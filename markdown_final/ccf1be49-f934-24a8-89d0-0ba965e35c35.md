## Question

How to treat snoring in infants

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat snoring in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and distinguishing primary snoring from obstructive sleep apnea. Then, I should verify the prevalence and why infant snoring matters. Next, I will review risk factors and red flags that push me toward testing or treatment. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including when to use polysomnography versus oximetry or watchful waiting. Then, I will examine treatment options by etiology, including medical, surgical, and noninvasive ventilation strategies. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, safety considerations, and what to do when symptoms persist, and I will integrate special populations like post-prematurity infants and those with craniofacial anomalies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Snoring in infants sits on a spectrum from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, and the latter carries risks for growth, neurodevelopment, and cardiopulmonary complications, so I should not dismiss habitual snoring as benign without evaluation, even though many infants snore intermittently [^600741b9] [^5255f236] [^370ec02e].

> Wait, let me verify prevalence and why this matters. Habitual snoring is common in infants, with studies suggesting around 11.8% snore at least 2 days per week and 5.3% at least 3 days per week, and infant OSA prevalence is estimated around 1–4% in pediatrics overall, though neonatal data are limited and definitions differ by age, so I need to be cautious about thresholds and context [^600741b9] [^5255f236] [^78370473].

> I need to check risk factors that heighten concern. Prematurity, craniofacial anomalies, laryngomalacia, neuromuscular weakness, Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, obesity, and secondhand smoke exposure all increase risk for infant OSA, and these comorbidities should lower my threshold for testing and treatment [^600741b9] [^09bb1658] [^45b3e783].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm red flags that mandate evaluation: frequent or loud snoring, witnessed apneas, gasping or choking, failure to thrive, persistent oxygen need, abnormal sleep positions, or developmental concerns warrant further workup rather than watchful waiting alone [^600741b9] [^5255f236].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Polysomnography is the gold standard to distinguish primary snoring from OSA and to gauge severity, but infant norms differ and there is no universal AHI threshold in neonates; many centers use AHI > 1–2 as abnormal in infants, whereas some accept higher cutoffs, so I must interpret results in clinical context and, if PSG is unavailable, consider overnight oximetry or referral to a pediatric sleep specialist [^e0a46e09] [^96bde420] [^799c6a30].

> Let me consider watchful waiting carefully. In otherwise healthy infants with mild, intermittent snoring, no desaturations, normal growth, and no other red flags, observation with close follow-up is reasonable because some infants improve spontaneously; however, I should document symptoms and growth and reassess within weeks to months to ensure progression does not occur [^notfound].

> I will now examine etiology-specific treatments. For anatomical causes such as laryngomalacia or other supraglottic collapse, supraglottoplasty can be effective when obstruction is sleep-dependent and persistent. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a key option for micrognathia or Pierre Robin sequence. And for adenotonsillar hypertrophy in older infants, adenotonsillectomy remains first-line when indicated, though tonsillar tissue is less prominent in neonates and early infancy [^a5d66c22] [^04d9210f] [^d63a8512].

> But wait, what if the infant is too young or not a surgical candidate? Noninvasive ventilation with CPAP is a mainstay for infants with OSA, including those with post-prematurity respiratory disease, craniofacial anomalies, or persistent disease after surgery; short supervised titration or even home auto-titration with close follow-up can be effective, and many infants wean off CPAP within 12–24 months as airways grow and mature [^07c76a8c] [^58e135c3] [^799c6a30].

> I should double-check oxygen strategies. Low-flow oxygen can improve gas exchange in some infants with SDB, and in small series has shown better improvement than high-flow nasal cannula, though evidence is limited and heterogeneous; thus, I should individualize oxygen use and monitor for efficacy and safety, especially in post-prematurity infants with baseline lung disease [^c2e30b52].

> Let me reconsider medical therapy. Intranasal corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists can reduce upper airway inflammation and adenoid size in older children with mild OSA or persistent symptoms after surgery; however, evidence in infants is sparse, so I should reserve these for select cases and monitor closely for response and adverse effects [^ef2775d9] [^e3370090].

> Next, I should review supportive and environmental measures. For infants with chronic nasal congestion, saline drops with gentle suctioning can improve airflow; optimizing sleep hygiene and avoiding secondhand smoke are prudent, though I must not compromise safe sleep positioning, which remains supine for SIDS prevention unless a specialist directs otherwise for a specific airway anomaly [^893520b2] [^13f7d3e9].

> I need to ensure follow-up is explicit. After any intervention, I should reassess clinically within 6–8 weeks and, if symptoms persist or the child is high risk, repeat PSG or oximetry to document improvement; for infants on CPAP, growth in weight and airway caliber often permits weaning over 12–24 months, and multidisciplinary care is essential for complex cases [^8b7674aa] [^799c6a30].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. Post-prematurity infants with persistent apnea, desaturations, or bradycardia beyond 40 weeks PMA, or those needing ongoing oxygen at 2 years, should have PSG or sleep referral; when PSG is not available, overnight oximetry is a reasonable screen, with escalation if abnormal [^51cc087d] [^bea22833].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, screen all infants for snoring and associated symptoms at routine visits. Second, triage by severity and risk: mild, intermittent snoring without red flags may be observed with close follow-up. Third, evaluate with PSG or oximetry when snoring is habitual, loud, or accompanied by apneas, growth failure, oxygen need, or developmental concerns. Fourth, tailor therapy to etiology: supraglottoplasty or mandibular distraction for anatomical obstruction, adenotonsillectomy when age-appropriate and hypertrophy is present, CPAP for persistent OSA or when surgery is contraindicated, and oxygen as adjunctive support. Fifth, reassess systematically and coordinate multidisciplinary care for complex infants [^b2265b0d] [^d63a8512] [^a5d66c22] [^04d9210f] [^07c76a8c] [^8b7674aa].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and counseling points. Families need clear return precautions for worsening snoring, apneas, feeding difficulty, or poor growth; they also need education on safe sleep positioning and, when CPAP is used, hands-on training and reliable follow-up to maximize adherence and outcomes [^13f7d3e9] [^07c76a8c].

Infant snoring is common and often benign, but persistent or loud snoring warrants evaluation for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** [^600741b9] or other causes [^a6ebea67]. Management is cause-specific: treat **congestion** with saline and suction, **allergies** with intranasal steroids or antihistamines, and **anatomical issues** (e.g. laryngomalacia, craniofacial anomalies) with ENT referral and possible surgery [^a5d66c22] [^04d9210f]. CPAP is reserved for **severe or refractory OSA** [^07c76a8c] [^c2e30b52]. Most infants improve with conservative care, but persistent snoring or red flags (apnea, poor growth, feeding difficulty) need polysomnography [^e0a46e09] and specialist input [^d00be0c0].

---

## Clinical significance of infant snoring

Snoring reflects turbulent airflow from **upper airway narrowing** [^21c71b7c]; in infants, this often arises from immature airway anatomy, congestion, or allergies [^a6ebea67]. Persistent snoring can signal OSA, which is linked to growth failure, neurodevelopmental effects, and cardiovascular strain [^370ec02e] [^5255f236].

---

## Common causes of infant snoring

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Anatomical | - Laryngomalacia [^a6ebea67] <br/> - Craniofacial anomalies (e.g. Pierre Robin, cleft palate) [^09bb1658] <br/> - Adenotonsillar hypertrophy (rare in infants) [^a6ebea67] |
| Infectious/inflammatory | - Upper respiratory infections <br/> - Allergic rhinitis [^e3370090] <br/> - Gastroesophageal reflux [^42d555fe] |
| Environmental | - Secondhand smoke exposure [^600741b9] <br/> - Dry air <br/> - Poor sleep positioning [^bd2f0c9a] |
| Physiological | - Immature respiratory control [^09bb1658] <br/> - Obligate nasal breathing [^09bb1658] <br/> - Rapid eye movement (REM)-related muscle atonia [^09bb1658] |

## Diagnostic evaluation

Persistent or loud snoring (> 3 nights/week) [^534c6d16], especially with apneas, gasping, poor growth, feeding difficulty, or daytime sleepiness, warrants evaluation [^600741b9]. The **gold standard** is polysomnography (PSG) [^e0a46e09] to distinguish primary snoring from OSA and guide therapy [^d00be0c0]. If PSG is unavailable, overnight oximetry or home cardiorespiratory monitoring can screen for hypoxemia or obstructive events [^51cc087d] [^bea22833]. ENT evaluation may include flexible nasopharyngoscopy or drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to identify obstruction sites [^c2e30b52].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause and severity**:

---

### Conservative management

- **Nasal congestion**: Saline drops/sprays with gentle suctioning; elevate the head of the crib slightly [^893520b2].
- **Allergies**: Intranasal corticosteroids or antihistamines if age-appropriate [^e3370090].
- **Environmental modifications**: Humidified air, smoke-free environment, optimal sleep positioning (supine unless contraindicated) [^13f7d3e9].
- **Feeding adjustments**: Thickened feeds or upright positioning for reflux-related snoring [^notfound].

---

### Medical management

Medical options include **intranasal corticosteroids** for allergic rhinitis or mild OSA when surgery is contraindicated [^ef2775d9], and **leukotriene receptor antagonists** (e.g. montelukast) for mild OSA or as adjuncts to reduce adenoid size [^c9facb36].

---

### Surgical interventions

- **Supraglottoplasty**: For laryngomalacia or supraglottic obstruction causing OSA [^a5d66c22].
- **Mandibular distraction osteogenesis**: For severe micrognathia (e.g. Pierre Robin sequence) [^04d9210f].
- **Adenotonsillectomy**: Rarely indicated in infants; reserved for severe adenotonsillar hypertrophy refractory to medical therapy [^notfound].

---

### Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy

Continuous positive airway pressure (**CPAP**) is indicated for severe OSA or when surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful [^07c76a8c]; short supervised titration or home auto-titration with close follow-up is feasible in infants [^536520d3] [^f48a33b3].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most infants improve with conservative or medical therapy as the airway matures [^notfound]. Persistent, untreated OSA can impair growth, neurodevelopment, and cardiovascular health [^370ec02e] [^5255f236]. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor growth, development, and symptom resolution [^8b7674aa].

---

## Parental education and support

Parents should be educated about red flags, adherence to therapy (e.g. CPAP), and safe sleep practices [^13f7d3e9]. Support groups and counseling can improve adherence and outcomes.

---

Infant snoring is common and often benign, but persistent or loud snoring needs evaluation for OSA or other causes. Management is **cause-specific**, with conservative measures first and escalation to medical, surgical, or PAP therapy as indicated. Persistent symptoms or red flags warrant PSG and specialist referral [^d00be0c0].

### Snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea in children: why should we treat? [^370ec02e]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Frequent and loud snoring is a very frequent condition in prepubertal children affecting approximately 10% of all 2–8 year old children. If polysomnographical evaluations are performed in these snoring children, approximately 10% will be diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The pathophysiology of OSA in children is still poorly understood. Indeed, while adenotonsillar hypertrophy is certainly a major contributor to OSA, other factors need to be implicated for OSA to develop. In recent years, it has become apparent that OSA and snoring are not as innocuous as previously thought. Indeed, epidemiological and pre-post treatment analyses have identified substantial morbidities that primarily affect cardiovascular and neurobehavioural systems, namely pulmonary hypertension, systemic elevation of arterial blood pressure, nocturnal enuresis, reduced somatic growth, behavioural problems that resemble attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, as well as learning and cognitive deficits. These problems are associated with marked increases in healthcare-related costs. More importantly, if timely diagnosis and intervention are not implemented, some of these morbid complications may not be completely reversible, leading to long-lasting residual consequences.

### When and why to treat the child who snores? [^84dea71f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can result in cardiovascular and neurocognitive morbidity as well as adversely affect behavior, growth, quality of life, and nocturnal continence. This article summarizes the latest evidence regarding the morbidity related to obstructive SDB, commenting on the impact of severity of obstruction, that is, the difference in effects seen of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) compared to those of mild OSAS or primary snoring. The impact of therapy is discussed, focusing on which children are likely to benefit from treatment interventions; namely those with moderate or severe OSAS irrespective of the presence of morbidity, children with mild OSAS with associated morbidity or predictors of SDB persistence such as obesity, and children with complex conditions accompanied by upper airway obstruction like craniosynostosis and Prader-Willi syndrome. The co-existing conditions which may improve when treatment for obstructive SDB is offered are reviewed, while the clinical parameters associated with spontaneous improvement or resolution of obstructive SDB are discussed.

### Is positive airway pressure lab-titration always necessary to start noninvasive respiratory support in infants? [^07c76a8c]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1 CPAP Lab Titration, Short‐Supervised

Following an OSAS diagnosis, a second in‐lab nap PSG was performed under the close supervision of a physician to establish the efficacy of the therapy and to allow any practical problems with mask fitting or attachment to be corrected.

CPAP was increased from a minimum starting point of 4 cmH 2 O until obstructive respiratory events (apneas, hypopneas, and snoring) were eliminated, with increments of at least 1 cmH 2 O applied no less than every 5 min. In practice, there was a notable change in the child's breathing pattern as soon as an effective pressure was reached. Breathing became less labored, snoring stopped, arousals diminished, and SpO 2 stabilized. CPAP could only be classed as successful if it was shown to be effective in both quiet sleep (approximating to deep sleep stages) and active sleep (including REM sleep periods). The time taken to achieve a decision on CPAP efficacy was 2–4 h with CPAP in place. It depended on the level of CPAP required and the pattern of the sleep states of the infant. The children for whom CPAP was accepted and found to be effective were sent home with the appropriate equipment. The parents received a detailed explanation about obstructive sleep apnea, the need for treatment, and how the CPAP system works. Telephone support for any problems arising or for equipment replacement parts was also given to the families.

The infants who were discharged at home were treated with the pressure level that was determined during the titration study, and the parents were asked to administer CPAP to their infants during all sleeping periods, including daytime naps.

Bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation was considered for persistent sleep hypoventilation whenever PtcCO 2 levels exceeded 50 mmHg. The minimum inspiratory positive airway pressure was set at 8 cmH 2 O, with an inspiratory–expiratory positive airway pressure differential ranging from 4 to 10 cmH 2 O.

What others are saying

Guidelines from the ATS, ERS, and British Thoracic Society support treating preterm infants with supplemental oxygen to maintain normal oxygen saturation. However, the role of diagnostic PSG was not addressed by these panels. A position statement from the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand suggested that PSG be considered when obstructive or central apnea is suspected.

ATS recommendations

R

For infants with PPRD who are otherwise ready to be discharged from the NICU, we suggest the use of PSG for patients with persistent apnea, intermittent desaturation, or bradycardia at greater than 40 weeks' PMA (conditional recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

R

For infants, children, and adolescents with PPRD, we suggest the use of PSG and/or sleep medicine referral for those with symptoms of SDB, including persistent snoring, failure to thrive, or a persistent need for supplemental oxygen at 2 years of age (conditional recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

R

When a PSG is indicated but not available, we recommend that an overnight or 24-hour oximetry be performed to screen for SDB, followed by PSG and/or a sleep medicine referral for further evaluation if needed (conditional recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

Implementation

When a PSG is indicated but not readily available, clinicians must consider whether oximetry monitoring is sufficient or whether referral to a sleep medicine program is needed for clinical management.

Justification

This recommendation places a high value on the potential improvement of quality of life and other clinical outcomes as well as respiratory symptoms such as apnea or hypoxemia. Limitations such as costs, access to PSG, and the lack of normative data in these patients are also taken in consideration.

Question 5: Should all infants, children, and adolescents born preterm (gestational age less than 37 wk) with PPRD undergo a swallow evaluation?

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly recognized in children. There is accumulating robust evidence to support early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the epidemiology, clinical features, complications, and treatment of childhood OSA. The authors have also proposed an easy-to-follow flowchart on the management of children with snoring or sleep disturbance for clinical use by busy pediatricians.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^600741b9]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Infant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — symptoms, snoring prevalence, and risk factors: Symptoms of OSA, which may be subtle or absent in infants, include snoring, noisy respirations, labored breathing, mouth breathing, and profuse sweating, and some infants with OSA will present with failure to thrive, witnessed apnea, and/ or developmental delay. In otherwise normal infants, snoring is present at least 2 days per week in 11.8% and at least 3 days per week in 5.3% of infants. Some infants with OSA may be asymptomatic and have a normal physical examination, yet studies have reported a high incidence of snoring in infants with (26%–44%) and without (22%–26%) OSA. Additional risk factors for infant OSA include prematurity, maternal smoking, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, obesity, and specific medical conditions including laryngomalacia, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular weakness, Down syndrome, achondroplasia, Chiari malformations, and Prader-Willi syndrome.

### Survey of the practices of neonatologists in managing neonates believed to be at high risk of sleep disordered breathing [^62238ebe]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

What is known about the subject?

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) can have long-term effects in children if not treated.
There is a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and therapeutic threshold in neonates and young infants.

What this study adds?

Management practices for neonates with suspected SDB vary considerably.
There is a lack of guideline for management, and decisions are mostly physician dependent.
Higher level of evidence is needed to standardise the practices and care of this group of neonates.

### A review of pediatric nonrespiratory sleep disorders [^8d018dc9]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep problems are extremely common during childhood, from infancy to adolescence. Despite the prevalence of sleep problems, childhood sleep disorders are often underrecognized and undiagnosed, despite being either preventable or treatable. Sleep impacts almost all aspects of a child's functioning, and thus the increased recognition and treatment of sleep disorders will positively affect a child's well-being. Children experience the same broad range of sleep disturbances encountered in adults, including sleep apnea, insomnia, parasomnia, delayed sleep phase, narcolepsy, and restless legs, but their clinical presentation, evaluation, and management may differ. Although snoring and sleep apnea may be the most common indication for an overnight sleep study in a child, one quarter of children presenting to a sleep clinic for evaluation will have a second sleep diagnosis, which is often nonrespiratory in nature. Especially in children, ruling out sleep apnea is rarely the end point of the sleep evaluation. Clinicians involved in sleep medicine must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage plans for sleep disorders across the lifespan of the patient. This article will provide an updated review of nonrespiratory pediatric sleep disorders within a developmental framework.

### Clinical characteristics, associated comorbidities and hospital outcomes of neonates with sleep disordered breathing: a retrospective cohort study [^5255f236]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a group of conditions characterised by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep with variable severity. In neonates, it includes periodic breathing, apnoea of prematurity, central sleep apnoea (CSA) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) as opposed to terms used in older children including primary snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive hypoventilation. Central apnoea is commonly seen in healthy newborns, is usually benign, and its frequency decreases with age.OSA is the most severe form of SDB with an estimated prevalence of 1%–4% among paediatric population.SDB has not been thoroughly investigated in young infants and its prevalence remains unknown in neonatal population.

Neonates are anatomically and physiologically prone to have SDB, especially those with certain comorbidities and craniofacial anomalies. If undiagnosed and untreated, OSA can lead to significant growth and neurobehavioural consequences in children. This warrants the need for early identification and timely intervention at a time of rapid brain development, especially as evidence suggests that treatment may improve quality of life and neurocognitive function.

There has been growing recognition of SDB as a concern in neonates and data are slowly emerging about its profile. However, managing SDB in neonates is challenging due to the complex pathophysiology, lack of normative data and lack of agreement on diagnostic and treatment thresholds. There remain significant variations in knowledge and practices among neonatologists and sleep physicians when treating neonates with suspected SDB. A recent survey of paediatric sleep and pulmonology experts from eight different countries showed there was no agreement on the diagnostic threshold for the obstructive apnoea hypopnea index (OAHI) to diagnose OSA in young infants. Our primary aim was to highlight the identifiable risk factors associated with the presence and severity of SDB in neonates. Furthermore, we wanted to describe indications for obtaining a sleep study, use of various diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions used to manage SDB in neonates as well as their hospital outcome. Collectively, this information will serve to increase awareness and help clinicians manage SDB in neonates.

### Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea: consensus, controversy, and craniofacial considerations [^216903f6]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, characterized by partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, is associated with multiple adverse neurodevelopmental and cardiometabolic consequences. It is common in healthy children and occurs with a higher incidence among infants and children with craniofacial anomalies. Although soft-tissue hypertrophy is the most common cause, interplay between soft tissue and bone structure in children with craniofacial differences may also contribute to upper airway obstruction. Snoring and work of breathing are poor predictors of obstructive sleep apnea, and the gold standard for diagnosis is overnight polysomnography. Most healthy children respond favorably to adenotonsillectomy as first-line treatment, but 20 percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea refractory to adenotonsillectomy and may benefit from positive airway pressure, medical therapy, orthodontics, craniofacial surgery, or combined interventions. For children with impairment of facial skeletal growth or craniofacial anomalies, rapid maxillary expansion, midface distraction, and mandibular distraction have all been demonstrated to have therapeutic value and may significantly improve a child's respiratory status. This Special Topic article reviews current theories regarding the underlying pathophysiology of pediatric sleep apnea, summarizes standards for diagnosis and management, and discusses treatments in need of further investigation, including orthodontic and craniofacial interventions. To provide an overview of the spectrum of disease and treatment options available, a deliberately broad approach is taken that incorporates data for both healthy children and children with craniofacial anomalies.

### Pediatric sleep apnea: early onset of the 'syndrome'? [^92115c5c]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in childhood, particularly in the last decade when an increased prevalence of obesity has been documented. The neurocognitive and behavioral problems associated with this disorder have been known for a long time. However, the increased knowledge of cardiovascular and metabolic complications in adults with sleep apnea has been followed by a better understanding of the systemic effects of upper airway obstruction in children. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been shown to induce autonomic imbalance in children and to affect blood pressure, cerebral blood flow and cardiac function in an early phase. OSA may also induce chronic systemic inflammation and may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome in obese children. Very recent research indicates that in children primary snoring, the mildest form of the sleep-disordered breathing spectrum, may also be associated with morbidity. It is, therefore, likely that these respiratory sleep disorders do not simply influence children's' performance in private and social life, but may more seriously affect children's' health. The aim of this review is to outline early systemic complications of obstructive sleep apnea and primary snoring in infants and children.

### What's new in paediatric sleep? [^c9facb36]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The major recent advance in our understanding of paediatric sleep is the publication of reference values for sleep in children aged 3.2–8.6 years. These data show developmental changes reflecting a subtle process of the maturation of the central nervous system with regard to sleep in childhood. In infants, a significant negative correlation has been observed between a snore-associated arousal index and an infant development scale, underlining that snoring is less innocent than has been suggested. A link between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and airway inflammation has been demonstrated, with children with OSA having significantly higher expression of the leukotriene (LT) 1 and 2 receptors and higher concentrations of LT C4/D4/E4 and LT B4 in adenotonsillar tissues than children with recurrent rhinitis who have no OSA. This explains the efficacy of treatment for OSA with montelukast, a LT receptor antagonist, alone or in combination with corticosteroids. By using peripheral arterial tonometry, a noninvasive technique that allows the moment-to-moment measurement of sympathetic tone, persistent waking-associated autonomic nervous system dysfunction has been demonstrated in young children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). As such, SDB in childhood may represent a cardiovascular risk factor in adulthood.

### How do we recognize the child with OSAS? [^3caca40d]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing includes a spectrum of clinical entities with variable severity ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The clinical suspicion for OSAS is most often raised by parental report of specific symptoms and/or abnormalities identified by the physical examination which predispose to upper airway obstruction (e.g., adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders). Symptoms and signs of OSAS are classified into those directly related to the intermittent pharyngeal airway obstruction (e.g., parental report of snoring, apneic events) and into morbidity resulting from the upper airway obstruction (e.g., increased daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, poor school performance, inadequate somatic growth rate or enuresis). History of premature birth and a family history of OSAS as well as obesity and African American ethnicity are associated with increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing in childhood. Polysomnography is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of OSAS but may not be always feasible, especially in low-income countries or non-tertiary hospitals. Nocturnal oximetry and/or sleep questionnaires may be used to identify the child at high risk of OSAS when polysomnography is not an option. Endoscopy and MRI of the upper airway may help to identify the level(s) of upper airway obstruction and to evaluate the dynamic mechanics of the upper airway, especially in children with combined abnormalities.

### Management of obstructive sleep apnea in the infant and newborn [^a6ebea67]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea in newborns and infants presents a unique challenge with distinct differences in sleep physiology, etiologies, and management compared to older children. The indications for and interpretation of polysomnography are less well defined in infants. There are also no broadly accepted clinical practice guidelines for treating sleep apnea in this age group. Etiologies include general causes of upper airway obstruction in infants such as laryngomalacia, micrognathia, and nasal obstruction in addition to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Treatment strategies must be tailored to the specific anatomic features and comorbidities of the specific patients and often require a multidisciplinary approach.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^51cc087d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — PPRD, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) evaluation: For infants with PPRD who are otherwise ready to be discharged from the NICU, we suggest the use of polysomnography (PSG) for patients with persistent apnea, intermittent desaturation, or bradycardia at greater than 40 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). For infants, children, and adolescents with PPRD, we suggest the use of PSG and/or a sleep medicine referral for those with symptoms of SDB, including persistent snoring, failure to thrive, or a persistent need for supplemental oxygen at 2 years of age. When PSG is indicated but not available, we recommend that overnight or 24-hour oximetry be performed to screen for SDB, followed by PSG and/or a sleep medicine referral for further evaluation if needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^61d6285b]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The Section on Pediatric Pulmonology of the American Academy of Pediatrics selected a subcommittee composed of pediatricians and other experts in the fields of pulmonology and otolaryngology as well as experts from epidemiology and pediatric practice to develop an evidence base of literature on this topic. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. The guideline contains the following recommendations for the diagnosis of OSAS: 1) all children should be screened for snoring; 2) complex high-risk patients should be referred to a specialist; 3) patients with cardiorespiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation; 4) diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating between primary snoring and OSAS, the gold standard being polysomnography; 5) adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for most children, and continuous positive airway pressure is an option for those who are not candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery; 6) high-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively; 7) patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional treatment is required. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the evaluation of children with OSAS. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for diagnostic decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to this problem.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in infancy: a 7-year experience at a pediatric sleep center [^42d555fe]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the common indications for polysomnogram (PSG) associated co-morbid conditions, evaluation strategies, treatment options, and outcomes in a series of infants diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by a PSG.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of infants who underwent PSG over a 7-year period was done. Infants with PSG diagnosed OSA were included in this study.

Results

A total of 97 infants (59 males, mean age 4.6 months, standard deviation 3.3 months) were diagnosed with OSA (AHI ≥ 1/hr) based on PSG. The most common indication for PSG in infants were excessive snoring (53%) followed by nocturnal desaturations (24%). Associated co-morbid conditions included gastro-esophageal reflux (30%), laryngomalacia (24%), and craniofacial abnormalities (16%). Genetic abnormalities were found in 53%, of which trisomy 21 was the most common. Surgical treatments were employed in 36% and oxygen therapy in 15%. Thirty-eight patients were followed up with a repeat sleep study after a median interval of 8 months (range 1–24 months), of whom 26/38 had resolution of symptoms. Twenty-seven patients (28%) were followed clinically after a mean interval of 5 months of intervention (range, 1–34.5 months), in whom the symptoms resolved in 23/27 patients. Seven patients were deceased at review. Causes of death included status epilepticus, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, kidney failure, or unknown causes.

Conclusion

The etiologies of OSA in infants are different when compared to older children. PSG is feasible and a valuable tool in the diagnosis of OSA in infants and may help determine timely and appropriate evaluation and interventions. Clinical improvement in symptoms and resolution of PSG parameters were noted following medical and/or surgical interventions. Prospective studies need to be done to ascertain the long-term outcome of infants diagnosed with OSA to assess the benefits of early intervention on their neurocognitive development.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^78370473]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The spectrum of obstructive sleep‐disordered breathing (oSDB) in children ranges from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Primary snoring is characterized by snoring occurring more than three nights per week with normal overnight polysomnography (PSG) and is present in 6%–17% of all children. OSAS is defined by an increased apnea‐hypopnea index (AHI) — the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour — during PSG and is present in 1%–5% of all children. It is widely acknowledged that an AHI of at least 5 per hour warrants consideration of treatment, most commonly adenotonsillectomy. However, when the AHI is less than 5 per hour and there are no clinical signs of complications related to oSDB, watchful waiting may be a valid approach. Official guidelines generally recommend performing an overnight PSG in all children with a history of chronic snoring to measure the AHI, assess the severity of oSDB, and determine the need for treatment. In practice, however, most children do not have access to overnight PSG due to the limited availability of sleep laboratories worldwide.

My personal review of last year's literature on oSDB in children focuses on publications dealing with the recognition of children who require treatment for oSDB, including the place of overnight PSG in their management.

### Recommendations and supporting evidence in guidelines for referral of patients to sleep laboratories [^f7bea537]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

At the request of Canadian health ministries, we reviewed recommendations in guidelines prepared by professional bodies on the referral of individuals to sleep laboratories. Searching electronic databases and the Internet, we found 37 guidelines that covered 18 applications of sleep laboratory investigation including obstructive sleep apnea, other respiratory disorders, obstructive sleep apnea and other conditions in children, sudden infant death syndrome, treatment for snoring, insomnia, depression with insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder, parasomnias and circadian rhythm disorders. We identified recommendations on referral of patients for sleep studies and assessed the quality and relevance of evidence cited in support of these. Of 81 recommendations, 46 were supported by evidence from primary investigations. Only six cases cited evidence from well-conducted, prospective controlled studies. Evidence was highly relevant in 18 cases, of some relevance in 22 and of little or no relevance in six. No evidence was provided in support of 31 recommendations, and in four cases the guideline had identified an absence of available evidence. Although the publications from professional bodies that were reviewed contain much detailed information, evidence supporting many recommendations is limited. There is a need for further, good quality, studies of many sleep laboratory applications.

### Obstructive sleep apnea is position dependent in young infants [^bd2f0c9a]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Role of sleep positioning in infants

Currently, the supine sleep position is recommended for all infants as part of SIDS-reduction campaigns. No exceptions attract attention, despite infants such as those with PRS seeming to benefit from the side-sleep positioning. One estimated odds ratio (OR) for SIDS between the supine and prone sleeping position is 4.46, and is 1.36 between supine and side sleeping positions. How real is the risk of SIDS being related to side-sleep positioning if side or prone positioning were applied as a part of OSA treatment? Prior to SIDS sleeping campaigns in the 1970's and 1980's, SIDS rates in Finland ranged from 0.5 to 0.6 per 1000 live births. In order to establish the safety of any type of OSA treatment, the study group should exceed 7 600 infants when comparing treatment safety to sleep position treatment with prone sleep positioning, and over 76,000 for comparing the treatment to side-sleep positioning. This simple power calculation demonstrates the low risk level related to side sleep positioning. It may not be valid to apply the standard sleep position recommendation to a specific infant population from whom side-sleep positioning may be otherwise beneficial.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^b2265b0d]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Key action statement 1 — screening for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) states that as part of routine health maintenance visits, clinicians should inquire whether the child or adolescent snores, and if the answer is affirmative or if a child or adolescent presents with signs or symptoms of OSAS, clinicians should perform a more focused evaluation, with Evidence Quality: Grade B, Recommendation Strength: Recommendation; the evidence profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: B, Harm: Provider time, patient and parent time, and Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and adds that asking about snoring at each health maintenance visit is a sensitive, albeit nonspecific, screening measure that is quick and easy to perform and that an affirmative answer should be followed by a detailed history and examination to determine whether further evaluation for OSAS is needed.

### Polysomnography for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing in children under 2 years of age [^e0a46e09]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

In the present study, none of the standard measures of sleep fragmentation were predictive of physician assessment of SDB. Respiratory events are the primary PSG criteria used to define SDB despite the fact that sleep disruption is also analyzed as an important component of disease. Strong arousal response, leading to sleep fragmentation, is an important mechanism to protect against obstructive apnea during sleep in infants and potentially prevent catastrophic events such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 SDB, including snoring, has been shown to disrupt sleep in infants including a reduction in REM sleep 56 and a higher number of respiratory related arousals. 57 Further work is needed to determine whether evidence of sleep disruption influences physician assessment and management of SDB in younger children.

Limitations of this study must be acknowledged. The data were collected retrospectively from sleep laboratory records and medical charts. This meant that physician classification of PSG results and treatment decisions were missing for 12% and 17% of PSGs, respectively. No attempt was made to fill in this information with post‐hoc review by physicians to ensure that the data collected best represented prospective clinical practice decision making. The data collected are from a single tertiary care center where PSG was a first‐line test and where results are reviewed and interpreted by pediatric sleep physicians. The results may not generalize to centers where screening measures are used prior to PSG or where PSG results are reviewed by non‐sleep or adult sleep physicians. Finally, this study examined only PSG variables to determine factors that influence physician assessment of SDB severity. Clinical diagnosis of SDB in any age group will incorporate multiple clinical factors, one of which is PSG results. Additional clinical factors, such as comorbidities, current symptoms, and physical examination findings, are likely important determinants of physician determinations of SDB and management decisions.

In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate differences in sleep and respiratory parameters by age group in a clinical cohort of infants < 2 years of age. Infants < 6 months of age appear to represent a distinct population with respect to the diagnosis and management of SDB. These results support the need for separate criteria to define abnormal PSG results in young children. Further work is needed to determine the relationship between PSG results, outcomes, and the impact of SDB treatment in infants < 2 years of age.

### Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in neonates and implications for its long-term impact [^14dd154c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a significant cause of morbidity in neonates and young infants. SDB occurs more commonly in preterm infants and in neonates with underlying syndromes. Recent evidence shows that infants with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or SDB have greater health care resource utilization, including longer hospital stay. Management of SDB includes non-invasive ventilation or surgical interventions tailored to the patient. Screening high risk newborns should allow for early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention for this population. However, the thresholds for diagnosing SDB and for guiding and implementing treatment in neonates remain unclear. A collective effort is required to standardize the practice worldwide. This article will discuss neonatal sleep physiology and characteristics of neonatal sleep, with an emphasis on the epidemiology and diagnosis of SDB in neonates and its implications for long term outcomes.

### Early-onset pharyngeal airway collapse in infants: a retrospective single-center study [^a5dc071d]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharyngeal airway is a critical component of the upper respiratory tract. Collapse of pharyngeal airway can result in airflow limitation, especially during the inspiratory period. Principally, the internal diameter of pharyngeal airway is determined by an interaction between neural regulation of upper airway muscle activity and structural properties of the pharyngeal airway. In the older children, pharyngeal airway collapse (PAC) is mainly secondary to the enlargement of the lymphoid tissue (tonsils and adenoid). It usually presents as snoring and can result in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in some cases. The infants aged younger than 6 months even the neonates can also develop PAC. Compared to the older children, the infants aged younger than 6 months have a superiorly placed larynx, a smaller size of pharyngeal airway as well as ventilatory control instability. Furthermore, either tonsils or adenoid has not yet developed in this age. So there may be differences in the comorbidities, clinical features, treatments and outcomes between the PAC with onset in the older child age and those with onset within 6-months old. In this present study, the PAC with onset within 6-months is named as early-onset PAC in infants. Until now, early-onset PAC in infants has not been given enough attention in clinic. Therefore, this present study is intended to explore the clinical features, endoscopic findings, comorbidities and outcomes of early-onset PAC in infants with the aim of extending clinician's awareness and improving the diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy for this disease.

### Follow-up of primary snoring in children [^5ac398d1]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

We reevaluated 13 children with primary snoring 3 years after their original polysomnograms were performed and compared them with healthy control subjects. As a group, the patients' snoring and polysomnographic findings did not change. There was no difference in any sleep-disordered breathing of the patients and control subjects. Only the youngest individual in the study developed frank obstructive sleep apnea. Children with primary snoring are not likely to develop polysomnography-confirmed obstructive sleep apnea, and it is safe to defer treatment.

3 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP‐DISORDERED BREATHING: A FUTURE PERSPECTIVE IS NEEDED

It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of oSDB is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the AHI, which, according to current official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is " neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity".

An important publication by Solano‐Pérez E et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children. There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypo pneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently. This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypo pneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long‐term consequences of pediatric OSA, such as cardiovascular disease. As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences, and conversely, children with primary snoring and normal AHIs may still require treatment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to better phenotype pediatric oSDB to personalize management strategies more effectively.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^ef2775d9]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This revised clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and adolescents. This practice guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS, that is, OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting.

Methods

Of 3166 articles from 1999–2010, 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II-IV. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations.

Results and Conclusions

The following recommendations are made. (1) All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. (2) Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. (3) Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (4) High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. (5) Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. (6) Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. (7) Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. (8) Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.

### Childhood obstructive sleep-disordered breathing: a clinical update and discussion of technological innovations and challenges [^52f813d1]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been known to be associated with health and cognitive impacts for more than a century, and yet our understanding of this disorder is in its infancy. Neuropsychological consequences in children with snoring or subtle breathing disturbances not meeting the traditional definition of sleep apnea suggest that "benign, or primary snoring" may be clinically significant, and that the true prevalence of SDB might be underestimated. There is no standard definition of SDB in children. The polysomnographic technology used in many sleep laboratories may be inadequate to diagnose serious but subtle forms of clinically important airflow limitation. In the last several years, advances in digital technology as well as new observational studies of respiratory and arousal patterns in large populations of healthy children have led to alternative views of what constitutes sleep-related breathing and arousal abnormalities that may refine our diagnostic criteria. This article reviews our knowledge of childhood SDB, highlights recent advances in technology, and discusses diagnostic and treatment strategies that will advance the management of children with pediatric SDB.

1.8 Treatment of Obstructive Sleep‐Disordered Breathing in Children Less Than 2 Years

The diagnosis and management of SDB and OSA in infants can be particularly challenging. To support clinical decision‐making, the European Respiratory Society recently published an updated statement building on their previous 2017 recommendations. Key highlights from this update include:
The definition of OSA in infants likely differs from the one used in older children. In addition to AHI, clinicians should also consider additional parameters such as the desaturation index, the mean oxygen saturation, and the percentage of time spent in hypoxia. The statement also notes that an obstructive AHI greater than 5 events/hour may be normal in neonates as obstructive and central sleep apneas decline during infancy.
Drug‐induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) may be helpful in determining the appropriate surgical approach, as both dynamic and fixed obstructions may contribute to obstructive SDB in this population.
Surgical procedures such as AT, adenoidectomy, and supraglottoplasty may provide significant improvement when used in the appropriate clinical context.
For infants who are not candidates for surgery or have persistent OSA following surgical intervention, PAP therapy remains a key treatment option. High‐flow nasal cannula may be used as a temporary measure or alternative in children who are PAP‐intolerant or awaiting definitive treatment.

Gurbani et al. compared the use of HFNC and low‐flow oxygen as treatments for OSA in infants. Nine infants were enrolled in the study (mean age 1.3 ± 1.7 months). OSA improved in 44% of infants treated with HFNC, compared to universal improvement among those receiving low‐flow oxygen. These findings suggest that low‐flow oxygen may be more effective than HFNC in infants. Interestingly, the authors hypothesize that the characteristic respiratory instability at this age — due to a high loop gain — may explain their response to low‐flow oxygen.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^6d9a4269]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

12. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME

Basic Questions

What is the prevalence of OSAS in the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis?
What screening method (type and frequency) is indicated to timely detect OSAS?
How can OSAS be prevented or treated?

Introduction

The OSAS is characterized by episodes of partial and (or) complete upper airway obstruction during sleep state. – These may lead to hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and abnormal sleep architecture. Dependent on the severity of the syndrome, vital dysfunctions to even fatal pulmonary heart disease may occur.

The clinical symptoms are diverse and are distinguished into those occurring in the night: troubled sleep, snoring, apneas, bedwetting and perspiration, and those occurring in the day: dry mouth when waking up in the morning, fatigue, impaired cognitive functioning, poor school performance, and behavioral disorders. Disturbed growth may occur at the long term.

Children with craniosynostosis syndromes are among the risk groups for OSAS.

Early identification is of great importance in view of the severe consequences of OSAS, and considering that good treatment modalities are available.

### Obstructive sleep apnoea: children are not little adults [^7740a6e9]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

During a child's development, several important developmental physiological sleep processes occur, and, occasionally, pathological disorders occur, which results in differences between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in adults and children. There are major differences in sleep and respiratory physiology as well as OSA symptoms and treatment options between children and adults. Many practitioners do not realize these differences, which results in delays in the diagnosis and treatment of OSA in children. The treatment options for OSA in children are markedly different compared with adults, effective in most children. The use of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy delivered through continuous or bi-level positive airway pressure modes is successful in children and even in infants; however, there are several challenges facing parents and practitioners to achieve good compliance. The early recognition and treatment of paediatric OSA are essential to prevent deleterious consequences. This article discusses the major differences between paediatric and adult OSA and demonstrates why children are not little adults.

### Cognitive and behavioral outcomes of snoring among adolescents [^534c6d16]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Snoring results from impaired airflow through the upper airway during sleep and is the most consistently observed symptom of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children. The most common factors associated with increased risk for snoring in children are adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity. While snoring in otherwise healthy children was historically considered benign, nearly all clinical societies advocate for the early evaluation and management of snoring. The recommended management of snoring varies by location. Clinical societies in the US uniformly recommend a proactive approach toward habitual snoring, defined as snoring 3 or more nights per week. For example, recognizing that habitual snoring is not benign, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends polysomnography or referral to an otolaryngologist or sleep medicine physician for further management. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine also emphasizes this position. However, the American Academy of Otolaryngology reserves polysomnography only for children at high risk of adenotonsillectomy-related complications or those with less certain diagnoses, leaving room for a preference-sensitive approach to adenotonsillectomy as a potential management of habitual snoring and SDB. The European Respiratory Society also recommends further evaluation of snoring using polysomnography. Other recommendations from China, Australia, and India, and combined data from the Asia-Pacificalso emphasize the need for further evaluation and management of habitual snoring.

### Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) for the allergist: update on the assessment and management [^33dc8b7d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to provide an understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, potentially serious complications, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options available for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

Data Sources

The Ovid, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases from 1950 to the present were searched for relevant articles regarding pediatric OSAS.

Study Selection

Articles describing the prevalence, mechanisms, risk factors, complications, and most recent updates on assessment and management of pediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) were used for this review.

Results

The data suggest that SDB may be considered a disease continuum. It ranges in severity from mild obstruction of the upper airway, producing primary snoring, to increased upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), to continuous episodes of complete upper airway obstruction or OSAS. The degree of sleep disruption, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and upper airway airflow reduction are main factors in determining the severity of SDB. Mounting evidence implicates OSAS as a risk factor for decreased growth, impaired neurocognitive function, and cardiovascular morbidity. The first treatment of choice for OSAS in children remains tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

Conclusions

Sleep-disordered breathing is common in children and can cause minor as well as major disruption of sleep and health problems requiring intervention. Despite apparent symptoms and potentially severe consequences, SDB may be underdiagnosed and unrecognized. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and detailed clinical history and physical examination should be part of any clinical assessment of a child presenting with breathing difficulty during sleep.

### Continuous positive airway pressure titration in infants with severe upper airway obstruction or bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^58e135c3]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is recognized as an effective treatment for severe upper airway obstruction (UAO) in young children. Indeed, the maintenance of airway patency throughout the entire breathing cycle by means of CPAP has been shown to be associated with an unloading of the respiratory muscles, an improvement of breathing pattern and gas exchange.

In adults and adolescents with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the titration of CPAP is based on the polysomnographic disappearance of apnoea, hypopnoea, respiratory effort-related arousal and snoring, as recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The diseases responsible for airway obstruction in infants differ from those of older children and adults with the predominance of anatomical abnormalities of the upper airways such as laryngomalacia or tracheomalacia, Pierre Robin syndrome or other maxillofacial malformations.

Some other diseases involving the lower respiratory tract, such as chronic lung diseases of prematurity, also called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are associated with lung diseases and predominantly peripheral airway obstruction, which may be severe and cause intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi). Because of these differences in pathophysiology and the lack of guidelines for this age group, the titration of CPAP in infants is generally based on clinical parameters such as the disappearance of the stridor and retractions, the decrease in respiratory and heart rates and the normalization of gas exchange. To facilitate the acclimatization of the infant with CPAP, the initial level is usually set at 4 cmH 2 O, followed by a gradual increase of the CPAP level until the best clinical efficacy and comfort are obtained.

Importantly, small changes in the CPAP level may have significant clinical consequences. Indeed, the minimal airway diameter is the most critical because, according to Poiseuille's law, the resistance increases with an exponent 4 of the radius. This has been observed in infants with acute viral bronchiolitis, in whom a 2 cmH 2 O change of CPAP level was associated with a significant change in the work of breathing and breathing pattern. In such a homogeneous group of infants, the optimal CPAP level, determined by monitoring the oesophageal (Poes) and gastric pressure (Pgas), was 7 cmH 2 O for all the patients; however, it is not known if this level is also appropriate for infants with UAO and BPD, in whom CPAP could counteract the PEEPi.

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^63fcbab1]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This technical report describes the procedures involved in developing the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in children. The group of primary interest for this report was otherwise healthy children older than 1 year who might have adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity as underlying risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The goals of the committee were to enhance the primary care clinician's ability to recognize OSAS, identify the most appropriate procedure for diagnosis of OSAS, identify risks associated with pediatric OSAS, and evaluate management options for OSAS.

Methods

A literature search was initially conducted for the years 1966–1999 and then updated to include 2000. The search was limited to English language literature concerning children older than 2 and younger than 18 years. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance, and committee members reviewed in detail any possibly appropriate articles to determine eligibility for inclusion. Additional articles were obtained by a review of literature and committee members' files. Committee members compiled evidence tables and met to review and discuss the literature that was collected.

Results

A total of 2115 titles were reviewed, of which 113 provided relevant original data for analysis. These articles were mainly case series and cross-sectional studies; overall, very few methodologically strong cohort studies or randomized, controlled trials concerning OSAS have been published. In addition, a minority of studies satisfactorily differentiated primary snoring from true OSAS. Reports of the prevalence of habitual snoring in children ranged from 3.2% to 12.1%, and estimates of OSAS ranged from 0.7% to 10.3%; these studies were too heterogeneous for data pooling. Children with sleep-disordered breathing are at increased risk for hyperactivity and learning problems. The combined odds ratio for neurobehavioral abnormalities in snoring children compared with controls is 2.93 (95% confidence interval: 2.23–3.83). A number of case series have documented decreased somatic growth in children with OSAS; right ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypertension also have been reported in children with OSAS. However, the risk growth and cardiovascular problems cannot be quantified from the published literature. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) is recognized as the gold standard for diagnosis of OSAS, and there are currently no satisfactory alternatives. The diagnostic accuracy of symptom questionnaires and other purely clinical approaches is low. Pulse oximetry appears to be specific but insensitive. Other methods, including audiotaping or videotaping and nap or home overnight PSG, remain investigational. Adenotonsillectomy is curative in 75% to 100% of children with OSAS, including those who are obese. Up to 27% of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for OSAS have postoperative respiratory complications, but estimates are varied. Risk factors for persistent OSAS after adenotonsillectomy include continued snoring and a high apnea-hypopnea index on the preoperative PSG.

Conclusions

OSAS is common in children and is associated with significant sequelae. Overnight PSG is currently the only reliable diagnostic modality that can differentiate OSAS from primary snoring. However, the PSG criteria for OSAS have not been definitively validated, and it is not clear that primary snoring without PSG-defined OSAS is benign. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment for OSAS but requires careful postoperative monitoring because of the high risk of respiratory complications. Adenotonsillectomy is usually curative, but children with persistent snoring (and perhaps with severely abnormal preoperative PSG results) should have PSG repeated postoperatively.

### Persistent snoring in preschool children: predictors and behavioral and developmental correlates [^c73fcbfb]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To clarify whether persistent snoring in 2- to 3-year-olds is associated with behavioral and cognitive development, and to identify predictors of transient and persistent snoring.

Methods

Two hundred forty-nine mother/child pairs participated in a prospective birth cohort study. Based upon parental report of loud snoring ≥ 2 times weekly at 2 and 3 years of age, children were designated as nonsnorers, transient snorers (snored at 2 or 3 years of age, but not both), or persistent snorers (snored at both ages). We compared groups by using validated measures of behavioral and cognitive functioning. Potential predictors of snoring included child race and gender, socioeconomic status (parent education and income), birth weight, prenatal tobacco exposure (maternal serum cotinine), childhood tobacco exposure (serum cotinine), history and duration of breast milk feeding, and body mass relative to norms.

Results

In multivariable analyses, persistent snorers had significantly higher reported overall behavior problems, particularly hyperactivity, depression, and inattention. Nonsnorers had significantly stronger cognitive development than transient and persistent snorers in unadjusted analyses, but not after demographic adjustment. The strongest predictors of the presence and persistence of snoring were lower socioeconomic status and the absence or shorter duration of breast milk feeding. Secondary analyses suggested that race may modify the association of childhood tobacco smoke exposure and snoring.

Conclusions

Persistent, loud snoring was associated with higher rates of problem behaviors. These results support routine screening and tracking of snoring, especially in children from low socioeconomic backgrounds; referral for follow-up care of persistent snoring in young children; and encouragement and facilitation of infant breastfeeding.

### Survey of the practices of neonatologists in managing neonates believed to be at high risk of sleep disordered breathing [^09bb1658]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Background

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is increasingly recognised as a cause of morbidity and prolonged hospital stay in neonates and young infants. SDB involves a spectrum of problems in neonates; the most severe form is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which causes obstructive events and associated arousals leading to impaired sleep quality and disturbances in both oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide (CO 2).

Neonates with OSA often suffer recurrent oxygen desaturation and CO 2 retention (type II respiratory failure). Previous studies have demonstrated an association between episodes of hypoxia and poor growth and long-term neurodevelopmental delay.SDB has been linked to several long-term adverse effects in children including hypertension, behavioural problemsand impairment of cognition, attention and executive functions. Therefore, early identification of high-risk infants is important so that treatment can improve quality of life and neurocognitive function. There is a gap in literature regarding SDB in neonates and its long-term outcomes. Piteo et al reported that infants who snored had lower cognitive scores compared with controls. In a study of 33 infants with cleft lip/palate, Smith et al reported that infants with more obstructive episodes had lower global behaviour scores at 3 years of age. However, a couple of recent studies showed negative links between SDB in neonates and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Neonates are more vulnerable to OSA due to number of reasons including anatomical considerations (small mid-face), obligate nasal breathing, immature respiratory control and predominance of rapid eye movement sleep state, which may exacerbate obstruction due to loss of muscle tone. In young children, adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the principal cause of OSA. However, in infants, anatomical anomalies are the predominant cause like laryngomalacia, macroglossia, craniofacial disorders such as craniosynostosis (Crouzon's disease, Apert syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome), cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, infants with mid-face hypoplasia (eg, Treacher Collins and Goldenhar syndromes) and with choanal atresia (CHARGE association). Low muscle tone is also an important predisposing factor, for example, in infants with Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome or neuromuscular disorders.

### Clinical guidelines for the manual titration of positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^afe78b7e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

CPAP titration — general recommendations for pediatric and adult patients state that CPAP should be increased until obstructive respiratory events are eliminated or the recommended maximum CPAP is reached, targeting apneas, hypopneas, RERAs, and snoring; SaO2 desaturation-only events without associated obstructive respiratory events should not be considered when deciding to increase CPAP; the recommended minimum starting CPAP is 4 cm H2O; and the recommended maximum CPAP is 15 cm H2O for patients < 12 years and 20 cm H2O for patients ≥ 12 years (Consensus).

### Parental experience of sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: comparing parental and clinical priorities [^5e792589]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify outcomes relating to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) that are relevant to parents, during the early weeks of caring for infants with cleft palate (CP), and compare these with clinical outcomes identified in a systematic search of research literature.

Design

A qualitative study using telephone/face-to-face interviews with parents explored their understanding of breathing and respiratory effort in infants with CP.

Setting

Care provided by 3 specialist cleft centers in the United Kingdom, with study conducted in parents' homes.

Participants

Criteria for participation were parents of infants with isolated CP aged 12 to 16 weeks. Thirty-one parents of infants with CP (over 12 weeks) were invited to participate in the interview. Interviews were completed with 27 parents; 4 parents could not be contacted after completing the sleep monitoring.

Results

Parents' description of infants' sleep suggests that breathing is not considered as a separate priority from their principal concerns of feeding and sleeping. They observe indicators of infants' breathing, but these are not perceived as signs of SDB. Parents' decision to use lateral or supine sleep positioning reflects their response to advice from specialists, observation of their infants' comfort, ease of breathing, and personal experience. Outcomes, identified in published research of SDB, coincide with parents' concerns but are expressed in medical language and fit into distinct domains of "snoring", "sleep", "gas exchange", and "apnea".

Conclusions

Parents' description of sleeping and respiration in infants with CP reflect their everyday experience, offering insight into their understanding, priorities, and language used to describe respiration. Understanding parents' individual priorities and how these are expressed could be fundamental to selecting meaningful outcomes for future studies of airway interventions.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^d63a8512]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and adolescents: The guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting. All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.

### Current practice patterns in the diagnosis and management of sleep-disordered breathing in infants [^96bde420]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Currently, there are no universally accepted guidelines for diagnosis and management of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in infants. The purpose of this study was to survey pediatric sleep medicine providers regarding their current practice patterns for diagnosis and management of SDB in infants.

Methods

An anonymous, web-based survey with 71 questions was distributed via the PEDSLEEP and Ped-Lung listserv, which serve as a hub of communication for pediatric sleep and pulmonary medicine providers worldwide.

Results

Fifty-four providers from eight countries completed the survey. Ninety-six percent of providers reported performing sleep studies in infants with 53% performing more than 30 studies per year. There was no consensus on the definition of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in infants when using an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHIo) cutoff: AHIo > 1 (30%), AHIo > 2 (35%), AHIo > 5 (24%), AHIo > 10 (2%) and other (9.3%). Thirty-six percent did not use pediatric criteria to define severity of OSA in infants. Opinions regarding management of five typical SDB cases were solicited and the results varied among respondents. Most of the providers (89%) thought that more research is needed to gather normative sleep data in infants and that their practice would benefit from evidence- based guidelines for diagnosis and management of SDB in infants (98%).

Conclusions

These results demonstrate substantial variability in practice patterns for diagnosis and management of SDB in infants. Further research and consensus guidelines are needed to ensure optimal care for infants with SDB.

### Adenotonsillectomy and health care utilization in children with snoring and mild sleep apnea: a randomized clinical trial [^aa167f55]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The literature indicates that health care utilization (HCU) of children with untreated moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea is greater than that of matched controls before diagnosis, and treatment is associated with a decline in HCU not observed in those who remain untreated. Research on this topic has been limited to retrospective analyses and observational cohort studies; little is known about HCU among the many children with snoring and mild sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

Objective

To determine whether adenotonsillectomy in comparison with watchful waiting with supportive care is associated with fewer health care encounters and prescriptions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial, Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial for Snoring (PATS), was a 12-month, parallel-arm trial conducted from 2016 to 2022 in tertiary care centers in the United States. Participants were recruited from otolaryngology, sleep, pulmonary, or general pediatric clinics; aged 3 to 13 years; diagnosed with mild SDB; had a tonsillar hypertrophy grade of 2 or more; and had a body mass index z score less than 3. Children referred from a clinician outside of the local electronic medical record system were excluded. Data analysis was conducted from June 2022 to April 2024.

Intervention

Early adenotonsillectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Evaluation of HCU was a prespecified secondary aim of PATS. Total encounters and total prescriptions over the 12 months after randomization were analyzed.

Results

Among 459 children who were randomized, the analytic sample included 381 children, after excluding those referred from outside the local electronic medical record system. The median (IQR) age was 6 (4–8) years; 192 participants (50%) were female and 189 (50%) male. Adenotonsillectomy was associated with a 32% reduction in total health care encounters (mean difference, -1.25 per participant per year; 95% CI, -1.96 to -0.53) and a 48% reduction in prescriptions (mean difference, -2.53 per participant per year; 95% CI, -4.12 to -0.94). The difference in encounters was primarily driven by fewer office visits and outpatient procedures rather than by reduced hospitalizations or urgent care visits.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that adenotonsillectomy was associated with reduced all-cause HCU in children with mild SDB, supporting early intervention for children with mild SDB. Future research focused on the cost effectiveness of adenotonsillectomy for pediatric SDB is warranted.

### Predictors for snoring in children with rhinitis at age 5 [^5f5da040]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2007). Low credibility.

Snoring is often found in allergic diseases and may be an early manifestation of more serious sleep-disordered breathing. We aimed to investigate whether the risk factors for snoring among pre-school children with rhinitis are similar to those for allergic diseases in a birth cohort. The study cohort was drawn from participants in the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study (CAPS). This is a randomized controlled trial of dietary intervention and house dust mite avoidance during the first 5 years of life, aimed at reducing the risk of acquiring asthma and other allergic conditions in children at high-risk for allergic diseases. Parents of children with symptoms of rhinitis at age 5 years (n = 219 out of 516 cohort members) were asked if their child snored: 127 (60%) reported some snoring and 56 (26%) snored more than three times per week. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that children who were first-born (adjusted odds ratio, 2.50, 95% CI 1.20–5.21), were exposed to maternal tobacco smoke during the first year of life (2.40, 1.1–5.25), or who had asthma (2.51, 1.14–5.55) and/or eczema (2.29, 1.02–5.13) at age 5 years were more likely to snore. Birth-weight, body mass index at age 4.5, spirometry, and breastfeeding were not related to snoring. Risk factors for snoring are similar to risk factors for allergic disorders. Snoring may be part of the allergic spectrum of diseases. Our data may contribute to clinician's ability to effectively screen for snoring in preschool children.

### Pediatric sleep-disordered breathing year in review 2024 [^7d91c6f9]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a population‐based, retrospective study analyzing 2100 children aged 1–19 years hospitalized for influenza infection, Wang and Chiu assessed the impact of OSA — previously diagnosed in 420 of them — on clinical outcomes. After propensity score matching, their logistic regression analysis revealed that children with OSA had a significantly longer length of stay, higher total hospital costs, and an increased risk of pneumonia compared to those without OSA. The authors conclude that their findings underscore the importance of recognizing and managing OSA in the context of influenza‐related infections among children. An accompanying editorial by Gozal highlights the significance of these unique and important results, which suggest that early intervention with antiviral therapy may help mitigate complications in children with OSA hospitalized for influenza. However, caution should be maintained until results from prospective clinical trials on the subject become available.

1.3 Treatment of Sleep‐Disordered Breathing

Sleep‐disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remain subjects of considerable debate, and clinical practices vary widely across the world. This section highlights 2024 publications that explore various aspects of SDB management, including surgical interventions, pharmacologic treatments, alternative procedures, and respiratory support strategies.

1.4 Adenotonsillectomy

For most pediatric patients, adenotonsillectomy (AT) remains the cornerstone of OSA management. However, several clinical challenges remain unresolved, including the indications for surgery in the absence of frank OSA, optimal surgical techniques, and the risk of persistent OSA following the procedure.

Mitchell et al. investigated whether a combination of clinical characteristics could differentiate children with primary snoring (apnea‐hypopnea index [AHI] < 1) from those with mild OSA (AHI 1–3) and thus identify patients who might benefit from AT. The Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy for Snoring (PATS) trial was a multicenter, single‐blind, randomized study that included 459 children. The median age was 6.0 years (4.0, 7.5), and 88 participants (19.2%) had obesity. Black race, obesity, and elevated urinary cotinine levels — a marker of second‐hand smoke exposure — were associated with higher odds of mild OSA compared to primary snoring. However, no individual factor, or combination of factors, was able to reliably discriminate between the two groups. The authors conclude that distinguishing primary snoring from mild OSA continues to rely on PSG, and no specific clinical profile reliably identifies children likely to benefit from AT.

### Early life environment and snoring in adulthood [^4a4d1995]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The predisposition for adult snoring and possibly also for obstructive sleep apnea may be partly established early in life. Having had severe airway infections or recurrent otitis in childhood, being exposure to a dog as a newborn, and growing up in a large family appear as possible risk factors for snoring in adulthood. We speculate that these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring. The presented findings are new and suggest that further knowledge about early life environment might contribute to primary prevention of snoring.

### Infant-feeding methods and childhood sleep-disordered breathing [^95a51836]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Childhood sleep-disordered breathing has an adverse impact on cognitive development, behavior, quality of life, and use of health care resources. Early viral infections and other immune-mediated responses may contribute to development of the chronic inflammation of the upper airway and hypertrophic upper airway lymphadenoid tissues underlying childhood sleep-disordered breathing. Breastfeeding provides immunologic protection against such early exposures. Therefore, we sought to explore whether sleep-disordered breathing severity would differ for children who were breastfed as infants.

Methods

The parents or guardians of 196 habitually snoring children (mean ± SD: 6.7 ± 2.9 years old) who were undergoing overnight polysomnography at Kosair Children's Hospital Sleep Medicine and Apnea Center completed a retrospective survey on the method(s) used to feed the child as an infant.

Results

Among habitually snoring children, those who were fed breast milk for at least 2 months had significantly reduced sleep-disordered breathing severity on every measure assessed, including apnea-hypopnea index, oxyhemoglobin desaturation nadir, and respiratory arousal index. Breastfeeding for longer than 5 months did not contribute additional benefits.

Conclusions

Our findings support the notion that breastfeeding may provide long-term protection against the severity of childhood sleep-disordered breathing. Future research should explore mechanism(s) whereby infant-feeding methods may affect the pathophysiology of development of childhood sleep-disordered breathing.

### Does sleep position influence sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: a feasibility study? [^17e78504]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

At 3 months, 22 parents (11 side-lying, 11 supine) completed the sleep questionnaires. Nine parents still reported their infant had difficulty breathing when asleep, but 5 of these were only when they had a cold. In addition, 4 parents reported that their child had stopped breathing for periods or had pauses in their breathing during their sleep at times (1 everyday; 1 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks; 3 side-lying, 1 supine). Noisy or snoring breathing, both during the day (41% of parents reported this) and at night time (86% of parents) remained very common.

At 3 months, 3 parents regularly repositioned their baby during sleep; all reported they moved them onto their side as they slept easier that way (including 1 supine-lying baby).

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^8a584044]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Definition and epidemiology of childhood OSAS: The guideline defines OSAS in children as a disorder of breathing during sleep characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction that disrupts normal ventilation during sleep and normal sleep patterns, accompanied by symptoms or signs; prevalence based on level I and II studies ranges from 1.2% to 5.7%, symptoms include habitual snoring, disturbed sleep, and daytime neurobehavioral problems, daytime sleepiness may occur but is uncommon in young children, and risk factors include adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, craniofacial anomalies, and neuromuscular disorders, with only the first 2 risk factors common.

### Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children: controversies in diagnosis and treatment [^9fc2ecc9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common, under-recognized condition in childhood with significant morbidities if undiagnosed and untreated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued a clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. It was accompanied by a comprehensive evidence-based technical report that summarized the available literature supporting the guideline. The current review highlights areas of controversy and uncertainty that limit the development of more definitive standards of practice, updates the reader to several newer publications relevant to diagnosis and treatment of childhood OSAS, and identifies future directions for clinical research.

Sleep Questionnaires

Twenty-nine (17 side-lying, 12 supine) parents completed the sleep questionnaire at 1 month of age. Although only 3 (10%) parents reported that their baby did not have good quality sleep, 8 (28%) went on to describe their baby's sleep as poor/restless or sometimes restless (3 every day; 2 > 3 d/wk; 3 ≤ 3 d/wk). In addition, 38% (47% side-lying, 25% supine) reported that their child had difficulty breathing while asleep at some time (1 every day; 3 > 3 d/wk; 3 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks; and 2 only when they had a cold). Ten percent (3 parents) reported that their child had stopped breathing for periods or had pauses in their breathing during their sleep at times (1 everyday; 1 > 3 d/wk; 1 ≤ 3 d/wk; 1 side-lying, 2 supine).

Three-quarters (76%) of parents described their baby as snoring or noisy when sleeping (12 every day; 4 > 3 d/wk; 3 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks; and 1 only when they had a cold; 94% of side-lying, 50% of supine). In addition, a third of parents also described their baby snoring or making snoring noises when awake (2 every day; 5 > 3 d/wk; 1 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks).

Four parents, whose babies slept on their side, reported having to reposition their babies on to their side to improve their sleep quality, perhaps implying that they did not always stay in the original position they had been placed, although this was not specifically stated by parents.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring with oral appliance therapy: an update for 2015 [^f8b3c17a]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary snoring — recommendation and clinical considerations for oral appliances (OAs): We recommend that sleep physicians prescribe oral appliances, rather than no therapy, for adult patients who request treatment of primary snoring without obstructive sleep apnea (STANDARD). Oral appliances reduce the frequency and intensity of snoring, improve sleep quality for both patients who snore and their bed partners, and improve quality of life (QOL) measures, and though the available evidence on these outcomes is limited, we gave this a STANDARD strength of recommendation, as the possible benefits from treatment of primary snoring clearly outweigh the risks. Insufficient evidence exists to conclude that treatment of primary snoring improves other health-related outcomes, or to compare objective sleep quality during use of oral appliances versus other treatments. Therefore, OAs should be recommended for patients who snore who fail conservative measures (weight loss, positional therapy, avoiding alcohol) and request further treatment, and diagnosis of primary snoring should be rendered by a sleep physician and not a dentist, as snoring is frequently accompanied by OSA, and misdiagnosis can have serious implications for the patient.

### Early life environment and snoring in adulthood [^44162797]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

About 16% of middle-aged men and 7% of women snore habitually. They suffer from daytime sleepiness and run an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Snoring is a sign of increased upper airway resistance, usually due to a compromised upper airway during sleep. Snoring and daytime sleepiness are also symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.

Enlargement of the lymphatic system with hypertrophy of the tonsils and the tongue are common causes of a reduction in the size of the upper airways. Infants snore during respiratory infections, and school children snore and suffer from sleep apnea when their tonsils are enlarged. Mandibular retrognathia and narrowing of the lateral pharyngeal area reduce the upper airway size, with snoring and sleep apnea as a result in adults. Obesity, age, smoking and chronic bronchitis are other risk factors for snoring among adults.

There has been great attention to research focusing on the early life origins of adult disease during the last two decades. Increasing evidence show that early life environment may influence health throughout life. Risk factors for adult cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus for example, include maternal smoking, low birth weight and socio-economic class. Exposure to pets and growing up on a farm appear to be protective for allergy, while severe respiratory infections in childhood and living in a large family increase the risk of asthma.

To our knowledge there are no studies investigating whether the susceptibility to adult snoring and sleep apnea could be partly determined by early life environment. In the present paper we aimed to investigate whether environmental factors in childhood are associated with snoring later in life.

### Management of obstructive sleep apnea in the infant: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^04d9210f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the improvement in respiratory parameters of infants with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treated with medical or surgical intervention.

Data Sources

A comprehensive review was completed using the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane libraries including articles published from 1975 to 2024.

Review Methods

Interventions studied included adenotonsillectomy, mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO), tongue/lip adhesion, partial glossectomy, floor-of-mouth release, supraglottoplasty, oral appliances, tracheostomy, and positioning. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) served as a control. Outcomes studied included pre- and postintervention obstructive apnea-hypopnea index. Studies included randomized controlled trials and case-control trials. A total of 2161 records were identified, and 59 studies were included in the analysis. Data was extracted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and pooled using a random-effects model. The primary study outcome established prior to data collection was a change in the apnea-hypopnea index.

Results

A meta-analysis of MDO performed in infants for OSA demonstrated an overall pooled mean difference (pre-apnea-hypopnea index minus post-apnea hypopnea index) of 30.1 (95% confidence interval: 22.9, 37.4; 10 studies, 373 patients). No other data was pooled for analysis due to study heterogeneity. All CPAP studies showed apnea resolution. Tailored therapies including supraglottoplasty and tongue-lip adhesion reduced but did not resolve apneic events.

Conclusion

Current investigations of the evaluation and treatment of infant OSA are limited by heterogeneity in reporting and study. Mandibular distraction and CPAP are promising.

### Management of snoring… [^21c71b7c]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Snoring is a sound caused by vibration of tissue during sleep. It is associated with relaxation of airway muscles and narrowing of the airway, leading to turbulent airflow. Historically it was viewed as a humorous curiosity or nuisance until 1976, when Christian Guilleminault first described obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: verified by nocturnal polysomnography, 8 children with loud snoring, nocturnal enuresis, morning headaches, hypertension, and poor school performance showed dramatic clinical improvement after surgical interventions that included tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and even tracheostomies. Snoring is usually the major symptom in childhood sleep-disordered breathing, a spectrum ranging from primary snoring to severe OSAS.

Habitual snoring, defined as snoring that occurs at least 3 nights per week, is reported in approximately 10% of preschool and school-age children, of whom only 2% to 3% demonstrate clinical OSAS. Parental report of a snoring child. Comments Curative rate with surgical intervention.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in children [^f3dcc12a]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing is common in children. From 3 percent to 12 percent of children snore, while obstructive sleep apnea syndrome affects 1 percent to 10 percent of children. The majority of these children have mild symptoms, and many outgrow the condition. Consequences of untreated obstructive sleep apnea include failure to thrive, enuresis, attention-deficit disorder, behavior problems, poor academic performance, and cardiopulmonary disease. The most common etiology of obstructive sleep apnea is adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Clinical diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is reliable; however, the gold standard evaluation is overnight polysomnography. Treatment includes the use of continuous positive airway pressure and weight loss in obese children. These alternatives are tolerated poorly in children and rarely are considered primary therapy. Adenotonsillectomy is curative in most patients. Children with craniofacial syndromes, neuromuscular diseases, medical comorbidities, or severe obstructive sleep apnea, and those younger than three years are at increased risk of developing postoperative complications and should be monitored overnight in the hospital.

### Is positive airway pressure lab-titration always necessary to start noninvasive respiratory support in infants? [^536520d3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, the longer hospital stays involved more therapeutic education sessions, which may have contributed to better adherence in our cohort. Second, almost all the infants had nap PSG for the diagnostic study, which is a potential limitation as daytime nap PSG applied in infants and children with Down syndrome underestimates sleep‐disordered breathing severity. Nevertheless, Singh and colleagues found that polysomnographic sleep parameters and the number of treatments prescribed were equivalent whether the PSG was performed during daytime or nighttime in a group of children aged < 6 months who were evaluated for sleep‐disordered breathing. Other limitations include the single‐center data, a small sample size, and the retrospective nature of the study design.

In conclusion, this study confirms that initiating CPAP in infants under 2 years old, either with or without traditional laboratory titration, is feasible and effective. The outcomes of HNGE are comparable between the short‐supervised lab titration and the long‐unsupervised titration using the built‐in ventilator software data.

### Diagnosis and perioperative management in pediatric sleep-disordered breathing [^3492c76c]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing has a prevalence of 12% in the pediatric population. It represents a spectrum of disorders encompassing abnormalities of the upper airway that lead to sleep disruption, including primary snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation. Sleep-disordered breathing is the most common indication for adenotonsillectomy, one of the most common procedures performed in children. In recent years, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists have crafted guidelines to help safely manage children with sleep-disordered breathing. Each organization recommends in-laboratory polysomnography for definitive diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in certain cases. However, because this test is both costly and inconvenient, there has been significant interest in alternative methods for diagnosing clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. Accurate diagnosis is critical because sleep-disordered breathing confers certain perioperative risks and increased mortality in some instances. Recent studies have elucidated the danger of anesthesia and opioids in worsening obstructive sleep apnea, and recommendations for alternative analgesia are being created. In addition, determining the most appropriate level and duration of monitoring in the postoperative period is actively being evaluated. This article presents an overview of the recent literature on the perioperative care of pediatric patients with sleep-disordered breathing. It highlights innovative modalities and limitations in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea, the importance of a tailored anesthetic/analgesic approach to children with obstructive sleep apnea, and the need for postoperative monitoring. It also brings to focus that further studies on the perioperative care of these children are necessary.

### Clinical characteristics and prognosis of infants and children [^eab407af]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroglossal duct cysts (TGDCs) are congenital and developmental abnormalities in infants and young children. This retrospective case series study examined the characteristics of 7 patients < 3 years (mean age, 1.9 years) with TGDC complicated with a parapharyngeal mass treated at one hospital between January 2019 and 2022. Four patients had a painless mass around the neck, 2 had a painless mass associated with snoring, and 1 presented repeated swelling and pain. B-ultrasound suggested 6 cases of TGDC and 1 possible lymphangioma. All patients were treated with Sistrunk surgery to remove the TGDC. Six patients had no cyst recurrence during follow-up (6 months to 2 years). In conclusion, TGDC complicated with a parapharyngeal mass has complex and variable clinical manifestations. Completely removing the cyst while sparing thyroid cartilage and surrounding vascular and neuroanatomical structures is important to avoid complications. The patients are likely to be free from recurrence after surgery.

### Snore-associated sleep fragmentation in infancy: mental development effects and contribution of secondhand cigarette smoke exposure [^dbb81c14]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The link between sleep-disordered breathing and neurocognitive functioning in preschool and school-aged children now has been established clearly. Within these age groups, isolated studies have examined the potential effect of snoring without gas exchange abnormalities on aspects of cognitive competence. The goal of the study was to test the potential association between snoring and decrements in developmental performance among infants.

Methods

Thirty-five healthy community infants (8.2 ± 0.4 months) were administered the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, including the Mental Development Index (MDI), after standard, overnight research polysomnography.

Results

The apnea-hypopnea index for all infants was 0. Respiratory arousal index was significantly correlated with MDI. Snoring-associated arousals accounted exclusively for this relationship; spontaneous arousals and those that were associated with central apnea and oxyhemoglobin desaturation episodes (≥ 4%) were not significantly correlated with MDI. Living in a smoking household was not significantly associated with the presence of objectively recorded snoring but was associated with an increase in arousal frequency in snoring infants.

Conclusions

Infants with lower scores on a standardized mental development assessment had higher snoring-arousal indices. Because neither apnea nor hypopnea was present, these findings constitute additional evidence that snoring is not just an innocent noise during sleep in infants but may in fact represent the lower end of the disease spectrum associated with sleep-disordered breathing. Secondhand exposure to cigarette smoke may increase the deleterious effects of infant snoring.

### Implementing an electronic health record-integrated pediatric primary care sleep screener [^f98d05e8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Healthy sleep is vital during childhood. Poor sleep health (eg, short duration) and untreated medical (eg, sleep-disordered breathing [SDB]) and behavioral (eg, insomnia) sleep disorders in childhood are associated with obesity, academic problems, and mental health concerns, including suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion. Despite sleep's importance for optimal development, sleep problem symptoms are commonly underidentified and undertreated in outpatient settings, including primary care.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends assessing for and promoting sleep health (eg, sufficient duration, regular bedtime). Like sleep-focused organizations, the AAP also recommends well-child visit screenings for habitual snoring (≥ 3 nights/week), a common obstructive sleep apnea symptom. Yet primary care clinicians (PCCs) lack standardized tools that feasibly, efficiently, and effectively identify and manage sleep problems while also minimizing rather than contributing to screening burden. A 5-domain primary care screener was associated with increased identification of sleep problems, but it was implemented via pencil and paper for 195 children at 1 clinic, limiting generalizability. In 1 health care system, a brief electronic infant sleep questionnaireand an SDB screener with clinical decision support were feasibly implemented during well-child visits; however, other sleep domains were not evaluated across ages or in more than 5 practices.

To address the lack of an efficient and effective tool to support PCCs in identifying and managing sleep problems, we developed and implemented a brief, electronic health record (EHR)–integrated well-child visit sleep screener with educational resources. The purpose of this study was to describe the developmment of the sleep screener and evaluate its implementation for and association with sleep problem recognition and management in a large primary care network using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework. We hypothesized that the screener would reach 80% or more of unique patients and be adopted in 80% or more of well-child visit encounters during its first year of network-wide implementation. We also hypothesized that the implementation of the screener would be associated with increased sleep disorder diagnosis and management (orders or referrals) compared with a preimplementation period.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^13f7d3e9]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Sleep-related infant deaths — scope and evidence basis: Recommendations are based on studies that include infants aged up to 1 year, and therefore recommendations for sleep position and the sleep environment, unless otherwise specified, are for the first year after birth. Because there are no randomized controlled trials with regard to SIDS and other sleep-related deaths, case-control studies are the best evidence available. When discussing sleep practices, physicians and nonphysician clinicians are encouraged to have open and nonjudgmental conversations with families and others who care for infants, and individual medical conditions may warrant that a clinician recommend otherwise after weighing the relative risks and benefits.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^08df0f69]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Anaesthesia in individuals with achondroplasia — Patients with achondroplasia, especially children, should be anesthetized preferentially in hospitals where care providers are knowledgeable and experienced in caring for patients with achondroplasia and skeletal dysplasias. Due to foramen magnum stenosis, head and neck movement should be avoided or minimized during bag-mask ventilation and intubation of patients with achondroplasia, and these difficulties should be planned for by having readily available airway adjuncts for difficult bag-mask ventilation and video laryngoscopes to avoid neck movement. Thorough pre-assessment is necessary and should pay particular attention to airway assessment, range of neck movement, and history of snoring or sleep-disordered breathing; in infants and young children, central sleep apnoea might be present due to cord compression at the cervicomedullary junction, and a history of sleep-disordered breathing or results of a sleep study will guide their post anaesthetic stay ranging from same-day discharge, overnight stay, high dependency unit, step-down unit or paediatric intensive care.

### AAP releases guideline on diagnosis and management… [^a697936b]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome commonly occurs in children, and if not treated, can cause complications. The American Academy of Pediatrics originally released a guideline on the diagnosis and management of OSAS in children in 2002, but because of the significant increase in research on OSAS, the guideline was updated in 2012. This update focuses on uncomplicated OSAS; children younger than one year, and patients with central apnea or hypoventilation syndromes, or with OSAS that is associated with another medical condition are not discussed. Recommendations Most children with OSAS snore; however, parents rarely mention this at physician visits. Physicians should routinely ask at health maintenance visits if the child snores. If the child does snore or has other signs or symptoms of OSAS, more specific screening should be performed.

Detecting OSAS early is beneficial, because treatment can help relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, prevent sequelae, and decrease use of health care services. If a child regularly snores or has signs or symptoms of OSAS, the physician should perform polysomnography or refer the patient to a sleep specialist or otolaryngologist for further assessment. If polysomnography is not available, alternative testing may be performed. Compared with polysomnography, alternative testing has weaker positive and negative predictive values; however, performing these tests is preferred to performing only a clinical evaluation. If alternative testing does not confirm OSAS in a patient with high pretest probability, polysomnography should be performed. Adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy alone may not be adequate, because lymphoid tissue is left behind, which may cause continued obstruction.

Although adenotonsillectomy may be less effective in children who are obese, results can still be satisfactory in many patients. More study is needed in this population to establish which of these children are likely to benefit. Topical intranasal corticosteroids can be prescribed in children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated, or in children with mild OSAS after adenotonsillectomy. Long-term effects of corticosteroids for this indication are not known; therefore, the patient should be observed for recurrence and adverse effects.

### Interactions of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing with recurrent wheezing or asthma and their effects on sleep quality [^5ff3dafd]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Snoring is the most characteristic symptom of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and recurrent wheezing is the most common clinical manifestation of asthma. The purpose of the present review is to outline the impact of SDB and recurrent wheezing/asthma on sleep quality and to summarize the epidemiologic and pathophysiologic evidence supporting an association between the two disorders. Enlarged tonsils and adenoid or obesity predispose to obstructive sleep apneas and hypopneas which are accompanied by arousals, restless sleep, and frequently daytime sleepiness, inattention, hyperactivity, and academic difficulties. Subjects with history of wheezing are also at risk for sleep disturbance and daytime cognitive dysfunction. Asthmatic children have more frequent snoring, apneas, and hypopneas during sleep than non-asthmatic subjects and tonsillar hypertrophy mediates at least in part this epidemiologic association. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that treatment of sleep apnea with adenotonsillectomy results in improved control of coexisting asthma. Elevated concentrations of leukotrienes and oxidative stress markers have been detected in the exhaled breath condensate of children with asthma and probably contribute to bronchoconstriction. Moreover, sleep apneic children have increased expression of leukotrienes and leukotriene receptors in adenotonsillar tissue. Viral respiratory infections may induce inflammation and oxidative stress in the asthmatic airway enhancing not only bronchospasm, but also biosynthesis of leukotrienes within pharyngeal lymphoid tissues, which promote adenotonsillar enlargement and sleep apnea. In conclusion, taking under consideration the epidemiologic association between obstructive SDB and asthma, when one of the two disorders is diagnosed, the possibility of the other disease being present should be entertained.

### Do newborn infants exhale through the CPAP system? Secondary analysis of a randomised cross-over trial [^67ea6e06]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

During nCPAP treatment, infants treated with nCPAP can exhale through the CPAP system. For preclinical research, this is relevant for studies comparing CPAP systems and interfaces. For clinicians, it could represent an opportunity for optimisation of CPAP treatment by improving delivery of distending pressures. Using flows to determine exhalation through the CPAP system has not previously been reported.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^5a7d49d2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 GUIDELINES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CHILDREN WITH OSDB NEEDING TREATMENT

Two expert recommendations published in 2023 identify a group of children with a history and clinical examination consistent with oSDB who can be treated without the need for overnight recording.

A French Consensus focused on recommendations for children with "oSDB type 1", defined as occurring in young, nonobese children with no associated comorbidities, where oSDB is generally due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The experts conclude that significant oSDB‐1 is suspected when several nighttime respiratory symptoms related to upper airway obstruction are present in the clinical history. They emphasize that "the diagnosis is above all clinical and OSA severity should also be evaluated on the basis of all the clinical signs". A specialized otolaryngologist examination is considered essential.

They further state that questionnaires can be used to collect clinical history, especially by non‐experts. Hence, a score less than 0.3 at the Sleep‐Related Breathing Disorder Scale of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire has good predictive value for mild OSA with potential spontaneous normalization, allowing for watchful waiting. Conversely, a score greater than 2.72 on the Spruyt and Gozal Severity Questionnaire indicates a high likelihood of moderate OSA (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 81%) and suggests that treatment should be considered. In addition, it is stated that a sleep study is not mandatory before surgery for a child with oSDB‐1 if at least two nighttime symptoms (including snoring) and significant tonsil hypertrophy are present. If a sleep study is required, full nocturnal PSG in hospital (the gold standard) or cardiorespiratory polygraphy — performed in hospital or at home depending on the child's needs and availability — should be performed.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical management for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children [^734b744f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) is a condition that encompasses breathing problems when asleep, due to an obstruction of the upper airways, ranging in severity from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). It affects both children and adults. In children, hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoid tissue is thought to be the commonest cause of oSDB. As such, tonsillectomy - with or without adenoidectomy - is considered an appropriate first-line treatment for most cases of paediatric oSDB.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy compared with non-surgical management of children with oSDB.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 5 March 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness and safety of (adeno)tonsillectomy with non-surgical management in children with oSDB aged 2 to 16 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Three trials (562 children) met our inclusion criteria. Two were at moderate to high risk of bias and one at low risk of bias. We did not pool the results because of substantial clinical heterogeneity. They evaluated three different groups of children: those diagnosed with mild to moderate OSAS by polysomnography (PSG) (453 children aged five to nine years; low risk of bias; CHAT trial), those with a clinical diagnosis of oSDB but with negative PSG recordings (29 children aged two to 14 years; moderate to high risk of bias; Goldstein) and children with Down syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) diagnosed with mild to moderate OSAS by PSG (80 children aged six to 12 years; moderate to high risk of bias; Sudarsan). Moreover, the trials included two different comparisons: adenotonsillectomy versus no surgery (CHAT trial and Goldstein) or versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (Sudarsan). Disease-specific quality of life and/or symptom score (using a validated instrument): first primary outcomeIn the largest trial with lowest risk of bias (CHAT trial), at seven months, mean scores for those instruments measuring disease-specific quality of life and/or symptoms were lower (that is, better quality of life or fewer symptoms) in children receiving adenotonsillectomy than in those managed by watchful waiting:- OSA-18 questionnaire (scale 18 to 126): 31.8 versus 49.5 (mean difference (MD) -17.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.2 to -14.2);- PSQ-SRBD questionnaire (scale 0 to 1): 0.2 versus 0.5 (MD -0.3, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.26);- Modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale (scale 0 to 24): 5.1 versus 7.1 (MD -2.0, 95% CI -2.9 to -1.1). No data on this primary outcome were reported in the Goldstein trial. In the Sudarsan trial, the mean OSA-18 score at 12 months did not significantly differ between the adenotonsillectomy and CPAP groups. The mean modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores did not differ at six months, but were lower in the surgery group at 12 months: 5.5 versus 7.9 (MD -2.4, 95% CI -3.1 to -1.7). Adverse events: second primary outcomeIn the CHAT trial, 15 children experienced a serious adverse event: 6/194 (3%) in the adenotonsillectomy group and 9/203 (4%) in the control group (RD -1%, 95% CI -5% to 2%). No major complications were reported in the Goldstein trial. In the Sudarsan trial, 2/37 (5%) developed a secondary haemorrhage after adenotonsillectomy, while 1/36 (3%) developed a rash on the nasal dorsum secondary to the CPAP mask (RD -3%, 95% CI -6% to 12%). Secondary outcomesIn the CHAT trial, at seven months, mean scores for generic caregiver-rated quality of life were higher in children receiving adenotonsillectomy than in those managed by watchful waiting. No data on this outcome were reported by Sudarsan and Goldstein. In the CHAT trial, at seven months, more children in the surgery group had normalisation of respiratory events during sleep as measured by PSG than those allocated to watchful waiting: 153/194 (79%) versus 93/203 (46%) (RD 33%, 95% CI 24% to 42%). In the Goldstein trial, at six months, PSG recordings were similar between groups and in the Sudarsan trial resolution of OSAS (Apnoea/Hypopnoea Index score below 1) did not significantly differ between the adenotonsillectomy and CPAP groups. In the CHAT trial, at seven months, neurocognitive performance and attention and executive function had not improved with surgery: scores were similar in both groups. In the CHAT trial, at seven months, mean scores for caregiver-reported ratings of behaviour were lower (that is, better behaviour) in children receiving adenotonsillectomy than in those managed by watchful waiting, however, teacher-reported ratings of behaviour did not significantly differ. No data on these outcomes were reported by Goldstein and Sudarsan.

Authors' Conclusions

In otherwise healthy children, without a syndrome, of older age (five to nine years), and diagnosed with mild to moderate OSAS by PSG, there is moderate quality evidence that adenotonsillectomy provides benefit in terms of quality of life, symptoms and behaviour as rated by caregivers and high quality evidence that this procedure is beneficial in terms of PSG parameters. At the same time, high quality evidence indicates no benefit in terms of objective measures of attention and neurocognitive performance compared with watchful waiting. Furthermore, PSG recordings of almost half of the children managed non-surgically had normalised by seven months, indicating that physicians and parents should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of adenotonsillectomy against watchful waiting in these children. This is a condition that may recover spontaneously over time. For non-syndromic children classified as having oSDB on purely clinical grounds but with negative PSG recordings, the evidence on the effects of adenotonsillectomy is of very low quality and is inconclusive. Low-quality evidence suggests that adenotonsillectomy and CPAP may be equally effective in children with Down syndrome or MPS diagnosed with mild to moderate OSAS by PSG. We are unable to present data on the benefits of adenotonsillectomy in children with oSDB aged under five, despite this being a population in whom this procedure is often performed for this purpose.

### Morbidity of overweight (≥ 85th percentile) in the first 2 years of life [^a7043470]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our hypothesis was that morbidity related to overweight/obesity is already evident in infants and young toddlers. The major objectives of this study were (1) to assess the prevalence of overweight in a sample of hospitalized infants and (2) to assess the prevalence of morbidity in overweight infants in a community-based sample.

Methods

The hospital admission study population included 2139 infants, ≤ 24 months of age, who were admitted for any reason to the pediatric department at the Bnai Zion Medical Center in 2004–2005. For the community-based sample, we identified overweight infants (≥ 85th weight-for-height percentile in ≥ 2 measurements, ≥ 3 months apart), ≤ 24 months of age, in 8 mother and child health care facilities in the Haifa subdistrict of Israel. Parents of infants were interviewed by using a structured questionnaire.

Results

We found that overweight infants (85th to 94th percentiles) had fewer admissions and fewer repeated admissions than expected. Infants of ≥ 95th percentile had more admissions than expected, as well as a larger number of repeated admissions. In the second part of the study, we found that rates of developmental delays (mainly delayed gross motor skills) and snoring were significantly higher in infants of ≥ 85th percentile. In addition, although the results were not statistically significant, infants with overweight suffered more frequently from breathing problems, such as asthma and stridor. When the mothers were asked to assess whether their child was overweight, only 31.6% of mothers of overweight children thought that the child was overweight.

Conclusions

The high admission rates for infants of ≥ 95th percentile and the high incidence rates of respiratory morbidity, snoring, and delayed gross motor skills in overweight infants support our hypothesis regarding early morbidity associated with overweight.

### Clinical characteristics, associated comorbidities and hospital outcomes of neonates with sleep disordered breathing: a retrospective cohort study [^e71bd088]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our data demonstrate that SDB is common in high-risk neonates and are often associated with significant multisystem comorbidity where craniofacial abnormalities and airway malformations (38%) and genetic syndromes were common (26%). It must be identified and treated promptly to avoid negative consequences. However, diagnosis and management of SDB in the neonatal period are complex. This study identifies the critical need to establish normative data for the neonatal population. The establishment of reference values and treatment thresholds for the neonates will help clinicians in making decision based on polysomnographic findings and it will help in standardising the practices. This study also highlights an urgent need for outcome-based research. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish the relationship between SDB in infancy and long-term outcomes.

Key Action Statement 5 — reevaluation after therapy: Clinicians should clinically reassess all patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) for persisting signs and symptoms after therapy to determine whether further treatment is required (Evidence Quality: Grade B, Recommendation Strength: Recommendation). Clinicians should reassess OSAS-related symptoms and signs after 6 to 8 weeks of therapy; most clinicians recommend reevaluation 6 to 8 weeks after treatment, and objective data regarding the timing of the postoperative evaluation are not available. Patients who remain symptomatic should undergo objective testing or be referred to a sleep specialist for further evaluation.

### Long-term outcomes of medical treatment of adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children with obstructive sleep disordered breathing [^8080875f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Adenotonsillectomy is widely recognized as first-line treatment for obstructive sleep disordered breathing (oSDB), especially for older children with severe disease. The best course of treatment for children with milder oSDB is less clear. It has been our practice to offer surgical candidates with mild symptoms (snoring with occasional short, infrequent pauses by parental report) the option of medical treatment with an antibiotic and oral steroid. We examine the immediate and long term-effects of this intervention.

Methods

We reviewed the records of children presenting to our academic Pediatric Otolaryngology practice in the years 2000 to 2023. Tonsil size before and after treatment, resolution of snoring, and ultimate need for surgery were recorded. Follow-up phone calls were made to patient families when information was incomplete.

Results

One hundred sixty-nine patients underwent medical treatment for mild oSDB. Among children with acute (≤ 2 months) symptoms, 38% (20/53) had resolution of snoring and 42% (18/43) did not require surgery. Mean tonsil size (Brodsky grade) decreased from 2.58 to 2.20 after medical treatment in this group. Among children with chronic symptoms, 34% (26/77) had resolution of snoring and 30.0% (18/60) did not require surgery. Their mean tonsil size decreased from 2.58 to 2.13.

Conclusions

These results suggest that treatment of mild oSDB treatment with short-course amoxicillin-clavulanate and 5 days of prednisolone is safe and can result in resolution of snoring in many children. More than one third of children treated this way avoided surgery with follow-up averaging 5 years. These observations argue for a prospective, randomized trial of this medical treatment as an alternative to immediate surgery.

Sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma affecting the nasopharyngeal region is an extremely rare disease, especially in infants. We describe the case of a 2-year-old boy who presented to the ear, nose and throat department with a history of snoring, blood-stained rhinorrhoea and symptoms consistent with upper respiratory tract infections. Physical examination revealed massive cervical lymphadenopathy. MRI of the head and neck showed a mass lesion in the nasopharynx with bilateral lymph node enlargement. Debulking of the mass was performed and biopsies were sent for histology, which confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient was treated with complex chemotherapy and had a good clinical response. The patient remains in remission after 6years.

"The more severe the OSAS, the more likely a child is to have HTN", and "inadequate duration of sleep and poor-quality sleep have been associated with elevated BP".

### Multilevel risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing-related symptom burden in an urban pediatric community-based sample [^51bd37b1]. CHEST Pulmonary (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including habitual snoring and OSA, is prevalent in 7% to 15% and 1% to 5% of children, respectively, and disproportionally affects children from minoritized backgrounds, with low socioeconomic status (SES) households, or living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. - SDB is a risk factor for numerous health, neurobehavioral, and functional outcomes, and therefore may contribute to health disparities. In generally healthy school-aged children, the most commonly recognized risk factors for SDB are adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity. Black children have a fourfold increased risk for OSA compared with White children unexplained by obesity, and have decreased response to treatment of OSA with adenotonsillectomy compared with White children, suggesting that risk factors other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity contribute to OSA disparities. Several studies suggest that neighborhood disadvantage associates with SDB prevalence or severity; however, the underlying mechanisms are not understood.

A plausible explanation for disparities in SDB is that environmental exposures to allergens and irritants directly contribute to the pathogenesis or severity of SDB via effects on upper airway inflammation or indirectly influence SDB through effects on lower airway inflammation that increase risk of asthma. Asthma and allergic rhinitis frequently coaggregate with SDB, suggesting potential causal associations and shared risk factors. - Although allergen and irritant exposures, including rodents, cockroaches, and environmental smoke exposure (ETS), have been associated with increased asthma symptoms or increased asthma severity in children who are atopic, - little is known about how these exposures affect SDB.

Understanding multilevel risk factors as risk factors for SDB is critical to mitigating childhood sleep health disparities. We hypothesize that multilevel risk factors — particularly the indoor environment — are associated with increased risk for SDB symptom burden in children. We focused on SDB symptom burden given that measures of symptom burden are increasingly valued as important health outcomes, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) does not fully reflect the clinical manifestations and chronic symptom burden experienced by children with SDB, and SDB symptoms better predict behavioral outcomes and response to intervention than the AHI.

### Somatropin (omnitrope) [^b6dedcee]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Acute Critical Illness

Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4)]. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n = 522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3–8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients experiencing acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk.

5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children

There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4)].

### Polysomnography in infants with clinical suspicion of sleep-related breathing disorders [^799c6a30]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Limited data exist concerning the indications, parameters, utility of daytime polysomnography, and treatment of infants with suspected sleep-related breathing disorders.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all polysomnography undertaken in a quaternary pediatric hospital for term infants up to 6 months of age between January 2017 and December 2019. Outcomes were evaluated, including a comparison among diagnostic groups.

Results

Of 161 infants (58% male), 77 (48%) were ≤ 2 months old, and 103 (61%) were referred for either craniofacial abnormalities or an airway malformation. Daytime (n = 100) vs nighttime (n = 61) studies showed no differences in sleep architecture or treatment rates. Apnea-hypopnea index was > 10 events/h in 137 (85%) and was similar across different diagnostic groups, and 97 (78%) were prescribed noninvasive ventilation, with a mean treatment duration of 13.4 ± 9 months. Of the infants who were commenced on noninvasive ventilation 75% did not require it beyond 24 months.

Conclusions

Polysomnographic sleep parameters and the number of treatments prescribed were equivalent whether the polysomnography was performed during daytime or nighttime. Treatment with noninvasive ventilation was required in the short term for most infants with sleep-related breathing disorders, regardless of the indication for referral.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^45b3e783]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — sleep-disordered breathing and iron supplementation: Discuss symptoms related to sleep-disordered breathing at every well-child visit, including snoring, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, nighttime awakening, behavior problems, and abnormal sleep position. Refer to a physician with expertise in pediatric sleep, otolaryngologist, or a pediatric sleep medicine specialist any child with signs or symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing or abnormal sleep study results. Children with sleep problems and a ferritin concentration < 50 μg/L may benefit from iron supplementation, and discuss obesity as a risk factor of sleep apnea with review of healthy diet and activity in affected patients.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in children: an update [^8afc3dde]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in children requires clinical suspicion supplemented with the use of specific diagnostic tests. Polysomnography remains the key to diagnosis, and helps to assess the need for treatment, the risk for perioperative respiratory compromise, and the likelihood of persistent OSAS after treatment. Adenotonsillectomy is the mainstay of treatment, although children with complex medical conditions that affect upper airway anatomy and tone may require additional treatment.

Summary of the evidence

We identified two published studies that met the inclusion criteria: Chan and colleagues and Digoy and colleagues, including a total of 60 children (aged 6–55 mo) and four outcomes of interest (Table E5). Both studies reported a reduction in AHI after surgery. Chan and colleagues reported a decrease in mean AHI from 14.9 ± 2.8 to 4.9 ± 1.1, with 21/24 children (88%) showing an improvement in AHI. Digoy and colleagues reported a decrease in mean AHI from 13.3 ± 12.9 to 4.1 ± 5.0 (P = 0.001), with 33/36 children (92%) showing a decrease in AHI. Neither study specifically reported resolution of OSA as an outcome.

Chan and colleagues reported a mean oxygen saturation from 88% ± 1.2% at baseline to 88.8% ± 0.6% postoperatively. Digoy and colleagues reported a mean increase in oxygen saturation from 83.0% ± 8.6% to 86.5% ± 4.9% postoperatively (P = 0.015); 58% of patients experienced an increase in saturation. These improvements may be especially clinically relevant if the child has medical complexity, including cardiopulmonary comorbidity.

Snoring improvement was reported by Digoy and colleagues in 25/29 children (86%), with resolution in 15 and improvement in 10.

Outcomes of daytime sleepiness, QOL, cognitive function, behavioral changes, and mood were not reported.

Adverse effects were only reported by Digoy and colleagues, with postoperative dysphagia in seven children, transient dysphagia in five, and dysphagia for > 6 months in two others. Postoperative coughing and throat clearing were reported in three children.

Recommendation 5: We suggest that children with sleep-dependent laryngomalacia and persistent OSA may be considered candidates for supraglottoplasty (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the estimates of the effect).

Justification and implementation

This recommendation places a high priority on the need to identify obstruction at the level of the supraglottis (sleep-dependent or congenital laryngomalacia) using DISE in children with persistent OSA.

Desirable consequences and their magnitude

The magnitude of the desirable consequences is difficult to judge, because we only identified two small, retrospective studies. Both studies reported an improvement in OSA severity (AHI and oxygen saturation) after supraglottoplasty.

### Should you give kids medicine for coughs and colds? [^893520b2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Ways to Treat Colds in Infants and Children Coughs are a normal symptom of a cold and help the body clear the mucus out of the airway and protect the lungs. Non-drug treatments for coughs include drinking plenty of fluids, especially warm drinks to soothe the throat. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration offers these tips for relieving cough and cold symptoms in infants and children: A makes breathing easier by decreasing congestion in nasal passages. Do not use warm mist humidifiers because they can cause nasal passages to swell and make breathing more difficult. cool mist humidifier keep nasal passages moist and help avoid stuffiness. Saline nose drops or sprays or a similar product, with or without saline nose drops, works very well for children younger than a year old. You can use them on older children, too, but they often resist bulb syringes. Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe. can be used to reduce fever, aches, and pain.

Carefully read and follow the product's instructions on the Drug Facts label or talk to your pharmacist or health care provider about dosage. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen Encourage children to drink plenty of liquids to. stay hydrated. How can you be sure to give the correct dose. The FDA encourages drug manufacturers to provide a dosing instrument, such as a syringe or a cup, marked with the correct measurements. Use them — and not household spoons or tools from other medications — to measure medication. Don't give children medicines that are packaged and made for adults because adult medicines may overdose a child. In certain instances, children younger than 4 who took these products have experienced serious side effects, some of which required hospitalization, including:

- Seizure, allergic reaction, and difficulty breathing.
- Low blood potassium and low blood sugar, which may result in headache, crankiness, drowsiness, and weakness.

These serious side effects occurred soon after children took a homeopathic cough and cold product; however, it is not always possible to know whether a reported side effect was caused by a medicine.
- Severe headache.
- Not eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration.
- Excessive crankiness or sleepiness.
- Persistent ear pain.
- If the child is getting worse.

### What is "abnormal" in pediatric sleep? [^704526f4]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing in general and, more particularly, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are highly prevalent conditions in children. Although the diagnosis appears relatively straightforward using a sleep study (polysomnography), this labor-intensive and expensive procedure is used in only a minority of cases across the country because of the relative unavailability of pediatric sleep centers. However, the definition of an abnormal sleep study is not a trivial process and requires a methodical delineation of normative data, implication of "abnormal" variables to specific outcomes, and demonstration of cost-effectiveness of such approach. Unfortunately, such studies are lacking; there is no real consensus on any of these important aspects, which in turn leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Such paucity of validated data, however, is an opportunity to explore alternative options that would enable incorporation of biomarkers into well defined and validated algorithms. There is no doubt that novel approaches to the evaluation of community-based and clinically referred pediatric populations should enable more pragmatic and reliable diagnostic approaches for pediatric sleep-disordered breathing.
