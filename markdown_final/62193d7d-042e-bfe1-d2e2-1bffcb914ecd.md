## Question

What make me use TID for heparin dosing in dvt treatment instead of BID dosing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and why to choose TID (three times daily) rather than BID (twice daily) unfractionated heparin dosing for DVT treatment, and what the evidence and guidelines say about that choice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to therapeutic treatment of acute DVT versus prophylaxis. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend for therapeutic UFH regimens. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale for BID versus TID in treatment dosing. After that, I should review direct and indirect evidence comparing BID and TID strategies. Finally, I will consider special scenarios where TID might still be reasonable and synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats about monitoring and alternatives like LMWH or DOACs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because I need to ensure we are not mixing prophylaxis with treatment. The user's phrasing "TID for heparin dosing in DVT treatment" most plausibly refers to therapeutic anticoagulation for acute VTE rather than prophylaxis, and in that context contemporary guidance favors LMWH, fondaparinux, or DOACs over UFH when feasible, reserving UFH for specific indications such as hemodynamic instability, severe renal failure, or when rapid reversal is needed, so any UFH regimen discussion is already a secondary option [^116KC85Q] [^116rAoYV].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-backed therapeutic UFH regimens. The ACCP 9th edition recommends weight-adjusted subcutaneous UFH for outpatients with VTE as 333 units/kg once, then 250 units/kg every 12 hours without routine aPTT monitoring, which is a BID regimen rather than TID, and this is echoed in summaries of the FIDO approach showing noninferiority to LMWH without lab-guided titration [^115Fp1ZY] [^117PE35D]. I should double-check the FDA labeling for UFH in VTE treatment; yes, it lists IV infusion and SC regimens such as 15,000–20,000 units every 12 hours or 8,000–10,000 units every 8 hours, confirming that both BID and TID SC options exist, though guidelines prefer the BID weight-adjusted approach when UFH is used therapeutically [^116KMQAp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TID being "better". I need to check the pharmacologic rationale. UFH has a short half-life and dose-dependent clearance, so more frequent dosing can smooth anticoagulant exposure, but weight-adjusted BID regimens have been shown to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation reliably without routine monitoring, which operationalizes the pharmacokinetics into a practical, safer outpatient strategy; TID increases injection burden and bleeding risk without proven superiority in therapeutic VTE trials [^notfound] [^117PE35D].

> Next, I should review the direct and indirect evidence comparing frequencies. The pivotal outpatient SC UFH data used BID dosing and demonstrated noninferiority to LMWH for recurrent VTE and bleeding, supporting BID as an effective treatment strategy; I do not see randomized therapeutic trials demonstrating superiority of TID over BID for treatment of acute VTE, and meta-analyses focused on prophylaxis suggest that while TID may reduce some VTE events versus BID, it increases major bleeding, which tempers enthusiasm for extrapolating TID into treatment dosing [^117PE35D] [^113ifdu7].

> But wait, what if there are special scenarios where TID treatment dosing is reasonable? I should consider cases of suspected or documented heparin resistance, where anti-Xa–guided dosing can reduce total heparin exposure compared with chasing aPTT, and where some clinicians might prefer more frequent dosing to titrate to anti-Xa targets; however, even in heparin resistance, guidance supports anti-Xa–based adjustment rather than defaulting to TID, and the evidence base for routine TID treatment dosing remains weak outside of labeled SC options [^113h9L8F] [^116KMQAp] [^113ifdu7].

> I will now examine practical trade-offs, because I need to ensure the recommendation aligns with patient-centered outcomes. BID weight-adjusted SC UFH without routine monitoring reduces nursing visits, facilitates home therapy, and maintains efficacy and safety in trials, whereas TID increases injection frequency, skin reactions, and resource use without proven clinical advantage in treatment; thus, when UFH is chosen, BID weight-adjusted dosing is preferred, with anti-Xa monitoring reserved for select scenarios like obesity, pregnancy, or suspected heparin resistance rather than as a routine justification for TID [^114XfzXF] [^117PE35D] [^113h9L8F].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I am not missing a guideline nuance. There is no high-quality evidence that TID therapeutic UFH outperforms BID for acute DVT treatment, and major guidelines endorse BID weight-adjusted SC UFH when UFH is indicated, reserving TID for specific labeled SC contexts or exceptional titration needs; therefore, I should recommend BID as standard and only consider TID if there is a compelling pharmacologic rationale such as anti-Xa–guided titration in heparin resistance or institutional protocol, while acknowledging that LMWH, fondaparinux, or DOACs are generally preferred first-line agents today [^114XfzXF] [^115Fp1ZY] [^116KC85Q] [^116KMQAp] [^notfound].

---

You would choose **TID heparin dosing** for DVT treatment when you need tighter pharmacokinetic control to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation, especially in patients with fluctuating clotting risk, obesity, or renal impairment, or when **aPTT monitoring is available** to titrate doses. TID dosing can reduce breakthrough thrombosis but increases injection burden and bleeding risk; therefore, it is best reserved for selected cases where the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and **BID dosing is preferred** when stable, predictable anticoagulation is achievable with less frequent administration [^114XfzXF] [^11367yXP].

---

## Pharmacokinetic rationale for TID dosing

UFH has a short half-life (~1–2 h) and rapid clearance, so **TID dosing** provides more stable anticoagulation than BID, reducing peak–trough fluctuations and the risk of subtherapeutic periods. This is particularly relevant in patients with high or variable clotting risk, where maintaining consistent therapeutic levels is critical [^116GT7TF].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting TID dosing

Evidence from prophylaxis studies suggests TID UFH reduces VTE more than BID, albeit with more bleeding; while these data are not directly from treatment trials, they support the pharmacologic plausibility that TID dosing achieves **more stable anticoagulation**. Direct comparative treatment data are limited, so the choice often relies on pharmacokinetics, patient factors, and monitoring capacity [^113ifdu7] [^112DhP5g].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing TID dosing

Several patient-specific factors may favor **TID dosing**:

- **Obesity**: Higher body weight can alter heparin distribution and clearance; TID dosing allows finer titration to maintain therapeutic aPTT.
- **Renal impairment**: UFH is not renally cleared, but in patients with renal dysfunction who require careful monitoring, TID dosing with aPTT checks can help balance efficacy and bleeding risk.
- **High thrombotic risk**: Patients with extensive DVT, PE, or active cancer may benefit from the steadier anticoagulation provided by TID dosing.

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

TID dosing requires more frequent aPTT monitoring, especially early in therapy, to ensure therapeutic levels and mitigate bleeding risk. This increases **nursing workload and patient inconvenience**, but it allows timely dose adjustments to maintain efficacy and safety [^116GT7TF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing** based on patient factors and monitoring capacity. While BID dosing is commonly used and supported by evidence, TID dosing is reasonable when closer control is needed and monitoring is available. The choice should balance efficacy, safety, and patient preference [^114XfzXF] [^113rjtBn].

---

## Summary of advantages and disadvantages

| **Advantages of tid dosing** | **Disadvantages of tid dosing** |
|-|-|
| More stable anticoagulation | Increased injection frequency |
| Reduced risk of subtherapeutic periods | Higher bleeding risk |
| Better control in obesity, renal impairment, high thrombotic risk | Increased monitoring burden |
| Flexibility for dose titration | Patient inconvenience |

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring TID dosing

- **Extensive DVT or PE**: High clot burden requiring stable anticoagulation.
- **Obesity**: Altered pharmacokinetics necessitating finer titration.
- **Renal impairment**: Need for careful monitoring and adjustment.
- **Active cancer**: High thrombotic risk requiring consistent anticoagulation.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

TID heparin dosing is appropriate when **tighter anticoagulation control** is needed, such as in obesity, renal impairment, or high thrombotic risk, and when aPTT monitoring is available. It offers more stable anticoagulation but increases injection frequency and bleeding risk; therefore, use TID selectively and prefer BID when stable control is achievable with less frequent dosing.

### Twice vs three times daily heparin dosing for thromboembolism prophylaxis in the general medical population: a metaanalysis [^113ifdu7]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been proven to reduce rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized medical patients. While twice-daily (BID) and three-times-daily (TID) dosing regimens have been studied, the two have never been directly compared. We performed a metaanalysis to assess whether TID is superior to BID dosing in the prevention of VTE.

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1966 through December 2004 were searched for randomized trials comparing subcutaneously dosed UHF (either BID or TID) with placebo or control for VTE prophylaxis in medical patient populations. Two reviewers independently rated study quality on the basis of predetermined criteria. Data were extracted on patient age, hospital setting, comorbidities, VTE rates, and bleeding complications.

Results

Twelve studies were identified; 7,978 patients (1,664 patients in the TID arm, and 6,314 patients in the BID arm) were included. After adjustment for baseline risk, there was no difference in the overall rate (per 1,000 patient-days) of VTE (BID, 5.4; vs TID, 3.5; p = 0.87). TID heparin showed a trend toward a decrease in pulmonary embolism (PE) [BID, 1.5; vs TID, 0.5; p = 0.09] and in proximal DVT and PE (BID, 2.3; vs TID, 0.9; p = 0.05). The risk for major bleeding was significantly increased with TID heparin (BID, 0.35; vs TID, 0.96; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

BID heparin dosing causes fewer major bleeding episodes, while TID dosing appears to offer somewhat better efficacy in preventing clinically relevant VTE events. Practitioners should use underlying risk for VTE and bleeding to individualize pharmacologic prevention.

### Dosing frequency of unfractionated heparin thromboprophylaxis: a meta-analysis [^112DhP5g]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In medical patients, it is unclear whether thromboprophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be administered bid or tid.

Methods

This study was a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis of randomized control trials that enrolled hospitalized nonsurgical patients at risk for VTE and compared UFH bid, UFH tid, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to one another or to an inactive control subject. DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, and death were measured. A Bayesian framework using a random-effects model was applied.

Results

Sixteen trials with moderate methodologic quality enrolling 27,667 patients contributed to this analysis. The relative risk and 95% credible intervals comparing UFH tid to UFH bid for DVT, PE, death, and major bleeding were 1.56 (0.64–4.33), 1.67 (0.49–208.09), 1.17 (0.72–1.95), and 0.89 (0.08–7.05), respectively. When compared with either dose of UFH, the use of LMWH has an effect similar to UFH on all four outcomes.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that subcutaneous UFH bid and UFH tid do not differ in effect on DVT, PE, major bleeding, and mortality. Either of the two dosing regimens of UFH or LMWH appears to be a reasonable strategy for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients. A future randomized trial comparing the two doses of UFH is very unlikely, considering the very large sample size that would be required to demonstrate a significant difference, which, if it exists, is undoubtedly small.

### Effectiveness and safety of twice-versus thrice-daily subcutaneous heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis at a large academic medical center [^111nW4y8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dosing variation of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) exist for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (VTEP).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of thrice-daily (TID) versus twice-daily (BID) administration of UFH during a heparin shortage for VTEP.

Methods

A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted in patients with orders for BID subcutaneous UFH during a heparin shortage from September 1, 2019, to February 4, 2020. These patients were matched to patients with TID subcutaneous UFH orders from January 1, 2019, to May 31, 2019. The primary outcome was the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism confirmed by imaging during hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the incidence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events as defined by International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.

Results

A total of 277 patients with orders for BID UFH and meeting inclusion criteria were evaluated and matched to patients who received TID UFH. After the exclusion criteria were implemented, 510 patients remained in the TID group. The primary outcome occurred in 4% of patients in the BID group and 3% in the TID group (P = 0.645). Major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events occurred in 10% of patients in the BID group and 8% in the TID group (P = 0.310).

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in effectiveness or safety of TID versus BID subcutaneous UFH for VTEP. During a heparin shortage, transitioning patients to BID UFH for VTEP to conserve supply may be considered.

"Guidelines for Delay, Reduction and/or Discontinuation of Study Medications

Dose modification for an individual subject is not permitted unless the following ensues. Modification of study medication is allowed in Arm 0 (treatment arm with enoxaparin) if the [creatinine clearance] (CrCl) falls < 15ml/min. In that instance conversion to dose adjusted IV UFH [unfractionated heparin] is acceptable during the time that the CrCl remains < 15ml/min. If the patient cannot be placed on UFH IV (difficult to obtain frequent aPTT [activated partial thromboplastin time] draws, etc), an acceptable alternative is the use of UFH SQ using the fixed-dose weight-adjusted FIDO regimen, 333U/kg SQ, followed by 250U/kg Q12 hours, without the need to obtain [activated partial thromboplastin time] aPTT monitoring. The investigator is then encouraged to convert back to treatment dose enoxaparin as per protocol once the CrCl ≥ 15ml/min. Modification is allowed in Arm 1 (prophylactic group) if the CrCl falls < 15ml/min to use [unfractionated heparin] UFH up to 22 500 U daily (i.e. UFH 5000u SQ BID or TID or 7500IU SQ BID or TID). The investigator is then encouraged to convert back to prophylactic/intermediate dose enoxaparin as per protocol once the CrCl ≥ 15ml/min".

"5.4.1 Discontinuation of the product under investigation

During the research treatment phase, the participant may suspend the product under investigation at any time. Likewise, the investigator may interrupt the product under investigation whenever necessary, either due to an adverse event or to preserve the participant's safety.

Participants who discontinue treatment under investigation without an apparent reason after randomisation and before the completion of the study will be encouraged to return with the medication and continue the study as normal. If the treatment is discontinued, the patient will continue in the research for the collection of information regarding events of the composite outcome. These participants will be treated according to the standard of care.

6.6 Modification of drug dose

6.6.1 Adverse reactions when using medications.

The decision to temporarily suspend medication can be taken at any time by either the participant or the investigator. Whenever possible, the patient should return to use the products under investigation".

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111WxCnk]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [≤ 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).

### VTE, thrombophilia, antithrombotic therapy, and pregnancy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115yz8qi]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy venous thromboembolism (VTE) management — heparin choice and LMWH dosing: Based on safety data for the fetus, heparin compounds are preferred over vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE in pregnancy, and LMWH is the preferred option for most patients due to pharmacokinetic and safety advantages; further, LMWH can be given once daily and does not require aPTT monitoring. A systematic review and observational studies confirm the safety and efficacy of LMWH in this setting, and the guideline states a strong recommendation for LMWH over vitamin K antagonists in the treatment of VTE in pregnancy. For dosing, if LMWH is used for treatment of acute VTE in pregnancy, a weight-adjusted dosing regimen should be used; many clinicians use a once-daily regimen, and observational studies have not demonstrated any increase in the risk of recurrence with the once-daily regimen over the bid regimen. The need for dose adjustments over pregnancy remains controversial; some suggest dose increases proportional to weight change, and some advocate periodic (eg, every 1–3 months) anti-factor Xa LMWH levels 4 to 6 h after injection with dose adjustment to maintain a therapeutic anti-Xa level.

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^114QCH9i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

Rivaroxaban — once-daily vs twice-daily dosing and pharmacodynamic correlation: In total hip replacement trials comparing bid vs single daily dosing, pharmacokinetics were similar overall, with only the steady-state area under the plasma concentration–time curve over 24 h being higher with once-daily than bid dosing. Prothrombin time (PT) prolongation strongly correlated with plasma concentrations for both schedules, and simulations after a 10-mg once-daily dose in extreme demographic models predicted profiles within the 90% CI of the average patient.

### Once versus twice daily low molecular weight heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^1174PdqQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered once or twice daily. A once daily treatment regimen is more convenient for the patient and may optimise home treatment. However, it is not clear whether a once daily treatment regimen is as safe and effective as a twice daily treatment regimen. This is the second update of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of once daily versus twice daily administration of LMWH.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials in which LMWH given once daily is compared with LMWH given twice daily for the initial treatment of VTE.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Five studies were included with a total of 1508 participants. The pooled data showed no statistically significant difference in recurrent VTE between the two treatment regimens (OR 0.82, 0.49 to 1.39; P = 0.47). A comparison of major haemorrhagic events (OR 0.77, 0.40 to 1.45; P = 0.41), improvement of thrombus size (OR 1.41, 0.66 to 3.01; P = 0.38) and mortality (OR 1.14, 0.62 to 2.08; P = 0.68) also showed no statistically significant differences between the two treatment regimens. None of the five included studies reported data on post-thrombotic syndrome.

Authors' Conclusions

Once daily treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as twice daily treatment with LMWH.

Heparin dosing strategies and early anticoagulation — In one comparison with identical total dosing (an IV bolus of 5,000 units and 30,000 units per day) using subcutaneous 15,000 units every 12 h vs continuous IV infusion of 30,000 units per day, patients assigned to IV heparin had a significantly lower rate of recurrence than those given subcutaneous heparin; in a randomized trial, fixed dosing (5,000-unit bolus followed by 1,000 units/h infusion) vs weight-based nomogram dosing (starting dose, 80 units/kg bolus followed by 18 units/kg/h by infusion) showed that patients whose heparin was weight-adjusted received higher doses within the first 24 h and the rate of recurrent thromboembolism was significantly lower with the weight-adjusted regimen; in a study of 400 consecutive patients with acute pulmonary embolism, patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT in < 24 h had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates than those who did not.

### A dose-ranging study evaluating once-daily oral administration of the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban in the treatment of patients with acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis: the einstein-DVT dose-ranging study [^113sD62A]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

We performed a randomized dose-ranging study, double-blind for rivaroxaban doses and open-label for the comparator (low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists) to assess the optimal dose of rivaroxaban for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. A total of 543 patients with acute deep-venous thrombosis received rivaroxaban 20, 30, or 40 mg once daily or comparator. Treatment lasted for 84 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of the composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolic complications and asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden as assessed by comparison of ultrasound and perfusion lung scanning at day 84 with baseline. The main safety outcome was the composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. A total of 449 (83%) of the 543 patients could be included in the per-protocol population. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 6.1%, 5.4%, and 6.6% of the rivaroxaban 20-, 30-, and 40-mg treatment groups, respectively, and in 9.9% of those receiving standard therapy. The main safety outcome occurred in 5.9%, 6.0%, and 2.2% of the rivaroxaban 20-, 30-, and 40-mg treatment groups, respectively, and in 8.8% of those receiving standard therapy. These results with simple fixed-dose oral regimens justify phase 3 evaluations (www. ClinicalTrials.gov no.NCT00395772).

Key messages

- doses of 40 mg QD and 30 mg BID enoxaparin yield sub-therapeutic levels of anti-Xa in critically ill patients.

- a dose of 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin is more likely to achieve a target anti-Xa range of 0.1 to 0.4 U/ml.

- thromboprophylactic studies with clinical endpoints should be vigorously pursued.

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^116cnEcC]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower-extremity DVT thrombolysis — prevention of bleeding emphasizes technical access, dose limits, and monitoring. It should be confirmed that venous access was routinely obtained with US guidance and a micropuncture needle, and the popliteal vein may be used as the preferred access site. When recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is used, weight-based dosing at 0.01 mg/kg/h (not to exceed 1.0 mg/h) is recommended. Monitoring should include blood draws for hematocrit, platelet count, and PTT at least every 12 hours, and serial fibrinogen monitoring during CDT may help to prevent complications. It should be confirmed that arterial punctures and intramuscular injections did not occur during thrombolysis, and that thrombolytic progress was assessed by venography at least every 24 hours. For unfractionated heparin, subtherapeutic dosing — 1.2–1.7 times the control PTT — was reasonably effective and safe in one randomized trial, and low molecular weight heparin at twice-daily, weight-based, FDA-approved dosing may also be a safe method during CDT/PCDT though data are limited. One small study suggests argatroban may also be safe, but heparin-based therapy should be preferred in patients without contraindications until larger studies are available.

### Algorithm for subcutaneous heparin treatment of DVT… [^11437bW7]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities are usually treated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin followed by long-term oral anticoagulation. Nomograms may help to determine the rate of intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin that ensures prompt, adequate anticoagulation. Subcutaneous heparin has been shown to be as effective and safe as intravenous heparin. Prandoni and associates devised a weight-based algorithm for subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin following administration of an intravenous loading dose. Seventy symptomatic outpatients with a first episode of proximal venous thrombosis were given an intravenous bolus of sodium heparin and a subcutaneous injection of calcium heparin in dosages adjusted according to body weight.

The activated partial thromboplastin time was first measured after six hours, and subsequent dosage adjustments during the first 48 hours were scheduled according to the algorithm. The aPTT was performed in the mid-interval. After the first 48 hours, heparin administration was managed on the basis of daily aPTT determinations. Therapy was discontinued if the International Normalized Ratio was greater than 2 for two consecutive days in patients who had received heparin for at least five days and who started sodium warfarin therapy on the first or second day. Therapy with sodium warfarin was continued for 12 weeks, and patients were followed after one and three months. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Proper anticoagulation was achieved in 87 percent of patients within 24 hours and in 99 percent of patients within 48 hours.

None of the patients had major bleeding or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism recurred in only three patients. The mean daily amount of heparin required to prolong the aPTT during the first 24 hours was greater than the dosage usually required with intravenous heparin administration. The authors conclude that the use of a weight-based algorithm for the subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin may simplify the initial treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders. This regimen allows early patient mobilization and early discharge of appropriate patients. This approach is significantly less expensive than similar treatment with low-molecular-weight heparins.

### Once versus twice daily LMWH for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^115tkhzT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered once or twice daily. A once daily treatment regimen is more convenient for the patient and may optimise home treatment. However, it is not clear whether a once daily treatment regimen is as safe and effective as a twice daily treatment regimen.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of once daily versus twice daily administration of LMWH.

Search Strategy

We identified trials through searching the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (last searched April 2005), the Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (last searched Issue 2, 2005), handsearches of relevant journals, checking cross-references and through personal communication with experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials in which LMWH given once daily is compared to LMWH given twice daily for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Five studies were included with a total of 1508 participants. The pooled data showed a statistically non-significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism between the two treatment regimens (OR 0.82, 0.49 to 1.39). A comparison of major haemorrhagic events (OR 0.77, 0.40 to 1.45) and mortality (OR 1.14, 0.62 to 2.08) also showed a statistically non-significant difference between the two treatment regimens.

Authors' Conclusions

Once daily treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as twice daily treatment with LMWH. However, the 95% confidence interval implies that there is a possibility that the risk of recurrent VTE might be higher when people are treated once daily. Hence, the decision to treat a person with a once daily regimen will depend on the evaluated balance between increased convenience and the potential for a lower efficacy.

### Medical indications and considerations for future clinical decision making [^116oD7X2]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

There are many well-known drawbacks associated with the currently used antithrombotic agents, warfarin, heparin, and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). Because heparins can be administered only parenterally, their application is limited. Though warfarin can be administered orally, its unpredictable anticoagulant effect means that it must be regularly monitored. Ximelagatran (Exanta, AstraZeneca) is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor (oral DTI) that is rapidly converted to its active form, melagatran, upon administration. The antithrombotic effects of melagatran have been demonstrated. Following the oral administration of ximelagatran, melagatran has stable and reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that enable ximelagatran to be administered orally, twice daily, according to a fixed-dose regimen, with no need for routine coagulation monitoring. In view of its favourable profile, a clinical trial programme has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ximelagatran compared with standard therapies, for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with previous acute coronary syndromes. These studies show that oral ximelagatran is well tolerated at doses of up to 60 mg, twice daily (bid), and that it is as effective as standard therapy for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, for the treatment of clinically verified acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and in patients with nonvalvular AF who have a moderate to high risk of stroke. The protocols and results of some of these studies — and a study that investigates the use of ximelagatran in combination with aspirin for the management of acute coronary artery disease — are described in this paper.

### The second American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine evidence-based medicine assessment of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia: executive summary [^115R2gVn]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Updated ASRA recommendations for SC UFH and neuraxial techniques — prior statement and current emphasis on timing: The 2010 statement suggested that in patients receiving prophylaxis with SC UFH with dosing regimens of 5000 U BID, there is no contraindication to the use of neuraxial techniques; the risk of neuraxial bleeding may be reduced by delaying heparin injection until after the block and may be increased in debilitated patients after prolonged therapy; and in patients receiving doses greater than 10,000 U of UFH daily or more than BID dosing of UFH, we suggest that neuraxial block be avoided (grade 2C). The new guideline acknowledges the use of 5000 U TID and suggests that the timing of needle placement and catheter removal — regardless of BID or TID dosing — coincide with lower levels of anticoagulant activity, noting that a SC 5000-U dose of UFH results in an anticoagulant effect 1 hour after administration that persists 4 to 6 hours, hence the 4- to 6-hour delay after administration for needle placement.

### Treatment of DVT… [^115G5JMS]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of DVT The goals of treatment for DVT are to stop clot propagation and prevent clot recurrence, PE, and pulmonary hypertension. These goals usually are achieved with anticoagulation using heparin followed by warfarin. Despite some controversy about the need to treat isolated calf-vein DVT, a recent evidence-based guideline on antithrombotic therapy recommends at least six to 12 weeks of anticoagulation. UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN Treatment with unfractionated heparin is based on body weight, and the dosage is titrated based on the APTT. An APTT of 1. 5 to
2. 3 times control is desirable. 6 Weight-based heparin dosing and adjustments based on the APTT are provided in Table 2. 6 This approach to heparin therapy has been shown to achieve adequate anticoagulation quickly and safely.

LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN Compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin offers distinct advantages: it has a longer biologic half-life, it can be administered subcutaneously once or twice daily, dosing is fixed, and laboratory monitoring is not required. In addition, some adverse effects of unfractionated heparin, such as thrombocytopenia, appear to be less likely. In patients with DVT, subcutaneous administration of heparin is at least as effective as continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin in preventing complications and reducing the risk of recurrence. 9 Outpatient management of DVT using LMW heparin for short-term anticoagulation until warfarin is at a therapeutic level is safe and cost-effective, despite the higher cost of the heparin. Promising results have been shown for a protocol in which warfarin is initiated in a dosage of 10 mg per day.

16 In one study, 16 consecutive outpatients being treated with LMW heparin for DVT or PE were randomized to a 5-mg or 10-mg warfarin protocol. An INR higher than 1. 9 was achieved an average of

1. 4 days sooner in the patients who received warfarin according to the 10-mg protocol. Clot recurrence, bleeding events, and morbidity did not differ in the two treatment groups.

Oral Anticoagulants and Treatment of VTD

Before the emergence of new oral anticoagulants, the approved initial anticoagulant therapy for DVT and pulmonary embolism included intravenous unfractionated heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux with a transition to warfarin or other VKA. Multiple trials have assessed the efficacy of the new anticoagulants in the acute treatment of VTE (Table 5). At present, rivaroxaban is the only drug that is approved for treatment in acute DVT and pulmonary embolism based on results from the EINSTEIN DVT (Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Rivaroxaban in Patients With Acute Symptomatic Deep Vein Thrombosis) and EINSTEIN PE (Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Rivaroxaban in Patients With Acute Symptomatic Deep Vein Thrombosis) randomized clinical trials. With the primary end point being recurrence of VTE at 3, 6, and 12 months, investigators from EINSTEIN DVT report event rates for rivaroxaban and VKA of 2.1% versus 3.0%, respectively (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.04; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Similarly, in EINSTEIN PE, rivaroxaban also met noninferiority compared with VKA (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.68; P = 0.003 for noninferiority). Rivaroxaban was not associated with an increased risk for major bleeding in either trial. It is important to highlight the treatment doses of rivaroxaban for acute treatment of VTE: 15 mg twice daily for the initial 3 weeks followed by a 20‐mg once‐daily maintenance dose. The extension study of EINSTEIN DVT also reported noninferiority of rivaroxaban, but versus placebo, when assessed for efficacy and safety outcomes at 12‐month follow‐up. –

### Pharmacology of low molecular weight heparins [^1137UzMe]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Although intravenous heparin has been the treatment of choice for acute VTE disease, LMWHs are gaining wider recognition and support as not only a new option but also as the standard of care. Each LMWH is viewed as a unique drug by regulatory agencies because of their differing physical and pharmacokinetic attributes. LMWHs have high absorption, high bioavailability, and long half-lives enabling once- or twice-daily dosing with predictable dose-response relationships. These factors enable the LMWHs to be used without laboratory monitoring and at home for acute DVT management. Studies continue to show that LMWH preparations are as at least as effective as heparin in a variety of settings, including VTE disease prophylaxis, management of acute VTE disease, unstable angina, and NSTEMI. They are at least as safe as heparin relative to hemorrhagic complications. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is less of a problem with LMWHs. Use of LMWHs has resulted in cost benefits in the treatment of acute DVT, unstable angina, and NSTEMI as well as in prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. Emergency physicians, because of their unique position at the forefront of acute care, will soon regularly use LMWHs.

### Once versus twice daily LMWH for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^115NmjfQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered once or twice daily. A once daily treatment regimen is more convenient for the patient and may optimise home treatment. However it is not clear whether a once daily treatment regimen is as safe and effective as a twice daily treatment regimen.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of once daily administration to a twice daily administration of LMWH.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified through the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (last searched May 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR/CENTRAL) (last searched Issue 1, 2002), by hand-searching other relevant journals, by checking cross-references and through personal communication with experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials in which a once daily treatment regimen with LMWH is compared to a twice daily regimen in the initial treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trials on criteria for inclusion and extracted the data independently.

Main Results

Five studies were included with a total of 1508 patients. The pooled data showed a statistically non-significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism between the two treatment regimens (OR 0.82; 0.49–1.39). A comparison of major haemorrhagic events (OR 0.77; 0.40–1.45) and mortality (OR 1.14; 0.62–2.08) also showed a statistically non-significant difference between the two treatment regimens.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Once daily treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as twice daily treatment with LMWH. However, the 95% confidence interval implies that there is a possibility that the risk of recurrent VTE might be higher when patients are treated once daily. Hence the decision to treat the patient with a once daily regimen will depend on the evaluated balance between increased convenience and the potential for a lower efficacy.

Intravenous UFH dosing strategies and monitoring — five RCTs compared initial IV UFH dosing according to a weight-based nomogram with a fixed-dose approach; in the remaining three RCTs a total of 292 patients were randomized, study follow-up periods ranged from 48 h to 3 months, and the two weight-based and fixed-dose approaches achieved similar therapeutic aPTTs during the first 24 to 48 h. Event data included "vs two (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02–1.13) in the fixed-dose vs weight-adjusted group and only one major bleed (fixed-dose group)", and "These results suggest that weight-adjusted dosing and fixed dosing of IV UFH are similar in outcomes", though "Small numbers of clinical events and failure to specify the timing of thromboembolic complications are major limitations of available studies". Either regimen can be monitored with plasma heparin levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring improves clinical outcomes, and "The evidence linking plasma heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 International Units/mL anti-Xa activity by the amidolytic assay to the occurrence of either bleeding or thrombosis is also of low quality".

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

CHEST 2016 VTE guideline — first unprovoked proximal DVT of the leg or PE guides duration by bleeding risk: For low or moderate bleeding risk, we suggest extended anticoagulant therapy (no scheduled stop date) over 3 months of therapy (Grade 2B); for high bleeding risk, we recommend 3 months of anticoagulant therapy over extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (Grade 1B). Patient sex and D-dimer measured a month after stopping may influence stop vs extend decisions, and in all who receive extended therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (eg, annually).

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^113qHzqs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. The new drugs have characteristics that may be favourable over conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or re-dosing and few known drug interactions. To date, no Cochrane review has measured the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of DVT.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (last searched January 2015). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies and the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which people with a DVT confirmed by standard imaging techniques, were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the treatment of DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LR, JM) independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third review author (PK). We performed meta-analyses when we considered heterogeneity low. The two primary outcomes were recurrent VTE and PE. Other outcomes included all-cause mortality and major bleeding. We calculated all outcomes using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials of 27,945 participants. Three studies tested oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), while eight tested oral factor Xa inhibitors (four rivaroxaban, two apixaban and two edoxaban). We deemed all included studies to be of high methodological quality and low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was graded as high as the outcomes were direct and effect estimates were consistent and precise, as reflected in the narrow CIs around the ORs. Meta-analysis of three studies (7596 participants) comparing oral DTIs with standard anticoagulation groups showed no difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.49), recurrent DVT (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.58), fatal PE (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.27 to 3.70), non-fatal PE (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.90) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13). However, oral DTIs were associated with reduced bleeding (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98). Meta-analysis of eight studies (16,356 participants) comparing oral factor Xa inhibitors with standard anticoagulation demonstrated a similar rate of recurrent VTE between the two treatments (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07). Oral factor Xa inhibitors were associated with a lower rate of recurrent DVT (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98). However, this was a weak association, heavily dependent on one study. The rate of fatal (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.03), non-fatal PE (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.23) was similar between the two treatment groups. Oral factor Xa inhibitors were also associated with reduced bleeding (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.76). None of the included studies measured post-thrombotic syndrome or health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

NOACs such as DTIs and factor Xa inhibitors may be an effective and safe alternative to conventional anticoagulation treatment for acute DVT.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Lvtn5]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35–0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

Idraparinux — In a phase 2 dose-finding trial in proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 659 patients were randomized after a 5- to 7-day enoxaparin course to once-weekly subcutaneous idraparinux (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10 mg) or warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] of 2–3) for 12 weeks; major bleeding showed a dose-response with an unacceptably high frequency at 10 mg, and the lowest dose had less bleeding than warfarin (P = 0.029), leading to selection of 2.5 mg once weekly for further trials. In phase 3 Van Gogh trials, 2,904 DVT and 2,215 pulmonary embolism (PE) patients were randomized to idraparinux 2.5 mg weekly or conventional therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist with INR between 2 and 3; in DVT, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 3 months was 2.9% vs 3.0% and clinically relevant bleeding 4.5% vs 7.0% (P = 0.004) for idraparinux vs conventional therapy, while in PE, recurrent VTE was 3.4% vs 1.6% and clinically relevant bleeding 5.5% vs 8.2%. In the Van Gogh extension, 1,215 patients who completed 6 months of initial therapy were randomized to an additional 6 months of idraparinux vs placebo, with a 72.9% relative reduction in recurrent VTE (P = 0.002) compared with placebo.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111SxyZo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

Heparin selection and monitoring in critically ill COVID-19 with proximal DVT or PE — Unfractionated heparin has an unpredictable dose response and a narrow therapeutic window; therefore, monitoring is essential to ensure optimal efficacy and safety, whereas body weight-adjusted doses of LMWH or fondaparinux can be administered subcutaneously without laboratory monitoring in the majority of these patients. UFH, not LMWH, can be affected by heparin resistance (including when the aPTT does not reflect the anti-Xa effect) and this may delay attainment of therapeutic levels; based on this, and to avoid risk of exposure for staff, we suggest that LMWH or fondaparinux be used over UFH in critically ill COVID-19 patients with proximal DVT or PE. UFH might be preferred over LMWH or fondaparinux in patients at high bleeding risk (including those with severe renal failure [creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min]) or with overt or imminent hemodynamic decompensation due to PE, and patients with VTE in the setting of COVID-19 are considered to have a provoking factor, and thus initial treatment should be for at least 3 months.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline… [^1167MBZy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the latest recommendations for anti-thrombotic therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism. Bottom Line The guideline covers a lot of ground. Key updates include a clear preference for direct oral anti-coagulants, including in patients with cancer, and low-dose apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended-phase anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE. There is greater leeway for observation only of selected patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism or isolated distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and outpatient treatment of selected patients with PE. Synopsis The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others.

The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. A direct oral anticoagulant is recommended as first-line therapy. An exception should be made for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, for whom warfarin is recommended during the treatment phase. For patients with cancer, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are recommended over low-molecular-weight heparin for treatment of VTE. The authors make a weak recommendation for 45 days of fondaparinux, 2. 5 mg daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg daily, for patients with superficial venous thrombosis of the lower leg.

Extended-phase low-dose anticoagulation with apixaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, is recommended for all patients with unprovoked VTE. This has only been studied for two to four years, so extending anticoagulation beyond that is of uncertain benefit. Aspirin is recommended when patients discontinue extended-phase anticoagulation.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111tAEoa]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

CHEST guideline update — COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients provides separate guidance statements for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention for hospitalized patients with acute (moderate) illness and critically ill patients in the ICU, and divides each original question and resulting recommendation into two questions: standard prophylaxis vs therapeutic (or escalated dose) prophylaxis and standard prophylaxis vs intermediate dose prophylaxis. Critically ill patients should receive standard thromboprophylaxis for VTE, moderately ill patients with a low bleeding risk might benefit from therapeutic heparin, and "We see no role for intermediate dose thromboprophylaxis in either setting". This update led to a change in one recommendation and an upgrading of three additional recommendations based upon higher quality evidence.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Fixed-dose versus adjusted-dose low molecular weight heparin for the initial treatment of patients with deep venous thrombosis [^116reXdA]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were treated with a body-weight independent dosage of 2 x 8000 aXa IU low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Certoparin. After the subcutaneous administration of 8000 IU Certoparin, pharmacodynamic parameters did not differ between patients and healthy volunteers, and the AUC of the anticoagulant effects were not related to body weight. Two clinical trials demonstrated a greater regression of thrombi and a lower occurrence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), major bleeding, and mortality within 14 days of initial therapy compared with intravenous heparin. D-dimer decreased, and anti-Xa activity increased in those patients with a regression of thrombosis. The benefit of the reduced occurrence of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality was maintained up to 6 months. Major bleeding was not related to the body weight in either treatment group. Treatment of acute DVT in adults with fixed dose of 2 x 8000 aXa IU LMWH Certoparin is more effective and safer than heparin.

### Pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^115iv1JQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is based on antithrombotic therapy, initially with parenteral administration of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for five to seven days, then subsequent long-term therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). Pentasaccharides are novel anticoagulants that may be favourable over standard therapy due to their predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a harmful effect of heparins, appears to be rare during treatment with pentasaccharides.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and harms of pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (22 March 2017) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2) (searched 22 March 2017). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies and the reference lists of relevant articles for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which people 18 years of age or older with a DVT confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux, idraparinux, or idrabiotaparinux) for the treatment of DVT in comparison with standard therapy or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data characterising the included trials according to the methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and employed the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of the evidence. The main primary outcome for efficacy was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the main primary outcome for harm was major and clinically relevant bleeding. Since our outcomes were dichotomous, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined the effects of different comparisons through a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials of 6981 participants comparing pentasaccharides with standard therapy or other pentasaccharides. The quality of the evidence varied depending on the outcome and was judged as of moderate to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to risk of bias or imprecision, or both. Two studies evaluated fondaparinux, at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg, plus vitamin K antagonist in comparison with standard therapy. A meta-analysis of these two studies showed no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.47; 2658 participants); moderate-quality evidence. The frequencies of major bleeding were similar between interventions in the initial period of treatment (approximately five days) (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.44; 2645 participants) and at three months' follow-up (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; 2645 participants). We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate. One study (757 participants) compared idrabiotaparinux (3.0 mg) with idraparinux (2.5 mg) and demonstrated no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at six months' follow-up (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at six-month follow-up was less frequent in participants receiving idrabiotaparinux versus participants treated with idraparinux (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71); low-quality evidence. The effect of an initial treatment with LMWH followed by three months of idraparinux (10 mg) showed no clear difference from standard therapy for risk of recurrent VTE (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.90; 263 participants); very low-quality evidence; one study. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. The frequency of major and other clinically relevant bleeding at three months' follow-up ranged from 2% to 15% in participants receiving LMWH and increasing doses of idraparinux of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg. When dosage groups were combined, there was no clear difference in major plus other clinically relevant bleeding or in major bleeding alone between the idraparinux treatment group and the standard therapy group (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.40; 659 participants; RR 3.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 28.19; 659 participants, respectively); very low-quality evidence. One study (2904 participants) compared idraparinux (2.5 mg) to standard therapy. There was no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at three months' follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.48); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at three months of follow-up appeared to be similar in the idraparinux group and the standard therapy group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.47); very low-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that the effects of fondaparinux at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg plus vitamin K antagonist are similar in terms of recurrent VTE and risk of major bleeding compared with standard treatment for DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests equal efficacy of idraparinux at 2.5 mg and the equimolar dose of 3.0 mg of idrabiotaparinux with regard to recurrent VTE, but a higher frequency of major bleeding was observed in participants treated with idraparinux. We judged evidence on the effectiveness of idraparinux compared with standard therapy, with or without initial treatment with LMWH, and on associated bleeding risk to be low to very low quality, therefore we have very limited confidence in the estimated effects. The observed similar effectiveness in terms of recurrent DVT and harmful effects in terms of bleeding risk with fondaparinux plus vitamin K antagonist compared to standard treatment for DVT suggest that it may be an alternative to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of DVT in certain circumstances.

Results

Study characteristics

Our search identified 1781 studies of interest, after removal of duplicates (fig 1). Most studies were eliminated during screening as the indication for anticoagulation was not acute venous thromboembolism. After we reviewed 20 full text articles, nine studies with over 16 000 patients were suitable for data extraction and pooled analysis. The trials evaluated two factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban (four randomised controlled trials, n = 8709) and apixaban (one trial, n = 258)) and two direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran (two trials, n = 5107) and ximelagatran (two trials, n = 2627)). Four studies were phase II dose finding studies and five were phase III studies powered for non-inferiority against vitamin K antagonists. The length of follow-up ranged from two weeks to 12 months.

Fig 1 Flow diagram of search strategy for studies of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism

Rivaroxaban

Two small phase II studies (EINSTEIN-Dose and ODIXa) looked at rivaroxaban in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and were primarily concerned with imaging endpoints, though the endpoints of interest for our study were also reported. The main phase III studies were performed by the EINSTEIN investigators in a pair of open label non-inferiority studies. The EINSTEIN-DVT study enrolled 3449 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and excluded patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism. The EINSTEIN-PE study recruited 4832 patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism with or without symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. After the phase II studies, the EINSTEIN investigators chose to load rivaroxaban at 15 mg twice a day for two weeks followed 20 mg four times a day for the remainder of the study. The rivaroxaban patients typically received one to two doses of low molecular weight heparin before starting rivaroxaban, whereas the patients randomised to vitamin K antagonists received low molecular weight heparin concurrently for five days or more, until the target international normalised ratio was achieved.

Apixaban

A single published phase II study (Botticelli study) looked at apixaban in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis. This formed the basis for an ongoing clinical trial of apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (NCT00643201). In a similar design to the rivaroxaban studies, the patients in the apixaban arm did not receive a full course of low molecular weight heparin.

### Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism [^117PE35D]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

When unfractionated heparin is used to treat acute venous thromboembolism, it is usually given by intravenous infusion with dose adjustment in response to activated partial thromboplastin time measurements. These two requirements are a barrier to treatment of venous thromboembolism with unfractionated heparin, and it is uncertain if they are necessary.

Recent Findings

Two recent studies compared subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, each given twice-daily, for the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. The Galilei study used an initial dose of unfractionated heparin that was partially weight-adjusted, with subsequent dosing based on activated partial thromboplastin time results. The FIDO study treated patients with a first dose of unfractionated heparin of 333 IU/kg, followed by 250 IU/kg twice-daily without dose adjustment in response to the activated partial thromboplastin time or other coagulation tests. There was no difference in either study between the unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin groups at the end of 3 months, for recurrent venous thromboembolism (Galilei: 4.2 vs. 3.9%; relative risk (RR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 2.2. FIDO: 3.8 vs. 3.4%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.3) or major bleeding (Galilei: 1.4 vs. 1.9%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.2. FIDO: 1.7 vs. 3.4%; RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.3).

Summary

Recent studies suggest that twice-daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is as effective and safe as low-molecular-weight heparin for the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism, and that adjustment of unfractionated heparin dose in response to activated partial thromboplastin time measurements is not necessary with a weight-adjusted dose of unfractionated heparin.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111vmyRe]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline for first venous thromboembolism (VTE) that is an unprovoked proximal DVT of the leg or PE — among patients with (i) low or moderate bleeding risk, we suggest extended anticoagulant therapy (no scheduled stop date) over 3 months of therapy (Grade 2B), and (ii) high bleeding risk, we recommend 3 months of anticoagulant therapy over extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (Grade 1B). Patient sex and D-dimer level measured a month after stopping anticoagulant therapy may influence the decision to stop or extend therapy, and in all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (eg, annually).

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^114mnCwu]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Alterations from standard venous thromboembolism anticoagulation regimens to prevent thrombotic complications

None of the major societies recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for prevention of thrombotic complications. Only the ACF recommends increasing the intensity of anticoagulation in critically ill patients (enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or heparin 7500 unit/dose three times daily) while they recommend standard dose anticoagulant prophylaxis for all other hospitalized non-critically ill patients. The SCC-ISTH mentions that intermediate LMWH dosing can be considered in high risk critically ill patients (50% of respondents) and may be considered in non-critically ill hospitalized patients (30% of respondents). The SCC-ISTH also specifically mentions that the anticoagulation regimens may be modified based on extremes of body weight (50% increase in dose if obese), severe thrombocytopenia, or worsening renal function. The ACC mentions that while there is insufficient data to consider routine intermediate or therapeutic dosing, a minority of their panel considers an intermediate intensity (31.6%; i.e. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/day, enoxaparin 40 mg BID, UFH with target PTT 50–70) or therapeutic anticoagulation (5.2%) reasonable. The CDC recommends that any changes in anticoagulation regimens that are different than the current standard of care for patients without COVID-19 should only be administered in the setting of a clinical trial.

Fondaparinux — Dose management by weight: For patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and body weight over 100 kg, we suggest that the treatment dose of fondaparinux be increased from the usual 7.5 mg to 10 mg daily subcutaneously (Grade 2C). Randomized trials used total body weight–adjusted doses — 5.0, 7.5, or 10 mg in patients weighing < 50, 50–100, or > 100 kg, respectively — and a subgroup analysis reported VTE in 75 of 1,946 (3.9%) nonobese patients vs 10 of 251 (4%) obese patients, with major bleeds in 25 of 1,993 (1.3%) nonobese patients vs in one of 248 (0.4%) in obese patients. There are insufficient data on patients with low body weight to make any recommendation or suggestion regarding dose adjustment for these patients.

### Characterization of apixaban pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics and dose assessment in pediatric patients with congenital or acquired heart disease [^115Gm8iM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with congenital or acquired heart disease (CAHD) are at risk of clinically significant thrombosis, including intracardiac, intravascular, and coronary thromboses; thrombosis of surgically placed shunts; and thromboembolic stroke. Thrombosis complications are increasingly recognized as important factors contributing to the morbidity and mortality in these patient populations. Despite a better understanding of the risk factors associated with thrombosis in children with CAHD, there are sparse data regarding optimal strategies for the prevention, detection, and management of thrombosis in pediatric heart disease. Many standard drugs (eg, warfarin, low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH], and heparin) are often used off label, and may be associated with unwanted adverse effects (potential decrease in bone mineral density and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia,) and require either parenteral administration or therapeutic monitoring. With the advent of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, there exists an opportunity to improve the prevention and management of thrombosis in children with CAHD.

Apixaban is an oral direct inhibitor of FXa approved in adults for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after knee and hip replacement surgery, stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent VTE following twice daily (BID) dosing. Apixaban has also recently been approved in Europe for the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in children aged ≥ 28 days to < 18 years. Apixaban pharmacokinetics (PK) are well characterized, with low inter‐patient variability. Apixaban does not require monitoring of coagulation markers and can be administered without regard to food, drugs, or botanical products. Thus, apixaban could be a new option as a pediatric‐friendly anticoagulant for the prevention of thromboembolism in children with CAHD.

Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) initial regimen — for patients starting IV UFH, we suggest that the initial bolus and the initial rate of the continuous infusion be weight adjusted (bolus 80 units/kg followed by 18 units/kg per h for VTE; bolus 70 units/kg followed by 15 units/kg per h for cardiac or stroke patients) or a fixed-dose (bolus 5,000 units followed by 1,000 units/h) rather than alternative regimens (Grade 2C).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112vn2YQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

American Society of Hematology guidelines — pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) key points: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complicates ∼1.2 of every 1000 deliveries, and the panel agreed on 31 recommendations spanning treatment of VTE and superficial vein thrombosis, diagnosis of VTE, and thrombosis prophylaxis. The guideline states a strong recommendation for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin for acute VTE. Most recommendations were conditional, including those for either twice-per-day or once-per-day LMWH dosing for the treatment of acute VTE and initial outpatient therapy over hospital admission with low-risk acute VTE, as well as against routine anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring to guide dosing with LMWH for VTE treatment. The panel also made a strong recommendation (low certainty in evidence) for antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with a history of unprovoked or hormonally associated VTE and a conditional recommendation against antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with prior VTE associated with a resolved nonhormonal provoking risk factor.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113Sm1Za]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and anti-Xa targets — coagulation monitoring is not generally necessary, though some authorities suggest monitoring in obese patients and in those with renal insufficiency, and monitoring may also be advisable when treatment doses are given during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial comparing monitored and unmonitored dalteparin therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed no benefit of monitoring; monitoring is thus not recommended for the majority of patients, and if monitoring is required, the anti-Xa level is the recommended test. For treatment of VTE, a conservative peak anti-Xa level with twice-daily enoxaparin or nadroparin is 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, and the target range for peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 h after dosing with once-daily enoxaparin is likely to be above 1.0 units/mL, whereas it is 0.85 units/mL with tinzaparin and 1.3 units/mL and 1.05 units/mL with nadroparin and dalteparin, respectively.

Non-heparin anticoagulants for treatment of acute HIT — fondaparinux and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) list dosing, elimination, and monitoring as follows: Fondaparinux is subcutaneous (SC) with renal elimination ("Renal (17–21 h)") and no routine laboratory monitoring ("None"), with weight-based once-daily dosing " ≤ 50 kg — 5 mg once per day", "50–100 kg — 7.5 mg once per day", and " > 100 kg — 10 mg once per day". Apixaban is oral (PO) with hepatic elimination ("Hepatic (8–15 h)") and "None" for laboratory monitoring; HIT with thrombosis (HITT) dosing is "10 mg twice per day x 1 week, then 5 mg twice per day", and isolated HIT dosing is "5 mg twice per day until platelet count recovery". Dabigatran is PO with renal elimination ("Renal (12–17 h)") and "None" for laboratory monitoring; dosing is "150 mg twice per day after ≥ 5 days of treatment with parenteral anticoagulant", and for isolated HIT "150 mg twice per day until platelet count recovery". Rivaroxaban is PO with renal elimination ("Renal (5–9 h)") and "None" for laboratory monitoring; HITT dosing is "15 mg twice per day x 3 weeks, then 20 mg once per day", and isolated HIT dosing is "15 mg twice per day until platelet count recovery".

Reevaluation of evidence — patient-important vs surrogate outcomes: Applying the ACCP-GRADE approach requires distinguishing patient-important from surrogate outcomes; for example, an intervention that increases serious bleeding by 20 events in 1,000 patients but reduces asymptomatic thrombosis by 100 in 1,000 leaves net benefit unclear without knowing the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism reductions. The authors highlight the need for studies that directly measure symptomatic thrombosis without venographic or ultrasound surveillance.

In a review that included 94 pediatric patients from 6 studies, the mean final enoxaparin dose had been reduced from 1 mg/kg twice daily to 0.84 mg/kg twice daily, and population models developed using fat-free mass have been proposed; these studies highlight the importance of more closely monitoring for drug accumulation in this subgroup of patients, and there is a lack of data to advise dosing of other LMWHs in children who are overweight/obese.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) monitoring — Therapeutic dosing is "usually monitored using the aPTT", and a retrospective study "suggested that an aPTT ratio between 1.5 and 2.5" led to wide acceptance of "a therapeutic aPTT range of 1.5 to 2.5 times control", yet assay responsiveness varies such that "aPTT results ranging from 48 to 108 s can be measured in samples with a heparin concentration of 0.3 units/mL", and with "heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 anti-Xa units/mL" aPTT ratios "range from 1.6–2.7 to 3.7–6.2 times control"; in the study establishing the range, an "aPTT ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 corresponded to a heparin level of 0.2 to 0.4 units" by protamine and "0.3 to 0.7 units" by anti-Xa, and interlaboratory studies "failed to show that correlating the aPTT with anti-Xa assays improves agreement"; for coronary indications the range "is unknown" but is "about 10% lower" than VTE treatment levels, and a randomized VTE trial showing unmonitored, weight‑adjusted high‑dose subcutaneous heparin twice daily was as safe and effective as unmonitored LMWH "challenge the requirement for aPTT monitoring of heparin administered subcutaneously".

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the medical patient: controversies and perspectives [^111NDS8A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized at-risk medical patients, the publication of large-scale studies showing that prophylaxis is effective in this patient group, and the presence of international guidelines, prophylaxis rates in medically ill patients remain suboptimal. Studies show that low-molecular-weight heparins, given once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin usually given thrice daily with equivalent or improved safety profiles, and that thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing. However, the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not distinguish between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Furthermore, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not established. Finally, there are few data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group and no established standard of care for prophylaxis of special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Even though prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, which can improve care and decrease overall costs.

In the context of COVID-19, another consideration is the frequency of dosing. Unfractionated heparin prophylaxis is often administered twice or thrice daily, whereas LMWH, especially enoxaparin, is dosed daily. International guidelines also state that once-daily regimens of LMWH may be advantageous over UFH because missed doses may be associated with worse outcomes, will reduce healthcare worker exposure, and conserve personal protective equipment.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either LMWH or UFH for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and moderate quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for VTE prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
4) Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of "enhanced" or "intermediate" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence).
5) In hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
6) If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with IPC devices or GCS for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).

How should clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19–related VTE be managed in LMICs?

Rationale.

Management of VTE requires timely diagnosis, knowledge of risk factors for both thrombosis and bleeding, safe administration of medications, and ability to monitor, when indicated. Clinical suspicion for PE should arise if a patient develops a sudden deterioration of oxygenation, respiratory distress, or hypotension disproportional to pulmonary involvement by COVID-19. According to COVID-19 clinical management guidelines from the WHO, NIH, and various societies, patients with suspected or confirmed VTE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as would be indicated in those without COVID-19. The optimal approach to managing VTE related to COVID-19 in LMICs remains unknown.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^112xokAm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately one in 1000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors, which have characteristics that may be favourable compared to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or dose adjustment and few known drug interactions. DOACs are now commonly being used for treating DVT: recent guidelines recommended DOACs over conventional anticoagulants for both DVT and PE treatment. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2015. It was the first systematic review to measure the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT. This is an update of the 2015 review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of DVT.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 1 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a DVT, confirmed by standard imaging techniques, were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor compared with conventional anticoagulation or compared with each other for the treatment of DVT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), recurrent DVT and PE. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, major bleeding, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and quality of life (QoL). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified 10 new studies with 2950 participants for this update. In total, we included 21 RCTs involving 30,895 participants. Three studies investigated oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), 17 investigated oral factor Xa inhibitors (eight rivaroxaban, five apixaban and four edoxaban) and one three-arm trial investigated both a DTI (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban). Overall, the studies were of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis comparing DTIs to conventional anticoagulation showed no clear difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.65; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.66; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.29 to 6.02; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.59; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; 1 study, 2489 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). DTIs reduced the rate of major bleeding (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; 3 studies, 5994 participants; high-certainty evidence). For oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation, meta-analysis demonstrated no clear difference in recurrent VTE (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 13 studies, 17,505 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; 9 studies, 16,439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.02; 6 studies, 15,082 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.27; 7 studies, 15,166 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14; 9 studies, 10,770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis showed a reduced rate of major bleeding with oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89; 17 studies, 18,066 participants; high-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current review suggests that DOACs may be superior to conventional therapy in terms of safety (major bleeding), and are probably equivalent in terms of efficacy. There is probably little or no difference between DOACs and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent VTE, recurrent DVT, pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality. DOACs reduced the rate of major bleeding compared to conventional anticoagulation. The certainty of evidence was moderate or high.

### Treatment of patients who have DVT with or without PE… [^116xzXKT]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has changed recently. Unfractionated heparin had been used to manage these venous thromboembolic disorders, but the introduction of low-molecular-weight heparin changed the way they are managed. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin has the advantage of convenient dosing and can be used as an outpatient therapy, which can lead to lower costs. In previous studies, low-molecular-weight heparin was found to be at least as safe and effective as unfractionated heparin for the initial management of DVT and PE. Most of the studies on this issue are based on managing DVT, and only a few studies have assessed this treatment strategy in patients with PE. Mismetti and colleagues evaluated low-molecular-weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of patients who have DVT with or without associated symptomatic PE.

The authors performed an individual patient data meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials comparing the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin with unfractionated heparin in the treatment of patients with DVT. To be included in the analysis, the studies had to be randomized properly; include patients with objectively diagnosed DVT with or without symptomatic PE; and use objective measures to confirm major outcomes, including recurrent symptomatic thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death at three months. Three trials met the inclusion criteria for the study. The number of patients enrolled in the combined studies was 749 in the enoxaparin group and 754 in the unfractionated heparin group. Sixteen percent of study participants were diagnosed with PE. When the authors compared the two groups, the relative risk of recurrent venous thrombosis was not significantly different.

The results were similar when comparing patients in the two treatment groups who did or did not have a symptomatic PE. With regard to safety, no significant differences existed between the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin groups, but a trend favoring enoxaparin for reduction in the rate of mortality and major bleeding was noted. The authors conclude that the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin is as safe and effective as unfractionated heparin in the initial treatment of patients who have DVT with or without PE.

### Anticoagulant treatment for isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111y9YB6]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that patients with IDDVT who are managed without anticoagulation have a higher risk of recurrent DVT, proximal progression of thrombosis, and PTS compared with patients receiving anticoagulant treatments. Long-term anticoagulation regimen (i.e. between 6 and 12 weeks) appears to be more effective than short-term treatment durations (i.e. up to 6 weeks). Furthermore, there is a trend towards a reduced risk of recurrent DVT in extended treatment (i.e. over 12 weeks) compared to long treatment duration. The incidence of recurrent DVT was higher in patients defined at high risk than in those defined at low risk and the benefit of anticoagulant treatment appeared to be greater in patients receiving either intermediate or therapeutic doses of anticoagulant agents as compared with patients receiving prophylactic doses. There were no differences in PE across groups of different treatment duration or dose. Globally, the incidence of major bleeding was low (ranging from 1% to 4%) and similar across the considered groups; moreover, the risk for major bleeding was lower in patients treated with anticoagulants. CRNMB rates were higher in patients at high risk for recurrent DVT and in those receiving long or extended treatment duration.
