## Question

A 12-year-old boy with a 2-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents for a routine follow-up. His mother reports that he has been snoring loudly at night, sometimes seems to stop breathing during sleep, and is often tired during the day. His BMI is at the 98th percentile for age. On review of systems, he denies chest pain or palpitations. Physical exam is notable for acanthosis nigricans and mild tonsillar hypertrophy. You are the pediatrician seeing him in clinic.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's possible sleep disorder?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most appropriate next step is for a 12-year-old with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, including loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime sleepiness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability of OSA given his risk factors and symptoms. Then, I should verify what current pediatric diabetes guidelines recommend for screening and referral. Next, I will review pediatric sleep guidelines to confirm the diagnostic gold standard and whether home testing is appropriate. Finally, I will consider alternatives if polysomnography is not immediately available and outline the downstream management implications once OSA is confirmed or excluded.

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability. A 12-year-old with severe obesity (BMI 98th percentile), type 2 diabetes, and classic OSA symptoms (loud snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness) has a very high likelihood of OSA, and obesity is a major risk factor in pediatrics, with OSA prevalence far higher in youth with obesity and diabetes than in the general pediatric population [^113Nvac3] [^1159pC7v].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline direction before jumping to testing. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 explicitly recommends screening for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea at every visit in youth with type 2 diabetes and, if indicated, referring to a pediatric sleep specialist for evaluation and polysomnography; if OSA is documented, it should be treated, which aligns with a high-credibility, guideline-based pathway here [^114TBAFK] [^1135aCpX] [^115HrDaN].

> I should confirm the diagnostic standard. Polysomnography remains the gold standard for diagnosing pediatric OSA and is the test of choice when symptoms and risk factors are present; home sleep apnea testing is not validated for children and should not be substituted for in-lab PSG in this scenario, so referral for PSG is the correct next step rather than home testing or empiric treatment [^113Nvac3].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any pediatric sleep guidance suggests alternatives when access is limited. The British Thoracic Society pediatric guidance emphasizes that oximetry or simplified cardiorespiratory studies can miss disease and should not be used to exclude OSA when suspicion is high; if PSG is not immediately available, clinicians may consider interim supportive measures, but definitive diagnosis still requires PSG, reinforcing that referral for PSG is the most appropriate next step here [^111uofcd] [^113Nvac3].

> Let me consider the downstream implications to ensure the plan is complete. If OSA is confirmed, treatment with CPAP is recommended and has been associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity and inflammatory markers in some pediatric studies, while weight management remains foundational; this integrates both sleep-specific therapy and metabolic care that will be coordinated by the sleep specialist and the diabetes team [^113Nvac3] [^1135Gu7d].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to refer to a pediatric sleep specialist for evaluation and diagnostic polysomnography, given his high pretest probability and the ADA's directive to screen and refer youth with T2D who have suggestive symptoms. I should document the classic OSA features and the diabetes/obesity risk profile in the referral to expedite timely testing and treatment [^114TBAFK] [^1135aCpX] [^113Nvac3].

The most appropriate next step is to **refer to pediatric sleep medicine for polysomnography** [^114TBAFK] because the patient has classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^115Z7gPe] and is at high risk due to obesity and type 2 diabetes [^1159pC7v]. Current guidelines recommend screening for OSA at each visit in youth with type 2 diabetes and referring for diagnostic polysomnography when symptoms are present [^1135aCpX] [^115HrDaN]. Early diagnosis and treatment of OSA can improve glycemic control, blood pressure, and quality of life [^1159pC7v] [^113Nvac3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting OSA screening in pediatric T2DM

- **Prevalence**: OSA is common in youth with T2DM, with 38.6% in the TODAY cohort, and is strongly linked to obesity and insulin resistance [^115maLbt] [^113Nvac3].
- **Glycemic impact**: OSA worsens insulin resistance and glycemic control, increasing cardiovascular risk [^1143mvvS] [^1159pC7v].
- **Guideline support**: ADA 2025 recommends screening for OSA at each visit in youth with T2DM and referring for polysomnography when indicated [^114TBAFK] [^1135aCpX].

---

## Recommended screening tools and diagnostic approach

- **Screening**: Use a focused history (snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, nocturnal enuresis, morning headaches) and exam (tonsillar hypertrophy, adenoid facies, micrognathia, high-arched palate) [^115Z7gPe] [^111CgT84].
- **Diagnosis**: Polysomnography is the gold standard; an AHI > 5/hour confirms pediatric OSA [^113Nvac3] [^116CFHVP].
- **Alternatives**: Home sleep apnea testing is not validated in children; oximetry alone is insufficient and should not be used to exclude OSA [^111uofcd].

---

## Consequences of untreated OSA in pediatric T2DM

Untreated OSA in youth with T2DM is associated with:

- **Worse glycemic control**: Higher HbA1c and insulin resistance [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction [^notfound].
- **Quality of life**: Fatigue, neurocognitive impairment, and mood disturbance [^1159pC7v].

---

## Benefits of treating OSA in pediatric T2DM

Treating OSA (CPAP, weight loss, tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy) can improve:

- **Glycemic control**: Lower HbA1c and improved insulin sensitivity [^113Nvac3].
- **Blood pressure**: Reduced nocturnal blood pressure and improved circadian rhythm [^1159pC7v].
- **Quality of life**: Less daytime sleepiness, better cognition, and mood [^1159pC7v].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Screen for OSA symptoms at each visit in youth with T2DM [^114TBAFK] [^1135aCpX] |
| 2 | Refer to pediatric sleep medicine for polysomnography if symptoms are present [^114TBAFK] [^1135aCpX] |
| 3 | Treat confirmed OSA with CPAP, weight management, and surgery when indicated [^1159pC7v] [^1135Gu7d] |
| 4 | Monitor glycemic control, blood pressure, and quality of life after treatment [^1159pC7v] |

---

The most appropriate next step is to **refer to pediatric sleep medicine for polysomnography** [^114TBAFK] given the high risk of OSA in this patient and the potential benefits of treatment on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk [^1159pC7v].

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of upper-airway obstruction which result in intermittent hypoxemia and transient arousals leading to sleep fragmentation and poor sleep quality. Sleep disturbance and OSA are increasingly recognised as being associated with obesity, insulin resistance in adults and children and type 2 diabetes in adults. Additionally, it is a risk factor for future cardiovascular disease.

Obesity, male sex, and advancing age are the strongest risk factors for OSA. It affects an estimated 1–2% of normal children and is more common in obese youth.

Evaluate symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea using questions about snoring, apnoea, nocturia, enuresis, sleep quality, morning headaches and daytime sleepiness at every visit after diagnosis. Questionnaires alone do not provide a high enough sensitivity or specificity and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion.

The gold standard diagnostic test is overnight laboratory polysomnography, which quantifies episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea, with an apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) of > 5 being diagnostic. Treatment with continuous airway pressure has been associated with improvement in the glycaemic profile, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity and inflammation in some studies.

### Advances in the management of type 2 diabetes in adults [^115svLZ3]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The length and quality of sleep are increasingly recognised as essential components of the management of diabetes and individuals should be screened for sleep related disorders. Referral for diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea and other sleep disorders should be considered if indicated. Screening for psychosocial factors and social determinants of health that might affect an individual's diabetes care and quality of life should also be performed, with engagement of or referral to relevant clinical team members for further evaluation and care, as appropriate.

Lifestyle interventions in individuals with obesity or who are overweight are most successful when efforts are intensive and frequent follow-up is available, either in person or virtually. Weight loss can be achieved in various ways, and is most effective when strategies are combined: caloric restriction, increased caloric expenditure, elimination or substitution of drugs that promote weight gain, use of weight reducing drugs and, in select individuals, metabolic or bariatric surgery. One dietary strategy that has received considerable attention in recent years is time restricted eating, although data in adults with type 2 diabetes are limited to one randomised controlled trialand a larger trial is ongoing (n = 344; Using Early Time Restricted Feeding and Timed Light Therapy to Improve Glycemic Control in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes, NCT04155619). Weight management is discussed in more detail below.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose… [^111dF1SG]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major health problem that is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Diabetes can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle interventions. 1–3 Information that has been learned about the natural history and pathogenesis of diabetes indicates that this disease has a prolonged prediabetic phase. 4 Consequently, family physicians have an opportunity to identify patients at high risk for developing diabetes and institute primary prevention strategies. Patients with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose are at significant risk for diabetes. Definitions and Epidemiology An expert committee sponsored by the American Diabetes Association has identified an intermediate group of patients who have blood glucose values that are higher than the defined normal level but not high enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes. 6 the risk of developing diabetes was found to be approximately 3. 6 to
8.

7 percent per year in patients with IGT. Elevated fasting glucose levels, elevated two-hour postchallenge glucose values, and BMI greater than 27 kg/m² were associated with the development of diabetes in these patients. 5, 6 Compared with normoglycemic persons, patients with IGT are at substantially greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
12. 13 has identified metabolic syndrome as a constellation of lipid and nonlipid risk factors for coronary artery disease. The syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, abdominal obesity, and prothrombotic and proinflammatory states. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when three or more of the risk factors in Table 2 13 are present. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media.

For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. It is important for family physicians to identify patients with metabolic syndrome and to intervene aggressively to reduce the risk of diabetes and macrovascular disease. In a prospective study 14 conducted in Finland, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were increased in men with metabolic syndrome even in the absence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Women who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus constitute another group at high risk for progression to diabetes. In a study of 1, 636 women with recent gestational diabetes tested at one to four months postpartum, 14 percent were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. It is recommended that women diagnosed with gestational diabetes undergo postpartum glucose testing at six weeks and every three years thereafter.
15.

Screening Recommendations The American Academy of Family Physicians policy 16 on screening for type 2 diabetes is consistent with the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, which concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening of asymptomatic adults for type 2 diabetes, IGT, or IFG. 17 It has not been demonstrated that control of early diabetes as a result of screening provides additional benefit over waiting to treat until a clinical diagnosis has been made. The USPSTF does recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in adults with hypertension or hyperlipidemia. When these patients are specifically targeted for screening, the number needed to screen to prevent a cardiovascular event is lower than screening of the general population. 17 The ADA also prefers to use the fasting plasma glucose level for screening, because it is faster, more acceptable to patients, and less expensive than other screening tests.

### Lifestyle interventions for treatment and remission of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in adults: implications for clinicians [^115p5SAQ]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sleep disorders in prediabetes, T2D, and history of GDM — clinicians should assess and refer as indicated: The clinician or HCP "should ask about sleep quality, quantity, and patterns, determine if a sleep disorder is present, and refer, as indicated, for further evaluation and management", with a "Strong recommendation based on RCTs, systematic reviews, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm". Evidence quality is "Grade B" with "Level of confidence in evidence: High". Benefits include to "Prioritize additional assessment and intervention of individuals who require further evaluation to improve sleep quality" and to "better inform the management plan for diabetes mellitus by taking into account comorbid sleep disorders", while risks/costs include "Time counseling individuals; cost of additional assessment, testing, or referral; limited access to individuals who can perform the needed additional evaluations; frustration if unable to achieve goals". Practice implications note that "Poor sleep habits and sleep disorders are associated with a higher prevalence and incident risk of T2D and GDM, and worse glucose management in the setting of T2D", and list relevant disorders including "obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic insomnia disorder/insomnia symptoms/poor sleep quality, shift work disorder (SWD), and short and long sleep duration", emphasizing "not missing a sleep disorder that requires special assessment or management".

"Obstructive sleep apnea should be evaluated in individuals with suggestive symptoms… and… treatment (lifestyle modification, continuous positive airway pressure, oral appliances, and surgery) significantly improves quality of life and blood pressure management". Regarding emerging therapies, "two phase 3 randomized trials found that among adults with obesity and moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea but without diabetes, treatment with the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA tirzepatide substantially reduced sleep apnea severity", though "More research is needed to determine the effects of GLP-1 and dual GIP and GLP-1 RAs on sleep apnea in people with diabetes".

Sleep medicine in diabetes care — obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening and treatment: Health care professionals should assess persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for symptoms and signs of OSA (Grade B; BEL 2), and persons suspected to have OSA should be referred for diagnosis and management based on local resources (Grade B; BEL 4 and Expert Opinion of Task Force). Weight loss is recommended as the predominant intervention to improve both OSA and insulin sensitivity, and positive airway pressure devices prescribed by a sleep specialist are effective (Grade A; BEL 1). The National Sleep Foundation recommends an average of at least 7 hours of sleep for adults ≥ 18 years of age, and OSA is prevalent in persons with T2D (58%-77%) and even higher (86%) in those with both T2D and obesity. Screening may use tools such as the STOP-Bang questionnaire and can be supplemented by home testing depending on resources. Evidence on glycemic control with CPAP is mixed, with CPAP not necessarily improving A1C in some studies, although a 2021 meta-analysis found significant A1C improvement; weight loss has been independently reported to improve both sleep apnea and A1C in those with T2D.

2. Type 2 diabetes

The incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents is increasing, especially in ethnic minority populations. Distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children can be difficult, since the prevalence of overweight in children continues to rise and since autoantigens and ketosis may be present in a substantial number of patients with features of type 2 diabetes (including obesity and acanthosis nigricans). Such a distinction at the time of diagnosis is critical because treatment regimens, educational approaches, and dietary counsel will differ markedly between the two diagnoses.

Type 2 diabetes has a significant incidence of comorbidities already present at the time of diagnosis. It is recommended that blood pressure measurement, a fasting lipid profile, microalbuminuria assessment, and dilated eye examination be performed at the time of diagnosis. Thereafter, screening guidelines and treatment recommendations for hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, and retinopathy in youth with type 2 diabetes are similar to those for youth with type 1 diabetes. Additional problems that may need to be addressed include polycystic ovary disease and the various comorbidities associated with pediatric obesity such as sleep apnea, hepatic steatosis, orthopedic complications, and psychosocial concerns. The ADA consensus statement on this subject provides guidance on the prevention, screening, and treatment of type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities in young people.

Importance of taking sleep more seriously from a public health standpoint

Until recently, T2D was rarely diagnosed in the pediatric population as evidenced by its previously popular name of adult-onset diabetes. The pervasiveness of T2D in children and adolescents is increasing and this trend is not solely seen in America but worldwide. The rates of diagnoses of T2D in the pediatric population are certainly worrisome but also of concern are the anecdotal reports supporting the notion that early T2D diagnosis in children is a disease that progresses at alarming rates compared with the disease progression of the adult-onset version of T2D. Although T2D diagnosis in children is quickly becoming one of the most important public health concerns, it is also apparent that children's sleep duration, quality and sleep–wake time schedule is becoming part of the issue. Sleep has an important role in the primary and secondary prevention of numerous cardiovascular diseases and metabolic conditions, including T2D. Although it is undeniable that T2D in the pediatric population is a complex and multifaceted disease, presently there are scarcely any viable long-term solutions for the growing rates of T2D in children and adolescents. A multidisciplinary health-care approach with regular follow-ups has been shown to be the most successful at improving glycemic control in adults with T2D. However, currently there is little evidence to support this approach in children and adolescents with or at risk for T2D. A multidisciplinary approach is contingent on many factors, such as resource availability, location, expertise and subsidized programs. This holistic approach is family and patient centered and generally includes a large team of dedicated individuals, including a primary care physician, an endocrinologist, a registered nurse, a nutritionist or dietician, an exercise physiologist, a social worker, a psychologist and diabetes educators. As sleep is such a vital component of overall health and well-being (and also interacts with other behaviors), the team should, as common practice for both preventative and therapeutic purposes, ask about children and adolescents' sleep quality, sleep duration and sleep–wake time schedule. We previously published an example of simple and quick questions that can be used to assess sleep as a vital health indicator. After assessing sleep, clinicians should be recommending that children and adolescents improve their sleeping habits. Although it is no easy task to get children and adolescents to adhere to recommendations, there is no harm in recommending more sleep and solutions should be individualized to the family by addressing root causes of the problem and finding feasible solutions. Some sleep duration guidelines do exist to help evaluate and recommend proper sleep duration. For example, the National Sleep Foundation in the United States recommends that toddlers aged 1–2 years sleep between 11 and 14 h per night, preschoolers aged 3–5 years sleep between 10 and 13 h per night, children aged 6–13 years sleep between 9 and 11 h per night and adolescents aged 14–17 years sleep between 8 and 10 h per night to maximize overall health and well-being.

Clinical suspicion for steatotic liver disease in a child — primary care screening and referral: Children at risk are screened with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) starting at age 10 years, and this can be considered earlier if cardiometabolic risk factors, family history, or severe obesity are present. If there is clinical concern for acute liver disease, the pathway indicates "Yes, urgent referral"; otherwise, repeat ALT within 3 months and reassess annually if ongoing risks such as weight gain, severe obesity, prediabetes/diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Children with persistently elevated ALT levels or concerns for severe liver disease should be referred to pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology for further diagnostic evaluation.

### Waking up to the importance of sleep in type 2 diabetes management: a narrative review [^112KZmxt]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

For the first time, the latest American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) consensus guidelines have incorporated a growing body of evidence linking health outcomes associated with type 2 diabetes to the movement behavior composition over the whole 24-h day. Of particular note, the importance of sleep as a key lifestyle component in the management of type 2 diabetes is promulgated and presented using three key constructs: quantity, quality, and timing (i.e., chronotype). In this narrative review we highlight some of the key evidence justifying the inclusion of sleep in the latest consensus guidelines by examining the associations of quantity, quality, and timing of sleep with measures of glycemia, cardiovascular disease risk, and mortality. We also consider potential mechanisms implicated in the association between sleep and type 2 diabetes and provide practical advice for health care professionals about initiating conversations pertaining to sleep in clinical care. In particular, we emphasize the importance of measuring sleep in a free-living environment and provide a summary of the different methodologies and targets. In summary, although the latest ADA/EASD consensus report highlights sleep as a central component in the management of type 2 diabetes, placing it, for the first time, on a level playing field with other lifestyle behaviors (e.g., physical activity and diet), the evidence base for improving sleep (beyond sleep disorders) in those living with type 2 diabetes is limited. This review should act as a timely reminder to incorporate sleep into clinical consultations, ongoing diabetes education, and future interventions.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115RgwDk]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Pathogenesis and comorbidity context — obesity and insulin resistance: Often, T2DM is preceded by a prolonged asymptomatic hyperglycemic period where microvascular and macrovascular damage occurs, and insulin resistance, which often develops in the context of obesity, is a cardinal feature of T2DM. The increased prevalence of T2DM is closely associated with the increased prevalence of obesity in the U.S.; currently, ~42% of Americans are considered obese, and diabetes is present in 6.6% of normal weight, 10.3% of overweight, and 23.3% of obese individuals. When white adipose tissue lipid storage capacity is exceeded, lipids accumulate in ectopic sites and activate cellular pathways that impair insulin signaling; diets, therapies, and activities that promote weight loss often decrease ectopic lipid accumulation and increase insulin sensitivity, and T2DM often develops as one of many obesity-related conditions, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obstructive sleep apnea.

### Obstructive sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a bidirectional association [^1143mvvS]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes are common medical disorders that have important clinical, epidemiological, and public health implications. Research done in the past two decades indicates that obstructive sleep apnoea, through the effects of intermittent hypoxaemia and sleep fragmentation, could contribute independently to the development of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes. Conversely, type 2 diabetes might increase predisposition to, or accelerate progression of, obstructive and central sleep apnoea, possibly through the development of peripheral neuropathy and abnormalities of ventilatory and upper airway neural control. Although more research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional association between the two disorders, their frequent coexistence should prompt all health-care professionals to embrace clinical practices that include screening of a patient presenting with one disorder for the other. Early identification of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with metabolic dysfunction, including type 2 diabetes, and assessment for metabolic abnormalities in those with obstructive sleep apnoea could reduce cardiovascular disease risk and improve the quality of life of patients with these chronic diseases.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^111wqbaA]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 10- to 18-year-old patients makes recommendations for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM, and the recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated, and at any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained in or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made; if a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model.

### The concomitant relationship shared by sleep disturbances and type 2 diabetes: developing telemedicine as a viable treatment option [^112LZe6b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2013). Low credibility.

Individually, sleep disturbances and type 2 diabetes pose pervasive challenges to health. In addition, the negative symptomology associated with each condition is exacerbated further when presenting concomitantly. This relationship formulates a destructive loop wherein those with diabetes experience decreased sleep quality, which, in turn, worsens a wide range of health threats experienced by those with diabetes, including obesity and glucose intolerance. Because major lifestyle changes and daily care are needed to effectively manage both diabetes and sleep disturbances, an efficient and timely modality of treatment is essential. Advanced technology incorporating telemedicine and telehealth has the potential to enhance treatment by delivering accepted standard of care, medical monitoring, and education quickly and seamlessly — even in rural locations. This type of intervention has the added potential benefit of fostering patient empowerment.

### The role of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the development of male obesity-associated secondary hypogonadism [^116RxmBy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity, secondary (hypogonadotrophic) hypogonadism (SH), sleep disorders [such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)] and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men have complex interlinks both with respect to mutual aetiopathogenesis as well as therapeutics. Correction of the attendant hypogonadism in obese men may serve to break this link and have beneficial effects beyond restoration of normal sexual function. Male obesity-associated secondary hypogonadism (MOSH) should be regarded as a distinct clinical entity and subtype of SH. A high index of suspicion for the presence of MOSH must be maintained by clinicians when assessing obese men. The pathogenesis of MOSH remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, the optimal management of MOSH and its associated sequelae will require long-term prospective studies that in turn will inform the development of future clinical guidelines for this important and prevalent condition.

13.2 Sleep

Sufficient and high‐quality sleep plays an important role in overall health and may also be associated with hyperglycemia and glycemic variability in children with T1D. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends infants sleep between 12 and 16 h per day, toddlers sleep between 11 and 14 h per day, and preschoolers sleep between 10 and 13 h per day including naps. However, recent studies in young children with T1D report much shorter than average sleep durations (8 h per night) based on parent‐report and actigraphy. Both children and caregivers experience sleep disruptions and restriction because of nighttime caregiving and caregivers commonly report fear of nighttime hypoglycemia. Infants and toddlers sleeping pattern during the day needs to be taken into consideration when programming the insulin pump. There is emerging evidence suggesting automated insulin delivery systems can reduce the number of parental awakenings and fear during the night and improve parental perceptions of sleep quality.

### Obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with type 2 diabetes: aetiology and implications for clinical care [^114xSwmz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Recent attention has been drawn to the close association between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Debate has included much discussion about cause and effect with mechanisms proposed whereby one condition might cause the other. However, both clearly share a common phenotype, namely, obesity that overlaps considerably with the other components of the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. It would therefore appear likely that all are manifestations of the same basic pathological processes. Possible interacting aetiological mechanisms are reviewed along with treatment options. A recent report by the International Diabetes Federation has made recommendations to raise awareness of possible OSA in patients with T2DM and also for screening for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and T2DM in patients with known OSA. The clinical implications are discussed.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2022. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^113aJx7e]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the previous consensus statements on the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes in adults, published since 2006 and last updated in 2019. The target audience is the full spectrum of the professional health care team providing diabetes care in the U.S. and Europe. A systematic examination of publications since 2018 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on social determinants of health, the health care system, and physical activity behaviors, including sleep. There is a greater emphasis on weight management as part of the holistic approach to diabetes management. The results of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials involving sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, including assessment of subgroups, inform broader recommendations for cardiorenal protection in people with diabetes at high risk of cardiorenal disease. After a summary listing of consensus recommendations, practical tips for implementation are provided.

A related issue is whether screening should be done to identify diabetes itself at an earlier stage. Again, Stern said, we need to demonstrate benefits of early as opposed to delayed treatment. The conservative approach would be to wait until diabetes presents, more aggressive would be to screen, and most aggressive would be to predict. ADA Position Statements in the past have suggested that screening begin at age 45 years and be carried out every 3 years, particularly for those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², but Stern wryly observed that such recommendations are "not exactly data driven", and the current ADA guidelines, although discussing the approach to the person who is found to have "pre-diabetes", are silent on how such ascertainment should be carried out. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for individuals with blood pressure > 135/80 mmHg, as treatment recommendations are different if diabetes is present, but Stern noted that this, too, is not data driven. Using the Archimedes Model, a simulation study compared health outcomes with eight different diabetes screening strategies, starting at age 30 years every 3 years; at age 45 years every 1, 3, and 5 years; at age 60 years every 3 years, at the time of hypertension diagnosis, just once, or every five visits; or, the maximal strategy, beginning at age 30 years and then repeating every 6 months. In all cases, treatment to achieve recommended glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, taking into account known information about compliance, was used in predicting outcome. Without screening, diabetes was present in ∼15% of individuals at age 56 years, 20% at age 67 years, and so on. All the strategies prevented 2–5 deaths per 1,000 people (of ∼250 deaths per 1,000 individuals), prevented 3–9 myocardial infarctions of ∼150, and prevented 3–9 microvascular complications of 120, with little effect on stroke. "The effects of this are modest", Stern concluded, "let's face it", although the study did find that screening for type 2 diabetes is cost-effective when started between ages 30–45 years and repeated every 3–5 years, at a cost of $10,000–15,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY); most cost-effective was screening hypertensive individuals annually, at $6,287/QALY.

Conclusion: The Cases Revisited

Each case represents a patient we would commonly see in clinical practice.

The male described in case 1 has a high pretest probability of OSA by virtue of his age, obesity, poorly controlled T2D, and hypertension. The presence of nocturia, fatty liver disease (suggested by ultrasound), sexual dysfunction, and mood disorder may all, at least in part, relate to underlying OSA. The loud snoring is consistent with OSA. There is no mention of daytime sleepiness, but its absence does not exclude severe OSA. Alcohol at night will significantly worsen OSA.

Semaglutide was added to his treatment and the linagliptin ceased. He agreed to stop drinking alcohol on most nights and reduce his intake of processed foods. He found walking difficult because of fatigue. After 4 months, he was still snoring but not as loudly, his mood and sexual function were a little better, and nocturia was occurring twice per night. His weight was 114 kg, waist circumference 113 cm, and BP 145/95 mm Hg. There was no nocturnal decline of BP on ambulatory monitoring. HbA1c was 8%, and although improved, gamma-glutamyl transferase, ALT, and triglycerides remained elevated. After discussing the options, including waiting for further weight loss with pharmacotherapy or choosing bariatric surgery, he elected to undergo overnight PSG. The overall AHI was 38, with a high hypoxic burden.

Other sleep characteristics and glucose homeostasis

Additional sleep characteristics (for example, architecture and quality), other than duration, have been studied. Six studies, out of the 21 presented in Table 1 assessed sleep characteristics other than duration and examined their associations with glucose homeostasis in the pediatric population. In those studies, sleep quality was measured via questionnaire, and sleep architecture was measured by PSG. Measurement tools to assess sleep characteristics are diverse and each tool has its own list of limitations and advantages that deserve careful consideration. For example, PSG is considered the gold-standard measurement for sleep characteristics and the diagnostic tool for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in the pediatric population; however, PSG studies have some limitations as they can be a poor representation of at-home sleep routine and PSG is an impractical measurement tool for prolonged measurement periods and epidemiological studies with large sample sizes.

Introduction

The prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) is anticipated to rise from 14% in 2020 to 24% over the next 15 years and hence predicted to affect nearly 2 billion adults, children, and adolescents by 2035. The rapid rise of obesity in children and adolescents is especially concerning, since obesity in adolescence typically persists into adulthood and predisposes individuals to numerous complications. Most notable obesity-associated comorbidities and complications include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), increased risks of various cancers and mortality, reduced quality of life (QOL), and increased risk of death.

Obesity is a highly heterogeneous and progressive multifactorial disease. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, generating substantial, sustained weight reduction, along with improvements in comorbidities and quality of life, and increased life expectancy. Although MBS is the most effective anti-obesity intervention, there are large variations in treatment response after MBS, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the disease. New anti-obesity medications (AOMs) and endoscopic bariatric procedures are extremely welcome additions to the treatment of obesity linked to promising weight loss and favorable associated metabolic changes, in selected patients. With the increased availability of potent AOMs now and in the near future, the practice of combination therapy will grow as MBS and AOMs can work in synergy on the treatment of severe obesity and hopefully in enabling increased access to effective obesity treatments.

In addition to the two most common surgical procedures — sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) — there are numerous other MBS procedures and considerable variation between practices and regions. Variations in reported MBS outcomes (e.g. lack of uniform standardized reporting definitions) are evident in the MBS literature and markedly limit the comparability of different studies, creating a major hindrance to evidence-based clinical obesity treatment algorithms. In 2015, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) published reporting standards in MBS aiming to enhance the quality and comparability of MBS results. However, only four studies published from 2015 to 2020 have used the recommended ASMBS reporting standards, resulting in low compliance and implementation of such standards in clinical practice. This highlights the importance of having valid, simple-to-use definitions for both clinical practice and research that are acceptable and applicable to the surgical and medical communities.

### Recorded diagnosis of overweight / obesity in primary care is linked to obesity care performance rates [^112F6YaX]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2023 expert committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics on child obesity recommended laboratory evaluations for children with obesity, for lipid abnormalities, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal liver function, starting at age 10 years. This entails obtaining a fasting lipid panel, fasting glucose, and alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels every 2 years. For children with overweight, the recommendation was only for a fasting lipid panel. For children aged 2–9 years with obesity, evaluation for lipid abnormalities may be considered. In children younger than 10 years, obtaining tests for abnormal glucose metabolism or liver function is not universally recommended, due to the lower risk profile for NAFLD and diabetes mellitus (especially in the absence of severe obesity). For evaluation of type 2 diabetes mellitus, additional risk factors need be considered, including family history, a history of gestational diabetes, signs of insulin resistance, and the use of obesogenic psychotropic medication. For NAFLD, additional risk factors include a family history of NAFLD, central adiposity, signs of insulin resistance, prediabetes or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea. Therefore, the relatively low referral rate for screening for obesity-related comorbidities in the younger group of our cohort may be related to these recommendations, albeit the referral rate was significantly higher among those with than without recorded formal diagnoses of overweight or obesity.

### Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents… [^114KeBUW]. publications.aap.org (2013). Low credibility.

A breakdown of grade of recommendation shows no grade A studies, 10 grade B studies, 6 grade C studies, and 10 grade D studies. With regard to screening and treatment recommendations for comorbidities, data in children are scarce, and the available literature is conflicting. Therapeutic recommendations for hypertension, dyslipidemia, retinopathy, microalbuminuria, and depression were summarized from expert guideline documents and are presented in detail in the guideline. Numerous experts have argued that the ideal care of a child with T2DM is provided through a team approach, with care shared among a pediatric endocrinologist, diabetes nurse educator, nutritionist, and behavioral specialist.

16, – 18 In areas of limited access to pediatric endocrinologists, however, contact with the pediatric endocrinology team might involve contact at diagnosis for initial diabetes education and intermittently thereafter; annually, with interval care by a PCP and interval communication with the pediatric endocrinology team; or at every visit, for those patients who are either doing poorly or are taking insulin. How these observations might be applied to the child who has T2DM is not entirely clear, but they suggest that regular, direct contact between the generalist and a specialist can have a positive outcome on these patients. De Berardis et al.

24 reported that, compared with adult patients with diabetes mellitus who were seen in general practice offices, patients cared for in diabetes clinics were more likely to conform with process-of-care measures, including HbA1c concentrations, blood pressure, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, microalbuminuria testing, and foot and eye examinations and were more likely to have adequate concentrations of total cholesterol. No differences were found in glycemic, blood pressure, or LDL-C control, however. In that same study, all process-of-care measures improved when the patient was seen by a single physician as opposed to being seen by several different physicians. No similar studies have been performed in children, and it is therefore unknown whether similar outcomes can be achieved in the pediatric population.

25 Recognizing these barriers to care and patients' real-world needs, it is the committee's consensus that it is impractical to expect every patient with T2DM to be able to access a pediatric endocrinologist on a regular basis. It is also unreasonable to assume that these visits will be frequent enough to provide the level of care needed to maintain the best possible metabolic control. For this reason alone, PCPs must have a thorough knowledge of the management of T2DM, including its unique aspects related to childhood and adolescence.

### Obstructive sleep apnea, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk in young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes: results from the TODAY study [^115maLbt]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common comorbidity in type 2 diabetes and has been associated with poor glycemic control, but few data exist in youth-onset type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the prevalence of OSA and its associations with metabolic control and cardiovascular risk in young adults with pediatric type 2 diabetes.

Methods

OSA presence and severity was assessed by polysomnography in 114 participants in the TODAY Study (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) (mean: age 23.5 years, diabetes duration 10 years, BMI 35.3 kg/m²). HbA1c, β-cell function, and diabetes-related complications were collected in the TODAY cohort. Adjusted regression models evaluated relationships between OSA and outcomes.

Results

The prevalence of OSA in TODAY was 38.6%. OSA was not associated with HbA1c, loss of metabolic control, or diabetes-related complications in this cohort.

Conclusions

Despite nearly 10 years of poorly controlled diabetes, young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes had a moderate prevalence of OSA. Severity of OSA was not associated with loss of glycemic control or diabetes-related complications in the TODAY cohort. The prevalence of OSA was lower than that reported in adults with prediabetes/early type 2 diabetes.

### Best practice updates for pediatric / adolescent weight loss surgery [^115966PR]. Obesity (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to update evidence-based best practice guidelines for pediatric/adolescent weight loss surgery (WLS). We performed a systematic search of English-language literature on WLS and pediatric, adolescent, gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric banding, and extreme obesity published between April 2004 and May 2007 in PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. Keywords were used to narrow the search for a selective review of abstracts, retrieval of full articles, and grading of evidence according to systems used in established evidence-based models. In light of evidence on the natural history of obesity and on outcomes of WLS in adolescents, guidelines for surgical treatment of obesity in this age group need to be updated. We recommend modification of selection criteria to include adolescents with BMI ≥ 35 and specific obesity-related comorbidities for which there is clear evidence of important short-term morbidity (i.e., type 2 diabetes, severe steatohepatitis, pseudotumor cerebri, and moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea). In addition, WLS should be considered for adolescents with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40) and other comorbidities associated with long-term risks. We identified > 1,085 papers; 186 of the most relevant were reviewed in detail. Regular updates of evidence-based recommendations for best practices in pediatric/adolescent WLS are required to address advances in technology and the growing evidence base in pediatric WLS. Key considerations in patient safety include carefully designed criteria for patient selection, multidisciplinary evaluation, choice of appropriate procedure, thorough screening and management of comorbidities, optimization of long-term compliance, and age-appropriate fully informed consent.

The Case

A 67-year-old man is referred for evaluation and management of possible hypogonadism. He reports that his libido has declined over the last 10 years, but his predominant sexual complaints are that his erections have gradually become less firm resulting in decreased sexual satisfaction. He reports fatigue and "feeling washed out" on most days. His wife sleeps in another room because he snores very loudly. She reports that he has occasional gasping for breath when sleeping. He reports low mood that has worsened since retirement 2 years ago. Comorbidities include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) diagnosed 5 years ago, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He is sedentary. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking, but he quit smoking 5 years ago. He has no history of previous myocardial infarction or stroke. He was hospitalized briefly for treatment of a viral pneumonia about 10 weeks ago. His current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and sitagliptin. He has never used glucocorticoids, opioids, or anabolic steroids. He reports no bruising tendency, weakness, headaches, or visual disturbance. He has fathered 2 children (now adults) without difficulty. He recalls normal puberty at "about the same time as his friends". On physical examination, his blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, weight is 99.3 kg (219 lb), and BMI is 31.3 kg/m². He has normal body hair and lipomastia, but no palpable gynecomastia. His genital exam is normal (including testes that measure 20 cc each by Prader orchidometry). Pedal pulses are reduced. The remainder of the exam is normal, including cardiopulmonary, abdominal, skin, and neurological exam is normal.

Results from tests ordered by his primary care provider and performed on a nonfasting afternoon blood sample drawn 8 weeks ago demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 138.3 ng/dL (4.9 nmol/L) (normal range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L), a serum HbA1c of 8.1% and a serum hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL (normal range, 13.5–17.5 g/dL). Liver function and kidney function tests were normal. Bone densitometry 6 months ago revealed a T score of −1.8 in the lumbar spine and −1.6 in the left total hip and femoral neck.

### ASMBS pediatric metabolic and bariatric surgery guidelines, 2018 [^117Nhkxq]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Pediatric Committee updated their evidence-based guidelines published in 2012, performing a comprehensive literature search (2009–2017) with 1387 articles and other supporting evidence through February 2018. The significant increase in data supporting the use of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) in adolescents since 2012 strengthens these guidelines from prior reports. Obesity is recognized as a disease; treatment of severe obesity requires a life-long multidisciplinary approach with combinations of lifestyle changes, nutrition, medications, and MBS. We recommend using modern definitions of severe obesity in children with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention age- and sex-matched growth charts defining class II obesity as 120% of the 95th percentile and class III obesity as 140% of the 95th percentile. Adolescents with class II obesity and a co-morbidity (listed in the guidelines), or with class III obesity should be considered for MBS. Adolescents with cognitive disabilities, a history of mental illness or eating disorders that are treated, immature bone growth, or low Tanner stage should not be denied treatment. MBS is safe and effective in adolescents; given the higher risk of adult obesity that develops in childhood, MBS should not be withheld from adolescents when severe co-morbidities, such as depressed health-related quality of life score, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis exist. Early intervention can reduce the risk of persistent obesity as well as end organ damage from long standing co-morbidities.

Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics dietary guidance and lifestyle intervention outcomes in youth: According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' guidelines, when incorporated with lifestyle changes, balanced macronutrient diets at 900 to 1200 kcal per day are associated with short- and long-term (eg, ≥ 1 year) improvements in weight status and body composition in children 6 to 12 years of age, and restrictions of no less than 1200 kcal per day in adolescents 13 to 18 years old also result in improvements; these calorie recommendations are to be incorporated with lifestyle changes, including increased activity and possibly medication. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, the intensive lifestyle-intervention arm had a reduction in daily energy intake of 450 kcal and a 58% reduction in progression to diabetes at the 2.8-year follow-up, with 50% achieving at least 7% weight loss after the 24-week curriculum and 38% maintaining at least 7% weight loss at most recent visit. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends that protein-sparing, modified-fast (ketogenic) diets be restricted to children who are ≥ 120% of their ideal body weight with a serious medical complication, and specifies the intervention be short-term (typically 10 weeks) under supervision of a multidisciplinary team specializing in pediatric obesity.

Sleep — suboptimal sleep and circadian disruption are linked to adverse energy balance and cardiometabolic risks; counseling to extend sleep may aid weight reduction, and screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recommended in symptomatic or high-risk individuals, including those with high neck circumference thresholds. Suboptimal sleep duration (< 7–8 hours per night) and poor sleep quality can promote dysregulated energy intake, metabolic perturbations, and obesity, and inadequate sleep and circadian disruption are associated with increased appetite, increased energy intake, decreased energy expenditure, and cardiometabolic disease risk. For those with short sleep duration, individualized sleep hygiene counseling intended to extend sleep duration may reduce energy intake and increase weight reduction, and in the Sleep AHEAD trial, weight reduction resulted in significant improvements in OSA and the apnea-hypopnea index among people with obesity and type 2 diabetes; treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure only, however, does not seem to improve weight reduction. People with obesity should be counseled about the importance of adequate sleep and circadian health, and screening for OSA is recommended in those with typical symptoms, high neck circumference (> 17 inches in men and > 16 inches in women), or high risk for OSA.

### Approach the patient with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity [^111xCkaR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity are highly prevalent and bidirectionally associated. OSA is underrecognized, however, particularly in women. By mechanisms that overlap with those of obesity, OSA increases the risk of developing, or having poor outcomes from, comorbid chronic disorders and impairs quality of life. Using 2 illustrative cases, we discuss the relationships between OSA and obesity with type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, cognitive disturbance, mood disorders, lower urinary tract symptoms, sexual function, and reproductive disorders. The differences in OSA between men and women, the phenotypic variability of OSA, and comorbid sleep disorders are highlighted. When the probability of OSA is high due to consistent symptoms, comorbidities, or both, a diagnostic sleep study is advisable. Continuous positive airway pressure or mandibular advancement splints improve symptoms. Benefits for comorbidities are variable depending on nightly duration of use. By contrast, weight loss and optimization of lifestyle behaviors are consistently beneficial.

Objective

Over the last 3 decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased dramatically in North America, ushering in a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which previously was not typically seen until much later in life. This technical report describes, in detail, the procedures undertaken to develop the recommendations given in the accompanying clinical practice guideline, "Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Children and Adolescents", and provides in-depth information about the rationale for the recommendations and the studies used to make the clinical practice guideline's recommendations.

Methods

A primary literature search was conducted relating to the treatment of T2DM in children and adolescents, and a secondary literature search was conducted relating to the screening and treatment of T2DM's comorbidities in children and adolescents. Inclusion criteria were prospectively and unanimously agreed on by members of the committee. An article was eligible for inclusion if it addressed treatment (primary search) or 1 of 4 comorbidities (secondary search) of T2DM, was published in 1990 or later, was written in English, and included an abstract. Only primary research inquiries were considered; review articles were considered if they included primary data or opinion. The research population had to constitute children and/or adolescents with an existing diagnosis of T2DM; studies of adult patients were considered if at least 10% of the study population was younger than 35 years. All retrieved titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by the consulting epidemiologist.

Results

Thousands of articles were retrieved and considered in both searches on the basis of the aforementioned criteria. From those, in the primary search, 199 abstracts were identified for possible inclusion, 58 of which were retained for systematic review. Five of these studies were classified as grade A studies, 1 as grade B, 20 as grade C, and 32 as grade D. Articles regarding treatment of T2DM selected for inclusion were divided into 4 major subcategories on the basis of type of treatment being discussed: (1) medical treatments (32 studies); (2) nonmedical treatments (9 studies); (3) provider behaviors (8 studies); and (4) social issues (9 studies). From the secondary search, an additional 336 abstracts relating to comorbidities were identified for possible inclusion, of which 26 were retained for systematic review. These articles included the following: 1 systematic review of literature regarding comorbidities of T2DM in adolescents; 5 expert opinions presenting global recommendations not based on evidence; 5 cohort studies reporting natural history of disease and comorbidities; 3 with specific attention to comorbidity patterns in specific ethnic groups (case-control, cohort, and clinical report using adult literature); 3 reporting an association between microalbuminuria and retinopathy (2 case-control, 1 cohort); 3 reporting the prevalence of nephropathy (cohort); 1 reporting peripheral vascular disease (case series); 2 discussing retinopathy (1 case-control, 1 position statement); and 3 addressing hyperlipidemia (American Heart Association position statement on cardiovascular risks; American Diabetes Association consensus statement; case series). A breakdown of grade of recommendation shows no grade A studies, 10 grade B studies, 6 grade C studies, and 10 grade D studies. With regard to screening and treatment recommendations for comorbidities, data in children are scarce, and the available literature is conflicting. Therapeutic recommendations for hypertension, dyslipidemia, retinopathy, microalbuminuria, and depression were summarized from expert guideline documents and are presented in detail in the guideline. The references are provided, but the committee did not independently assess the supporting evidence. Screening tools are provided in the Supplemental Information.

Key action statement 1 — screening for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) states that as part of routine health maintenance visits, clinicians should inquire whether the child or adolescent snores, and if the answer is affirmative or if a child or adolescent presents with signs or symptoms of OSAS, clinicians should perform a more focused evaluation, with Evidence Quality: Grade B, Recommendation Strength: Recommendation; the evidence profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: B, Harm: Provider time, patient and parent time, and Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and adds that asking about snoring at each health maintenance visit is a sensitive, albeit nonspecific, screening measure that is quick and easy to perform and that an affirmative answer should be followed by a detailed history and examination to determine whether further evaluation for OSAS is needed.
