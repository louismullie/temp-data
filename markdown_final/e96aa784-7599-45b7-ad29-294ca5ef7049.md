## Question

What does a high d-dimer mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a high D-dimer means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what D-dimer actually measures and its basic test characteristics. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts in which D-dimer is used and how pretest probability governs interpretation. Next, I will review common non-thrombotic causes of elevation and special populations where cutoffs change. After that, I should consider ultra-high values and their prognostic implications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach to an elevated result and highlight key caveats and pitfalls to avoid misinterpretation.

> Let me first confirm the biology and test performance. D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product generated when plasmin degrades cross-linked fibrin, so its presence indicates ongoing coagulation and secondary fibrinolysis; it becomes detectable within about 2 hours of thrombus formation and has a half-life near 6 hours, which explains why it can be elevated in both thrombotic and inflammatory states [^115MCfmo]. Wait, let me verify the assay caveat: D-dimer assays are heterogeneous, with high-sensitivity quantitative ELISAs offering excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value but poor specificity, so a positive result is not diagnostic of thrombosis by itself and must be interpreted in clinical context [^112rULpX] [^114NcPTj].

> Next, I should review the primary clinical use. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — D-dimer's principal role is to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE, i.e. DVT or PE) in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability, not to rule in disease; in high pretest probability, guidelines recommend proceeding directly to imaging because even a normal D-dimer cannot safely exclude PE in that setting [^112UjLr8] [^117Kqscd]. I need to ensure I apply the right thresholds: for patients older than 50 years, an age-adjusted cutoff of age × 10 μg/L (FEU) increases specificity while maintaining sensitivity above 97%, and this strategy safely reduces unnecessary imaging in older adults [^112jpuht] [^114iWSdG].

> I will now examine non-thrombotic causes of elevation, because specificity is limited. Physiologic contributors include aging, pregnancy, and strenuous exercise; pathologic drivers include cancer, infection or sepsis, DIC, liver disease, renal impairment, recent surgery or trauma, and chronic inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disease and diabetes, all of which can raise D-dimer via inflammation-driven coagulation activation and extravascular fibrin turnover [^1145BaEj] [^112DozZL] [^114t3VSW]. Hmm, wait a minute — could renal dysfunction alone explain a marked elevation? It can contribute, but its effect appears less influential than age in suspected VTE cohorts, so I should avoid anchoring on renal function alone without considering the broader differential [^113UHRKg].

> Let me consider special populations and adjusted strategies. In pregnancy, D-dimer rises progressively and the YEARS algorithm combined with trimester-aware interpretation can help safely reduce imaging; in COVID-19, baseline D-dimer is frequently elevated and using D-dimer to exclude PE is problematic, though very high levels correlate with thrombosis and mortality risk and may inform risk stratification rather than diagnostic exclusion [^113UHRKg] [^1167CMPR] [^111KxaN8]. I should double-check that in patients over 80, some experts discourage D-dimer for exclusion because specificity is extremely low, reinforcing the need to rely on clinical probability and imaging when suspicion is meaningful [^1145BaEj].

> Now, I need to check the meaning of ultra-high D-dimer values. Levels above about 5000 ng/mL are uncommon and often reflect severe disease such as extensive VTE, advanced malignancy, or sepsis; in a pre-COVID cohort, mortality rose with increasing strata, reaching 75% when D-dimer exceeded 15,000 ng/mL, underscoring that such values are prognostically ominous even if the exact etiology is multifactorial [^115BXMBZ]. But wait, what if the patient has unprovoked VTE and an extremely high D-dimer at presentation? D-dimer above about 8000 ng/mL has been associated with occult malignancy and worse outcomes, prompting consideration of age-appropriate cancer screening in selected patients [^114ABVcM].

> Next, I should review how to manage an incidentally discovered high D-dimer in an ambulatory, asymptomatic patient. Hold on, I should verify that indiscriminate testing is discouraged; nonetheless, if an elevated D-dimer is found, a structured approach is warranted: reassure about non-thrombotic causes, review history for symptoms and risk factors, and selectively evaluate for infection, inflammation, malignancy, liver or renal disease, and DIC as indicated, while avoiding reflex imaging unless symptoms or risk profile justify it [^1144PcsQ] [^116FAgqE]. I need to ensure we do not medicalize a nonspecific marker; repeated D-dimer checks without a clinical target should be discouraged once a thorough evaluation is unrevealing [^116FAgqE].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise interpretation. First, confirm the clinical context and pretest probability using validated tools such as Wells or Geneva; if pretest probability is high, skip D-dimer and proceed to imaging. Second, if pretest probability is low or intermediate, obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer and apply age-adjusted thresholds in patients older than 50; a negative result safely excludes VTE and obviates imaging, whereas a positive result should prompt appropriate imaging (compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or CTPA for suspected PE). Third, if D-dimer is elevated without compatible symptoms, broaden the differential to non-thrombotic causes and tailor further workup to the patient's risk profile and findings, recognizing that very high values may signal serious underlying disease even in the absence of proven thrombosis [^112UjLr8] [^113UHRKg] [^115BXMBZ].

> I should double-check key caveats to avoid missteps. A positive D-dimer is not diagnostic of VTE and should not trigger anticoagulation without objective confirmation; conversely, a negative D-dimer does not absolutely exclude VTE in high pretest probability settings, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^114pX3Ff] [^117Kqscd]. Assay variability and unit confusion (FEU vs DDU, with a factor of about 1.75) can mislead interpretation, so I need to ensure the correct cutoff for the specific assay and reporting unit is used before making decisions [^115MCfmo]. Finally, I should avoid using D-dimer to guide anticoagulant dosing or escalation outside of research or guideline-supported contexts, as evidence for D-dimer–directed treatment adjustments remains limited and potentially harmful [^115pUABF] [^111AEke3].

> In summary, a high D-dimer signals increased fibrin formation and breakdown but is not specific for thrombosis; its greatest value is in ruling out VTE when pretest probability is low or intermediate and appropriate thresholds are applied, while elevated values in other contexts often reflect inflammation, infection, malignancy, or physiologic states rather than clot, and ultra-high levels should prompt careful evaluation for serious disease even if VTE is not immediately evident [^112UjLr8] [^115BXMBZ].

A high D-dimer means there is **active fibrin breakdown** [^113CguKd] from clot formation and dissolution, most often due to venous thromboembolism (VTE) [^notfound], but it is **not specific** and can also rise with infection, inflammation, cancer, trauma, surgery, pregnancy, or liver disease [^115KTUBp] [^112DozZL]. Because of this, a high D-dimer **does not diagnose VTE** [^114pX3Ff] and must be interpreted with clinical probability and imaging when indicated [^112rULpX]. In low-risk patients, a normal D-dimer can safely exclude VTE [^114NcPTj], whereas in high-risk patients, imaging is warranted regardless of D-dimer [^117Kqscd]. Persistent or very high D-dimer levels may signal serious disease and warrant further evaluation [^115BXMBZ].

## Physiological basis of elevated D-dimer

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product generated during **fibrinolysis** [^113CguKd]; elevated levels reflect ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis [^113kRJDw]. This occurs in **VTE** and in other conditions with increased thrombus formation and breakdown [^115KTUBp].

## Clinical significance of elevated D-dimer

- **Diagnostic utility**: Elevated D-dimer is highly sensitive [^114NcPTj] but nonspecific for VTE; it is most useful for excluding VTE in low-risk patients [^112khAkj] [^112UjLr8].
- **Prognostic value**: Persistently high D-dimer after anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE predicts higher recurrence risk [^116Mqtnj] and may guide treatment duration [^113UHRKg].
- **Indicator of severity**: Very high D-dimer levels (> 5000 ng/mL) [^115BXMBZ] are linked to severe disease and higher mortality in COVID-19 and other critical illnesses [^1167CMPR] [^114t3VSW].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **False positives**: Common in older adults, pregnant patients, cancer, infection, inflammation, liver disease, and recent surgery or trauma [^114H9c8p] [^1145BaEj].
- **False negatives**: Rare but can occur with early or small clots, or prolonged symptoms [^116ntJwo].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays and lack of standardization complicate interpretation [^112EThoU] [^112rULpX].

---

## Clinical approach to elevated D-dimer

- **Clinical context**: Always interpret with pretest probability and clinical judgment [^11491coM].
- **Imaging**: Use ultrasound or CT angiography [^113UHRKg] when clinical suspicion is moderate to high or D-dimer is elevated in low-risk patients.
- **Further evaluation**: If no thrombosis is found, assess for infection, inflammation, malignancy, or other causes [^116FAgqE].

---

A high D-dimer reflects active fibrin breakdown [^113CguKd] and is **nonspecific**; it supports VTE exclusion in low-risk patients [^notfound] and signals other pathology when VTE is absent, requiring context-aware interpretation and targeted imaging [^116FAgqE].

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: making sense of international guideline recommendations [^112rULpX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%). While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115KTUBp]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

D-dimer, a soluble fibrin degradation product that originates from plasmin-induced degradation of cross-linked fibrin, is an important biomarker of coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis that is routinely used to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence, as well as the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy. Besides VTE, D-dimer may be high due to physiologic conditions, including aging, pregnancy, and strenuous physical activity. In addition, several disorders have been associated with increased D-dimer levels, ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to infectious diseases and cancers. Thus, it is far from unusual for hematologists to have to deal with ambulatory individuals with increased D-dimer without signs or symptoms of thrombus formation. This narrative review is dedicated to the management of these cases by the hematologist.

For these reasons, we suggest that instead of recommending an evaluation algorithm for elevated D-dimer tests in asymptomatic ambulatory individuals, the focus should shift back towards avoiding unnecessary medical tests. Such efforts could lead to the better education of healthcare professionals on the rational prescription of these tests, ensuring effective and appropriate use based on solid clinical reasoning and a specific patient context.

Conclusions

D-dimer testing is unequivocally a useful tool for the diagnosis of VTE. However, owing to its intrinsic poor positive predictive value, D-dimer is not specific for thromboembolic disease because increased levels are also observed in many other conditions, ranging from DIC to infections and malignant neoplasms. In other words, increased D-dimer levels may be encountered as part of an inflammatory state or cancer without being the sign of intravascular thrombus formation. Thus, while D-dimer measurement must be incorporated in multi-test algorithms for the evaluation of patients with suspected VTE, this measurement has limited clinical utility in unselected ambulatory cases and should, therefore, only be performed in specified clinical situations. However, the detection of increased D-dimer cannot be ignored and warrants a series of diagnostic procedures aimed at the proper management of these cases. This means, on the one hand, the exclusion of any associated thromboembolic complication and, on the other hand, the identification or exclusion of conditions associated with increased D-dimer. When the latter remains the only abnormality, individuals should be reassured about their health status and encouraged to avoid the repeated, obsessive measurement of D-dimer.

Conditions associated with increased D-dimer

As mentioned above, D-dimer is used to guide the diagnostic procedure of VTE, which includes DVT and pulmonary embolism. However, while patients with pulmonary embolism or DVT in the acute phase usually have high D-dimer levels, individuals with high D-dimer do not necessarily have an underlying thromboembolic disease, but they may have several other pathological and non-pathological conditions (Table 1).

Venous thromboembolism

To begin, we provide a concise description of the D-dimer-based diagnostic workup of this thrombotic disorder. VTE affects nearly 10 million people every year worldwide, with an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 1,000 population. It is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease. Although its incidence increases with age both in men and women, women have a higher risk of developing VTE at the young age of 20–40 years due to hormonal-related factors (i.e. pregnancy or oral contraceptive use). Owing to the substantial global burden of VTE, suspected VTE requires a timely and preferably non-invasive diagnostic tool. In this context, thanks to the high sensitivity (almost 100%) of quantitative ELISA, D-dimer measurement plays a key role in the diagnostic workup. However, due to its low specificity (high negative and low positive predictive value), the test should only be used to exclude VTE. This means that a D-dimer negative result (i.e. < 500 µg/L) categorizes patients as having a low to moderate clinical pre-test probability of VTE.

Physiological conditions

It has previously been pointed out that the detection of increased D-dimer does not necessarily imply the presence of an underlying disease because there are a number of physiological conditions that are accompanied by abnormal values (Table 1).D-dimer increases with age, thus leading to a greater proportion of older patients (> 50%) with values higher than the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L. The lower specificity of D-dimer for VTE in older compared to younger people implies that the former are unlikely to have negative D-dimer results even when VTE is absent, with a related high rate of unnecessary use of imaging tests. For this reason, an age-adjusted cutoff has been validated and recommended in the diagnostic workup of VTE. However, in patients > 80 years of age, the use of D-dimer measurement is not recommended for the exclusion of VTE, because high baseline levels lead to unacceptably high false positive results in cases with no VTE.

Similarly, D-dimer levels increase physiologically during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. D-dimer levels are also higher in women taking oral contraceptives than in non-users, perhaps reflecting their hypercoagulable state.

Exercise has effects on hemostasis that are dependent on the duration and intensity of the physical activity.D-dimer levels significantly increase following short-duration strenuous exercise, and exercise-induced fibrinolytic activity in healthy subjects is proportional to the amount of exercise taken. Changes in cardiac and hemostatic biomarkers (including D-dimer) after strenuous endurance exercise can mimic pulmonary embolism and myocardial injury in individuals who are not actually at risk.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

### Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: constructive perspectives and comments on' how we manage a high D-dimer' [^111rctNM]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the narrative review, "How we manage a high D-dimer", authored by Massimo Franchini and colleagues and published in a recent issue of Haematologica. This review offers didactic and informative content, and although we generally agree with the perspectives and recommendations presented, we would like to address two specific issues that are vital to good clinical practice: the correct understanding of the properties of diagnostic tests; and the need for reduction of unnecessary test prescription.

Regarding the first issue, the review mentions the intrinsically low positive predictive value (PPV) of D-dimer testing. It is essential to clarify that PPV is not an intrinsic characteristic of the test. Rather, PPV is determined by the interaction between the pre-test probability and the test's positive likelihood ratio. Therefore, even a test like D-dimer, which has a low positive likelihood ratio, can exhibit a high PPV if applied in a setting with a very high pre-test probability.

Regarding the second issue, the review highlights that ubiquitous physiological conditions such as aging, pregnancy, and physical activity are among the main causes of elevated D-dimer levels. It also states that D-dimer testing has limited clinical utility in the random asymptomatic ambulatory patient and appropriately suggests that it should only be prescribed in specific clinical situations. Yet, it also asserts that an elevated D-Dimer ordered in the random asymptomatic ambulatory patient cannot be ignored and warrants further consideration and proposes an algorithm for the management of these patients. In our opinion, this approach legitimizes inappropriate ordering of the test and shifts the focus away from what truly should be good clinical practice: the use of a diagnostic test as a complement to sound clinical reasoning. This applies not only to D-dimer, but also to other tests inappropriately routinely ordered in asymptomatic individuals, such as high-sensitivity troponinand the ANA test. These tests should be reserved for cases of clinical suspicion due to extremely high false-positive rates in the context of low pre-test probability, which can lead to further unnecessary tests, invasive procedures with iatrogenic risk, increased costs to the healthcare system, and anxiety for the patient. We reinforce the need for rational patient selection prior to prescribing the diagnostic test, rather than seeking an unlikely diagnosis afterwards motivated by inappropriate test ordering.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe, often life-threatening, syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system with intravascular thrombin generation, and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, the primary aim of which is to eliminate the underlying condition (i.e. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases).D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC because, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value, the use of D-dimer measurement in this context has been endorsed by all national and international guidelines. For example, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) not only validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value, but also recommended sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor DIC evolution, and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

Cancer, inflammation, and infection

The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors, being associated with growth and progression. As a consequence, up to 20% of cancer patients develop VTE, which is the second leading cause of death.D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common finding of high D-dimer in cancer even in the absence of thrombosis limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, incorporating D-dimer measurement in appropriate scoring systems including other biomarkers may help to identify cancer patients at increased risk of developing VTE who are thus candidates for primary thromboprophylaxis. In addition, although the value of screening patients with increased D-dimer for occult cancer is still a subject of debate, an occult cancer may be considered as the potential source of a substantial rise in D-dimer levels when other physiological or pathological causes have been ruled out. The usefulness of this approach has been highlighted in a clinical study in patients with unprovoked VTE, demonstrating that extremely high D-dimer (> 4,000 µg/L) is independently associated with the likelihood of an occult cancer.

The presence of D-dimer in the bloodstream is physiological, representing the continuous balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Only when D-dimer exceeds the cutoff value is it considered pathologic. Cutoff values, earlier considered fixed and universal, are now considered variable and age-dependent, perhaps reflecting the physiological changes of the homeostatic system with the increased prevalence with aging of inflammatory -coagulative - reparative processes. From the time of its formation, D-dimer begins to be detectable in blood within approximately two hours, with a half-life of approximately six hours. After surgery, D-dimer increases, peaking at about one week and then decreasing by 5–10% daily; it is detectable for at least one month.

Numerous assays are commercially available for the laboratory measurement of D-dimer. Most of them rely on monoclonal antibodies and are typically enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). But other methods use microparticles covered with monoclonal antibodies that bind D-dimer and cause agglutination, detected and quantified by nephelometry or turbidometry. There are point of care (POC) assays that produce both qualitative and quantitative results, and provide faster results in emergency care settings. Quantitative ELISA have a high sensitivity (> 95%) but a low specificity for VTE and thus are principally used for exclusion purposes. For this reason, establishing a cutoff value is very important; but these values differ greatly among the various assays used, perhaps due to the different specificity and epitope affinity of the different monoclonal antibodies. Thus, it is of paramount importance to use an assay method for which the cutoff value has been determined by association of the D-dimer results with the clinical and instrumental diagnostic findings of VTE.D-dimer results can be expressed in two different units: FEU (Fibrinogen Equivalent Units) that correlate the mass of the D-dimer to that of fibrinogen, or DDU (D-dimer Units) that relate to the mass of the D-dimer itself. It is important not to switch or confuse a result expressed in FEU with one expressed in DDU, because they differ by a factor of 1.75.

Several scores have been developed in order to assess the clinical probability of VTE. The most used are the Wells and Geneva scores. In addition, a simplified and validated version of the Geneva score has been developed to widen its adoption in clinical practice. The combination of negative D-dimer ELISA and low-intermediate pre-test clinical probability excludes DVT or pulmonary embolism in approximately 30% of the cases with suspected VTE with no need for imaging (i.e. venous ultrasonography for a suspected DVT and computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiogram for a suspected pulmonary embolism). Conversely, D-dimer is not recommended in patients with a high clinical probability, because a normal result does not exclude VTE, even when a highly sensitive assay is used; these cases should directly undergo imaging without D-dimer testing (Figure 2). Notably, as D-dimer levels increase with age, an age-adjusted (age x 10 µg/L in patients aged > 50 years) rather than a fixed cutoff (< 500 µg/L) is warranted to exclude VTE in patients with low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability. Although impaired renal function has been suggested to affect D-dimer levels in individuals suspected of having VTE, its influence seems to be less important than that of age.

D-dimer testing in combination with a clinical pre-test probability assessment (YEARS criteria or revised GENEVA score) has also been used for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnant women with the aim of avoiding unnecessary imaging. In addition, D-dimer testing provides important information not only for the diagnosis of VTE, but also for the anticoagulant management of VTE. Current evidence indicates that a positive D-dimer after completion of three months of anticoagulant therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of VTE recurrence than a negative test. Thus, following the demonstration of the strong association between D-dimer and VTE recurrence, D-dimer testing is often included in the prediction models designed to guide decisions for stopping anticoagulant therapy. On the other hand, persistently high D-dimer after stopping a 3-month anticoagulant treatment argues in favor of therapy prolongation in cases with unprovoked VTE.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^113kRJDw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy. This review: 1) describes how D-dimer is generated; 2) reviews the assays used for its detection; and 3) discusses the role of D-dimer determination in these various conditions.

### The D-dimer assay [^113CguKd]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

D-dimer is an indirect marker of fibrinolysis and fibrin turnover; this molecule exhibits unique properties as a biological marker of hemostatic abnormalities as well as an indicator of intravascular thrombosis. D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the systematic degradation of vascular thrombi through the fibrinolytic mechanism. Because of this, the D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in a number of clinical scenarios. Most commonly, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for excluding the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and for monitoring other conditions in which the patient is at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Limitations of the assay include D-dimer elevation in a constellation of clinical scenarios (age, pregnancy, and cancer) and lack of clinical standardization.

There is a close link between fibrinogen, thrombus formation, fibrinolysis and the inflammatory process. Fibrinogen, an acute phase reactant, leaks out of the vasculature contributing to the inflammatory process. The involvement of clotting factors (i.e. FVIII and others) helps to form fibrin in the extravascular space, which functions as a scaffold for the inflammatory cells of the immune system to exert their functions. As a result of fibrin formation, secondary fibrinolysis occurs and this generates D-dimer, with levels paralleling the degree of inflammation. Several diseases are characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation and thus high D-dimer; the most common are autoimmune diseases and diabetes. Although D-dimer is considered a marker of inflammation (the so call "D-dimeritis"), high values do not necessarily imply the presence of an increased thrombotic riskbecause D-dimer increases exponentially in parallel with C-reactive protein.

Inflammation also provides the molecular basis to explain the detection of high D-dimer during infections. The best example is sepsis, a life-threatening systemic infection-related condition associated with defects in hemostasis and, as mentioned above, with DIC. Marked elevations of D-dimer have been observed in sepsis, demonstrating the prognostic importance of D-dimer in relation to the severity of the patient's condition. Besides SARS-CoV-2 infection, several viral infections (i.e. Ebola virus, influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus, Coxsackievirus, herpes simplex virus and parvovirus B19) are characterized by a marked rise in plasma levels of hypercoagulability markers, such as D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex. The endothelial dysfunction and the inflammatory state associated with infections drive patients towards a hypercoagulable condition, that translates into an increased thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk. This is particularly evident in HIV-infected patients. In addition to chronic, low-grade inflammation (an important mechanism for their enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease), people living with HIV have increased D-dimer that correlate with VTE and mortality risks.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to D-dimer, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to do not obtain D-dimer testing in patients with high clinical probability, as a normal result does not safely exclude PE.

### The clinical significance of ultra-high D-dimer levels [^115BXMBZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL are encountered in a number of conditions other than venous thromboembolism (VTE). Recent studies have used plasma D-dimer levels as a prognostic indicator for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The implications of abnormal levels are less clear for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a baseline elevation in plasma D-dimer levels. In the present study, we reviewed the occurrence of plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL and investigated the clinical significance of this finding before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

Inpatient records for a 4-year period were screened for laboratory results of plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL. The patient data were reviewed for the clinical identifiers commonly associated with elevated plasma D-dimer levels, including VTE, cancer, sepsis, pneumonia, other infection, bleeding, and trauma. The patients were then categorized into groups stratified by the plasma D-dimer level to allow for comparisons between the various clinical diagnoses.

Results

A total of 671 patients were included in the present study. VTE was the most common diagnosis for patients with a plasma D-dimer level > 5000 ng/mL, followed by cancer and pneumonia. Multiple clinical diagnoses were present in 61% of the patients. No clear cause for the ultra-high plasma D-dimer level could be identified in 11.3% of the patients. Among the patients lacking a clinical diagnosis at discharge, mortality was 24% in the 5000- to 10,000-ng/mL group, 28.6% in the 10,000- to 15,000-ng/mL group, and 75% in the > 15,000-ng/mL group.

Conclusions

VTE, cancer, and pneumonia were frequently present when ultra-high plasma D-dimer levels were encountered, and mortality was high when the levels were > 15,000 ng/mL. The results from our study from a pre-COVID-19 patient population suggest that ultra-high plasma D-dimer levels indicate the presence of severe underlying disease. This should be considered when using the plasma D-dimer level as a screening tool or prognostic indicator for COVID-19 infection.

### The D-dimer level predicts the prognosis in patients with lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138C9dm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conducted this meta-analysis revealed that the high plasma D-dimer level leads to lower survival than in the low D-dimer level, which might provide an important clue for high plasma D-dimer level as an independent factor of poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In the future, more prospective cohort studies are needed to study and verify.

### Is it possible to make a common reference standard for D-dimer measurements? Communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on fibrinolysis [^112EThoU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

D-dimer antigen is a heterogeneous mixture of fibrin degradation products that when present at high levels in plasma indicate ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. The heterogeneous nature of the target D-dimer antigen and the variety of assay systems means that it is difficult to compare results from different methods.

Objectives

To identify a universally agreed D-dimer standard that could help harmonize results from different methods.

Methods

A pool of patient plasma with high D-dimer levels was freeze-dried and investigated as a long-term World Health Organization international standard for D-dimer. Fibrin degradation products from clot lysis reactions were also freeze-dried in various formulations and investigated in commutability studies with patient plasma.

Results

Problems of instability of D-dimer plasma emerged suggesting loss of reactivity after freeze-drying and storage at -20°C of 10%-18% per year. Freeze-dried fibrin degradation products added to plasma were also unstable, but the sugar trehalose was found to improve stability. However, this preparation was not suitable as a standard in widely used assay platforms. Previous studies suggest fibrin degradation products are prone to structural rearrangements and amyloid formation, which may explain the instability of candidate D-dimer standards.

Conclusions

The known difficulties of D-dimer standardization are compounded by instability of D-dimer antigen after freeze-drying, described in this report. Fibrin degradation products added to plasma and stabilized by trehalose are not suitable as a standard for D-dimer measurement harmonization. Trehalose stabilization of pooled patient plasma containing high D-dimer levels may produce a useful standard, but this requires confirmation.

### Response to the comment: "Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: constructive perspectives and comments on "How we manage a high D-dimer" [^111C8uTr]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

We would like to thank Gonzaga and de Alencas for their letter. Their comments on our review article "How we manage a high D-dimer" recently published in Haema-tologicaare reasonable and well circumstantiated. The main objective of our review was to simplify the particularly complex topic of increased D-dimer levels in order to provide a handy tool for the daily clinical practice of hematologists. The authors made two comments to our narrative review. We agree with Gonzaga and de Alencas's first comment that D-dimer may carry a high positive predictive value in selected pathological conditions characterized by a very high pre-test probability. However, in our review we referred (always for reasons of practicality) to the main clinical setting for which the D-dimer is used which is pulmonary embolism exclusion. In this setting, to ensure optimal patient management, an ideal D-dimer test should have very high sensitivity and a very high negative predictive value.

Regarding the second comment on the inappropriateness and overuse of the D-dimer test in most cases, we also agree with the authors. Unfortunately, the D-dimer test has become very common practice, at least in Italy, and its use has exponentially increased over the last few years (hence the nickname "D-dimeritis"), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear, however, that an elevated D-dimer in an individual referred by the general practitioner to the hematologist cannot be ignored, but all the diagnostic procedures listed in Figure 3 of our reviewhave to be implemented to rule out or diagnose the possible underlying conditions associated with an increased D-di-mer. We agree that educating general practitioners on the appropriateness of prescribing D-dimer tests is needed, but that would lead only to a mid- to long-term response.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^114h5iwC]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of D-dimer for the diagnosis of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) has been the object of research in the last 20 years. A systematic review and meta-analysis by

Table 1.
Pathological and non-pathological conditions associated with high D-dimer levels.

Dentali and colleagues (14 studies including 1,134 patients) found high sensitivity and specificity for D-dimer (93.9% and 89.7%, respectively) in patients with suspected CVT. Another meta-analysis performed by Alons et al. (8 studies including 636 patients) showed that D-dimer had a high negative predictive value for CVT in low-risk patients (defined as those with normal neurological examination, normal standard head CT scan, and absence of such risk factors as puerperium and pregnancy) with isolated headache. A recent prospective study proposed a new score that, combining clinical data with normal D-dimer (i.e. < 500 µg/L), was very effective in predicting CVT, thus reducing unnecessary neuroimaging. Finally, the current view is that D-dimer testing should not be recommended as a first-line diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis in unusual sites (upper limbs, retinal veins, abdominal veins).

### High D-dimer levels at presentation in patients with venous thromboembolism is a marker of adverse clinical outcomes [^114ABVcM]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Qualitative D-dimer results, together with clinical probability scores, are well established in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The predictive value of quantitative D-dimer levels for various clinical outcomes in VTE patients is not fully understood. D-dimer levels obtained at presentation were analysed in 699 (360 men; 339 women) VTE patients for survival and occurrence of malignancy. Patients were followed for a median of 23 months. 17.2% patients had a D-dimer level > 8000 ng FEU/mlat presentation, which was associated with decreased overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and event-free survival (EFS) (P < 0.001). 25.4% patients had malignancy and 4% subsequently developed malignancy following VTE. 29.9% of patients with VTE and malignancy had a D-dimer level > 8 mg/l when compared with 13.4% of patients with VTE without malignancy (P < 0.001). 50% of patients who developed subsequent malignancy following VTE had a presentation D-dimer > 8000 ng FEU/mlas compared with 13.3% of patients with VTE with out malignancy (P = 0.009). In conclusion, D-dimer > 8000 ng FEU/ml at presentation in patients with VTE is a marker of poor OS, EFS and underlying malignancy. Consideration of screening for malignancy is recommended in patients with VTE with a presentation D-dimer > 8000 ng FEU/ml and age > 60 years.

### Pragmatic classification of the causes of high D-dimer [^114bxxnR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common preventable cause of in-hospital death and D-dimer (DD) is one of the essential diagnostic tools for it. Each risk factor for VTE can raise DD and they are numerous: 24 listed in 2008 European Guidelines. Acute coronary syndrome and stroke increase DD concentration, too. Thus, all three most important causes of cardiovascular death are capable of raising DD. Recent evidence suggests DD as a sensitive marker also for acute aortic dissection. Many other processes may raise DD concentration: atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, etc. The adequate DD interpretation is additionally important due to the frequent usage of the test (probably millions of times a year in the world). Simple and concise classification is much easier to remember and such one is suggested.

### Is stand-alone D-dimer testing safe to rule out acute pulmonary embolism? [^114UCWnd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials A stand-alone D-dimer below 750 μg/L has been proposed to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This was a post-hoc analysis on data from 6 studies comprising 7268 patients with suspected PE. The negative predictive value of a D-dimer < 750 μg/L ranged from 79% to 96% in various subgroups. Stand-alone D-dimer testing seems to be unsafe to rule out PE in all patients.

Summary

Background Recently, stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L -1 has been proposed as a safe and efficient approach to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE), without additional imaging, but this approach needs validation. Objectives To evaluate stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L -1 to rule out PE. Methods Individual data from 7268 patients with suspected PE previously enrolled in six prospective management studies were used. Patients were assessed by the Wells rule followed by quantitative D-dimer testing in those with a 'PE unlikely' score. Patients were classified post hoc as having a negative (< 750 μg L -1) or positive (≥ 750 μg L -1) D-dimer. Using a one-stage meta-analytic approach, the negative predictive value (NPV) of stand-alone D-dimer testing was evaluated overall and in different risk subgroups. Results The pooled incidence of PE was 23% (range, 13–42%). Overall, 44% of patients had a D-dimer < 750 μg L -1, of whom 2.8% were diagnosed with PE at baseline or during 3-month follow-up (NPV, 97.2%; 95% confidence interval, 94.9–98.5). The NPV was highest in patients with a low probability of PE according to the Wells rule (99.2%; 95% CI, 98.6–99.5%) and lowest in those with a high probability of PE (79.3%; 95% CI, 53.0–92.8%). The NPVs in patients with active cancer, patients with previous venous thromboembolism and inpatients were 96.2% (95% CI, 85.6–99.1%), 94.7% (95% CI, 88.6–97.6%) and 92.7% (95% CI, 79.3–97.7%), respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L -1 is not safe to rule out acute PE.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^116gCFFG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

### D-dimer specificity and clinical context: an old unlearned story [^115pUABF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the D-dimer dose adjustment of anticoagulant prophylaxis has not been proven effective even in COVID-19 patients, although some scientific societies suggest the possibility of stratifying patients based on serum D-dimer levels. This strategy's rationale is at least controversial: even in overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the D-dimer is unreliable since its specificity varies considerably with the cut-off value. Approximately 20% of patients with a D-dimer value greater than 2.2 μg/mL do not have DIC.

Finally, it should be considered that the ISTH SSC on Fibrinolysis group has identified several technical pitfalls detected in current studies on D-dimer in COVID-19 cases.

In conclusion, D-Dimer guided-anticoagulation management does not seem supported enough by evidence-based recommendations. Studies that specifically address this issue are needed before evidence-based recommendations can be made.

### The D-dimer level predicts the prognosis in patients with lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LWNgA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Though fibrinolytic and coagulation activation systems have been reported to boost tumor growth through different mechanisms, including promoting angiogenesis, suppressing apoptosis of tumor cells, the mechanism association between the plasma D-dimer level and the aggressiveness of lung cancer remains unclear. Shiina et al. found that tumors in the high D-dimer group frequently invaded vessels. Our subgroup analysis about tumor stage (III + IV/total > 80%) finding high D-dimer level had a worse prognosis of OS and PFS, indicating that D-dimer levels are associated with tumor invasion metastasis. Although high D-dimer levels might be lead to vessel injury due to tumor aggressiveness, the connection between the plasma D-dimer level and vessel invasion is unclear, and more detailed research is needed. Many studies believe that HR > 2 indicates a prognostic biomarker in practical setting. When subgroup analysis of OS was performed according to different treatment methods, the OS HR of non-surgical patients was higher than 2. This indicates that D-dimer has a stronger predictive value in non-surgical patients, which is consistent with the following report that progression-free survival was significantly worse in patients with high D-dimer levels than normal levels at different time points before and after chemotherapy.

Higher heterogeneity was found in our meta-analysis for OS and PFS of the prognostic role of D-dimer (P < 0.001, I² = 72.1%, P = 0.003, I² = 69.1%). To remove these biases, subgroup analyses were performed by the different nations, detecting methods, disease stage, histological type, and different treatments. When we grouped the analysis into III + IV/total < 80% groups, immunoturbidimetry assay group, and Europe group, the heterogeneity for OS could shrink to 47.4%,44.1%, and 0. Heterogeneity in other subgroups can be reduced or eliminated accordingly.

Several limitations should be addressed in our meta-analysis. First, our meta-analysis could only include retrospective cohort studies with limited sample size and patient selection bias for analysis. As a result, the statistical power of our meta-analysis could be decreased. Second, the main outcomes could not be fully obtained from all these original studies, and PFS cannot be tested for publication bias due to insufficient data. Moreover, D-dimer levels were measured only once which may result in errors. In conclusion, more prospective research with larger sample size is executed to confirm the further relationship between preoperative D-dimer molecular markers and prognostic characteristics.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cYYWv]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

D-dimer concentrations are highly sensitive for thrombus formation. Hence D-dimer tests are often used to rule-out venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in suspected patients with a non-high clinical probability. Patients with a high clinical probability do not require a D-dimer test. In these patients imaging examination is warranted to confirm or refute the diagnosis, irrespective of the D-dimer results (fig 1). However, D-dimer concentrations increase with age, which leads to a high proportion of older patients with D-dimer concentrations higher than conventional cut-off values (500 µg/L). This in turn leads to a low specificity (that is, more false positive results) of D-dimer testing in older patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism; the specificity is 49% to 67% for patients aged less than 50 years but in older old patients (≥ 80 years) between 0% and 18%. As imaging is indicated in patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism with a D-dimer concentration above the cut-off value, a high proportion of older patients with a non-high clinical probability undergo unnecessary diagnostic investigations. This can be burdensome, especially in older patients, and the yield of this imaging is relatively low (typically 20% or less of patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism are actually affected). As a result of a low specificity of D-dimer testing in older patients, some authors dissuade doctors from D-dimer testing in very old patients. Yet this would actually imply referring all suspected older patients for imaging, which is even less desirable.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^11693TVn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians best practice advice — evaluation of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE): Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered. Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should use age adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted. Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff. Clinicians should obtain imaging with CTPA in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve V/Q scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### D-dimer specificity and clinical context: an old unlearned story [^114H9c8p]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

D-dimer, a degradation product of activated fibrin, is considered a sensitive biomarker for thromboembolic events. Unfortunately, the D-dimer does not show as much specificity. Other conditions than venous thrombosis can also raise D-dimer level, such as pregnancy, renal failure, sepsis. An elevated D-dimer value is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism. Plasma D-dimers levels could be determined by the lysis of extra-vascular rather than intra-vascular fibrin. In the ADJUST-PE study, approximately 10% of patients with an age-adjusted D-dimer above the significant cut-off showed no angiographic evidence of pulmonary embolism. In a cohort of 98 patients, Kutinsky et al. found 12 with D-dimer > 500 ng/mL who had no angiographic evidence of pulmonary embolism and 8 with D-dimer < 250 ng/mL who did have pulmonary embolism.

D-dimer has a negative prognostic role in the COVID-19 patient's population. Numerous studies confirm this value, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. A component responsible for high D-dimer levels could be a peculiar form of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Up to 40% of patients with COVID-19 have some form of thromboembolism (i.e. DVT or PE). However, as many as 76% of patients have an elevated D-dimer.

We read the review by Susen et al. which identifies D-dimer as a reliable guide for the dosage of anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients. Due to the previously mentioned limitations, this strategy has never been validated, even for non-COVID-19 patients. Some authors proposed a low molecular weight heparin prophylactic regimen adjusted-doses based on D-dimer levels in some specific non-COVID-19 populations. However, these populations are not comparable to the COVID-19 patients.

### Use of different D-dimer levels to exclude venous thromboembolism depending on clinical pretest probability [^115zBrs6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, the same D-dimer cut-off point is used to define a positive result for all patients with suspected venous thromboembolism, regardless of their pretest probability. However, use of a relatively high D-dimer cut-off point (lower sensitivity) for those with a low clinical pretest probability, and a low D-dimer cut-off point (higher sensitivity) for those with a high clinical pretest probability, may be preferable. To determine if using three different D-dimer cut-off points according to low, moderate or high clinical pretest probability has greater utility for exclusion of venous thromboembolism than using the same single D-dimer cut-off point in all patients. Data from a previously published study of 571 patients was used to identify the highest D-dimer cut-off point with a negative predictive value of at least 98% for the subgroup of patients with low and high pretest probability. The D-dimer cut-off point for those with moderate clinical pretest probability remained unchanged [0.5 fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) microgram mL(-1)]. Accuracy of D-dimer testing for venous thromboembolism using three cut-off points vs. one cut-off point was than determined. D-dimer cut-off points of 0.2 and 2.1 FEU microgram mL(-1) were selected for the high and low pretest probability groups, respectively. When three pretest probability-specific cut-off points were used instead of the previously determined single D-dimer cut-off point (0.5 FEU microgram mL(-1)), sensitivity and negative predictive value were unchanged (95 and 98%, respectively), but specificity increased from 44.7 to 60.4% (P < 0.001). This resulted in exclusion of venous thromboembolism in 80 additional patients. Use of three pretest probability-specific D-dimer cut-off points rather than a single D-dimer cut-off point for all patients, has the potential to increase the utility of D-dimer testing for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.

### Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and treatment [^111xvSaT]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer result is sufficient to exclude DVT in patients with low pretest probability of DVT. Recognize that a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer result can exclude PE in moderate-risk patients with possible PE.

### Nonspecific tests for pulmonary embolism [^112nfW7r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Many tests have been proposed as useful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected PE, but nonspecific tests for PE can only add to the level of suspicion one has for the diagnosis. As Anderson indicates, "virtually all clinical and laboratory findings neither diagnose nor exclude the diagnosis of PE. They merely serve to heighten suspicion of the diagnosis and prompt the clinician to pursue additional diagnostic studies". D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy out-patients, and further study and improvements in technology, can clarify the usefulness of the different methods of performing this assay. For now, diagnostic algorithms for PE should continue to incorporate multiple tests and decision points, but the standard remains specialized imaging techniques.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115j6zVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### D-dimer testing: the role of the clinical laboratory in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115n9rxw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common, yet often unsuspected and unrecognised disease associated with a high mortality. New, objective, "user friendly" and cost effective diagnostic strategies are being explored. D-dimers, the fibrinolytic degradation products of crosslinked fibrin, have emerged as the most useful of the procoagulant activity and ongoing fibrinolysis markers. D-dimer measurements are very sensitive in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the setting of normal values, a low clinical suspicion, and non-diagnostic lung scans. Several assays have been developed and are reviewed.

### Role of fibrin D-dimer testing in emergency medicine [^114Q7wUS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Systemic values of the fibrinolytic plasma marker fibrin D-dimer are raised in a variety of acute clinical conditions. D-dimer values can now be rapidly determined and used to aid diagnosis in emergency medicine. However, despite clinical guidelines, inappropriate and unnecessary measurement of D-dimer values is a significant clinical problem. An understanding of the pathophysiological basis and limitations of the value of D-dimer values may help reduce this problem. This review discusses the pathophysiology of the fibrinolytic system. The currently used assays, clinical indications, and limitations of D-dimer measurement are reviewed. Finally, the potential future clinical indications for measurement of D-dimer values in emergency medicine are discussed.

Methods

Literature on D-dimer was identified from Medline, along with cross referencing from the reference lists of major articles on the subject

Results

and conclusions: Systemic D-dimer values aids diagnosis, and is potentially a prognostic indicator, in a variety of clinical conditions in emergency medicine. However, it has limited specificity in patients with comorbid conditions. Although, currently, there is no standard D-dimer assay, immunoturbidimetric assays are the most suitable for use in emergency medicine

### D-dimer for the exclusion of acute venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^114NcPTj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Despite extensive literature, the diagnostic role of d-dimer for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unclear, reflecting multiple d-dimer assays and concerns about differing sensitivities and variability.

Purpose

To systematically review trials that assessed sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and variability among d-dimer assays.

Data Sources

Studies in all languages were identified by searching PubMed from 1983 to January 2003 and EMBASE from 1988 to January 2003.

Study Selection

The researchers selected prospective studies that compared d-dimer with a reference standard. Studies of high methodologic quality were included in the primary analyses; sensitivity analysis included additional weaker studies.

Data Extraction

Two authors collected data on study-level factors: d-dimer assay used, cutoff value, and whether patients had suspected DVT or PE.

Data Synthesis

For DVT, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative rapid ELISA dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.96 (95% confidence limit [CL], 0.91 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.12 (CL, 0.04 to 0.33); and sensitivity, 0.96 (CL, 0.90 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.09 (CL, 0.02 to 0.41), respectively. For PE, the ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA also dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.85 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.03 to 0.58); and sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.83 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.02 to 0.84), respectively. The ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA have negative likelihood ratios that yield a high certainty for excluding DVT or PE. The positive likelihood values, which are in the general range of 1.5 to 2.5, do not greatly increase the certainty of diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses do not affect these findings.

Limitations

Although many studies evaluated multiple d-dimer assays, findings are based largely on indirect comparisons of test performance characteristics across studies.

Conclusion

The ELISAs in general dominate the comparative ranking among the d-dimer assays for sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio. For excluding PE or DVT, a negative result on quantitative rapid ELISA is as diagnostically useful as a normal lung scan or negative duplex ultrasonography finding.

### Sex-related differences in D-dimer levels for venous thromboembolism screening [^114SDqcS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

D-dimer is generally considered positive above 0.5 mg/L irrespective of sex. However, women have been shown to be more likely to have a positive D-dimer after controlling for other factors. Thus, differences may exist between males and females for using D-dimer as a marker of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. We hypothesized that the accuracy of D-dimer tests may be enhanced by using appropriate cutoff values that reflect sex-related differences in D-dimer levels.

Methods

This research is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, international, prospective, observational study of adult (18+ years) patients suspected of VTE, with low-to-intermediate pretest probability based on Wells criteria ≤ 6 for pulmonary embolism (PE) and ≤ 2 for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). VTE diagnoses were based on computed tomography, ventilation perfusion scanning, or venous ultrasound. D-dimer levels were tested for statistical difference across groups stratified by sex and diagnosis. Multivariable regression was used to investigate sex as a predictor of diagnosis. Sex-specific optimal D-dimer thresholds for PE and DVT were calculated from receiver operating characteristic analyses. A Youden threshold (D-dimer level coinciding with the maximum of sensitivity plus specificity) and a cutoff corresponding to 95% sensitivity were calculated. Statistical difference for cutoffs was tested via 95% confidence intervals from 2,000 bootstrapped samples.

Results

We included 3,586 subjects for analysis, of whom 61% were female. Race demographics were 63% White, 27% Black/African American, and 6% Hispanic. In the suspected PE cohort, 6% were diagnosed with PE, while in the suspected DVT cohort, 11% were diagnosed with DVT. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in males than females for the PE-positive group and the DVT-negative group, but males had significantly lower D-dimer levels than females in the PE-negative group. Regression models showed male sex as a significant positive predictor of DVT diagnosis, controlling for D-dimer levels. The Youden thresholds for PE patients were 0.97 (95% CI = 0.64 to 1.79) mg/L and 1.45 (95% CI = 1.36 to 1.95) mg/L for females and males, respectively; 95% sensitivity cutoffs for this group were 0.64 (95% CI = 0.20 to 0.89) and 0.55 (95% CI = 0.29 to 1.61). For DVT, the Youden thresholds were 0.98 (95% CI = 0.84 to 1.56) mg/L for females and 1.25 (95% CI = 0.65 to 3.33) mg/L for males with 95% sensitivity cutoffs of 0.33 (95% CI = 0.2 to 0.61) and 0.32 (95% CI = 0.18 to 0.7), respectively.

Conclusion

Differences in D-dimer levels between males and females are diagnosis specific; however, there was no significant difference in optimal cutoff values for excluding PE and DVT between the sexes.

### Selective D-dimer testing for diagnosis of a first suspected episode of deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^116NJWJD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

D-Dimer testing is sensitive but not specific for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Changing the use of testing and the threshold level for a positive test result on the basis of risk for DVT might improve the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and reduce the need for testing.

Objective

To determine whether using a selective D-dimer testing strategy based on clinical pretest probability (C-PTP) for DVT is safe and reduces diagnostic testing compared with using a single D-dimer threshold for all patients.

Design

Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Patients were allocated using a central automated system. Ultrasonographers and study adjudicators but not other study personnel were blinded to trial allocation. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00157677)

Setting

5 Canadian hospitals.

Patients

Consecutive symptomatic patients with a first episode of suspected DVT.

Intervention

Selective testing (n = 860), defined as D-dimer testing for outpatients with low or moderate C-PTP (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 1.0 µg/mL [low C-PTP] or < 0.5 µg/mL [moderate C-PTP]) and venous ultrasonography without D-dimer testing for outpatients with high C-PTP and inpatients, or uniform testing (n = 863), defined as D-dimer testing for all participants (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 0.5 µg/mL).

Measurements

The proportion of patients not diagnosed with DVT during initial testing who had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3-month follow-up and the proportion of patients undergoing D-dimer testing and ultrasonography.

Results

The incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism at 3 months was 0.5% in both study groups (difference, 0.0 percentage point [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8 percentage points]). Selective testing reduced the proportion of patients who required D-dimer testing by 21.8 percentage points (CI, 19.1 to 24.8 percentage points). It reduced the proportion who required ultrasonography by 7.6 percentage points (CI, 2.9 to 12.2 percentage points) overall and by 21.0 percentage points (CI, 14.2 to 27.6 percentage points) in outpatients with low C-PTP.

Limitation

Results may not be generalizable to all D-dimer assays or patients with previous DVT, study personnel were not blinded, and the trial was stopped prematurely.

Conclusion

A selective D-dimer testing strategy seems as safe as and more efficient than having everyone undergo D-dimer testing when diagnosing a first episode of suspected DVT.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on thromboembolic events in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: a randomized clinical trial [^1145L4PW]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study MODIGLIA-NI was published by Yonathan Freund and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the trial question was: what is the effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in ED patients with suspected PE? In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the population was: 1414 patients (823 female, 591 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PE rule-out criteria rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE. The key exclusion criteria were high or low clinical probability of PE; pregnancy; other obvious cause for chest pain, syncope or dyspnea; concurrent anticoagulation treatment. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the interventions were: n = 648 modified diagnostic strategy (use of YEARS rule combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing) n = 623 a conventional diagnostic strategy (test with D-dimer using the age-adjusted threshold level). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in VTE at 3 months (0.15% vs. 0.8%; AD -0.64%, 97.5% CI -Infinity to 0.21). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in need of chest imaging (30.4% vs. 40%; AD -8.7%, 95% CI -13.8 to -3.5) Significant increase in ED median length of stay (6 hours vs. 6 hours; AD 1.6 hours, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.9). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PE rule-out criteria rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE, modified diagnostic strategy was noninferior to a conventional diagnostic strategy with respect to VTE at 3 months.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jpuht]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients (> 50 years) with suspected venous thromboembolism, using conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

Design

Systematic review and bivariate random effects meta-analysis.

Data Sources

We searched Medline and Embase for studies published before 21 June 2012 and we contacted the authors of primary studies.

Study Selection

Primary studies that enrolled older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism in whom D-dimer testing, using both conventional (500 µg/L) and age adjusted (age × 10 µg/L) cut-off values, and reference testing were performed. For patients with a non-high clinical probability, 2 × 2 tables were reconstructed and stratified by age category and applied D-dimer cut-off level.

Results

13 cohorts including 12,497 patients with a non-high clinical probability were included in the meta-analysis. The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age, from 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) in patients aged 51–60 years to 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) in those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7% in those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in those aged > 80. Age adjusted cut-off values revealed higher specificities over all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

Conclusions

The application of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity without modifying sensitivity, thereby improving the clinical utility of D-dimer testing in patients aged 50 or more with a non-high clinical probability.

### D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113SBb8a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

For more than 2 decades, the plasma D-dimer assay has been used in conjunction with clinical prediction scores to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with a low pretest probability of having this condition without the need for more costly and invasive methods. The increased thrombotic risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (ie, those with high pretest probability of PE) and increased D-dimer levels in the absence of thrombosis diverge considerably from the study population used to originally validate this assay. However, the availability of D-dimer samples routinely collected from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the heterogeneity of early, smaller studies generated uncertainty regarding the clinical utility of the assay in this setting. Therefore, we conducted a diagnostic accuracy study to characterize the performance of D-dimer using various threshold values to exclude PE among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

### D-dimer test for excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^117TJSyF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur when a thrombus (blood clot) travels through the veins and lodges in the arteries of the lungs, producing an obstruction. People who are thought to be at risk include those with cancer, people who have had a recent surgical procedure or have experienced long periods of immobilisation and women who are pregnant. The clinical presentation can vary, but unexplained respiratory symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain and an increased respiratory rate are common.D-dimers are fragments of protein released into the circulation when a blood clot breaks down as a result of normal body processes or with use of prescribed fibrinolytic medication. The D-dimer test is a laboratory assay currently used to rule out the presence of high D-dimer plasma levels and, by association, venous thromboembolism (VTE). D-dimer tests are rapid, simple and inexpensive and can prevent the high costs associated with expensive diagnostic tests.

Objectives

To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute PE in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) settings who have had a pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined according to a clinical prediction rule (CPR), by estimating the accuracy of the test according to estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment.

Search Methods

We searched 13 databases from conception until December 2013. We cross-checked the reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently applied exclusion criteria to full papers and resolved disagreements by discussion. We included cross-sectional studies of D-dimer in which ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA) were used as the reference standard.•

Participants

Adults who were managed in hospital outpatient and A&E settings and were suspected of acute PE were eligible for inclusion in the review if they had received a pre-test probability score based on a CPR.•

Index Tests

quantitative, semi quantitative and qualitative D-dimer tests.• Target condition: acute symptomatic PE.• Reference standards: We included studies that used pulmonary angiography, V/Q scintigraphy, CTPA and MRPA as reference standard tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). We resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors extracted patient-level data when available to populate 2 × 2 contingency tables (true-positives (TPs), true-negatives (TNs), false-positives (FPs) and false-negatives (FNs)).

Main Results

We included four studies in the review (n = 1585 patients). None of the studies were at high risk of bias in any of the QUADAS-2 domains, but some uncertainty surrounded the validity of studies in some domains for which the risk of bias was uncertain. D-dimer assays demonstrated high sensitivity in all four studies, but with high levels of false-positive results, especially among those over the age of 65 years. Estimates of sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100%, and estimates of specificity from 23% to 63%.

Authors' Conclusions

A negative D-dimer test is valuable in ruling out PE in patients who present to the A&E setting with a low PTP. Evidence from one study suggests that this test may have less utility in older populations, but no empirical evidence was available to support an increase in the diagnostic threshold of interpretation of D-dimer results for those over the age of 65 years.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^111AEke3]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU anticoagulation and D-dimer — For venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) whenever available, and although some clinicians advocate intermediate-dosing LMWH or UFH for adults with severe or critical COVID-19 there are no published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing conventional dosing to intermediate-dosing prophylaxis. It remains unclear whether therapeutic anticoagulation should be administered to COVID-19 patients without VTE, and a pilot RCT randomized 20 hospitalized mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer to receive either full-dose anticoagulation with enoxaparin or prophylactic-dose UFH or enoxaparin but was underpowered to detect meaningful differences. In a U.S. cohort of 3,334 hospitalized patients, 829 were admitted to the ICU; in this study, male sex and elevated D-dimer were the only variables significantly associated with VTE, and a D-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng/mL was associated with an HR of 32 (95% CI 17.2 to 61.9) for VTE. Although D-dimer levels were elevated in patients with and without VTE, median D-dimer was higher in pulmonary embolism cases (1,748 ng/mL; IQR 398 to 10,000) compared with those without VTE (414 ng/mL; IQR 268 to 768). Because different assays measure D-dimer with different diagnostic utility and a decision process based on D-dimer levels needs to be better studied before clinicians adopt empiric anticoagulation — especially since elevated D-dimer could also indicate bleeding — clinical evaluation is crucial before making decisions based on laboratory values. Considering the uncertainty in the absence of VTE, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials.

### Is D-dimer used according to clinical algorithms in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspicion of venous thromboembolism? A study in six European countries [^111mh2wu]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical algorithms consisting of pre-test probability estimation and D-dimer testing are recommended in diagnostic work-up for suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to explore how physicians working in emergency departments investigated patients suspected to have VTE.

Materials and Methods

A questionnaire with two case histories related to the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) (Case A) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (Case B) were sent to physicians in six European countries. The physicians were asked to estimate pre-test probability of VTE, and indicate their clinical actions.

Results

In total, 487 physicians were included. Sixty percent assessed pre-test probability of PE to be high in Case A, but 7% would still request only D-dimer and 11% would exclude PE if D-dimer was negative, which could be hazardous. Besides imaging, a D-dimer test was requested by 41%, which is a "waste of resources" (extra costs and efforts, no clinical benefit). For Case B, 92% assessed pre-test probability of DVT to be low. Correctly, only D-dimer was requested by 66% of the physicians, while 26% requested imaging, alone or in addition to D-dimer, which is a "waste of resources".

Conclusions

These results should encourage scientific societies to improve the dissemination and knowledge of the current recommendations for the diagnosis of VTE.

### Emergency department D-dimer testing [^117FvG6L]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Since the early 1980s, much attention has been paid to the development of a biochemical marker for venous thromboembolism. D-dimers are derivatives of fibrinolysis and recently have been touted as a means of screening for thromboemoblism. We review the physiologic, pathologic, and chemical bases for this new test, and outline the specific D-dimer assays currently available. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical utility of D-dimer in the evaluation of patients with venous thromboembolism.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KVDRH]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Others have argued for increasing the D-dimer cut-off value in older patients to improve the specificity and thereby increase the number of patients in whom — based on a D-dimer level below the cut-off value — imaging could be avoided. An age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value that increases gradually with age especially showed a promising increase in specificity without substantial loss of safety. This age adjusted cut-off value was defined as age (years)×10 μg/L for patients aged over 50 years (for example, for a patient aged 78 years, the D-dimer concentration would be considered normal below 780 μg/L). The age adjusted cut-off value was derived from a cohort of secondary care patients with a non-high probability of pulmonary embolism. This cohort was subdivided into 10 year age groups and the optimal cut-off value was selected for each age group — that is, the cut-off value with a sensitivity of 100% and the highest accompanying specificity. This revealed an increase of the optimal cut-off value of approximately 100 μg/L per decade (10 μg/L per year). This age adjusted cut-off value was subsequently validated in secondary care patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and in both primary and secondary care cohorts of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. However, higher cut-off values may also lead to an increased percentage of false negative cases (that is, missed cases of venous thromboembolism), which might make this strategy less safe. Since venous thromboembolism has a high short term mortality rate in older patients, doctors do not always get the chance to reconsider a missed diagnosis.

Controversy therefore remains on the utility of D-dimer testing (either using the conventional or higher cut-off values) to safely exclude venous thromboembolism in a substantial proportion of older patients. A formal systematic review increases the evidence base on this topic; a meta-analysis can provide more precise estimates of the accuracy of D-dimer testing among clinically relevant subgroups, whereby sources for interstudy heterogeneity can be considered. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing for excluding suspected venous thromboembolism in older patients, with a particular interest in whether increasing the threshold for test positivity using the proposed age adjusted manner is a safe and more efficient strategy than using the conventional cut-off value.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of pretest probability, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer result is sufficient to exclude DVT in patients with low pretest probability of DVT. Recognize that a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer result can exclude PE in moderate-risk patients with possible PE.

### High D-dimer level is associated with increased 15-D and 3 months mortality through a more central localization of pulmonary emboli and serious comorbidity [^114AqMZ3]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

High D-dimer levels are predictors of death in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), as are more proximally located, larger emboli. The direct link between these three has not yet been described. A cohort of 674 consecutive patients with confirmed PE was studied. Patients were followed up for 3 months. D-dimer levels were measured only in patients with an unlikely clinical probability (n = 262). The odds ratio (OR) for death of all variables was calculated. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for mortality. The best predictive D-dimer cut-off point for mortality was a concentration > 3000 ng/ml FEU (OR 7.29). High D-dimer levels were correlated with active malignancy and age over 65 years, both being indicators of 3-month mortality. High D-dimer levels were also correlated with centrally located pulmonary emboli and 15-d mortality. The combination of high D-dimer levels and central emboli increased early mortality risk by 2.2. High D-dimer levels in patients with an unlikely clinical probability were associated with fatal outcome after PE. Centrally located pulmonary emboli were associated with higher D-dimer levels and worse 15-d mortality. Active malignancy, being an inpatient at time of diagnosis and age over 65 years were associated with higher D-dimer levels and worse 3-month survival.

### Decision-making with D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115qeJk9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement of D-dimer can provide useful information to aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement in conjunction with adequate estimation of pretest probability can facilitate the safe discharge of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and limit unnecessary investigation or anticoagulation. We review clinical decision-making strategies in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and propose means to minimize diagnostic error that might arise from knowledge of the D-dimer result prior to clinical assessment.

### Can causes of false-normal D-dimer test [simpliRED] results be identified? [^116ntJwo]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Background

To simplify the diagnostic strategy of patients suspected for venous thromboembolism, the use of D-dimer tests has been advocated. Very important for the safety of such diagnostic strategies would be the capacity to recognise false-normal D-dimer results, in order to prevent inadequately withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients who actually have the disease. Insight in the causes of false-normal D-dimer results would therefore be necessary. We hypothesised that certain patient characteristics are associated with relatively low plasma D-dimer levels and, therefore, could increase the risk of false-normal results.

Methods

Consecutive patients with an objectively confirmed venous thromboembolic event and an independently obtained false-normal SimpliRED D-dimer test result were included in the study. For each patient, two controls with objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism and an adequate abnormal D-dimer result were selected. Baseline patient characteristics, obtained by standardised questionnaires, were compared between the two groups of patients.

Results

In total, 686 patients had a venous thromboembolic event and 47 of these patients had a false-normal SimpliRED result. Therefore, the overall sensitivity of the SimpliRED test for venous thromboembolism was 94% (95% CI: 92–95%). Although the prevalence of certain clinical characteristics was significantly higher in patients with a false-normal D-dimer result than in the controls [odds ratios for (LMW)heparin treatment and symptoms lasting more than 10 days: 5.1 (95% CI: 1.5–18.7) and 3.2 (95% CI:1.4–7.4), respectively], the prevalence of these characteristics was also high in the control group with an adequate abnormal D-dimer. Combining two or more of these characteristics had a low prevalence and did not further improve the ability to identify those patients with a false-normal D-dimer test at presentation.

Conclusions

Although these findings clearly indicate an association between certain baseline clinical characteristics and the occurrence of a false-normal SimpliRED test, the clinical utility for these characteristics is limited.

### Missed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off value [^114SmvF9]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially severe diagnosis with high short-term mortality. Recently, age-adjusted cut-off values (age × 10 μg/l) of D-dimer were introduced to improve the diagnostic workup in older patients. In clinical practice, PE is considered 'ruled out' in patients with a non-high clinical probability and a normal D-dimer. However, all diagnostic tests have a small false-negative rate. This small probability of misdiagnosis might be easily overlooked by clinicians when using simplified dichotomized flow charts. This case illustrates a normal D-dimer (age-adjusted) but with a PE. We recommend clinicians using the D-dimer test-either conventional or age-adjusted in a rule-out strategy to be aware of the-albeit small probability of a false-negative result.

### Clinical decision rules and D-dimer in venous thromboembolism: current controversies and future research priorities [^117FxJSs]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially lethal clinical condition that is suspected in patients with common clinical complaints, in many and varied, clinical care settings. Once VTE is diagnosed, optimal therapeutic management (thrombolysis, IVC filters, type and duration of anticoagulants) and ideal therapeutic management settings (outpatient, critical care) are also controversial. Clinical prediction tools, including clinical decision rules and D-Dimer, have been developed, and some validated, to assist clinical decision making along the diagnostic and therapeutic management paths for VTE. Despite these developments, practice variation is high and there remain many controversies in the use of the clinical prediction tools. In this narrative review, we highlight challenges and controversies in VTE diagnostic and therapeutic management with a focus on clinical decision rules and D-Dimer.

### Assessing recurrence risk following acute venous thromboembolism: use of algorithms [^115vYkQU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a chronic disease, associated with a significant rate of recurrence, lower in patients with events provoked by transient risk factors and higher in unprovoked cases. Short-term treatment is indicated for provoked VTE, long-term treatment should be considered for unprovoked. The aim of this review is to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence and the decisional algorithms available to guide patients' management.

Recent Findings

To identify patients who carry a high recurrent risk and require long-term treatment, three algorithms have been proposed: the HERDOO2, the Vienna prediction model, and the DASH score. All identify male sex and elevated D-dimer levels as important risk factors for recurrence. However, important differences among the models should be outlined: in the HERDOO2 model, D-dimer levels are measured during anticoagulation and not after its withdrawal; furthermore, it indicates age greater than 65 as a risk factor for recurrence, whereas the DASH score attributes a higher risk to age less than 50. The Vienna model is complex for routine use.

Summary

Further studies are needed to clarify these discrepancies. A management study based on D-dimer levels after anticoagulation withdrawal is ongoing and could indicate a simple way to safely manage these patients.

### Does this patient have deep vein thrombosis? [^112khAkj]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have nonspecific signs and symptoms. Missed DVT diagnosis may result in fatal pulmonary embolism. Since many patients may have DVT, a selective and efficient diagnostic process is needed.

Objective

To systematically review trials that determined the prevalence of DVT using clinical prediction rules either with or without D-dimer, for the diagnosis of DVT.

Data Sources

English- and French-language studies were identified from MEDLINE from 1990 to July 2004 and supplemented by a review of all relevant bibliographies.

Study Selection

We included studies that prospectively enrolled consecutive, unselected outpatients with suspected DVT and applied clinical prediction rules before D-dimer testing or diagnostic imaging. All studies included sufficient information to allow the calculation of the prevalence of DVT for at least 1 of the 3 clinical probability estimates (low, moderate, or high). We required that patients be followed up for a minimum 3-month period. Unless the clinical model incorporated prior DVT, studies were excluded if patients with a history of prior DVT were enrolled.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the prevalence of DVT, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of D-dimer in each of the 3 clinical probability estimates. Data for the D-dimer in all studies were pooled and analyzed as high-sensitivity/low-specificity test or a moderate-sensitivity/moderate-specificity test.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen studies involving more than 8000 patients used 1 clinical prediction rule for diagnosing DVT, of which 11 incorporated D-dimer testing in the diagnostic algorithm. The prevalence of DVT in the low, moderate, and high clinical probability groups was 5.0% (95% CI, 4.0%-8.0%), 17% (95% CI, 13%-23%), and 53% (95% CI, 44%-61%), respectively. The overall prevalence of DVT was 19% (95% CI, 16%-23%). Pooling all studies, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative LRs of D-dimer testing in the low probability group were 88% (95% CI, 81%-92%), 72% (95% CI, 65%-78%), and 0.18% (95% CI, 0.12–0.18); in the moderate probability group: 90% (95% CI, 80%-95%), 58% (95% CI, 49%-67%), and 0.19% (95% CI, 0.11–0.32); and in the high probability group: 92% (95% CI, 85%-96%), 45% (95% CI, 37%-52%), and 0.16% (95% CI, 0.09–0.30). The LRs for a normal result on a high or moderately sensitive D-dimer assay among patients with: (1) low clinical suspicion were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03–0.37) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.12–0.31); (2) moderate clinical suspicion were 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01–0.21) and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13–0.39); and (3) high clinical suspicion were 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03–0.18) and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.10–0.38).

Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy for DVT improves when clinical probability is estimated before diagnostic tests. Patients with low clinical probability on the predictive rule have prevalence of DVT of less than 5%. In low-probability patients with negative D-dimer results, diagnosis of DVT can be excluded without ultrasound; in patients with high clinical suspicion for DVT, results should not affect clinical decisions.

### Appropriate use of D-dimer in hospital patients [^111XAuCs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer, the final product of plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi, has emerged as a simple blood test that can be used in diagnostic algorithms for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism. D-dimer also is used as a part of the diagnostic tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation, where excessive thrombin generation is the key pathophysiological factor. However, there are no robust data available at present on the use of this test to exclude venous thromboembolism in a hospital inpatient. Considerable confusion also exists among physicians about its appropriate use and interpretation in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This article focuses on the available evidence to guide the appropriate use of D-dimer in patients admitted to a hospital.

Remarks instruct providers to weigh thrombosis and bleeding risks; patients at higher thrombosis risk may include those with a significantly elevated D-dimer level defined in studies as 2–4 x the upper limit of normal, prior VTE, or relevant comorbidities, whereas high bleeding risk includes known bleeding within the last 30 days requiring emergency department presentation or hospitalization.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^112Q1i2b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds — nonhigh-risk adult patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) — are commonly based on the patient's age in years (age×10 μg/L) for patients older than 50 years, with most studies using high-sensitivity assays that generally use a conventional cutoff of FEU at 500 μg/L; one study using the HemosIL assay reported results in DDU and used age×5 μg/L. Nonhigh risk refers to a low or intermediate pretest probability or "PE unlikely" using a validated clinical prediction rule, and age-dependent increases in D-dimer reduce specificity with a fixed cutoff in the elderly, leading to unnecessary imaging.

### Questioning the use of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold to exclude venous thromboembolism: analysis of individual patient data from two diagnostic studies [^115mLoQt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials It is unclear if raising the D-dimer level to exclude venous thrombosis in older patients is valid. We compared this 'age-adjusted' strategy with other ways of interpreting D-dimer results. A non-age adjusted increase, and using higher thresholds in younger patients, was just as accurate. Age-adjustment of D-dimer thresholds does not appear to be appropriate. Click to hear Prof. le Gal's presentation on controversies in venous thromboembolism diagnosis SUMMARY: Background Using a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE) with increasing age has been proposed but is not well validated. Objective To determine whether it is appropriate to use a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude VTE with increasing age. Patients/methods We analyzed clinical data and blood samples from 1649 patients with a first suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. We compared the negative predictive values (NPVs) for VTE, and the proportions of patients with a negative D-dimer result, by using three D-dimer interpretation strategies: a progressively higher D-dimer threshold with increasing age (age-adjusted strategy); the same higher D-dimer threshold in all patients (mean D-dimer strategy); and a progressively higher D-dimer threshold with decreasing age (inverse age-adjusted strategy). Results The NPV with the age-adjusted strategy (99.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 99.0–99.9%) was not different from that with the mean D-dimer strategy (99.7%; 95% CI 99.0–99.9%) or that with the inverse age-adjusted strategy (99.8%; 95% CI 99.1–99.9%). The proportion of patients with a negative result with the age-adjusted strategy (50.9%; 95% CI 48.5–53.4%) was not different from the proportion of patients with a negative result with the mean D-dimer strategy (51.7%; 95% CI 49.3–54.1%) or with the inverse age-adjusted strategy (49.5%; 95% CI 47.1–51.9%). Conclusions Our analysis does not support the use of a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude VTE with increasing age.

### D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111KxaN8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This diagnostic study found that all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of PE had plasma D-dimer levels of 0.05 μg/mL or greater. If using D-dimer to exclude patients with PE, the increased values we found among 92.3% of patients suggest that this assay would be less useful than in the populations in which it was originally validated, among which a minority of patients had increased D-dimer values. Setting higher D-dimer thresholds was associated with improved specificity at the cost of an increased false-negative rate that could be associated with an unacceptable patient safety risk. The inclusion of patients with D-dimer and CTPA results was necessary to estimate diagnostic performance; however, this may have introduced selection bias by excluding patients unable to undergo CTPA. Nonetheless, given the high pretest probability of PE and low specificity observed in this and other studies, these results suggest that the use of D-dimer levels to exclude PE among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may be inappropriate and have limited clinical utility.

### Role of combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in COVID-19 treatment: a rapid review [^1157Ez9M]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

D-dimers

When a blood clot is dissolved, D-dimers are disseminated in the blood as a biproduct of coagulated platelet breakdown. Given that coagulopathy is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, it is expected that D-dimer levels might play an important role in diagnosis or monitoring of patients. Current studies observed elevated D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19, ranging from a 2.5-fold to a 6.0-fold increase, with these increased levels predicting mortality and the development of thromboembolic events in patients. Yet, there is no consensus on a specific cut-off level which can accurately predict disease course, mortality or response to antithrombotic therapy. Mouhat et al suggested the use of 2590 ng/mL as threshold level which corresponds to a ≈5-fold increase in normal D-dimer level. This 5-fold increase was associated with a 17-fold increase in the incidence of PE among patients (OR 16.9, 95% CI 6.3 to 45.0, p < 0.001). Similarly, Ventura-Diaz et al reported that a 5.5-fold increase in D-dimer level could predict the occurrence of PE with 81% sensitivity and 59% specificity (p < 0.001), while Ooi et al examined a larger sample of 974 patients and reported that a 4.5-fold increase in D-dimer level would predict the occurrence of PE with a 72% sensitivity and a 74% specificity. Moreover, patients presenting with increased D-dimer levels equivalent to more than fourfolds the normal level exhibit a higher mortality risk when compared with their counterparts, who present with lower levels (OR 10.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 94.38, p = 0.041). These findings were corroborated by Zhang et al, who had similar findings and showed that D-dimer levels ≥ 4 times the normal level could predict mortality with 92.3% sensitivity and 83.3%. specificity (HR 51.5, 95% CI 12.9 to 206.7, p < 0.001). Further research on possible explanations for anticoagulant treatment failure in some patient subgroups is warranted. Collectively, these preliminary findings indicate the possible use of D-dimers to guide treatment regimens and to establish different patient subgroups that should receive personalised treatment. However, the use of D-dimer in clinical settings as a stand-alone marker for COVID-19 thrombosis does not seem practical, as a clear cut-off value cannot be easily established since sensitivity of the test is compromised with age.

### D-dimer can help differentiate suspected pulmonary embolism patients that require anti-coagulation [^1144mq9T]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Determine whether D-dimer concentration in the absence of imaging can differentiate patients that require anti-coagulation from patients who do not require anti-coagulation.

Methods

Data was obtained retrospectively from 366 hemodynamically stable adult ED patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients were categorized by largest occluded artery and aggregated into: 'Require anti-coagulation' (main, lobar, and segmental PE), 'Does not require anti-coagulation' (sub-segmental and No PE), 'High risk of deterioration' (main and lobar PE), and 'Not high risk of deterioration' (segmental, sub-segmental, and No PE) groups. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for 2 sample comparisons of median D-dimer concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to determine a D-dimer cut-off that could differentiate 'Require anti-coagulation' from 'Does not require anti-coagulation' and 'High risk of deterioration' from 'Low risk of deterioration' groups.

Results

The 'Require anti-coagulation' group had a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 at an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 1540 with a specificity of 86% (95% CI, 81–91%), and sensitivity of 84% (79–90%). The 'High risk of deterioration' group had a maximum AUC of 0.93 at an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 2500 with a specificity of 90% (85–93%) and sensitivity of 83% (77–90%).

Conclusions

An age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 1540 ng/mL differentiates suspected PE patients requiring anti-coagulation from those not requiring anti-coagulation. A cut-off of 2500 differentiates those with high risk of clinical deterioration from those not at high risk of deterioration. When correlated with clinical outcomes, these cut-offs can provide an objective method for clinical decision making when imaging is unavailable.

### D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [^1135G5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abnormal coagulation function has been demonstrated to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19. However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study was aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed, and coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis.

Results

In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function, and a significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 μg/ml [interquartile range 0.9–4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3–1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones, on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the current study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.31, p < 0.001) μg/ml compared to those with non-severe disease, and odds of severe infection was associated with D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16–15.44, p < 0.001) on admission.

Conclusions

Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher level of D-dimer than those with non-severe disease, and D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml is associated with severe infection in patients with COVID-19.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114honJt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC performance and D-dimer cutoffs: The PERC are not a screening tool for all patients and should be applied only to very low–risk patients in whom PE is genuinely suspected, and when used in this manner the PERC should decrease the use of d-dimer testing only in patients who would have otherwise been tested. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found the overall proportion of missed PEs by using PERC was 0.3% (46 of 14 844 total cases), the pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), and the pooled specificity was 22%, indicating that 22% of d-dimer tests could have been safely avoided had the PERC been universally applied. To date, most recommendations have considered any value above 499 ng/mL as elevated, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies and 12 497 patients without high pretest probability found that using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for patients older than 50 years (age × 10 ng/mL) maintained a sensitivity for PE above 97% while significantly increasing specificity.

### D-dimer for venous thromboembolism diagnosis: 20 years later [^1134mb7u]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^116Mqtnj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study PROLONG was published by Palareti G and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the PROLONG study, the trial question was: what is the role of D-dimer testing in determining the duration of anticoagulation therapy in patients who had a first idiopathic episode of VTE? In the PROLONG study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PROLONG study, the population was: 223 patients (118 female, 105 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who had received a VKA for at least 3 months and underwent D-dimer testing. The key exclusion criteria were serious liver disease, renal insufficiency, other indications or contraindications for anticoagulation, or a limited life expectancy. In the PROLONG study, the interventions were: n = 120 abnormal D-dimer level with discontinuation of anticoagulation (discontinuation of VKA therapy) n = 103 abnormal D-dimer level with resumption of anticoagulation (resumption of VKA therapy). In the PROLONG study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in recurrence of thromboembolism (15% vs. 2.9%; aHR 4.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 14.6). In the PROLONG study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in deaths. In the PROLONG study, the conclusion was: in patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who had received a VKA for at least 3 months and underwent D-dimer testing, abnormal D-dimer level with discontinuation of anticoagulation was inferior to abnormal D-dimer level with resumption of anticoagulation with respect to recurrence of thromboembolism.

### Utility and limitations of patient-adjusted D-dimer cut-off levels for diagnosis of venous thromboembolism – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RKkNp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To systematically assess test performance of patient-adapted D-dimer cut-offs for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Methods

Systematic review and analysis of articles published in PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases. Investigations assessing patient-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for the exclusion of VTE were included. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model was used to assess diagnostic accuracy. Risk of bias was assessed by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 score.

Results

A total of 68 studies involving 141,880 patients met the inclusion criteria. The standard cut-off revealed a sensitivity of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–0.99) and specificity of 0.23 (95% CI 0.16–0.31). Sensitivity was comparable to the standard cut-off for age-adjustment (0.97 [95% CI 0.96–0.98]) and YEARS algorithm (0.98 [95% CI 0.91–1.00]) but lower for pretest probability (PTP)-adjusted (0.95 [95% CI 0.89–0.98) and COVID-19-adapted thresholds (0.93 [95% CI 0.82–0.98]). Specificity was significantly higher across all adjustment strategies (age: 0.43 [95% CI 0.36–0.50]; PTP: 0.63 [95% CI 0.51–0.73]; YEARS algorithm: 0.65 [95% CI 0.39–0.84]; and COVID-19: 0.51 [95% CI 0.40–0.63]). The YEARS algorithm provided the best negative likelihood ratio (0.03 [95% CI 0.01–0.15]), followed by age-adjusted (both 0.07 [95% CI 0.05–0.09]), PTP (0.08 [95% CI 0.04–0.17), and COVID-19-adjusted thresholds (0.13 [95% CI 0.05–0.32]).

Conclusions

This study indicates that adjustment of D-dimer thresholds to patient-specific factors is safe and embodies considerable potential for reduction of imaging. However, robustness, safety, and efficiency vary considerably among different adjustment strategies with a high degree of heterogeneity.

### Admission D-dimer levels, D-dimer trends, and outcomes in COVID-19 [^1167CMPR]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Observational data suggest an acquired prothrombotic state may contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. These data include elevated D-dimers observed among many COVID-19 patients. We present a retrospective analysis of admission D-dimer, and D-dimer trends, among 1065 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients, across 6 New York Hospitals. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were intubation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Three-hundred-thirteen patients (29.4%) died, 319 (30.0%) required intubation, and 30 (2.8%) had diagnosed VTE. Using Cox proportional-hazard modeling, each 1 μg/ml increase in admission D-dimer level was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95%CI 1.04–1.08, p < 0.0001) for death, 1.08 (95%CI 1.06–1.10, p < 0.0001) for intubation, and 1.08 (95%CI 1.03–1.13, p = 0.0087) for VTE. Time-dependent receiver-operator-curves for admission D-dimer as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areas-under-the-curve of 0.694, 0.621, and 0.565 respectively. Joint-latent-class-modeling identified distinct groups of patients with respect to D-dimer trend. Patients with stable D-dimer trajectories had HRs of 0.29 (95%CI 0.17–0.49, p < 0.0001) and 0.22 (95%CI 0.10–0.45, p = 0.0001) relative to those with increasing D-dimer trajectories, for the outcomes death and intubation respectively. Patients with low-increasing D-dimer trajectories had a multivariable HR for VTE of 0.18 (95%CI 0.05–0.68, p = 0.0117) relative to those with high-decreasing D-dimer trajectories. Time-dependent receiver-operator-curves for D-dimer trend as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areas-under-the-curve of 0.678, 0.699, and 0.722 respectively. Although admission D-dimer levels, and D-dimer trends, are associated with outcomes in COVID-19, they have limited performance characteristics as prognostic tests.

### Diagnostic value of D-dimer in patients with a moderate pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis [^115aZSdj]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

The negative predictive value (NPV) of d-dimer (DD) for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism is, overall, high and tends to increase as clinical pretest probability decreases. We have assessed the accuracy of a diagnostic protocol including clinical evaluation and DD in 134 outpatients presenting with a moderate pretest probability of proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). In these patients, a negative DD value safely excluded DVT (NPV 100%, 95% CI 85–100) In our experience, these results are equivalent to those found for low-pretest probability patients and therefore the same diagnostic strategy can be used for both risk groups.

D -dimer.

There is emerging evidence for D -dimer measurement. A retrospective, single-center, observational study from China involving 183 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated significantly higher D -dimer level at admission in non-survivors than in survivors (2.12 μg/mL versus 0.61 μg/mL; P < 0.001; normal D -dimer level < 0.50 μg/mL). Moreover, non-survivors had evidence of progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation, with decreased fibrinogen, increased D -dimer, and increased prothrombin time (PT), 10 days after admission. Although evidence at the time of writing remains limited, other studies also have suggested clinical utility of D -dimer measurement. A retrospective French study involving 71 hospitalized (non-ICU) COVID-19 patients reported a 90% negative predictive value of baseline D -dimer level < 1.0 µg/mL for VTE and 98% for PE. The same study reported a positive predictive value for VTE of 44% and 67% for PE with D -dimer levels ≥ 1.0 µg/mL and ≥ 3 µg/mL, respectively.

Other studies have identified laboratory based risk stratification models using D -dimer thresholds to identify patients who should receive prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation, even with low clinical suspicion of VTE. Those with D -dimer level persistently < 1,000 μg/L would receive standard prophylactic dosing, whereas those with initial level < 1,000 μg/L on admission, but with a significant increase during hospitalization to levels above 2,000–4,000 μg/L, may consider imaging for DVT or PE, particularly if the patient is symptomatic for these conditions. When imaging is not feasible, and clinical suspicion for VTE is high, therapeutic LMWH without imaging is recommended, provided that the risk of bleeding is acceptable. In a multicenter study involving three U.S. academic hospitalselevated D -dimer at hospital presentation and an elevated D -dimer or decreased platelet count during ICU admission suggested development of VTE, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. A serum D -dimer concentration greater than 2,600 ng/mL (normal range, 0–292 ng/mL) demonstrated the most accurate discriminatory function in this study to detect the occurrence of VTE (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.760; P < 0.0001; sensitivity and specificity of 89.7% and 59.5%, respectively).

Acute pulmonary embolism — age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds: Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds should be used to determine whether imaging is warranted, with an age-adjusted threshold of age × 10 ng/mL (rather than a generic value of 500 ng/mL) resulting in maintenance of sensitivities greater than 97% in all age groups; specificities increased significantly in all age groups, from 5.7% to 32.3% in patients aged 51 to 60 years, 39.4% to 49.5% in patients aged 61 to 70 years, 24.5% to 44.2% in patients aged 71 to 80 years, and 14.7% to 35.2% in patients older than 80 years, and given these results, we recommend using age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds to determine D-dimer evaluation in patients older than 50 years.

Age-adjusted D-dimer — clinical usefulness for increasing negative results and specificity shows consistent gains versus conventional cutoffs: the 3 Class II studies found a modest increase (ranging from 5% to 12%) in the proportion of non–high-risk patients with a negative D-dimer using age-adjusted versus conventional cutoffs, including a 12% increase from 28% to 40%, an increase from 28% to 33%, and from 28% to 37% with specificity improving from 36% to 47%. Class III studies also showed increases: from 46% to 51% and 34% to 40% in two validation sets; a 4% to 7% increase across clinical decision rules; from 54% to 63% with a yearly age-adjusted cutoff; specificity increases from 7% to 14% with a decadal formula and to 17% with yearly; and small increases from 2% to 6% (yearly) and from 2% to 13% using a 1,000 µg/L cutoff.

Figure 1.
Cumulative incidence at 100 days of venous or arterial thrombosis stratified for D-dimer levels. Cumulative incidence and 95% CIs (indicated by shaded areas) of arterial or venous thrombosis throughout 100-day follow-up, stratified for index D-dimer levels. The dashed red line represents high D-dimer levels (≥ 4 µg/mL), and the solid blue line indicates low to moderate D-dimer levels (< 4 µg/mL).

Three patients with prior venous or arterial thrombosis at a median of 5 years (range, 3–7 years) before study index, and one who received prophylactic-dose anticoagulation postindex (all in the low to moderate D-dimer group), were excluded in a sensitivity analysis. The cumulative incidence of thrombosis in the high D-dimer group in this analysis was 52.9% (95% CI, 26.4–73.8; n = 9 of 17) compared with 10.0% (95% CI, 3.1–21.7%; n = 4 of 40) in patients with low to moderate D-dimer (HR, 7.54; 95% CI, 2.31–24.58), in line with the full analysis. An additional sensitivity analysis excluding 3 patients (2 in the low to moderate D-dimer group; one in the high D-dimer group) who had D-dimer measured on the same day as the thrombotic event was also consistent with the primary analysis. In this analysis, the cumulative incidence in the high D-dimer group was 50.0% (95% CI, 23.4–71.9; n = 8 of 16) compared with 9.7% (95% CI, 3.0–21.0; n = 4 of 42) in patients with low to moderate D-dimer (HR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.15–23.88).

An analysis of the secondary thrombotic outcome excluding upper extremity DVTs produced similar results to our original analysis, with a cumulative incidence of 35.3% (13.8%-57.8%) in the high D-dimer group vs 4.6% (0.8%-13.8%) in the low to moderate group (HR, 8.86; 95% CI, 1.79–43.94).

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114fWovk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — low pretest probability evaluation uses the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) and D-dimer testing. In patients believed to be at low risk for PE, the PERC criteria should be applied. In those who meet all 8 PERC criteria, the risk for PE is lower than the risks of testing; do not order a plasma d-dimer test. Those who do not meet all of the criteria should be further stratified by using a plasma d-dimer test. A normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; do not order imaging studies. An elevated plasma D-dimer level should lead to imaging studies. The PERC items are Age < 50, Initial heart rate < 100 beats/min, Initial oxygen saturation > 94% on room air, No unilateral leg swelling, No hemoptysis, No surgery or trauma within 4 wk, No history of venous thromboembolism, and No estrogen use; the table notes that pretest probability with score of 0 is < 1%.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1156jgXL]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19–associated thrombosis background and scope: Within the first few months of the COVID-19 global pandemic, it was recognized that patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 often exhibited markers of a hypercoagulable state and had an increased incidence of VTE, and reports documented significantly elevated D-dimer levels that were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Based upon the limited, low-quality evidence suggesting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a higher risk of thrombosis than similarly ill patients without COVID-19, societal guidelines were uniform in their recommendation that all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in the absence of a contraindication. Over the past 15 months, randomized controlled trials have emerged focusing on optimal dosing in both moderately ill hospitalized (non-ICU) and critically ill (ICU) patients, and the update provides guidance focused on prevention of thrombosis in hospitalized patients while stating it is not updating guidance related to pre- or posthospital prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment.

### Venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 and correlation with D-dimers: a single-centre experience [^112MP8Sy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

The mean D-dimers in our study on first evaluation was high as expected (3322.24 ng/mL ± 9603 ng/mL) with one patient having D-dimers value in excess of 70 000 ng/mL. Patients with respiratory failure and those requiring ICU admission had a significantly higher mean values. Marked elevation of D-dimers has been a common finding in patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. Although high D-dimmers levels are non-specific, it has consistently been reported as a poor prognostic marker in patients with COVID-19. Several studies have shown association of higher D-dimer values with mortality, reporting a higher D-dimers value in non-survivors compared with survivors.

In addition to being a marker of disease severity, higher D-dimer values have also been associated with high risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia as expected. Some authors have suggested anticoagulation therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 and higher D-dimers value over four times upper limit of normal. Others have suggested the need to adapt for anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 as prophylactic anticoagulation does not avoid the occurrence of PE in these hospitalised patients. Importantly, significantly increased D-dimer is a good index for identifying high-risk groups of VTE. Cui et al suggested that a cut-off value of 1500 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 85.0%, specificity 88.5% and the negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7% for predicting VTE. In our study, all the patient with D-dimers value above 2000 ng/mL had confirmed VTE on imaging. This underscores the importance of keeping a low threshold for evaluating patients with high D-dimers value with dedicated imaging for excluding VTE in the right clinical scenario. The study further informs the readers of the real-life NHS hospital evidence of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 patients and also helps in establishing a cutt-off value for D-dimers in these patients, which will help in establishing appropriate diagnostic algorithms for VTE in these cases and their subsequent management.

### D-dimer and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels to predict venous thromboembolism recurrence after discontinuation of anticoagulation for cancer-associated thrombosis [^113QceJM]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Cancer patients differ substantially in terms of type, stage, and histology, which suggests that treatment duration should vary as well. Furthermore, a personalised approach to anticoagulation treatment, based on biomarkers or scores, has been investigated in non-cancer populations. Thus the present study adds value because, although clinicians know when to start anticoagulation treatment for patients with cancer, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate treatment duration. Nevertheless, as in unprovoked VTE, it is crucial to identify patients who can tolerate treatment withdrawal. Our work revealed that the 6-month incidence of VTE recurrence was high (8.8%; 95% CI: 4.3–15.5%), which suggests that additional research is needed to investigate biomarkers that can be used to identify patients with low or high risks of VTE recurrence and guide their treatment. It would be interesting to adjust for the type of cancer in future studies; unfortunately, the sample size in this study did not allow us to do so.

The present study has several limitations. First, a potential pre-selection study bias could be considered. However, we were attempting to select a subgroup of patients who could benefit from the discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. Second, one of the criteria to determine whether anticoagulant treatment could be stopped was the absence of any circumstance favouring treatment maintenance based on the clinician's discretion. These criteria are subjective; clinicians consider a variety of other reasons as to why anticoagulation should be continued. Although these criteria could be considered a weakness, there are other scores in which clinician subjectivity are considered, for example the Hestia criteria or the Wells score, which have a good reproducibility. Third, broad confidence intervals were calculated for sensitivity and the SHR, which is related to the small number of recurrences. The small sample size is likely related to the limited number of participating centres. Fourth, the study sample had heterogeneous characteristics in terms of cancer location, oncological treatment, and VTE location. The influences of these variables can only be evaluated in a larger sample of patients or studies with more strict inclusion criteria. No one with incidental VTE had VTE recurrences, although there was no relationship between incidental VTE and VTE recurrences (p = 0.06). This finding should be investigated in future studies.

DD and hs-CRP at 21 days after the discontinuation of anticoagulation were associated with the risk of VTE recurrence in patients with CAT. Biomarkers, such as DD and hs-CRP, may play a role in determining the optimal anticoagulant treatment duration in patients with CAT.

Diagnosis of suspected first lower extremity DVT — D-dimer testing — D-dimer, a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, is typically elevated in acute DVT and is characterized as a sensitive but nonspecific marker for venous thromboembolism (VTE). A positive D-dimer is not useful in confirming the diagnosis of DVT, whereas a negative result can aid in exclusion; D-dimer testing is less useful in hospitalized and other acutely ill patients because of the high frequency of false-positive results, and a wide variety of D-dimer assays are available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Elevated plasma D‐dimer is a marker for ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. The antigen target in D‐dimer tests is actually a heterogeneous mixture of fibrin degradation products (FDP), of varying size, that are generated by plasmin following activation of the fibrinolytic system. These fibrin fragments contain cross‐linked D domains, formed by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa), a transglutaminase produced by the action of thrombin on the zymogen precursor FXIII. Early work on the identification and use of fibrin breakdown products as a diagnostic marker, were boosted by the introduction of monoclonal antibody technologyand subsequently led to the development of a large diagnostic testing industry. However, common D‐dimer tests are characterized by high sensitivity but low specificity, which means the results have good negative predictive value (NPV), but poor positive predictive value (PPV, a high rate of false positives). Therefore, D‐dimer testing in clinical practice is widely used to exclude thrombosis, but confirmatory testing is required if patient values exceed a predefined cut‐off. NPV can be improved by various algorithms such as the Wells' score, which aim to reduce the likelihood of positive results in the population tested. Elevated D‐dimer levels are seen in a number of other pathological states, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammatory disease, trauma, and infections, including SARS‐Cov‐2, and are used to monitor therapy in patients with previous thrombosis. Measurement and interpretation of D‐dimer assay results are complicated by the poor PPV and the establishment of reliable cut‐off values to make clinical decisions.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^11452w79]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Measurement of D-dimer concentration in the blood is a valuable tool in the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer concentration below the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l combined with a "low/intermediate" or "unlikely" clinical probability can safely rule out the diagnosis in about 30% of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. However, the D-dimer concentration increases with age and its specificity for embolism decreases, which makes the test less useful to exclude pulmonary embolism in older patients. Indeed, the test is able to rule out pulmonary embolism in 60% of patients aged < 40 years, but in only 5% of patients aged > 80.

If the D-dimer test is combined with an "unlikely" clinical probabilityto rule out pulmonary embolism, 10% of patients > 75 years old versus 32% of patients of all ages do not need further diagnostic testing; the number needed to test for one negative test result is 10.6 and 3.1, respectively. Raising the cut-off value to various points between 600 μg/l and 1000 μg/l increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety, with more false negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made for clinical probability.

By constructing receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, we derived a new, age dependent D-dimer cut-off value and analysed its safety and clinical utility, in combination with clinical probability assessment, for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in two large prospective cohort studies of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. We then validated the outcome in two other large management studies.
