## Question

What is too many bruises with Brillenta

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes "too many bruises" while taking Brilinta (ticagrelor) and how to interpret and manage that clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the expected pharmacology and labeled bleeding risk with ticagrelor. Then, I should define what "too many bruises" means in terms of frequency, distribution, and associated bleeding symptoms. Next, I will review red flags that warrant urgent evaluation versus those that can be monitored. After that, I should outline a practical clinical approach, including history, exam, labs, and medication review. Finally, I will consider management strategies, including when to adjust or hold therapy and how to counsel patients going forward [^113a1hrG] [^117P777s].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and baseline risk. Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 inhibitor that produces rapid, potent, and sustained platelet inhibition; patients will bruise and bleed more easily and take longer to stop bleeding, which is an expected effect rather than a hypersensitivity phenomenon, and there is no specific reversal agent if bleeding occurs, so supportive care is key [^113bUtmM] [^113a1hrG] [^112E3A7R].

> Now, I need to define what "too many bruises" means in practice. Wait, let me verify the clinical thresholds. I would consider bruising excessive if it is spontaneous or occurs with minimal trauma, if there are more than about five new bruises per week without a clear mechanism, if bruises are unusually large or painful, if they appear in atypical locations (face, ears, neck, trunk, or mucosa), or if they are accompanied by other bleeding such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria, melena, or menorrhagia; any of these patterns should prompt closer evaluation rather than reassurance alone [^117P777s] [^117Raz5F].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should distinguish expected nuisance bruising from concerning bleeding. Expected bruising on the extremities from minor bumps, resolving within about two weeks, and not associated with mucosal bleeding or systemic symptoms is generally within the realm of antiplatelet effect, whereas bruising on the trunk, head, or neck, or the presence of petechiae, mucosal bleeding, or hematomas suggests more significant hemostatic compromise and warrants escalation [^117Raz5F].

> Next, I should review red flags that require urgent evaluation. I need to ensure I capture intracranial bleeding signs (headache, vision changes, altered mentation), gastrointestinal bleeding (melena, hematemesis, bright red blood per rectum), hematuria, severe mucosal bleeding, or rapidly expanding hematomas; these are not "just bruising" and require immediate medical attention and consideration of holding ticagrelor while managing the bleed, balancing thrombotic risk if stopped [^113a1hrG] [^111FAcH4].

> Let me consider the clinical approach when a patient reports frequent bruising. I should confirm the number, size, location, and mechanism of bruises; ask about associated bleeding symptoms; review concomitant medications that increase bleeding risk (especially aspirin dose, NSAIDs, SSRIs, anticoagulants, supplements like ginkgo or fish oil); and check for alcohol use and liver disease, which can amplify bleeding risk; on exam, I should map bruises and look for mucosal bleeding, petechiae, or jaundice suggesting hepatic dysfunction [^117P777s] [^113mzgZd] [^117DKqyt].

> I should double-check the laboratory workup when bruising is excessive or unexplained. A reasonable screen includes CBC with platelet count, PT/INR, and aPTT; if platelet function is questioned or aspirin dosing is uncertain, platelet function testing can be considered, recognizing that routine testing is not required for ticagrelor management; persistent or severe bleeding may warrant a broader hemostasis evaluation, including von Willebrand testing and mixing studies, guided by history and exam [^117KXGaS].

> But wait, what if the bruising is clearly linked to minor trauma and no other bleeding is present? In that scenario, I should confirm the aspirin dose is not exceeding 100 mg daily, eliminate NSAIDs and other interacting agents when possible, reinforce fall-prevention strategies, and consider protective measures for the skin; if bruising remains bothersome without major bleeding, ticagrelor can often be continued with close monitoring rather than automatically discontinued [^117P777s] [^113mzgZd].

> I will now examine when to modify or hold ticagrelor. If there is major bleeding or a need for high-risk surgery, ticagrelor should generally be held for about five days when feasible, with resumption as soon as hemostasis is secured; for minor procedures or low-to-moderate bleeding risk, shorter interruptions may suffice, but decisions should be individualized and coordinated with procedural teams; importantly, stopping ticagrelor increases thrombotic risk, so interruptions should be minimized and promptly reversed when safe [^111FAcH4] [^113cTqZ5] [^1125YapC].

> Let me reconsider whether switching to clopidogrel helps with bruising. Although clopidogrel is a less potent P2Y12 inhibitor and may reduce bleeding risk in some contexts, the PLATO program showed higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events with clopidogrel compared with ticagrelor, so switching solely for cosmetic bruising is not routinely justified; if a change is contemplated, it should be for compelling clinical reasons and with cardiology input [^1133QevS] [^113bUtmM].

> I should confirm patient counseling elements that reduce risk and anxiety. Advise keeping aspirin at 75–100 mg daily, avoiding NSAIDs and high-risk supplements, reporting any dark stools, blood in urine, severe headaches, or expanding hematomas promptly, and informing all clinicians and dentists about ticagrelor use before procedures; reinforce that some bruising is expected, but new patterns or associated bleeding warrant reassessment [^117P777s] [^115A3MB9].

> In summary, I need to ensure that "too many bruises" on ticagrelor is interpreted in context: more than about five new bruises per week without clear trauma, bruises in atypical locations, large or painful ecchymoses, or any associated mucosal or internal bleeding should trigger evaluation; otherwise, minor extremity bruising with an identifiable cause can be managed conservatively with medication review and patient education while maintaining antiplatelet therapy for cardiovascular protection [^117P777s] [^117Raz5F].

Too many bruises on Brilinta (ticagrelor) means **easy or frequent bruising** that occurs with minimal or no trauma, is larger than expected, or appears in unusual locations (torso, face, neck, ears, or genitalia) [^112eDfYd]. This reflects Brilinta's **platelet inhibition** [^113bUtmM], which increases bruising risk even with minor injury [^117P777s]. Patients should report new, frequent, or unusually large bruises, especially if accompanied by other bleeding signs (gums, nose, urine, stool) [^1141DA5L], and avoid aspirin doses above 100 mg/day [^117P777s] or other bleeding-risk drugs [^notfound]. Persistent or severe bruising warrants evaluation for bleeding disorders or medication interactions [^113cvJUf].

---

## Clinical significance of bruising while on Brilinta

Bruising on Brilinta is **common and expected** due to platelet inhibition [^117P777s] [^113bUtmM]; however, excessive or unusual bruising may signal an increased bleeding risk or an underlying condition [^113cvJUf]. Clinicians should assess the frequency, size, and location of bruises, as well as any associated bleeding symptoms [^117Raz5F].

---

## Characteristics of "too many" bruises

While there is no strict numerical threshold, the following characteristics may indicate **excessive bruising** on Brilinta:

- **Frequency**: Frequent bruising with minimal or no trauma.
- **Size**: Larger-than-expected bruises for the degree of trauma.
- **Location**: Bruises in unusual locations, such as the torso, face, neck, ears, or genitalia [^1152PDg2].
- **Associated symptoms**: Bruising accompanied by other bleeding symptoms, such as gum bleeding, nosebleeds, blood in urine or stool, or prolonged bleeding from cuts [^1141DA5L].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of monitoring and managing bruising in patients taking Brilinta:

- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be advised that bruising is a common side effect of Brilinta and that they may bruise more easily and bleed longer than usual [^117P777s].
- **Reporting symptoms**: Patients should report any unanticipated, prolonged, or excessive bleeding, or blood in their stool or urine [^117P777s].
- **Medication management**: Patients should avoid aspirin doses higher than 100 mg/day and inform their healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that may increase bleeding risk [^117P777s] [^1141DA5L].

---

## Clinical evaluation of excessive bruising

When evaluating excessive bruising in patients taking Brilinta, clinicians should consider the following:

- **History**: Detailed history of trauma, bleeding symptoms, medication use, and family history of bleeding disorders [^117KXGaS].
- **Physical examination**: Assessment of bruise size, location, and associated bleeding symptoms [^117Raz5F].
- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and renal and hepatic function tests [^117KXGaS].
- **Medication review**: Review of all medications, including anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and supplements that may increase bleeding risk [^113mzgZd].

---

## Management strategies

Management of excessive bruising in patients taking Brilinta includes:

- **Medication adjustment**: Consider adjusting the dose or switching to an alternative antiplatelet agent if bleeding risk outweighs benefit [^115A3MB9].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on avoiding activities that increase bleeding risk and on recognizing signs of serious bleeding [^117P777s].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up to monitor bruising and bleeding symptoms [^notfound].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients taking Brilinta should seek **immediate medical attention** if they experience:

- **Severe bleeding**: Uncontrolled bleeding, blood in urine or stool, or vomiting blood [^117P777s].
- **Neurological symptoms**: Severe headache, confusion, or signs of intracranial bleeding [^113a1hrG].
- **Large hematomas**: Rapidly expanding hematomas or bruising accompanied by severe pain [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Excessive bruising on **Brilinta** is characterized by frequent, large, or unusually located bruises, often with minimal trauma. Patients should report such bruising, and clinicians should evaluate for underlying **bleeding disorders** or medication interactions. Management includes medication adjustment, patient education, and **regular monitoring** [^117P777s].

Another original aspect of this paper was the first clinical evaluation made of skin bruising at the injection sites (Figs. 2 and 3).

Fig. 2

Fig. 3

Bruising is mentioned in several studies. It is a rather disturbing insulin injection side effect due to the resulting blemishes, for which no solutions have been identified as yet. Unfortunately, in terms of both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of shots that patients with diabetes are willing to take, so that in some studies half of the patients reported mentioning such problems to their healthcare providers without getting any solution against the associated pain and bruising. Concerning that, site-related adverse events, including pain, redness, bleeding, and, especially, bruising, are significant barriers to patient adherence to multiple daily injection regimens. This is particularly important when physicians and/or healthcare providers have insufficient experience or knowledge about specific assistance, or when the doctor–patient relationship is unsatisfactory.

To fill this gap, during the last few years, an interesting exchange of experiences started among patients through various networks, including the American Diabetes Association Community first. Such forums enabled patients to propose several attractive solutions themselves, including a sufficiently long injection time, thin and short needles, and a careful injection site rotation protocol. However, specific investigations are still warranted to assess the reasons behind the aforementioned injection complications and to identify scientifically sound solutions aimed to improve patient adherence to insulin therapy.

In our study, BR was associated with poor metabolic control as was LH, but not GV and hypo risk. The interpretation of this data is difficult and does not seem to be influenced by antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent utilization, which involved only a minority of patients (12% in patients with bruising and 14% in patients without bruising) or appear to be related to coagulation-affecting diseases, like cirrhosis and severe kidney disease, which had been excluded.

WARNING: BLEEDING RISK

BRILINTA, like other antiplatelet agents, can cause significant, sometimes fatal bleeding (5.1, 6.1).
Do not use BRILINTA in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of intracranial hemorrhage
(4.1, 4.2).
Do not start BRILINTA in patients undergoing urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (5.1,
6.1).
If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing BRILINTA. Stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of
subsequent cardiovascular events (5.2).

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is currently no known treatment to reverse the effects of BRILINTA, and ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken.

Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of BRILINTA in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding.

Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG.

### Why is my patient bleeding or bruising? [^113cvJUf]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a patient presenting with bleeding symptoms is challenging. Bleeding symptoms are frequently reported by a normal population, and overlap significantly with bleeding disorders, such as type 1 Von Willebrand disease. The history is subjective; bleeding assessment tools significantly facilitate an accurate quantification of bleeding severity. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from defects in primary hemostasis, coagulation deficiencies, to connective tissue disorders. Finally, despite significant clinical evidence of abnormal bleeding, many patients will have not an identifiable disorder. Clinical management of bleeding disorders is highly individualized and focuses on the particular symptoms experienced by the patient.

Bruising

Another original aspect of insulin injection-related skin lesions is bruising at the level of the injection site, as shown in Fig. 1. Bruising is mentioned in several published studies on insulin injections. It is a problematic side-effect of insulin injections which disturbs diabetic patients due to the resulting blemishes, for which there are as yet no solutions. Unfortunately, in terms of both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of shots diabetic patients are willing to take. In fact, in some studies one-half of the patients reported mentioning injection-related problems to their healthcare providers who were unable to resolve the associated pain and bruising.

Fig. 1
Two examples of bruising due to insulin injection, in the absence of any antiplatelet and/or anticlotting agents

In a series of 780 insulin-treated adults with type 2 (n = 556) or type 1 (n = 223) diabetes mellitus on a multiple daily injection regimen (4 shots/day), we identified 46.2% of patients had areas affected by LH, with a mean lesion diameter of 4.8 + 3.1 cm, but LA was quite uncommon (3.2%) (unpublished data). In this same series, 33.2% of patients showed bruising, either associated with LH (n = 178, 53.9%) or isolated (n = 156, 46.6%), independent of the use of antiplatelet and/or anticlotting drugs (unpublished data).

It is important to note that injection site-related adverse events, such as pain, redness, bruising, and bleeding, are significant barriers to patient adherence to treatment regimens involving multiple daily injections. This is especially important when physicians and/or healthcare providers are not sufficiently experienced or possess insufficient knowledge to provide assistance or when the doctor–patient relationship is unsatisfactory.

To fill this gap, during the last few years an interesting exchange of experiences has developed among patients through various networks, beginning with the American Diabetes Association Community. Such forums have enabled diabetic patients themselves to propose several interesting solutions, including a sufficiently long injection time, very thin and short needles, and a careful injection site rotation technique. However, specific investigations are still warranted to assess reasons behind such complications associated with the injection site and to identify scientifically sound solutions aimed at improving patient adherence to insulin therapy.

- Unusual bruising (bruises that appear without known cause or that get bigger)

- Pink or brown urine

- Red or black, tarry stools

- Coughing up blood

- Vomiting blood, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds

Instruct patients to call their healthcare provider or to get prompt medical attention if they experience any signs or symptoms of bleeding:

- Pain, swelling or discomfort in a joint

- Headaches, dizziness, or weakness

- Reoccurring nose bleeds

- Unusual bleeding from gums

- Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop

- Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly, if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise patients to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to contact his or her physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

2.1 General Instructions

Advise patients who miss a dose of BRILINTA to take their next dose at its scheduled time.

For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, BRILINTA tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk.

The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not administer BRILINTA with another oral P2Y12platelet inhibitor.

Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.2 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction

Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of BRILINTA. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of

BRILINTA, 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of BRILINTA twice daily during the first year after

an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of BRILINTA twice daily.

Initiate BRILINTA with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have

undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with BRILINTA based on the

evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

2.3 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction

Administer 60 mg of BRILINTA twice daily.

Generally, use BRILINTA with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14)].

2.4 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of BRILINTA and then continue with 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days.

Administer the first maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose.

Use BRILINTA with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg) and a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to

100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 17) shows the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death.

Figure 17 – Time to First Occurrence of Stroke or Death (THALES)

KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients

BRILINTA's treatment effect on stroke and on death accrued over the first 10 days and was sustained at 30 days. Although not studied, this suggests that shorter treatment could result in similar benefit and reduced bleeding risk.

The treatment effect of BRILINTA was generally consistent across pre-defined subgroups (Figure 18).

Figure 18 - Subgroup analyses of ticagrelor 90 mg (THALES)

Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

At Day 30, there was an absolute reduction of 1.2% (95% CI: -2.1%, -0.3%) in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic stroke and death (excluding fatal bleed) favoring ticagrelor (294 events: 5.3%) over placebo (359 events: 6.5%) in the intention-to-treat population. In the same population, there was an absolute increase of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.6%) in the incidence of GUSTO severe bleeding unfavorable to ticagrelor arm (28 events: 0.5%) compared to the placebo arm (7 events: 0.1%).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 μM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist.

The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours.

The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 μM ADP.

As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

Figure 5 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (± SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel

Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily

Transitioning from clopidogrel to BRILINTA resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from BRILINTA to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to BRILINTA without interruption of antiplatelet effect [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

BRILINTA has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients.

Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS)

Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event.

Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO)

Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel.

In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2.

Figure 2 - 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO)

X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG.

The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

14.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes and Secondary Prevention after Myocardial Infarction

PLATO

PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing BRILINTA (N = 9333) to clopidogrel (N = 9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study's primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke.

Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent.

All patients randomized to BRILINTA received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75–100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months.

14.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction

THEMIS

The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily BRILINTA or placebo, on a background of 75–150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints.

Patients were eligible to participate if they were ≥ 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of ≥ 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug.

Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months.

Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the US was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk.

Hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or any component of the product. (4.3)

4.1 History of Intracranial Hemorrhage

BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) because of a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population [see Clinical Studies (14.1), (14.2)].

4.2 Active Bleeding

BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

4.3 Hypersensitivity

BRILINTA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema) to ticagrelor or any component of the product.

### Ticagrelor (Brilinta) [^111FAcH4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that inhibit platelet function including BRILINTA increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions

(5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA

Patients at NIHSS > 5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of BRILINTA in such patients is not recommended.

5.2 Discontinuation of BRILINTA in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease

Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated

for coronary artery disease. If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant

surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with BRILINTA for five days prior to surgery that

has a major risk of bleeding. Resume BRILINTA as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

5.3 Dyspnea

In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with BRILINTA developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients.

In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.

If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of BRILINTA, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent.

5.4 Bradyarrhythmias

BRILINTA can cause ventricular pauses [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been

reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2ndor 3rddegree AV block or

bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased

risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor.

KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients

GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure < 90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention).

Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for BRILINTA and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for BRILINTA and in 2 for placebo.

Bradycardia

In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with BRILINTA (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2ndor 3rddegree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker).

It is often very challenging for clinicians to distinguish between accidental, intentional, and other causes of bruising such as underlying bleeding disorder in a child with extensive bruising. We present a case of a 17-month-old healthy male who presented to our emergency department with multiple unexplained bruises after an unwitnessed fall and was subsequently diagnosed with congenital vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency. This case illustrates the importance of thorough assessment in evaluating a child with multiple bruises to differentiate accidental from intentional injuries as well as to recognize bleeding disorders, which warrant specific diagnostic workup.

Question 3: What is the MOST appropriate first-line treatment for this patient?
A. Admission to the hospital for management
B. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and administration of plasmapheresis
C. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and short course of glucocorticoids
D. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and supportive care
E. Short course of glucocorticoids and administration of antihistamines

Answers:

A. Admission to the hospital for management – Incorrect. The patient is stable and supportive care can be managed in the outpatient setting. Indications for hospitalization include severe symptoms (high fever or severe arthritis) or uncontrolled infection for which the culprit drug had been prescribed.
B. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and administration of plasmapheresis – Incorrect. While immediate cessation of the suspected triggering medication is correct, plasmapheresis is unnecessary. Plasmapheresis may be utilized in situations where it is not possible to immediately stop the offending medication.
C. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and short course of glucocorticoids – Incorrect. High fever or severe arthritis and arthralgias may be managed with a short course of systemic glucocorticoids. This patient does not have these findings and is best managed conservatively with NSAIDs.
D. Immediate cessation of the offending medication and supportive care – Correct. This is appropriate management for this patient whose symptoms are limited to the skin and joints and is otherwise stable. SSLR is a self-limited condition that typically resolves within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation of the offending medication. NSAIDs are recommended for treatment of mild arthralgia and fever. Pruritus is commonly managed with antihistamines.
E. Short course of glucocorticoids and administration of antihistamines – Incorrect. High fever or severe arthritis and arthralgia, not present in this patient, may be managed with a short course of systemic glucocorticoids. Antihistamines may be included as supportive care. The most critical aspect of management is discontinuation of the offending agent.

### Ticagrelor (Brilinta) [^115KU4s7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below.

Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI).

Figure 11 – Subgroup analyses of (PLATO)

Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups most of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

Regional Differences

Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p = 0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable.

Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months.

Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 13) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke.

Figure 13 – Time to First Occurrence of CV death, MI or Stroke (PEGASUS)

Ti = Ticagrelor BID, CI = Confidence interval; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; N = Number of patients.

Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of BRILINTA in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for BRILINTA plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea.

Table 8 shows the results for the 60 mg plus aspirin regimen vs. aspirin alone.

In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar.

The treatment effect of BRILINTA 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most pre-defined subgroups, see Figure 14.

They add that "Bruises are the most common injury from child physical abuse" and that these injuries are "the most common missed or misinterpreted injuries (sentinel injuries) before a child is seriously injured or killed from abuse". The document notes that "Bruising resulting from physical assault occurs most often in different body locations than do those resulting from unintentional trauma (soft areas vs. bony areas)" and warns, "Any bruise, anywhere, on an infant that is not yet mobile is highly concerning for inflicted trauma, requiring due diligence". The section further states that "Bruising is the most common and usually the first injury to occur from physical child abuse (PCA)" and that "Underestimation of the importance of this injury (medical recognition failure) leads directly to poor patient outcomes when the patient returns back to the abuse setting".

### The life cycle of bruises in older adults [^117Raz5F]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the occurrence, progression, and resolution of accidentally acquired bruises in a sample of adults aged 65 and older. The systematic documentation of accidentally occurring bruises in older adults could provide a foundation for comparison when considering suspicious bruising in older adults.

Design

Between April 2002 and August 2003, a convenience sample of 101 seniors was examined daily at home (up to 6 weeks) to document the occurrence, progression, and resolution of accidental bruises that occurred during the observation period.

Setting

Three community-based settings and two skilled nursing facilities in Orange County, California.

Participants

One hundred one adults aged 65 and older (mean age = 83).

Measurements

Age, sex, ethnicity, functional status, handedness, medical conditions, medications, cognitive status, depression, history of falls, bruise size, bruise location, initial bruise color, color change over time.

Results

Nearly 90% of the bruises were on the extremities. There were no bruises on the neck, ears, genitalia, buttocks, or soles of the feet. Subjects were more likely to know the cause of the bruise if the bruise was on the trunk. Contrary to the common perception that yellow coloration indicates an older bruise, 16 bruises were predominately yellow within the first 24 hours after onset. People on medications known to affect coagulation pathways and those with compromised function were more likely to have multiple bruises.

Conclusion

Accidental bruises occur in a predictable location pattern in older adults. One cannot reliably predict the age of a bruise by its color.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Instructions for Use).

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly, if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants, advise them to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs) and muscular weakness. Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur.

Inform patients:

of the instructions for injecting Lovenox if they continue Lovenox therapy after discharge from the hospital.
that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding.
that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they use Lovenox.
that they should report any unusual bleeding, bruising, or signs of thrombocytopenia (such as a rash of dark red spots under the skin) to their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)].
that risks are associated with the use of benzyl alcohol, a preservative in Lovenox multiple-dose vials, in neonates, infants, and pregnant women.
to tell their physicians and dentists they are taking Lovenox and/or any other product known to affect bleeding before any surgery is scheduled and before any new drug is taken [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].
to tell their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including those obtained without a prescription, such as aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Are there patterns of bruising in childhood which are diagnostic or suggestive of abuse? A systematic review [^112eDfYd]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate what patterns of bruising are diagnostic or suggestive of child abuse by means of a systematic review.

Methods

All language literature search 1951–2004. Included: studies that defined patterns of bruising in non-abused or abused children < 18 years. Excluded: personal practice, review articles, single case reports, inadequate confirmation of abuse. Two independent full text reviews using standardised data extraction and critical appraisal forms. Studies ranked by study design and definition of abuse used.

Results

Twenty three studies included: seven non-abusive bruising, 14 abusive bruising, and two both. Non-abusive: The prevalence, number, and location of bruises is related to increased motor development. Bruising in non-independently mobile babies is very uncommon (< 1%). Seventeen per cent of infants who are starting to mobilise, 53% of walkers, and the majority of schoolchildren have bruises. These are small, sustained over bony prominences, and found on the front of the body. Abuse: Bruising is common in children who are abused. Any part of the body is vulnerable. Bruises are away from bony prominences; the commonest site is head and neck (particularly face) followed by the buttocks, trunk, and arms. Bruises are large, commonly multiple, and occur in clusters. They are often associated with other injury types that may be older. Some bruises carry the imprint of the implement used.

Conclusion

When abuse is suspected, bruising must be assessed in the context of medical, social, and developmental history, the explanation given, and the patterns of non-abusive bruising. Bruises in non-mobile infants, over soft tissue areas, that carry the imprint of an implement and multiple bruises of uniform shape are suggestive of abuse. Quality research across the whole spectrum of children is urgently needed.

### Childhood bruising distribution observed from eight mechanisms of unintentional injury [^112hUC5Z]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To inform the assessment of described mechanisms of bruising in children.

Design

Prospective cross-sectional study.

Setting

The emergency department, and children in the local community.

Patients

Children aged 0–13 years with bruises from unintentional injuries.

Exclusions

bleeding disorder, medication affecting coagulation or child protection concerns.

Interventions

Injury incidents were categorised into one of eight causal mechanisms (fall from < 1m, 1–2 m, fall from standing height or less and hitting an object during fall, stairs or impact, crush, sports or motor vehicle collision).

Main Outcome Measures

Location, number and mechanism of bruising for each injury mechanism.

Results

372 children had 559 injury incidents, resulting in 693 bruises; 85.2% of children were walking independently, with impact injuries and fall from standing height (including hitting an object) being the predominant mechanisms. A single bruise was observed in 81.7% of all incidents. Stair falls resulted in ≥ 3 bruises only with falls involving ≥ 10 steps (6/16). Bruising was rarely observed on the buttocks, upper arm, back of legs or feet. No bruises were seen in this dataset on ears, neck or genitalia. Petechial bruising was only noted in 1/293 unintentional incidents, involving a high-impact injury in a school-aged child.

Conclusion

These findings have the potential to aid an assessment of the plausibility of the explanation given for a child with bruising. Certain bruise distributions were rarely observed, namely multiple bruises from a single mechanism, petechiae and bruising to the ears, neck or genitalia.

### Ticagrelor (Brilinta) [^113kexae]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome.

Aspirin Dose

The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in US sites from sites outside of the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored BRILINTA when used with low maintenance doses (≤ 100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose.

Figure 12 – CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO)

Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^114q2A1X]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Bruising/Ecchymosis

Bruising is an understandable and common complication, though unwelcome by patients, of filler injections. Bruising is observed more frequently after injection into the dermal and immediate subdermal planes using fanning and threading techniques.

Bruising may be treated with cold compresses after the procedure, arnica, aloe vera, or vitamin K creams. The risk of bruising may be reduced by injecting the filler slowly. If bruising appears, it can be reduced by pressing with a compress.

Different substances associated with anticoagulation including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug medications, many vitamin/herbal supplements, and antiplatelet should be discontinued 7–10 days (not without consultation with the treating physician) prior to treatment to reduce the risk of bruising.

Clinical studies evaluating the risk of bleeding in patients undergoing minor dental surgery procedures have reported conflicting results. Several studies reported that the postoperative bleeding rate in patients undergoing oral anticoagulant treatment, such as warfarin or coumadin, was not higher than that in patients not undergoing oral anticoagulant treatment. However, some studies have reported more postoperative bleeding in oral anticoagulant treated patients. The results of a recently published meta-analysis found that although patients treated with oral anticoagulants have a higher postoperative bleeding risk than those not treated with oral anticoagulants following minor dental surgery, local hemostatic methods effectively stopped the bleeding.

An expert group consensus report, focused on preventing dermal fillers complications, recommended to reduce the risk of bruising and to pay special attention in patients taking oral anticoagulants.

In summary, the risk of bleeding in patients taking oral anticoagulant treatments and with a stable international normalized ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range 2–4 is really small, and its discontinuation may increase the risk of thrombosis.

According to the panel opinion, if the anticoagulant treatment is well balanced, the associated risk of discontinuing the treatment is greater than that of bleeding.

Although it is not forbidden, it is advisable to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 h to reduce the risk of bruising and swelling.

Regarding this issue, the panel recommends:
Prophylaxis: To use arnica with vitamin K creams for 3 to 4 days.

### Bleeding and bruising: a diagnostic work-up [^117KXGaS]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians are often asked about easy bruising, excessive bleeding, or risk of bleeding before surgery. A thorough history, including a family history, will guide the appropriate work-up, and a physical examination may provide clues to diagnosis. A standardized bleeding score system can help physicians to organize the patient's bleeding history and to avoid overlooking the most common inherited bleeding disorder, von Willebrand's disease. In cases of suspected bleeding disorders, initial laboratory evaluations should include a complete blood count with platelet count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. More specialized yet relatively simple tests, such as the Platelet Function Analyzer-100, mixing studies, and inhibitor assays, may also be helpful. These tests can help diagnose platelet function disorders, quantitative platelet disorders, factor deficiencies, and factor inhibitors.

### Bruising in children who are assessed for suspected physical abuse [^116gHCFZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

PA was confirmed in 69.2% of children under the age of 6 years who were referred for assessment of suspected PA. There were significant differences in this percentage between different referral scenarios (figure 1). Eighty-three per cent of the overall population had one or more bruises, with a significantly higher percentage in those in whom PA was confirmed compared with those in whom it was excluded. These children had significantly more bruises distributed over a greater number of regions of the body than when PA was excluded. There was no statistically significant difference in the age or gender of the child or the size of the bruises between the PA confirmed and PA-excluded group.

Petechiae, bruises of a linear nature or with a distinct pattern, and 'clusters' of bruises were seen more frequently in the children with confirmed PA. Nayak et al showed that the presence of petechiae increased the likelihood that injuries had arisen from PA. They identified petechiae in 21.9% (95% CI 15.6 to 29.8) of children less than 17 years old who had suffered from PA, a similar prevalence figure, albeit in an older age group. Brinkmann et al found clusters of skin injuries in 88% of 93 severely abused children (0–16 years old). They defined clusters as at least three injuries (bruises, scars, grazes and lacerations) occurring concurrently which were reported predominantly to the outside, front and back of limbs, head, back and buttocks. Bruises of a distinct pattern of implements used or slap markhave also been described in PA in small case series and case studies.

### Ticagrelor (Brilinta) [^117DKqyt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with BRILINTA.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of BRILINTA have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 BRILINTA-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to < 18 for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.

8.5 Geriatric Use

About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were ≥ 65 years of age and at least 15% were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of BRILINTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with BRILINTA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^116mHdCY]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, 780 children provided 4211 data collections (table 1); 1175 collections in pre-mobile children, median age 5 months (IQR 3–6 months), and 3036 collections in mobile children, median age 26 months (IQR 13–42 months).

Table 1
Number of children, their gender and the number of data collections within the accidental, inherited bleeding disorders and abuse groups according to their independent mobility

Frequency of bruises

Pre-mobile children in the accidental and IBD group rarely bruised, but once mobile they had frequent bruises (figure 2). By contrast, the abused pre-mobile children often had multiple bruises. The IBD and abused children showed the largest number of bruises overall. There was a wider variation between the number of bruises recorded at different time points on the same child for the IBD (range 0 to > 40) than for accidental groups (range 0–10 bruises) per collection.

Figure 2
Bruise count at each of 4211 data collections for 780 children from three groups of children: accidental (minor accidents and everyday activities), abused and inherited bleeding disorder. Data are ordered by the median number of bruises per child from children with the least to those with the greatest bruise frequency.

Distribution of bruises

Bruises to the torso were recorded in the pre-mobile IBD and abuse groups (figure 1). The IBD pre-mobile infants had more bruises on the upper arms, whereas the abuse group had more bruises to the cheeks, eyes and neck.

In the mobile group, bruises were commonly seen in the facial-T (forehead, nose, upper lip, chin)across all three groups. The distribution of bruises in the mobile abused and IBD children were similar with bruises to the torso. However, the prevalence of bruises to the cheeks, neck, ears and eyes was greater among the abused children than those with IBD. The latter had more bruises to the lower arms.

Bleeding

Inform patients or their caregivers that they may bleed more easily, may bleed longer, and should call their healthcare provider for any signs or symptoms of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Instruct patients or their caregivers to seek emergency care right away if they have any of the following, which may be a sign or symptom of serious bleeding:

Unusual bruising (bruises that appear without known cause or that get bigger)
Pink or brown urine
Red or black, tarry stools
Coughing up blood
Vomiting blood, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds

Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider or to get prompt medical attention if they experience any signs or symptoms of bleeding:

Pain, swelling or discomfort in a joint
Headaches, dizziness, or weakness
Reoccurring nose bleeds
Unusual bleeding from gums
Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop
Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly, if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise patients or their caregivers to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient or their caregivers to contact his or her physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider if they experience any signs or symptoms of dyspepsia or gastritis:

Dyspepsia (upset stomach), burning, or nausea
Abdominal pain or discomfort
Epigastric discomfort, GERD (gastric indigestion)

[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]

Invasive or Surgical Procedures

Instruct patients or their caregivers to inform their healthcare provider that they are taking PRADAXA before any invasive procedure (including dental procedures) is scheduled [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Concomitant Medications

Ask patients or their caregivers to list all prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements they are taking or plan to take so the patient's healthcare provider knows about other treatments that may affect bleeding risk (e.g., aspirin or NSAIDs) or dabigatran exposure (e.g., dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)].

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^114SW5HQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Any bruise in a pre-mobile child was strongly predictive of abuse/IBD and bruising in the TEN locations favoured abuse/IBD in mobile children who had more than one bruise recorded. When multiple bruises were recorded in the TEN locations, the likelihood of abuse over IBD increased. However, the poor discrimination between abuse and IBD reiterates the need for a haematological investigation in a child with concerning bruising.

The strong association between any bruise in a pre-mobile child and abuse is well established. Such infants rarely sustain accidental bruises. A recent studyof the causes of bruising in pre-mobile infants highlighted that 54% (26/46) of those with unexplained bruises were found to have been abused. On further investigation, 43% (27/63) of infants with initially 'explained' bruises were recognised as being abused. It is notable that 38% of the abused infants only had a single bruise.

It was unsurprising that the TEN4 bruise categorisation could not discriminate between abuse and IBD, as it was not designed to do so. Widespread bruises occur in both conditions. It was notable, however, that when there were more bruises in the TEN locations, the association with abuse was stronger than with IBD. Jackson et al have previously highlighted the overlap between IBD and suspected abuse, whereby 15% (29/189) of children with IBD had initially presented with bruising concerning for abuse, 79% (23/29) of whom were younger than 5 years. Investigations of any child with bruising must include a screen for IBD. It must also be remembered that both conditions can co-exist.

In this dataset, a mobile child (or one older than 4 months) with a single bruise in a TEN location only was more likely to be found in the accidental than the abuse group and the TEN bruise distribution had no power to discriminate either abuse or IBD from accidental injury in these children.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^114VBGBT]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE risk assessment — Patients who have experienced a BRUE may have a recurrent event or an undiagnosed serious condition that confers risk, and by consensus the subcommittee established < 1 minute as the upper limit of a "brief event"; the committee also agreed by consensus that the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be determined by trained medical providers. Infants who do not qualify as lower-risk are, by definition, at higher risk, and thus, pending further research, this guideline does not provide recommendations for the management of the higher-risk infant. The key action statements in this guideline do not apply to higher-risk patients but apply only to infants who meet the lower-risk criteria. Some studies suggest examples of higher risk, including that infants younger than 2 months who experience a BRUE may be more likely to have a congenital or infectious cause and be at higher risk of an adverse outcome, and that infants with multiple events or a concerning social assessment for child abuse may warrant increased observation.

17.1 Patient Advice

If the patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly, if they are taking concomitant NSAIDS, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants, inform patients to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematomas, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscular weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise patients to contact his or her physician immediately.

The use of aspirin and other NSAIDS may enhance the risk of hemorrhage. Advise patients to discontinue use prior to ARIXTRA therapy whenever possible; if co-administration is essential, the patient's clinical and laboratory status should be closely monitored [see Drug Interactions (7)].

If patients must self-administer ARIXTRA or if administered by a caregiver, (e.g., if ARIXTRA is used at home), advise patients of the following:

Advise patients that ARIXTRA should be given by subcutaneous injection. Instruct patients in the proper technique for administration.
Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of ARIXTRA, to inject the dose as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to inject two doses at the same time.
The most important risk with ARIXTRA administration is bleeding. Counsel patients on signs and symptoms of possible bleeding.
Advise patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding.
Advise patients that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with ARIXTRA.
Advise patients to report any unusual bleeding, bruising, or signs of thrombocytopenia (such as a rash of dark red spots under the skin) to their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)].
Advise patients to tell their physicians and dentists they are taking ARIXTRA and/or any other product known to affect bleeding before any surgery is scheduled and before any new drug is taken [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Advise patients to tell their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including those obtained without a prescription, such as aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### The significance of bruising in infants – a forensic postmortem study [^117KAvFx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the significance of bruises in cases of infant death to ascertain if their presence was associated with other injuries or homicide.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Forensic Science South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

Patients

135 infants aged between 7 and 364 days autopsied over a 9-year period from June 1999 to May 2008.

Outcome Measures

Coronial forensic autopsy reports.

Methods

Examination of autopsy reports to determine how many infants had bruising and whether bruising was associated with other injuries or lesions of concern. Cause and manner of death were also recorded.

Results

There were 83 boys and 52 girls. Twenty-one infants (15.6%) had one or more bruises, and 114 had no bruises. In the group of 21 infants with bruises, 17/21 had other injuries/lesions (81%), with 5/21 homicides (24%). Of the 114 non-bruised infants, only 9 (8%) had other injuries/lesions with only 4 homicides (3.5%). The incidence of other injuries/lesions was significantly higher in bruised infants compared with the non-bruised group (p < 0.001), as was the occurrence of homicide (p = 0.003). Bruises were found in 15.6% of infants presenting to coronial autopsy, with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 96% as markers for other injuries (positive predictive value 0.81; negative predictive value 0.92). At < 6 months of age, this increased to a sensitivity of 71%, with a similar specificity of 95%.

Conclusions

Bruising is a significant marker for other injuries in infants presenting to coronial autopsy. Homicide occurs more commonly in this group.

### The effect of microneedle thickness on pain during minimally invasive facial procedures: a clinical study [^116ZHJ5R]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive procedures are becoming increasingly popular because they require minimal downtime and are effective for achieving a more youthful appearance. The choice of needle for minimally invasive procedures can be a major factor in the patient's comfort level, which in turn affects the physician's comfort level.

Objectives

In this comparative study, the authors assessed levels of pain and bruising after participants were injected with 30-gauge or 33-gauge (G) microneedles, which are commonly used for minimally invasive injection procedures.

Methods

Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited for this prospective study. Eight injection points (4 on each side of the face) were determined for each patient. All participants received injections of saline with both microneedles in a randomized, blinded fashion. Levels of pain and bruising were assessed and analyzed for significance.

Results

The highest level of pain was in the malar region, and the lowest level was in the glabella. Although all pain scores were lower for the 33-G microneedle, the difference was significant only for the forehead. Because most minimally invasive procedures require multiple injections during the same sitting, the overall procedure was evaluated as well. Assessment of the multiple-injection process demonstrated a significant difference in pain level, favoring the 33-G needle. Although the difference in bruising was not statistically significant between the 2 needles, the degree of bruising was lower with the 33-G needle.

Conclusions

For procedures that involve multiple injections to the face (such as mesotherapy and injection of botulinum toxin A), thinner needles result in less pain, making the overall experience more comfortable for the patient and the physician.

### Adverse effects of oral corticosteroids in relation to dose in patients with lung disease [^115FfiJy]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The adverse effects of oral corticosteroids are widely recognised but there are few quantitative data on which to base advice to patients. In a two part cross sectional study we compared adverse effects in patients with lung disease taking oral corticosteroids and control subjects and related the adverse effects to corticosteroid dose in the patient group.

Methods

Data on oral corticosteroid use, lifestyle, fractures, and other possible adverse effects were collected by questionnaire and compared between a community based cohort of patients taking continuous or frequent intermittent oral corticosteroids for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or alveolitis and age and sex matched control subjects. Dose related effects were explored in the corticosteroid group using cumulative dose quartiles and multiple logistic regression.

Results

A total of 367 patients (≥ 50 years, 48% female) and 734 control subjects completed the questionnaire. The cumulative incidence of fractures since the time of diagnosis was 23% for patients taking oral corticosteroids and 15% in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.6). Patients were more likely to have had a fracture of the vertebrae (OR 10; 95% CI 2.9 to 34), hip (OR 6; 95% CI 1.2 to 30), and ribs or sternum (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 6.6) than control subjects. They also reported a significant increase in cataracts, use of antacids, muscle weakness, back pain, bruising, oral candidiasis, and having fewer teeth. The effects of oral corticosteroids were dose related: the odds ratio for patients in the highest compared with the lowest cumulative dose quartile (median prednisolone dose 61 g versus 5 g) ranged from 2 for all fractures to 9 for vertebral fractures and bruising.

Conclusions

By quantifying the morbidity associated with the use of oral corticosteroids, this study should help to rationalise their long term use.

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^11479rwN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Model fit

Relative to the accidental group, both IBD and abuse groups exhibited significantly more bruising in TEN and non-TEN locations. Pre-mobile infants had significantly fewer bruises than mobile children, though this difference was much smaller in the IBD and abuse groups. In all groups, there were fewer bruises in TEN locations than in non-TEN locations, but this difference was less pronounced among the IBD and abuse groups.

There was between-child variation in the amount of bruising (SD 0.87). This captures the idea that some children exhibit more bruises than others. An extreme child in the accidental group (at the 97.5th percentile in terms of their tendency to bruise) exhibits roughly the same average number of bruises as the median child in the abuse group (figure 2).

Likelihood ratios

A pre-mobile child with a single bruise was more likely to have been abused or have IBD than to be accidentally injured. The more bruises that a child had, the higher the likelihood of abuse/IBD versus accident. Once a child had two or more bruises, the LRs significantly favoured abuse over IBD. The presence of bruises in the TEN locations was more indicative of abuse than IBD (table 2). Using an age cut-off of 4 months, the LRs showed a similar result. While the LRs using the age cut-off were lower than using the mobility categorisation, the differences did not reach statistical significance. (online supplemental appendix 2)

### Model-informed dosing regimen of ticagrelor in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome [^115aERnc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

The exposure to ticagrelor (BRILINTA) is higher in the East Asian population compared with the White population, thus, East Asians have an increased risk of bleeding. We developed a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of ticagrelor based on a randomized 3×3 crossover study in healthy subjects. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome was simulated based on this model. Following this, eight machine learning (ML) methods were used to construct bleeding risk models. Variables included in the final bleeding risk model were age, hypertension, body weight, AUC, drinking status, calcium channel blockers, antidiabetic medications, β-blockers, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, sex, and proton pump inhibitor. In terms of F1 scores and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), the Random Forest model performed best among all models, with an F1 score of 0.73 and ROC-AUC of 0.81. Moreover, the PopPK model and ML algorithm were used to bridge the real-world data to build a bleeding risk prediction model based on drug exposure and clinical information. Using this model, a ticagrelor regimen that is associated with a lower risk of bleeding in individuals can be obtained. This model should be further validated prospectively in clinical settings.

### The timeliness of patients reporting the side effects of chemotherapy [^111KnWFd]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore the actions cancer patients reported they would take in response to a range of common side effects of chemotherapy and whether these were considered appropriate based on current guidelines and evidence; and to explore the sociodemographic and cancer-related variables associated with patients selecting the appropriate action (immediate medical attention or reporting) for two potentially life-threatening side effects: fever, and unusual bleeding and bruising.

Methods

Four hundred thirty-six medical oncology and haematology patients receiving chemotherapy completed two surveys to provide demographic, disease and treatment characteristics, and details on how they would respond if they experienced a range of specified side effects of chemotherapy (for example, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and skin rash or nail changes). The proportion of patients reporting the appropriate action for each side effect was calculated. Multiple logistic regressions examined the patient demographic and cancer characteristics associated with selecting the appropriate action (seeking immediate medical attention) for two potentially life-threatening side effects of chemotherapy: high fever of 38 °C or more, and unusual bleeding or bruising.

Results

Two thirds of patients indicated that they would seek immediate medical attention for high fever (67%), but only 41% would seek immediate attention for bleeding or bruising. Cancer type and time since diagnosis were significantly associated with patients indicating that they would seek immediate medical attention for high fever; while time since diagnosis was the only variable significantly associated with patients reporting that they would seek immediate medical attention for unusual bleeding or bruising. For chronic side effects, like skin rash or nail changes, and tingling or numbness, which usually do not require urgent reporting, only between 12 and 16% would report them immediately. A significant proportion of patients reported that they would "do nothing" about fatigue or tiredness (24%). By comparison, less than 10% patients reported that they would do nothing for the other side effects investigated.

Conclusions

Tools need to be created so that patients better understand the side effects after being treated with chemotherapy and what action they should take.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of the safety and efficacy of ADAM zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of migraine [^112xhHVH]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Safety

A high proportion of patients applied the treatment for the full prescribed 30 minutes: 98.8% in the placebo group, 98.8% in the ADAM zolmitriptan 1 mg group, 97.7% in the ADAM zolmitriptan 1.9 mg group, and 97.6% in the ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg group. Table 4 provides a summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The exceptions were three patients in the ADAM 3.8 mg group who reported a severe TEAE, one with application site bruising, one with application site pain, and one with muscle tightness. Dosing was discontinued in two patients in the ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg group due to TEAEs. There were no serious TEAEs and no TEAEs of special interest (defined as any application site reactions requiring further evaluation or care or resulting in burns or scars as determined by clinical review). The most commonly occurring adverse event was application site erythema, followed by application site bruising. There were no pigmentation reactions. Table 5 presents TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 2% of patients in any ADAM zolmitriptan treatment group.

All dermal adverse events were followed to resolution and most resolved within 7 days. However, some took 8–14 days to resolve (in the placebo, 1.0 mg, 1.9 mg and 3.9 mg groups, redness was seen in zero, two, five, and six patients, respectively, and bruising was seen in zero, two, five, and three patients, respectively), and three took more than 14 days to fully resolve (one patient in the placebo group with redness and two patients in the 1 mg group with bruising). Most patients with prolonged time to resolution of redness or bruising were taking medications that inhibit platelet function (NSAIDs, including aspirin, or fish oil).

### Randomized clinical trial comparing multiple stab incision phlebectomy and transilluminated powered phlebectomy for varicose veins [^112V8tYD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The aim was to compare early postoperative subjective outcome measures in a randomized trial of multiple stab incision phlebectomy (MSIP) and transilluminated powered phlebectomy (TIPP) for the treatment of varicose veins.

Methods

Patients having surgery for varicose veins were randomized to receive either MSIP or TIPP for local avulsion of varicose veins. Operating time, number of incisions and postoperative outcome were analysed in both groups. Quality of life (QoL) was analysed before and 1 and 6 weeks after surgery using domain-specific (Burford pain scale), disease-specific (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire) and generic (Short Form 36 and EuroQol 5D) instruments.

Results

Sixty-six patients consented to participate in the trial but four withdrew before surgery, so 33 patients underwent MSIP and 29 patients had TIPP. All patients had symptomatic or complicated varicose veins. There was no significant difference between groups in the total duration of surgery or the time taken for the avulsions. The number of incisions was significantly lower with TIPP. However, skin bruising at 1 and 6 weeks, and Burford pain score at 6 weeks were significantly higher in the TIPP group (P < 0.01 for bruising and P = 0.019 for pain). TIPP also had a greater adverse impact on generic QoL, resulting in a more prolonged recovery.

Conclusion

TIPP had the advantage of fewer surgical incisions, but was associated with more extensive bruising, prolonged pain and reduced early postoperative QoL.

### Ticagrelor to reduce myocardial injury in Patients with high-risk coronary artery plaque [^1139ANqU]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety outcomes

There were no suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions over the course of the study. Serious adverse events occurred in 7 (7%) of 100 patients who received at least 1 single dose of ticagrelor and 15 (11.9%) of 101 patients who were administered placebo (Supplemental Table 3). There were no reported major life-threatening or other major bleeding events over the course of the study. Minimal bleeding events (bruising) were reported in 64 (64.0%) patients in the ticagrelor group and 12 (11.9%) patients in the placebo group (Supplemental Table 4). Dyspnea episodes occurred in 24 (24%) patients in the ticagrelor group compared with 8 (7.9%) patients in the placebo group at 1 year.

### Interpreting bruises at necropsy [^113J7vze]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The accurate interpretation of bruising at necropsy is essential to understanding how a victim has been injured and assists the pathologist in a reliable reconstruction of the events leading to death. It is essential not only to assess the mechanism of production of a bruise, taking into account the type of impacting surface and the magnitude of force used, but also to estimate when the injury was caused. An account is given of the various methods used in the examination of bruises, particularly with respect to aging, as well as the factors that may affect their appearance. Differentiation from artefacts resulting from postmortem changes is also discussed in some detail.

### Patterns of bruising in preschool children – a longitudinal study [^116SGF68]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Bruises on the ears, neck, genitalia and hands were rare in any developmental group and buttock and front trunk bruises were rare in early mobile and younger children. A strength of the data set is that it included the anogenital area, excluded by previous authors. Sugar et al identified buttocks/hands/feet/abdomen/ upper arms as rare sites but did not mention ears or neck. Pierce et al detailed data on a highly selected group of 53 children younger than 48 months admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with accidental trauma. Bruises were identified in 38 children, a similar profile of rare sites for accidental bruising was identified.

Examples of causes of bruises were given, particularly in the premobile and early mobile children. As missing data in this field may represent either no knowledge of the cause, or a failure to record the information, we could not interpret how frequently parents know the cause of each bruise.

This study design has the benefit of prospective data collection using a consistent approach. The study relied upon the co-operation of 328 parents to collect data. The less socially deprived population was over-represented in our sample, possibly reflecting parental willingness to comply with the study, but this should not bias the associations with bruising. Study compliance varied in terms of the length of time each participant was involved, and while we cannot be certain that every single bruise was collected we have a high degree of confidence in our participants, verified by our validation of data collection accuracy. Recruitment to the study was challenging as it required prolonged participation. The informed consent described the reasoning behind the study, including a need to identify normal patterns of bruising to compare with bruising in child abuse. Parents were informed that a referral to social services would be made if child maltreatment was suspected. This information tended to dichotomise our target audience so that parents were either highly motivated to participate or vehemently declined. This may have impacted on willingness to participate. Each collection was scrutinised and at no time was a suspicion of abuse raised and no child was referred to social services during the study time period.

These data have the potential to alert clinicians to an unusual number or distribution of bruises in young children. Multiple bruises in premobile babies and bruises in locations other than the 'facial T', head or below the knee would be an unusual finding as would bruises to the ear, neck, hands or genitalia. Thus these data create invaluable baseline information for those assessing bruises in children.

### Bruising in children who are assessed for suspected physical abuse [^1152PDg2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the characteristics of bruising and mode of presentation of children referred to the paediatric child protection team with suspected physical abuse (PA), and the extent to which these differ between the children where abuse was confirmed and those where it was excluded.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting and Patients

519 children, < 6 years, referred to two paediatric child protection teams.

Main Outcome Measures

The mode of presentation, number, anatomical distribution, size and appearance of bruises according to whether PA was confirmed or excluded. ORs with 95% CI were calculated where relevant.

Results

PA was confirmed in 69% of children; the rate varied from 84% when abuse was witnessed, admitted, alleged or where explanation for injury was absent or implausible, to 50% where there was a concerning history. Significantly more children with PA had bruises (89.4%) than PA-excluded (69.9%) and had significantly more sites affected (p < 0.001). The odds of a PA child having bruising to: buttocks/genitalia (OR 10.9 (CI 2.6 to 46), left ear (OR 7.10 (CI 2.2 to 23.4), cheeks (Left (OR 5.20 (CI 2.5 to 10.7), Right OR 2.83 (CI 1.5 to 5.4)), neck (OR 3.77 (CI 1.3 to 10.9), trunk (back (OR 2.85 (CI 1.6 to 5.0) front (OR 4.74 (CI 2.2 to 10.2), front of thighs (OR2.48 (CI 1.4 to 4.5) or upper arms (OR 1.90 (CI 1.1 to 3.2) were significantly greater than in children with PA-excluded. Petechiae, linear or bruises with distinct pattern, bruises in clusters, additional injuries or a child known to social services for previous child abuse concerns were significantly more likely in PA.

Conclusions

Features in the presenting history, the extent and pattern of bruising differed between children with confirmed PA and those where abuse was excluded. These findings can provide a deeper understanding of bruising sustained from PA.

### Bruising and bleeding in infants and children – a practical approach [^116szxdb]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in children and are usually associated with minor injury and trauma. However, in two groups of children the bruising may be more significant than expected: those with an underlying haemostatic abnormality, such as an inherited bleeding disorder, or those who have been subjected to non-accidental injury (NAI). Diagnosing inherited bleeding disorders in children is fraught with difficulty, from venous access to interpretation of results; the possibility of NAI should be borne in mind, even in those children with proven significant bleeding disorders when the severity of the injury and the history are non-compatible. We describe the investigation of the haemostatic system in children with bruising and/or bleeding with emphasis on the key haemostatic disorders that need to be excluded.

### Bruising in infants: those with a bruise may be abused [^112FD7bN]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Bruising in the young infant is rare, and if present, this may be a manifestation of physical child abuse. Early signs of abuse, such as bruising, are often overlooked or their significance goes unrecognized resulting in poor patient outcomes. In such cases, the opportunity to intervene and potentially prevent repeat injury is lost, and the child is placed back in harm's way. This brief report presents 3 cases of nonmobile infants who presented to health care providers with bruising before a subsequent fatal or near-fatal event. These cases emphasize the importance of including abusive trauma in the differential diagnosis of an infant with a bruise or a history of easy bruising and the importance of initiating a thorough trauma evaluation immediately and concomitantly with any other workup for the causes of bruising in the noncruising infant.

### Effects of clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor on prevention of stent thrombosis in patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention: a network meta-analysis [^112LiX7n]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy

PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effect of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and/or ticagrelor in patients who underwent PCI. The search terms were "ticagrelor or brilinta", "clopidogrel or plavix", "prasugrel or effient", and "ST". These databases were searched for studies published up to January 12, 2020. RCTs registered inand major international cardiology meetings (American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC)) were also identified. Inclusion criteria were: (a) RCTs, (b) comparison of clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, (c) patients underwent PCI, (d) patients with follow‐up at least 6 months.

The primary end‐point was the rate of ST individually (as per the Academic Research Consortium definition).

2.2 Data extraction and quality assessment

The following data were collected from eligible studies: first author name, year of publication, region, type of study, duration of follow‐up, number of participants, gender of the subjects, and treatment regimens. The data were independently collected by two authors. The discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third author.

Quality of included studies was assessed in accordance with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, which contains seven domains: (a) random sequence generation, (b) allocation concealment, (c) blinding of participants and personnel, (d) blinding of outcome assessment, (e) incomplete outcome data, (f) selective reporting, and (g) other bias. Two authors completed quality assessment separately, and any discrepancies would be resolved by a third author.

2.3 Statistical analysis

We performed statistical analyses with Stata Version 14.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) and R Version 3.4.2 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). We carried out a Bayesian network meta‐analysis using the "gemtc" package for R. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for comparisons between groups. We analyzed the convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo chains for all model parameters using trace plots and Gelman‐Rubin diagnostic statistics. With regard to heterogeneity test, a P < 0.10 indicated statistically significant. The potential publication bias was estimated by funnel plot asymmetry.

5.4 Second Primary Malignancies

Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 14% of patients treated with BRUKINSA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancers (8%), followed by other solid tumors in 7% of the patients (including melanoma in 1% of patients) and hematologic malignancies (0.7%). Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies.

5.5 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Serious cardiac arrhythmias have occurred in patients treated with BRUKINSA. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were reported in 4.4% of patients treated with BRUKINSA, including Grade 3 or higher cases in 1.9% of patients. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher ventricular arrhythmias were reported in 0.3% of patients.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea, chest discomfort), manage appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)], and consider the risks and benefits of continued BRUKINSA treatment.

5.6	 Hepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including BRUKINSA.

Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with BRUKINSA. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after BRUKINSA, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold BRUKINSA. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue BRUKINSA.

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^1166zXjj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Does TEN4 categorisation of bruises to the torso, ear or neck or any bruise in < 4-month-old children differentiate between abuse, accidents or inherited bleeding disorders (IBDs)?

Design

Prospective comparative longitudinal study.

Setting

Community.

Patients

Children < 6 years old.

Interventions

The number and location of bruises compared for 2568 data collections from 328 children in the community, 1301 from 106 children with IBD and 342 abuse cases.

Main Outcome Measures

Likelihood ratios (LRs) for the number of bruises within the TEN and non-TEN locations for pre-mobile and mobile children: abuse vs accidental injury, IBD vs accident, abuse vs IBD.

Results

Any bruise in a pre-mobile child was more likely to be from abuse/IBD than accident. The more bruises a pre-mobile child had, the higher the LR for abuse/IBD vs accident. A single bruise in a TEN location in mobile children was not supportive of abuse/IBD. For mobile children with more than one bruise, including at least one in TEN locations, the LR favouring abuse/IBD increased. Applying TEN4 to collections from abused and accidental group < 48 months of age with at least one bruise gave estimated sensitivity of 69% and specificity for abuse of 74%.

Conclusions

These data support further child protection investigations of a positive TEN4 screen in any pre-mobile children with a bruise and in mobile children with more than one bruise. TEN4 did not discriminate between IBD and abuse, thus IBD needs to be excluded in these children. Estimated sensitivity and specificity of TEN4 was appreciably lower than previously reported.

### Anticoagulation and bleeding risk after core needle biopsy [^114AX3Cy]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to compare the bleeding complication rates after core needle biopsy in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy and those who had not to assess the safety of performing core needle breast biopsy in anticoagulated patients.

Materials and Methods

Core needle biopsy was performed at 1,144 sites in 1,055 women from August 2004 to May 2007. A retrospective study of these cases was performed. The patient group was composed of 200 women (220 biopsy sites) who were taking anticoagulant therapy daily (180 patients, aspirin; 16 patients, warfarin; and four patients, Excedrin), and the control group was composed of 855 women (924 biopsy sites) who were not receiving daily anticoagulant therapy. Any adverse reactions after core needle biopsy, including the presence and size of bruises or lumps (hematomas), were recorded.

Results

There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.035) in the percentage of bruises between patients receiving anticoagulation therapy and those who were not. Bruising occurred in 68 of the 200 (34%) women in the patient group (anticoagulated), whereas bruising occurred in 227 of the 855 (26.5%) women in the control group (nonanticoagulated). The differences were not statistically significant for hematoma formation (p = 0.274) or bruising with hematoma formation (p = 0.413). Hematoma occurred in 12 of the 200 (6%) anticoagulated patients versus 36 of the 855 (4.2%) patients in the control group. Patients reporting a bruise and lump (hematoma) numbered 10 of 200 (5%) for the anticoagulated group and 32 of 855 (3.7%) for the control group.

Conclusion

No patients undergoing core needle biopsy reported any clinically important complications. The results of this study confirm that performing core needle biopsy in patients on anticoagulation therapy is safe.

### Can you age bruises accurately in children? A systematic review [^112P4opt]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether it is possible to determine the age of a bruise in a child in clinical practice by means of a systematic review.

Methods

An all language literature search up to 2004. Included studies assessed the age of bruises in live children less than 18 years old. Excluded: review articles, expert opinion, and single case reports. Standardised data extraction and critical appraisal forms were used. Two reviewers independently reviewed studies.

Results

Of 167 studies reviewed, three were included: two studies described colour assessment in vivo and one from photographs. Although the Bariciak et al study showed a significant association between red/blue/purple colour and recent bruising and yellow/brown and green with older bruising, both this study and Stephenson and Bialas reported that any colour could be present in fresh, intermediate, and old bruises. Results on yellow colouration were conflicting. Stephenson and Bialas showed yellow colour in 10 bruises only after 24 hours, Carpenter after 48 hours, and Bariciak et al noted yellow/green/brown within 48 hours. Stephenson and Bialas reported that red was only seen in those of one week or less. The accuracy with which clinicians correctly aged a bruise to within 24 hours of its occurrence was less than 40%. The accuracy with which they could identify fresh, intermediate, or old bruises was 55–63%. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was poor.

Conclusion

A bruise cannot accurately be aged from clinical assessment in vivo or on a photograph. At this point in time the practice of estimating the age of a bruise from its colour has no scientific basis and should be avoided in child protection proceedings.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants: executive summary [^1173EBDR]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) — guideline scope and intent emphasize that the guideline may be of interest to payers, but it is not intended to be used for reimbursement or to determine insurance coverage, and it is not intended as the sole source of guidance in the evaluation and management of BRUEs and specifically does not address higher-risk BRUE patients. It is intended to provide a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce unnecessary and costly medical interventions, and improve patient outcomes, and includes recommendations for diagnosis, risk-based stratification, monitoring, disposition planning, effective communication with the patient and family, guideline implementation and evaluation, and future research. It aims to help clinicians determine the presence of a serious underlying cause and a safe disposition by alerting them to the most significant features of the clinical history and physical examination on which to base an approach for diagnostic testing and hospitalization.

### Time course for benefit and risk of ticagrelor and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111oRXYH]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Participants

We used data from the THALES trial. Details on the design and primary results of the THALES trial have been published elsewhere. In brief, THALES was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that randomized 11,016 patients from 414 sites in 28 countries between January 22, 2018, and December 13, 2019, to assess the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of ticagrelor (Brilinta, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE) and aspirin vs aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Patients included in the trial were those ≥ 40 years of age and diagnosed with a mild to moderate acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score ≤ 5 [range 0–42, with higher scores indicating more severe stroke]) or a high-risk TIA (ABCD 2 stroke risk score ≥ 6 [scores assessing the risk of stroke on the basis of age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA, and presence or absence of diabetes; range 0–7, with higher numbers indicating greater risk] or symptomatic intracranial or extracranial arterial stenosis [≥ 50% narrowing in the diameter of the lumen of an artery that could account for the TIA]) within 24 hours after symptom onset.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

The THALES trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT03354429). The protocol of the trial was approved by the ethics committee of all participating sites. All participants or their representatives provided written informed consent before enrollment.

Randomization and Treatments

We randomly assigned patients 1:1 to receive either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily on days 2–30) or matching placebo using an interactive web-based response system. All patients received aspirin (300–325 mg on day 1 followed by 75–100 mg daily on days 2–30).

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^113YbSJa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In young children who present with concerning patterns of bruising, the differential diagnosis includes accidental injury, physical abuse and coagulation disorders such as inherited bleeding disorders (IBDs). The clinician must identify the cause of the bruising and decide whether the child requires further clinical or child protection investigations.

In 2010, Pierce et al published a pilot study "discriminating bruising characteristics, to model those findings into a decision tool for screening children at high risk for abuse". The Bruise Clinical Decision Rule (BCDR) was developed from 71 children (42 had been abused) admitted to paediatric intensive care units with trauma and examined for bruising. The TEN4 BCDR emerged whereby "bruising on the torso, ear, or neck for a child < 48 months of age and bruising in any region for an infant < 4 months of age, in the absence of a publicly witnessed injury" had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 84% for predicting abuse. TEN4 is gaining momentum internationally as a recommended decision rule across a wider population of children.

We previously described the pattern of bruising in three groups of children: those with suspected abuse, bruises from day-to-day activities and accidents, and children with IBD. This study uses the datasets from these three publications to determine whether the categorisation of bruising used in the TEN4 BCDR can differentiate between these three conditions.

### Bleeding after hospital discharge following acute coronary syndrome: incidence, types, timing, and predictors [^116fH69B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The findings of this study should be interpreted in light of some limitations. First, bleeding events were not independently adjudicated. The observational design of the study does not preclude residual confounding. The definition for bleeding did not include laboratory parameters, such as decrease in hemoglobin measurements and/or receipt of blood transfusion. Classifying bleeding on the basis of severity (major and minor) was, therefore, not possible. The study was not adequately powered to examine the independent predictors of some types of bleeding events, such as intracranial and intraocular bleeds that occurred relatively rarely. Thus, findings in relation to these bleeding events should be viewed as exploratory. Reporting bias may be a cause for concern in our study because not all patients who experience minor and nuisance bleeding events (eg, nose bleeds and bruising) will seek medical advice. Therefore, the incidence of bleeding is likely to have been underreported, although more significant bleeds may have been likely recorded. Prasugrel, ticagrelor, and the newer oral anticoagulants became available during the study period, but most patients (90%) were mostly treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin after discharge. We restricted our study to people in England. Thus, the generalizability of our results outside of England is unclear. Finally, we were unable to examine the impact of dosing and duration of discharge antithrombotic drugs and those of emerging risk factors, such as frailty and genetic factors, on risk of future bleeding events.

In summary, bleeding complications after hospital discharge are common and occur more frequently in the first 30 days after hospital discharge. Patients who experience these bleeding events have distinct baseline characteristics. These characteristics differ, depending on the anatomic site of the bleeding event. Identification of these characteristics is an important step toward developing a real‐world risk stratification tool that can facilitate a more patient‐centered approach in deciding on favorable combination and duration of secondary antithrombotic therapy after ACS.

### Validation of a clinical decision rule to predict abuse in young children based on bruising characteristics [^113R2hfC]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Bruising caused by physical abuse is the most common antecedent injury to be overlooked or misdiagnosed as nonabusive before an abuse-related fatality or near-fatality in a young child. Bruising occurs from both nonabuse and abuse, but differences identified by a clinical decision rule may allow improved and earlier recognition of the abused child.

Objective

To refine and validate a previously derived bruising clinical decision rule (BCDR), the TEN-4 (bruising to torso, ear, or neck or any bruising on an infant < 4.99 months of age), for identifying children at risk of having been physically abused.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from December 1, 2011, to March 31, 2016, at emergency departments of 5 urban children's hospitals. Children younger than 4 years with bruising were identified through deliberate examination. Statistical analysis was completed in June 2020.

Exposures

Bruising characteristics in 34 discrete body regions, patterned bruising, cumulative bruise counts, and patient's age. The BCDR was refined and validated based on these variables using binary recursive partitioning analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Injury from abusive vs nonabusive trauma was determined by the consensus judgment of a multidisciplinary expert panel.

Results

A total of 21 123 children were consecutively screened for bruising, and 2161 patients (mean [SD] age, 2.1 [1.1] years; 1296 [60%] male; 1785 [83%] White; 1484 [69%] non-Hispanic/Latino) were enrolled. The expert panel achieved consensus on 2123 patients (98%), classifying 410 (19%) as abuse and 1713 (79%) as nonabuse. A classification tree was fit to refine the rule and validated via bootstrap resampling. The resulting BCDR was 95.6% (95% CI, 93.0%-97.3%) sensitive and 87.1% (95% CI, 85.4%-88.6%) specific for distinguishing abuse from nonabusive trauma based on body region bruised (torso, ear, neck, frenulum, angle of jaw, cheeks [fleshy], eyelids, and subconjunctivae), bruising anywhere on an infant 4.99 months and younger, or patterned bruising (TEN-4-FACESp).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, an affirmative finding for any of the 3 BCDR TEN-4-FACESp components in children younger than 4 years indicated a potential risk for abuse; these results warrant further evaluation. Clinical application of this tool has the potential to improve recognition of abuse in young children with bruising.

### Single bruise characteristics associated with abusive vs accidental Injury [^116F49Nm]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The TEN-4-FACESp bruising clinical decision rule (BCDR) is a validated screening tool utilizing information about a child's body region bruised, age, and pattern of bruising to predict abuse in children younger than 4 years of age. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the accuracy of the BCDR in predicting abuse when only 1 bruise was present and (2) identify other characteristics differentiating abusive from accidental injury in young children with a single bruise.

Methods

Patients included in this secondary analysis were those from the BCDR validation study whose only skin finding was a single bruise (including petechiae, subconjunctival hemorrhage, or frenulum injury). Cases were previously classified as abuse, accident, or indeterminate by an expert panel. We compared demographics, clinical characteristics, bruising regions, and psychosocial risk factors (PRFs) between abuse and accident groups.

Results

Of 349 patients with a single bruise, 27 were classified as abuse. The TEN-4-FACESp BCDR performed with 81.5% sensitivity and 87.6% specificity in this sample. Patients with abusive injuries were (1) younger and (2) less likely to present with an injury complaint but more likely to (3) have a bruise in a BCDR-positive region, (4) have a lower Glasgow Coma Score, and (5) have PRFs.

Conclusions

The TEN-4-FACESp BCDR is an effective screening tool for abuse among young children with a single bruise in the pediatric ED. Even 1 BCDR-positive bruise indicated increased risk for abuse. Negative BCDR results must be interpreted with caution given the higher rate of false negatives in this analysis compared with the validation study.

Reversing Ticagrelor: When and How?

The decision to reverse the pharmacodynamic effects of a platelet antagonist must be based on sound clinical judgment and a clear understanding of the potential risk and benefits, including acute thrombotic events, among patients predisposed because of an underlying condition. There are 3 clinical scenarios where reversal may be indicated:

- Active bleeding, particularly severe or life-threatening.
- Unscheduled, urgent, or emergent procedures that carry a high bleeding risk.
- Major trauma with anticipated bleeding.

After the decision to reverse has been made, the question then becomes: how will reversal be achieved? There are currently no evidence-based options for ticagrelor reversal, underscoring the potential importance of a strategy proposed by Angheloiu et al.
