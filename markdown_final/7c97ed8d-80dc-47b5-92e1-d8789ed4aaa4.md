## Question

If a patient has any baseline abnormality in their EKG, does that impact what cardiac stress can be obtained?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how baseline ECG abnormalities affect the selection and interpretation of cardiac stress testing in patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which baseline ECG abnormalities truly render exercise ECG uninterpretable. Then, I should verify how guidelines recommend selecting stress modalities in the presence of those abnormalities. Next, I will examine how baseline ECG affects test performance and prognostic interpretation. After that, I need to consider special populations and safety issues. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check for any exceptions or nuances I might miss along the way.

> Let me first confirm which baseline ECG findings make exercise ECG unreliable for ischemia detection. Left bundle branch block, ventricular pre-excitation (WPW), and significant resting ST-segment depression (generally ≥ 0.1 mV) are repeatedly cited as rendering exercise ECG interpretation problematic, and guidelines advise against exercise ECG in these settings; digitalis use similarly confounds ST interpretation and is a reason to avoid exercise ECG for diagnostic purposes [^1118jrRS] [^113DCrvR] [^111iA4Wt].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for LBBB specifically. LBBB alters ventricular activation and repolarization, so ischemic ST shifts cannot be reliably distinguished from conduction-related changes; moreover, LBBB is associated with a substantial prevalence of CAD and worse outcomes when stress imaging is abnormal, reinforcing the need for imaging rather than ECG-only testing when LBBB is present [^113caLuu] [^112ArF54].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all conduction disease. Right bundle branch block is different. While RBBB can reduce exercise capacity and complicate ST interpretation in the right precordial leads, it does not universally preclude exercise ECG, though many clinicians still favor imaging when RBBB is present to avoid false positives and to ensure diagnostic confidence. I should acknowledge that nuance explicitly [^11549xUs].

> I need to check the role of ventricular pacing and WPW. Both pacing and pre-excitation distort baseline repolarization and can mask or mimic ischemia, so guidelines recommend pharmacologic vasodilator stress imaging rather than exercise ECG in these scenarios. If rate-related LBBB emerges during exercise, conversion to pharmacologic stress is advised to preserve diagnostic accuracy [^111iA4Wt] [^115ScMtS].

> Next, I should review how baseline ECG abnormalities influence test selection. When the resting ECG is uninterpretable for ischemia due to LBBB, WPW, significant ST depression, or digitalis effect, stress imaging (echo, nuclear, or CMR) is preferred. In patients who cannot exercise adequately, pharmacologic stress imaging is indicated. Conversely, in low-risk patients with a normal resting ECG who can exercise, exercise ECG remains reasonable, though its diagnostic accuracy is lower than imaging and it is rarely stand-alone in contemporary practice [^1118jrRS] [^113DCrvR] [^114kVSqf].

> Let me consider performance characteristics and why baseline abnormalities matter. Exercise ECG has sensitivity and specificity around 60–77%, and performance drops further with resting ST-T abnormalities; in contrast, stress imaging provides direct visualization of ischemia and is less affected by baseline repolarization patterns, which is why guidelines pivot to imaging when the ECG is uninterpretable [^115xuTwe] [^113DCrvR].

> I should double-check prognostic implications tied to baseline ECG. In LBBB, abnormal stress echocardiography confers significantly worse 5-year survival than a normal study, underscoring the prognostic value of imaging in this subgroup; similarly, in women, resting ST abnormalities diminish the diagnostic yield of exercise ECG, prompting a preference for stress imaging in that context [^113caLuu] [^113Us373].

> But wait, what about special populations where baseline ECG is frequently abnormal. In end-stage renal disease, baseline ECGs are often abnormal and exercise tolerance is limited, so pharmacologic stress imaging is favored; in diabetes, guidelines similarly recommend pharmacologic stress imaging when resting ECG abnormalities preclude exercise ECG; in women, resting ST abnormalities and lower diagnostic performance of exercise ECG support imaging as the initial test in higher-risk profiles [^112Wx8gE] [^113Ef7za] [^113Us373].

> I need to ensure safety and monitoring are addressed. Baseline ECG and blood pressure should be recorded before any stress test, continuous ECG monitoring is required during stress and recovery, and life support resources must be available. Pharmacologic vasodilators like regadenoson can precipitate conduction abnormalities, and patients with baseline conduction disease have a higher risk of transient AV block, reinforcing the need for vigilant monitoring and readiness to treat [^1147adxD] [^114QFeHh] [^116hJXqj].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will verify each branch. If the resting ECG is normal and the patient can exercise, exercise ECG is reasonable in low-risk patients, with imaging reserved for indeterminate or abnormal results; if the resting ECG is abnormal in a way that compromises ischemia interpretation (LBBB, WPW, significant ST depression, digitalis), choose stress imaging; if the patient cannot exercise, use pharmacologic stress imaging; if LBBB is present, prefer vasodilator nuclear imaging or stress echo and avoid dobutamine when possible; if RBBB is present, consider imaging to avoid false positives, acknowledging that exercise ECG is not absolutely contraindicated; always document baseline abnormalities in the report because they constrain ECG interpretation and justify modality choice [^1118jrRS] [^113DCrvR] [^115ScMtS] [^115iHkmh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought any baseline abnormality would automatically preclude exercise ECG, but I should correct that. Minor or nonspecific ST-T changes, isolated ectopy, or RBBB do not necessarily make exercise ECG uninterpretable. The decisive factors are whether the abnormality obscures ischemic ST interpretation and whether the patient can achieve adequate exercise, so I need to individualize rather than overgeneralize [^1118jrRS] [^11549xUs].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and reporting standards. Structured reports should explicitly note baseline ECG abnormalities that limit ECG interpretability, record hemodynamics and symptoms at each stage, and specify whether target heart rate or adequate stress was achieved. This transparency supports appropriate modality selection and downstream decision-making and aligns with nuclear and echo reporting standards [^115iHkmh] [^117P7sbH].

Baseline ECG abnormalities **limit the diagnostic accuracy** of exercise ECG stress testing [^114kVSqf] because they obscure ischemic ST changes, reduce sensitivity/specificity, and increase false positives [^113DCrvR] [^113Us373] [^1131oFXK]. For patients with LBBB, WPW, ventricular pacing, or significant resting ST depression, **imaging stress tests** (echo, nuclear, or CMR) are preferred [^111iA4Wt] [^113DCrvR] because they rely on visual or perfusion evidence rather than ECG changes. Exercise ECG is still reasonable if the baseline ECG is only mildly abnormal and interpretable, but any uninterpretable baseline ECG should prompt imaging [^113DCrvR] [^113RJsek]. Pharmacologic stress is indicated when exercise is limited or baseline ECG is uninterpretable [^111iA4Wt] [^115ScMtS].

---

## Impact of baseline ECG abnormalities on stress testing

Baseline ECG abnormalities **reduce diagnostic accuracy** of exercise ECG by masking or mimicking ischemia, leading to false positives/negatives and limiting the reliability of ST-segment analysis [^1118jrRS] [^114kVSqf].

---

### Specific baseline ECG abnormalities and their implications

| **Ecg abnormality** | **Impact on stress testing** | **Recommended stress test modality** |
|-|-|-|
| Left bundle branch block (LBBB) | - Severely limits ECG interpretability <br/> - High false-positive rate <br/> - Exercise ECG contraindicated | - Pharmacologic stress imaging (echo or nuclear) [^115ScMtS] [^113DCrvR] |
| Right bundle branch block (RBBB) | - Moderately limits interpretability <br/> - False positives in right precordial leads | - Exercise or pharmacologic imaging [^notfound] |
| Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome | - Pre-excitation masks ischemia <br/> - Exercise ECG contraindicated | - Pharmacologic stress imaging [^111iA4Wt] |
| Ventricular pacing | - Paced beats obscure ischemic changes <br/> - Exercise ECG contraindicated | - Pharmacologic stress imaging [^111iA4Wt] |
| Resting ST depression (≥ 0.1 mV) | - Baseline ischemia mimics or masks new ischemia <br/> - Exercise ECG contraindicated | - Pharmacologic stress imaging [^notfound] |
| Digitalis use | - ST changes mimic ischemia <br/> - Exercise ECG contraindicated | - Pharmacologic stress imaging [^notfound] |

## Diagnostic accuracy of stress testing modalities in the presence of baseline ECG abnormalities

Exercise ECG has **lower sensitivity and specificity** in patients with baseline abnormalities, whereas imaging modalities maintain higher diagnostic accuracy by directly visualizing ischemia [^115xuTwe] [^113DCrvR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **imaging stress tests** for patients with baseline ECG abnormalities that limit ECG interpretability:

- **ESC 2024**: Do not use exercise ECG if ≥ 0.1 mV resting ST depression, LBBB, or digitalis use [^1118jrRS].
- **ACC/AHA 2021**: Use stress imaging when resting ECG is uninterpretable or baseline abnormalities are present [^113DCrvR] [^117VsZSy].
- **ASE 2020**: Prefer stress imaging when baseline ECG limits interpretation [^113DCrvR].

---

## Alternative stress testing modalities

When baseline ECG limits exercise ECG, **imaging stress tests** are preferred:

- **Stress echocardiography**: Visualizes wall motion; unaffected by baseline ECG [^113DCrvR].
- **Myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT/PET)**: Detects perfusion defects; unaffected by baseline ECG [^111iA4Wt].
- **Cardiac MRI**: Assesses perfusion/function; unaffected by baseline ECG [^113RJsek].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring special consideration

Certain scenarios **warrant tailored testing**:

- **LBBB**: Pharmacologic vasodilator stress (adenosine/regadenoson) preferred; avoid dobutamine [^115ScMtS].
- **WPW**: Pharmacologic stress imaging recommended [^111iA4Wt].
- **Ventricular pacing**: Pharmacologic stress imaging recommended [^111iA4Wt].
- **Digitalis use**: Pharmacologic stress imaging recommended [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications of baseline ECG abnormalities

Baseline abnormalities carry **adverse prognostic implications** and correlate with higher rates of CAD, ischemia, and events, which strengthens the case for imaging stress testing in these patients [^113caLuu] [^111K2sRW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Interpretable baseline ECG**: Exercise ECG reasonable if mild abnormalities.
- **Uninterpretable baseline ECG**: Use stress imaging (echo, nuclear, or CMR) [^113DCrvR].
- **LBBB, WPW, pacing, digitalis**: Pharmacologic stress imaging preferred [^111iA4Wt] [^115ScMtS].
- **Exercise limitation**: Pharmacologic stress imaging indicated [^111iA4Wt].

---

Baseline ECG abnormalities **reduce the accuracy of exercise ECG**; therefore, imaging stress tests are preferred when the ECG is uninterpretable, with pharmacologic stress favored in specific conduction or medication-related scenarios [^115ScMtS] [^113DCrvR].

Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) ST-segment response — diagnostic thresholds and performance in women: Significant ST-segment depression is defined as ≥ 1.0 mm horizontal or downsloping or ≥ 1.5 mm upsloping depression at 60 ms after the J point. In women, sensitivity and specificity for obstructive CAD range from 31% to 71% and from 66% to 86%, with meta-analysis means of 61% and 70% among women and 72% and 77% among men, and AHRQ pooled estimates of 62% (95% CI, 55%–68%) sensitivity and 68% (95% CI, 63%–73%) specificity. Positive predictive value is lower in women (47% versus 77%, P < 0.05) while negative predictive value is similar (78% versus 81%). Diagnostic performance is diminished with resting ST-segment changes (> 0.5 mm), and women who demonstrate such changes should be referred to stress imaging. A markedly positive response — ≥ 2 mm of depression or ≥ 1 mm of elevation in a non–Q-wave lead (excluding aVR) at a low workload (< 5 METs) or persisting for > 5 minutes — is considered a high-risk ETT for both women and men.

The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Scant knowledge exists regarding the significance of either additional ST depression in the presence of baseline depression or new stress-induced ST depression in patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the appearance and/or severity of ST abnormalities during exercise stress testing can accurately predict the prevalence of ischemic burden as measured by quantitative technetium-99m-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging in patients with LV hypertrophy. The results show that the presence of exercise ST-segment depression, as well as its magnitude, are not accurate predictors for identifying patients with coronary artery disease in the presence of electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy.

Non-invasive imaging

Q27. A 48-year-old man with a history of dyslipidaemia is referred to the emergency department because of acute chest pain with radiation to his shoulders and arms. This was accompanied by heavy sweating and nausea which lasted for 30 minutes, starting after his lunch, now 4 h ago. At first medical contact, the patient was pain free and the physical examination was unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG indicates no ST and/or T wave abnormalities. The initial as well as the 1 h follow-up level of hs-cTn is below the ULN without a significant dynamic change. The GRACE risk score is 59. The emergency department physician asks the cardiology fellow on call whether an invasive or non-invasive coronary assessment should follow.

Further investigations depend on patient and test characteristics, as well as local setting and expertise. The patient belongs to the low-risk group with a GRACE risk score of 59, indicative of < 3% risk of death up to 6 months following the index event. Therefore, a non-invasive assessment is recommended, e.g. functional testing by stress echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging or anatomic imaging by coronary CT angiography (CCTA).

Q28. The emergency department physician decided to perform CCTA to exclude obstructive CAD. Your fellow would like to know whether this strategy is in accord with current guidelines.

Correct. Non-invasive anatomical imaging with CCTA is one of the recommended options in this case. CCTA should be considered to exclude obstructive CAD in haemodynamically stable patients with acute chest pain suggestive of NSTE-ACS, but with initial negative hs-cTn, without ischaemic ECG changes and low GRACE score. This approach avoids 30% of invasive coronary angiography procedures.

### Update on exercise stress testing [^115QC3KM]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing is an important diagnostic tool for the evaluation of suspected or known cardiac disease. In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) revised their guidelines for exercise testing. Ten categories from the ACC/ AHA 1997 guidelines were modified: ST heart rate adjustment, unstable angina, older patients, acute coronary syndromes, chest pain centers, acute myocardial infarction, asymptomatic patients, valvular heart disease, rhythm disturbances, and hypertension. Adjustment of the ST heart rate can identify myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic patients with elevated cardiac risk. Intermediate- and low-risk patients with unstable angina, acute coronary syndromes, or chest pain should undergo exercise stress testing when clinically stable. Provided they are stable, patients who have had acute myocardial infarction can undergo a submaximal exercise test before discharge or a symptom-limited exercise stress test any time after two to three weeks have elapsed. In asymptomatic patients with cardiac risk factors, the exercise stress test may provide valuable prognostic information. Aortic regurgitation is the only valvular heart disorder in which there is significant evidence that exercise stress testing is useful in management decisions. The stress test also can be used in older patients to identify the presence of coronary artery disease. However, because of other comorbidities, a pharmacologic stress test may be necessary. Exercise stress testing can help physicians successfully evaluate arrhythmia in patients with syncope. The exercise stress test also can help identify patients at risk of developing hypertension if they show an abnormal hypertensive response to exercise.

### Electrocardiographic characteristics of Brugada syndrome type I during exercise stress test [^112APidU]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Brugada syndrome (BS) is a genetic channelopathy characterized by an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the absence of structural heart disease. Prognostic stratification is necessary to determine which patients are candidates for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The present study aims to evaluate EKG changes during exercise stress tests in patients with BS and to identify any poor prognosis variables.

Methods

This was an observational, case-control study. Three comparison groups were created: patients with Type 1 BS with or without prior arrhythmic events (BE and BNoE subgroups) and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Patients underwent EST and electrocardiographic variables were analyzed.

Results

The study recruited 36 patients with type 1 BS, 12 with prior Event (BE) and 24 without (BNoE). Patients in the BE group, in all postexercise recordings, had lower heart rates, notably in the first minute. A significant difference was also observed in the HR drop in the recovery phase, with a greater drop in relation to maximum HR in the first minute in the group of patients who had events.

Conclusion

BS patients with prior events had a lower capacity to increase heart rate at peak effort and a greater proportional drop in the recovery phase. No relationship was observed between the occurrence of arrhythmic events and ST-segment elevation during the exercise test.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113mic9n]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) role and diagnostic yield in suspected bradycardia — An EPS is an invasive, catheter-based procedure that can be used to test the integrity of cardiac conduction system and to assess potential inducibility of various cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and EPS are well tolerated with the risk of serious procedural complications such as cardiac tamponade and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia minimal; an EPS is generally not performed as the first-line diagnostic assessment in patients with suspected bradycardia, and the use of an EPS has almost exclusively been examined in patients with syncope or presyncope and is generally an adjunctive tool in the evaluation of patients in whom bradycardia is suspected but has not been documented after noninvasive evaluation. In most cases, the cause of symptomatic bradycardia can be established without invasive evaluation, the diagnostic yield of EPS in symptomatic patients with suspected bradycardia has been shown to vary widely (range, 12%–80%), and in 1 study of patients presenting with unexplained syncope those who had history of heart disease had a higher incidence of an abnormal EPS compared with patients who had a structurally normal heart; in addition, the likelihood of an abnormal EPS was greater in patients who had an abnormal ECG at baseline, and EPS may also be performed when the patient is undergoing an invasive procedure such as an endomyocardial biopsy.

Prior stress testing results — implications for acute chest pain evaluation: In patients with moderate or severe ischemia on prior stress testing who were not revascularized and present with acute chest pain, additional noninvasive stress testing is unlikely to change management; such patients can proceed directly to invasive evaluation if revascularization aligns with goals of care, whereas symptomatic patients with inconclusive or mildly abnormal stress tests often have an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

Noninvasive Diagnostic Tests to Diagnose CAD

The optimal strategy to evaluate patients with suspected SCAD is currently uncertain. The recent proliferation of noninvasive cardiac diagnostic testing technology has led to various potential options for the noninvasive diagnosis of CAD. The 2012 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Stable Ischemic Heart Disease from the American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the American College of Physicians, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommended GXT as the first‐line test in patients who are able to exercise in the absence of significant ST‐T wave abnormalities. 3 In contrast, the 2013 and 2014 European Society for Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on SCAD and revascularization are more liberal in their recommendations of stress and anatomic imaging as the initial testing strategy. Class 1 recommendations in the ESC documents are conferred to stress imaging when there are baseline ECG abnormalities, when patients are unable to exercise, and when stress imaging is available and there is local expertise. Furthermore, there is a class 1 recommendation for stress imaging for high‐risk patients and a class IIa indication for CCTA in the diagnosis of SCAD. 1, 2

Many studies have examined the efficacy of CCTA, GXT, MPI, and stress echo in selected populations 43, 44, 45; however, despite widespread clinical adoption of newer technologies, there have been limited data comparing their relative clinical effectiveness, specifically by comparing their real‐world downstream outcomes. 4, 5 The lack of a clear demonstration of an effect on outcomes has led to calls for regulation aimed at controlling spending and improving quality. 46, 47 Little comparative effectiveness research has been published on differing initial noninvasive diagnostic strategies that are currently available to clinicians.

Exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) — diagnostic accuracy and prognostic thresholds are outlined, with lower diagnostic accuracy than stress imaging noted as "sensitivity and specificity range, 60%–77%", and in the WOMEN trial of "824 symptomatic women" exercise ECG was "equally effective" versus exercise SPECT MPI with "similar 2-year CAD event rates (2.0% versus 2.3%; P = 0.59)". Failure to complete Bruce stage 1 "or < 5 METs" or not achieving "85% of age predicted fitness level" increases CAD event risk, whereas "Bruce stage III or > 10 METs with a negative ECG" indicates low risk. After submaximal exercise or with "ischemic ECG ≥ 1.0 mm ST depression", additional stress imaging "may improve its detection and guide clinical management", and "Marked ischemia (eg, ≥ 2.0 mm at reduced workloads) or high Duke or Lauer scores" signifies increased risk and "such patients may benefit from additional testing (anatomic or stress testing)".

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to ECG, ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline 12-lead ECG and record the VA on a 12-lead ECG whenever possible in patients with newly documented VA (frequent premature ventricular complexes, nonsustained VT, sustained monomorphic VT).

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113Ef7za]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes — candidates and modalities for cardiac testing: Candidates for advanced noninvasive cardiac testing include those with symptoms or signs of cardiac or vascular disease and an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG). Exercise ECG testing without or with echocardiography may be used as the initial test. In adults with diabetes ≥ 40 years of age, measurement of coronary artery calcium is also reasonable for cardiovascular risk assessment. Pharmacologic stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging should be considered when resting ECG abnormalities preclude exercise stress testing, and individuals unable to exercise should undergo pharmacologic stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^116THt7F]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Exercise treadmill testing (ETT) recommendations in symptomatic women — For a symptomatic woman with intermediate ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk who is capable of exercising at ≥ 5 METs and who has a normal rest ECG, the ETT is recommended as the initial test of choice, with imaging reserved for those women with resting ST-segment abnormalities or those unable to exercise adequately (Class I; Level of Evidence B). As per standardized reporting, the ETT interpretation should include not only the ST-segment response and risk score measurements but also exercise capacity, chronotropic response, heart rate recovery, and the blood pressure response to exercise (Class I; Level of Evidence B). If an ETT is indeterminate (eg, negative ECG in the setting of submaximal exercise [below age-predicted level or failure to achieve > 85% of predicted maximal heart rate]) or abnormal, the next step should be additional diagnostic testing with stress imaging, and individualized decision making and targeted anti-ischemic therapies after the ETT should consider the woman's ongoing symptom burden and the degree of abnormalities noted during the ETT (Class I; Level of Evidence C).

Cardiovascular

Although cardiac toxicity remains a major concern in HD IL2 treatment, the baseline risk has diminished in the general population in recent decades. The reduction in cigarette smoking, aggressive prophylaxis with statin drugs and management of hypertension and cardiovascular disease has significantly reduced the incidence of occult cardiac disease. The use of coronary artery bypass grafts and stents has corrected existing CAD with preservation of cardiac functional reserve. Careful attention to family history, risk factors and lifestyle is important in determining the extent of cardiac risk and degree of screening needed in preparation for HDIL2 treatment. Although the package insert mandates thallium screening in all patients, most sites follow different approaches, as the thallium stress test produces many false positive results. Patients below the age of 40–50 without relevant history or risk factors generally may not require extensive screening. Additionally, patients with prior history of coronary artery disease which has been corrected may be considered for treatment if this occurred at least 6–12 months in the past, but should be tested. The extensive use of VEGF targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mRCC is an important historical issue. These agents can be cardiotoxic and can produce reductions in left ventricle ejection fraction, particularly if treatment duration has exceeded one year. Ideally, patients should be off anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (anti-VEGFR TKIs) for 3 months before HD IL-2. Careful and complete screening is mandatory in these patients. An EKG exercise treadmill stress testing is the standard modality for testing patients. Ultrasound assessment of ejection fraction and myocardial wall activity are valuable parts of the stress test and may be employed in patients with risk factors. Ideally, stress testing should be done with the patient off of beta blockers, as they will be discontinued during HD IL-2 therapy. Dipyridamole (Persantin®) stress testing may be used in patients unable to effectively use a treadmill. If the stress test is abnormal, a cardiologist should be consulted, and ultimately determine both the need for and the path of further evaluation to help make a final decision about eligibility.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^112Wx8gE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Noninvasive testing with electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram, pharmacological stress echocardiography, and nuclear imaging (with single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] or cardiac positron emission tomography [PET]) are suggested as the first steps in investigating for presence of CAD. Patients should have baseline ECGs to evaluate for Q waves, ST‐T changes, T wave inversions, and left bundle branch block, which previously have been shown to be predictive of CAD. 25 Exercise ECG is not recommended, given abnormal baseline ECGs and overall poor exercise tolerance in this patient population. A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram performed at dry weight is also important because it can help identify impaired LVEF and wall motion abnormalities, which may be signs of prognostically significant CAD. 26 A normal cardiac stress test has a high negative predictive value for cardiovascular events 27, 28 in the perioperative and follow‐up periods, as shown in a study of renal transplant candidates undergoing preoperative SPECT. 29 A hybrid SPECT/computed tomography scan assesses for ischemia and coronary artery calcification, which is highly prevalent in patients with ESRD. 30 Coronary artery calcium score, however, does not independently provide significant incremental prognostic value in predicting mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction in ESRD. 30 These findings may be explained by the differences in distribution of calcium within the coronary artery in ESRD, as shown by intravascular imaging. 31 Patients with ESRD have a higher prevalence of intimal calcium without greater lipid arc or thin‐cap fibroatheroma, which are markers of vulnerable plaque. 31

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) performance and risk thresholds — Diagnostic accuracy of the exercise ECG is lower than stress imaging (sensitivity and specificity range, 60%–77%), yet it retains prognostic value; in the WOMEN trial including 824 symptomatic women, exercise ECG and exercise SPECT MPI had similar 2-year CAD event rates (2.0% versus 2.3%; P = 0.59). Failure to complete the first stage of the Bruce protocol (or < 5 METs) or to achieve 85% of age predicted fitness level increases CAD event risk, whereas patients reaching Bruce stage III or > 10 METs with a negative ECG have a low risk of CAD events. In patients with submaximal exercise or ischemic ECG ≥ 1.0 mm ST depression, additional stress imaging may improve risk detection and guide clinical management; marked ischemia (eg, ≥ 2.0 mm at reduced workloads) or high Duke or Lauer scores signify increased risk and such patients may benefit from additional testing. Use of attenuation correction algorithms and prone imaging can reduce MPI artifacts.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Diastolic stress testing — indications: Diastolic stress testing is indicated when resting echocardiography does not explain the symptoms of heart failure or dyspnea, especially with exertion. In general, patients with completely normal hearts and diastolic function at rest with preserved e′ velocity (> 7 cm/sec for septal e′, > 10 cm/sec for lateral e′) need not undergo stress testing. Likewise, patients with abnormal findings at baseline consistent with elevated LV filling pressures should not be referred for stress testing, and the most appropriate patient population for diastolic exercise testing is the group of patients with grade I diastolic dysfunction.

### Provocation testing in congenital long QT syndrome: a practical guide [^113UtNuk]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary cardiac channelopathy with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2500. A prolonged resting QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc interval) remains a key diagnostic component; however, the QTc value may be normal in up to 40% of patients with genotype-positive LQTS and borderline in a further 30%. Provocation of QTc prolongation and T-wave changes may be pivotal to unmasking the diagnosis and useful in predicting genotype. LQTS provocation testing involves assessment of repolarization during and after exercise, in response to changes in heart rate or autonomic tone, with patients with LQTS exhibiting a maladaptive repolarization response. We review the utility and strengths and limitations of 4 forms of provocation testing-stand-up test, exercise stress test, epinephrine challenge, and mental stress test-in diagnosing LQTS and provide some practical guidance for performing provocation testing. Ultimately, exercise testing, when feasible, is the most useful form of provocation testing when considering diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

### Normalization of abnormal T-waves during stress testing does not identify patients with reversible perfusion defects [^111MoQJj]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if T-wave normalization during exercise or dobutamine stress testing identified patients with myocardial ischemia as indicated by reversible perfusion defects.

Methods

Exercise or dobutamine stress tests with perfusion scintigraphy were performed in 1,173 patients with abnormal T-waves on their baseline electrocardiograms. The results of perfusion scintigraphy were compared in patients with and without stress-induced T-wave normalization.

Results

Only 33 of 270 patients with reversible perfusion defects (12.2%) had T-wave normalization during stress while 76.4% of 140 patients who had T-wave normalization during stress did not have a reversible perfusion defect. Results were similar for patients who did or did not reach 85% of their maximal predicted heart rate, for patients with and without Q-wave infarction on the baseline EKG and for patients who did or did not have ischemic ST-segment depression during stress.

Conclusions

T-wave normalization during stress testing has low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value for stress-induced reversible myocardial ischemia.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113caLuu]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Stress echocardiography in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) — test selection and prognosis: The prevalence of CAD in patients with LBBB is between 30 and 50%, and exercise ECG stress testing is not an option; specificity of exercise SPECT is reduced with dipyridamole or adenosine preferred, whereas stress echocardiography has a good specificity in LBBB. Prognostically, five-year survival was significantly lower in patients with LBBB and an abnormal stress echocardiogram (77%) vs patients with LBBB and a normal stress echocardiogram (92%; p = 0.02). Patients with LBBB but with a normal ESE had a good prognosis with event rates of 0.92%/ yr, whereas those with an abnormal stress echocardiogram had worse outcomes with a mortality rate of 4.4%/yr and a major adverse cardiovascular event rate of 3.6%/yr. Assessment of wall thickening during stress echocardiography in LBBB was more specific than myocardial perfusion with nuclear imaging, stress echocardiography can recognize nonischemic cardiac conditions associated with LBBB on baseline images, and quantitative assessment of myocardial deformation may increase its prognostic value.

### Implications of left bundle branch block in patient treatment [^112DFDYp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) causes an abnormal pattern of cardiac activation and affects regional myocardial function. Although recognition of LBBB on the surface electrocardiogram is straightforward, dissecting its effect on patient treatment and outcome can be more challenging. The altered pattern of cardiac activation in LBBB causes electrical and mechanical ventricular dyssynchrony, influences ischemia detection on the surface electrocardiogram, and affects stress testing and imaging modalities dependent on wall motion and thickening. Restoration of synchrony by biventricular pacing can improve symptoms and longevity in carefully selected patients. The diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of LBBB across this spectrum are discussed in this review.

Monitoring during immunotherapy for breast cancer should prioritize early detection and mitigation of toxicity, as the goal of appropriate monitoring during immunotherapy treatment is to promptly detect immune-related toxicities and intervene before these toxicities cause significant morbidity or mortality. An important principle is to properly educate patients and staff about the symptoms that require prompt reporting to avoid life-threatening complications. Particular attention should be paid to new or worsening fatigue, headaches, rash, respiratory symptoms, changes in bowel function, visual changes/eye pain, or musculoskeletal symptoms, and careful monitoring of laboratory studies is also required, including electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, liver function, and thyroid hormone levels. Baseline history/physical exam should include assessment of autoimmune, infectious, neurologic, bone, musculoskeletal, or endocrine pre-existing conditions. Pulse oximetry assessment and monitoring is recommended. An electrocardiogram (EKG) should be considered to provide a pre-treatment baseline for comparison with future EKGs obtained due to cardiac-related symptoms. Baseline troponin levels should also be obtained to provide useful information for evaluating potential future cardiotoxicity, and subsequently measured as clinically indicated. Routine monitoring of patients is generally more frequent during the initial 4 cycles of treatment, with clinical assessments and laboratory testing complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) — evaluation of cardiovascular symptoms: A multidisciplinary approach should be used in the evaluation of most patients with PASC, with primary care clinicians coordinating with subspecialists, and a basic cardiopulmonary evaluation can usually be performed up front to determine the need for specialty care. Although symptom type and severity should inform diagnostic testing, a reasonable initial approach for those with cardiovascular symptoms includes basic laboratory testing, an electrocardiogram (ECG), an echocardiogram, an ambulatory rhythm monitor, chest imaging (X-ray and/or CT), and/or pulmonary function tests. Cardiology consultation is recommended for those with abnormal cardiac test results, known cardiovascular disease with new or worsening symptoms or signs, documented cardiac complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and/or persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms that are not otherwise explained. As part of a PASC evaluation, cardiologists should perform a thorough history and physical examination, reviewing all relevant tests to help determine the probability of PASC-CVD; if myocarditis, pericarditis, or other myocardial involvement is suspected, further evaluation should be performed as recommended in the myocarditis section. Additional testing may also be required based on the clinical presentation, and for those with persistent symptoms but without PASC-CVD, additional evaluation for PASC-CVS should be performed, dictated by the most prominent symptom(s), the patient's baseline characteristics, and the pretest probability of cardiovascular disease.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^114YRYqj]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography for risk stratification — Stress echocardiography is a useful technique for the risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), with studies documenting prognostic use across symptoms, known CAD, prior coronary artery revascularization, prior myocardial infarction, and asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CAD. A normal exercise echocardiogram result is associated with an annual event rate of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction of less than 1%, equivalent to that of an age- and sex-matched population, and these patients do not require further diagnostic evaluation unless there is a change in clinical status. Patients with a normal pharmacologic stress echocardiogram result have a slightly higher event rate. Patients with extensive stress-induced abnormalities in a multivessel distribution are at a high risk of mortality and cardiac events, and in these patients, coronary angiography and subsequent myocardial revascularization may be justified. An exercise wall-motion score index greater than 1.4 or exercise ejection fraction (EF) less than 50% portends a significantly worse prognosis. Baseline left ventricular (LV) function expressed as wall-motion score index or EF remains a powerful predictor, and patients with resting LV dysfunction but no inducible myocardial ischemia have an intermediate risk, whereas patients with resting LV dysfunction and new wall-motion abnormalities have the greatest risk for death and cardiac events.

### Prognostic value of exercise stress technetium-99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with normal baseline electrocardiograms [^113kWowG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Exercise stress electrocardiography is the recommended method for cardiac evaluation of patients with normal electrocardiograms (ECGs). There are no data to indicate an independent value of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in predicting mortality in these patients. This study assessed the value of exercise stress MPI in predicting mortality in patients with normal baseline ECGs. We studied 319 patients (55 ± 10 years of age; 180 men) with normal ECGs by exercise stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin MPI. End points during follow-up were cardiac and all-cause mortalities and hard cardiac events. A normal scan was detected in 190 patients (60%). Myocardial perfusion abnormalities were fixed in 59 patients (18%) and reversible in 70 (23%). During a mean follow-up of 7 ± 1.2 years, 46 patients (14%) died. Death was considered cardiac in 28 patients (9%). Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 12 patients (4%). Annual cardiac death rates were 0.4% in patients with normal perfusion, and 2.7% in patients with reversible defects. Annual total mortality rates were 1.1% in patients with normal perfusion and 3.4% in patients with reversible defects. In a multivariate analysis model, reversible perfusion abnormalities were associated with cardiac death (RR 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 5.1) and hard cardiac events (RR 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.5). Perfusion abnormalities in multivessel distribution were predictive of all-cause mortality (RR 2, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 3.2). ST-segment depression was not significantly associated with events. In conclusion, stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin MPI provides independent information for predicting cardiac and overall mortalities in patients with normal ECGs. Reversible perfusion abnormalities, but not ischemic electrocardiographic changes, are predictive of outcome in these patients.

### Optimizing the assessment of patient clinical risk at the time of cardiac stress Testing [^111GvgR7]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to a marked temporal decline in inducible myocardial ischemia over recent decades, most diagnostic patients now referred for cardiac stress testing have nonischemic studies. Among nonischemic patients, however, long-term risk is heterogeneous and highly influenced by a variety of clinical parameters. Herein, we review 8 factors that can govern long-term clinical risk: coronary risk factor burden; patient symptoms; exercise capacity and exercise test responses; the need for pharmacologic stress testing; autonomic function; musculoskeletal status; subclinical atherosclerosis; and psychosocial risk. To capture the clinical benefit provided by both assessing myocardial ischemia and these additional parameters, the authors propose that a cardiac stress tests report have an additional component beyond statements as to the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease and/or magnitude of ischemia. This added component could be a comment section designed to make referring physicians aware of aspects of long-term risk that may influence clinical management and potentially lead to changes in the intensity of risk factor management, frequency of follow-up, need for further testing, or other management decisions. In this manner, the increasingly frequent normal stress test result might more commonly influence treatment recommendations and even patient behavior, thus leading to improvement in patient outcomes even in the setting of normal stress test results.

### Preoperative stress testing: new guidelines [^115LUtKW]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

To date, there are no well controlled trials in the literature that demonstrate an outcome benefit using stress testing as a screening procedure before noncardiac surgery. Perioperative beta-blockade significantly decreases morbidity and mortality, and thus reduces any potential benefit stress testing may have in identifying patients who may advance to more invasive treatment. Preoperative percutaneous coronary intervention has unproven perioperative benefit, and coronary artery bypass graft carries risks that often offset the risk of noncardiac surgery. Unless an outcome benefit from cardiac testing and procedures can be demonstrated in a properly designed trial, their use should generally be restricted to situations in which symptoms or other cardiac findings warrant cardiac evaluation and treatment, regardless of upcoming surgery.

### Initial diagnostic evaluation of stable coronary artery disease: the Need for a patient-centered strategy [^113RJsek]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The authors do quote existing guidelines but do not stress that these guidelines offer specific scenarios for some of the recommendations; they also seem to overstate the impact of their findings. It is clear that not all patients with suspected CAD are the same and risk factors, pre‐existing diagnoses, ability to exercise, the interpretability of an ECG, and the purpose of the evaluation should be considered in the selection of noninvasive testing. The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines clearly base noninvasive test selection for the initial diagnosis of CAD on the pretest likelihood of CAD and actually make a Class I recommendation for GXT in patients with an intermediate likelihood of CAD who have an interpretable ECG and can exercise. 3 A virtually identical recommendation is made by the 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as supported by the appropriate use criteria. 4, 5 Thus, it appears that no guidelines recommend cardiac imaging procedures as the initial test in this population, although the European Society of Cardiology document does indicate that stress imaging is an initial testing option depending on local expertise. Both guidelines suggest stress imaging when the pretest likelihood is higher than intermediate or when the resting ECG is uninterpretable. It also is obvious that GXT cannot be considered the initial testing option when patients are unable to exercise and pharmacologic stress imaging or CCTA would clearly be rational and appropriate. 3, 4 Thus, while GXT may well serve as the first‐line test in some patients, all guidelines indicate that cardiac imaging (stress echocardiography, stress cardiac magnetic resonance, stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, and CCTA) may be selected and in fact preferable in many patients.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Conduction disease monitoring and stress testing — Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring can be used to document clinically significant arrhythmias in asymptomatic patients, and most current monitoring systems will automatically store clinically abnormal rhythms in addition to patient-triggered recordings. However, progression of left bundle branch block (LBBB) and bifascicular block to atrioventricular block and bradycardia is low, approximately 1% per year, with approximately half of the patients presenting with syncope and the other half with symptoms including fatigue, chest pain, or dyspnea; most studies have reported that LBBB is associated with higher mortality than other forms of conduction disorders. If LBBB is present, ischemic electrocardiographic changes are more difficult to interpret, and an imaging component is necessary, and the threshold to consider stress testing is lower in patients with LBBB and concern for ischemia; rate related LBBB has been reported as a possible cause of nonischemic chest pain. Exercise induced LBBB, but not exercise induced RBBB, has been associated with increased risk of death and cardiac events. In another study of patients with connective tissue disease, new onset LBBB, and normal transthoracic echocardiograms, cardiac MRI identified significant abnormalities in 42% of patients.

### Does recovery from submaximal exercise predict response to cardiac resynchronisation therapy? [^1148SEPa]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). Although patient eligibility is currently primarily based on the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG, approximately 30%–40% of patients are non-responders. Research has focused on deriving new and more advanced markers from the ECG or echocardiogram to better predict response after CRT. However, sensitivity and specificity should be further improved in order to truly affect clinical decision making.

Incorporation of exercise parameters may further improve patient selection, but these are not yet part of routine clinical decision making for CRT. However, several studies showed a positive relationship between pre-implantation maximal exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake; VO 2 peak) and CRT response, suggesting that more severely impaired HF patients are less likely to achieve an echocardiographic response. This may be because their exercise capacity is more severely limited by peripheral derangements. Yet, studies investigating the influence of baseline 'exercise' characteristics on echocardiographic response are relatively scarce, as opposed to trials investigating electrical and mechanical substrates.

A barrier for the widespread implementation of assessment of maximal exercise capacity is that symptom limiting exercise testing is burdensome, and often not truly achievable for patients with severe HF. Therefore, 'submaximal' exercise testing could be a valuable alternative. One of the submaximal exercise parameters that reflect exercise capacity are oxygen kinetics. Oxygen kinetics describe the rate of increase of oxygen uptake during a short constant-load submaximal exercise bout (VO 2 onset kinetics) and the rate of decline during recovery (VO 2 recovery kinetics). Assessment of VO 2 kinetics is safe, feasible and not physically burdensome for severely impaired patients, as it only requires an exercise effort of several minutes below the anaerobic threshold. In HF patients, oxygen kinetics were shown to be reproducible and well correlated with exercise capacity and prognosis. In addition, VO 2 recovery kinetics were shown to be useful as a predictor of the effect of an exercise training programme.

The main goal of this study was to investigate whether submaximal exercise testing, and in particular oxygen uptake kinetics, can be used to predict the response to CRT. In addition, use of submaximal exercise parameters was compared with conventional parameters that require maximal exertion.

### Cardiac screening with electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^117VTJqh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac screening in adults with resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging can reveal findings associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease events, but inappropriate cardiac testing of low-risk adults has been identified as an important area of overuse by several professional societies.

Methods

Narrative review based on published systematic reviews; guidelines; and articles on the yield, benefits, and harms of cardiac screening in low-risk adults.

Results

Cardiac screening has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. It is also associated with potential harms due to false-positive results because they can lead to subsequent, potentially unnecessary tests and procedures. Cardiac screening is likely to be particularly inefficient in adults at low risk for coronary heart disease given the low prevalence and predictive values of testing in this population and the low likelihood that positive findings will affect treatment decisions. In this patient population, clinicians should focus on strategies for mitigating cardiovascular risk by treating modifiable risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and overweight) and encouraging healthy levels of exercise.

High-Value Care Advice

Clinicians should not screen for cardiac disease in asymptomatic, low-risk adults with resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or stress myocardial perfusion imaging.

Prior moderate-to-severe ischemia on previous stress testing — acute chest pain management: In patients with evidence of moderate or severe ischemia on prior stress testing who were not revascularized and now present with acute chest pain, additional noninvasive stress testing is unlikely to result in any change in management, and such patients can proceed directly to an invasive evaluation if coronary revascularization aligns with care goals; symptomatic patients with inconclusive or mildly abnormal stress tests often have an increased risk of MACE, and patients with previous stress testing often have atherosclerotic plaque and are at risk for obstructive CAD lesions.

As with exercise testing, anti-ischemic cardiac medications (including β-blockers, nitrates, and calcium antagonists) have been reported to decrease the diagnostic accuracy of vasodilator stress testing.

### What should be done with the asymptomatic patient with right bundle branch block? [^11549xUs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

If patients with concomitant imaging stress test had been included, reporting the data could have shed light on the issue of sensitivity to detect ischemia. Confirming the findings in previous studies, Gaba et al 18 reported that patients with RBBB were older than those without RBBB. In addition, peak heart rate was significantly lower and metabolic equivalents achieved was significantly lower. The percentage of the patients reaching target heart rate and the average percentage of the age‐adjusted maximal heart rate reached are not reported. With an average peak heart rate of 134.4 beats per minute and average age of 59 years (Tables 1 and 3), it is possible that a higher percentage of patients with RBBB did not reach target heart rate and, therefore, significant ischemia could have been missed. Moreover, patients with RBBB often have ST depression in the right precordial leads that become deeper during exercise. Isolated ST depression in V1 to V3 in patients with RBBB is usually not interpreted as a sign of ischemia. Studying a cohort of patients who underwent pharmacologic stress test could answer the question of whether RBBB at rest is associated with extensive coronary artery disease and worse prognosis, as was recently suggested for patients with acute coronary syndromes. 19, 20, 21

In the current cohort, patients with RBBB had lower exercise capacity, had slower heart rate recovery, and more often need to stop the test because of dyspnea compared with the patients without RBBB. 18 Thus, RBBB can be a marker for underlying subclinical cardiac conditions, including diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function; hypertension was more frequent in the patients with RBBB than in those without.

In addition, it is unclear whether the study included only patients with RBBB at baseline ECG in the RBBB group or also those with exercise‐induced RBBB. Stein et al reported that the mortality of patients with exercise‐induced RBBB during a stress test is relatively high. 22 However, these patients were older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients without exercise‐induced RBBB. After adjusting for age, exercise‐induced RBBB was no longer significantly associated with all‐cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. 22

### Prognosis in patients achieving ≥ 10 METS on exercise stress testing: was SPECT imaging useful? [^1158K3yo]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over exercise ECG stress testing alone is unclear in individuals attaining a workload of ≥ 10 METS. The purpose of this prospective study is to determine mortality and nonfatal cardiac events in patients at either intermediate pretest risk for CAD or patients with known CAD, achieving ≥ 10 METS regardless of peak exercise heart rate. The authors previously reported a low prevalence of significant ischemia in this patient cohort.

Methods

Baseline characteristics, ECG stress test findings, and perfusion and function results from quantitative gated (99m)Tc-SPECT MPI were compared by achievement of a maximum age-predicted heart rate ≥ 85% in 509 consecutive patients who reached ≥ 10 METS. Events including all-cause and cardiac mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and late revascularization (> 4 weeks after MPI) were prospectively collected.

Results

Of the 509 patients achieving ≥ 10 METS, follow-up for mortality was obtained in 463 (91%). Those lost to follow-up were older and had higher rates of tobacco use. The prevalences of CAD risk factors, prior known CAD, and MPI abnormalities were higher for the 68 patients failing to reach 85% of their target heart rate. The rate of ≥ 10% left-ventricular (LV) ischemia by MPI remained very low irrespective of attained heart rate (0.6% (3/463)). Six (1.2%) had an LVEF < 40%. Death occurred in 12 (2.6%) patients, one of which was classified as cardiac (0.1%/year). The other 11 deaths were related to cancer. Additionally, there were three nonfatal MIs (0.7%) and one late revascularization (0.2%). Only one of these patients had any ischemia on MPI. No cardiac event patient had exercise ST depression or ≥ 5% LV ischemia.

Conclusions

Thus, patients at intermediate risk for CAD or known CAD achieving ≥ 10 METS have a very low prevalence of ≥ 10% LV ischemia and very low rates of cardiac mortality, nonfatal MI, and late revascularization, irrespective of heart rate achieved. Cardiac events did not correlate with abnormalities on the index MPI study. These results suggest that patients who attain ≥ 10 METS during exercise stress have an excellent prognosis over an intermediate term of follow-up, regardless of peak exercise heart rate achieved. The added value of MPI to standard exercise ECG testing in this population is questionable.

### Exercise-electrocardiography and / or pharmacological stress echocardiography for non-invasive risk stratification early after uncomplicated myocardial infarction. A prospective international large scale multicentre study [^114dgs4B]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of the present study was to assess the relative prognostic value of clinical variables, the exercise electrocardiography test and the pharmacological stress echocardiography test either with dipyridamole or dobutamine early after a first uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction in a large, multicentre, prospective study.

Methods and Results

Seven hundred and fifty-nine in-hospital patients (age = 56 ± 10 years) with a recent and first clinical uncomplicated myocardial infarction, with baseline echocardiographic findings of satisfactory quality, an interpretable ECG and able to exercise underwent a resting 2D echocardiogram, a pharmacological stress test with either dipyridamole or dobutamine and an exercise electrocardiography test at a mean of 10 days from the infarction; they were followed-up for a median of 10 months. During the follow-up, there were 13 deaths, 23 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 59 re-hospitalizations for unstable angina. When all spontaneous events were considered, with multivariate analysis, the difference between the wall motion score index at rest and peak stress (delta wall motion score index), and exercise duration were independent predictors of future spontaneous events (relative risk 7.2; 95% CI = 2.73–19.1; P = 0.000; relative risk 1.1, 95% CI = 1.02–1.18; P = 0.008, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a better outcome for those patients with a negative pharmacological stress echocardiography test compared to patients with low dose positivity (94.7 vs 74.8%, P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Stress echocardiography tests provide stronger information than historical and exercise electrocardiography test variables. Pharmacological echocardiography as well as the exercise ECG is able to predict all spontaneously occurring events when the presence as well as the timing, severity, and extension of stress-induced wall motion abnormalities are considered.

### Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death: current status and challenges for the future [^1128B3eA]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system-based risk assessment in patients with genetically based cardiac diseases is in its infancy but preliminary encouraging data are being obtained. Hyperreactive ANS reflexes leading to very abrupt RR interval changes in either direction appear to pose an increased risk in those LQTS patients (LQT1) whose genetic mutations impair the I Ks current and who are thereby unable to appropriately adapt their QT interval to abrupt heart rate changes. This is an example of how ANS responses may dangerously interact with underlying genetic abnormalities.

Regional abnormalities in cardiac sympathetic innervation are associated with increased arrhythmic risk and they can be quantified by imaging techniques. Recently, the 123 -I MIBG defect score was found to independently predict ventricular arrhythmias causing appropriate ICD shocks. The combination of traditional markers of ANS activity with imaging techniques quantifying the degree of sympathetic denervation at ventricular level appears promising.

Autonomic nervous system markers contribute to SCD risk stratification. Arrhythmic risk is enhanced whenever markers of vagal activity decrease or markers of sympathetic activity increase. Both RR and QT variability may provide useful and complementary information. Reflex autonomic responses are more informative than baseline measurements. The limited use of ANS tests is partially due to their complexity. Analyses derived from tests as simple as an exercise stress test are more likely to impact on clinical practice.

A low-risk, abnormal imaging stress test does not lead to invasive angiography, except in high-risk vascular and nonvascular surgeries, and solid organ transplantation, where it may be appropriate. When at least moderate-risk is seen on imaging stress testing, a recommendation for invasive angiography may be appropriate for intermediate-risk nonvascular surgery, whereas the recommendation of coronary angiography is appropriate for intermediate-risk vascular, high-risk vascular, high-risk nonvascular surgeries, and solid organ transplantation.

### Conduction abnormalities during dipyridamole stress testing [^116hJXqj]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pharmacological stress tests using dipyridamole are considered to be safe. However, cases of atrioventricular (AV) block have been reported. We retrospectively analyzed ECG at baseline and during dipyridamole stress tests of 2010 consecutive patients (patients with second or third degree AV block were excluded). At baseline, 350 (17.4%) patients had conduction abnormalities. Following dipyridamole infusion 16 patients (0.8%) developed a transient change in AV conduction (15 patients) and or sinus arrest (1 patient). Compared to patients without baseline conduction abnormalities, patients with any conduction abnormalities at baseline were at a higher risk for the development of AV block after dipyridamole infusion [0.3% vs 3.14%, respectively; P < .0001].

Study description — The Study Description should be the next section of the structured report and should include all the parameters used in acquiring the study; it must include a description of the stress test performed, including the type of stress test (i.e., exercise or pharmacologic). For stress tests, it is necessary to include the type of protocol, duration of exercise, and its adequacy as determined by exercise time, peak heart rate, percent maximal predicted heart rate (MPHR), pressure rate product (PRP), and estimated metabolic equivalents (METS). For pharmacologic stress tests, the pharmacologic agent used, the dose received, including the infusion rate and duration, hemodynamic response to the dose, and use of adjunctive exercise must be documented; if pharmacologic stress is performed after attempted exercise, exercise parameters should be reported in addition to pharmacologic parameters, and the time of administration of radioactivity is also required for either modality, with specific data elements for this section in Table 4. The electrocardiographic (ECG) data pertinent to the test should be reported next, including the presence of any baseline ECG abnormalities that might preclude a conclusion regarding interpretation of the ECG stress response; comparison to prior tests and inclusion of parameters that allow calculation of validated risk scores (e.g., the Duke treadmill score) are recommended, and ideally stress ECG data would be presented in a tabular format with variables at each stage of stress and recovery. The structured report format continues with variables that define the imaging process including the protocol utilized, the patient position, radiopharmaceutical doses administered, their time of administration, and whether attenuation correction or other modalities were used, with these data elements presented in Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10. Following the imaging parameters, the left ventricular (LV) perfusion results should be provided; every qualitative assessment of LV perfusion should include a summary that provides an overall statement of LV perfusion abnormality, followed by the size, location, severity, and degree of reversibility of any perfusion defects as shown in Table 11, and perfusion defect location should be described according to the standardized 17-segment model.

Module 3: Screening of silent myocardial ischemia

6. A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) should be considered at least annually in asymptomatic patients with diabetes at INTERMEDIATE, HIGH, and VERY HIGH RISK. [IIa, B]

Summary of evidence

On the basis of expert-opinion evidence, an annual resting ECG is recommended for diabetic patients at high and very high cardiovascular risk, given its low cost, high safety, and prognostic value of ECG abnormalities, which must lead to further exploration.
In the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) Study, patients with type 1 diabetes had a mean follow-up of 19 years and underwent at least one ECG annually. The presence of any major ECG abnormalities was associated with a more than twofold increased risk of CVD events (hazard ratio [HR] 2.10 [95% CI 1.26–3.48] vs. no abnormality/normal ECG, and 2.19 [95% CI 1.46–3.29] vs. no major abnormality).
In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), one in every six newly diagnosed patients with diabetes had ECG evidence of silent myocardial infarction.
The MiSAD study included 925 asymptomatic intermediate to high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent an ECG stress test, which, if positive, led to stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) was 12.5% (abnormal exercise test). Of individuals with CAD, 6.4% had abnormal perfusion at MPI. Multivariate analysis showed that, in the overall population, the associated independent risk factors were age, total cholesterol, proteinuria, and, importantly, ST-T abnormalities on resting ECG, which had the highest odds ratio (9.27, CI 4.44–19.38) and was the only risk factor identified in both women and men. Abnormal MPI predicted cardiac events at 5 years (HR 5.5, 95% CI 2.4–12.3, p < 0.001). The relevance of ST-T abnormalities on resting ECG as a predictor of silent CAD highlights the importance of performing periodic resting ECGs in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Universal screening for coronary artery disease with stress induction of myocardial ischemia does not improve outcomes and is NOT RECOMMENDED in truly asymptomatic diabetic patients when in the absence of resting ECG abnormalities, even in the presence of a high-risk condition for cardiovascular events.

### The utility of sodium channel provocation in unexplained cardiac arrest survivors and electrocardiographic predictors of ventricular fibrillation recurrence [^1153BRDT]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients surviving an unexpected cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) are subjected to thorough cardiovascular assessment in order to identify a potential cause. In most cases, coronary angiography or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) will provide a diagnosis. However, in those without a clear structural, toxicological, or metabolic abnormality, or a baseline electrical disorder, further investigations are often required. In some cases, advanced cardiac imaging with contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance may identify areas of myocardial fibrosis or motion abnormalities not appreciated on TTE, exercise stress testing, or provocation with epinephrine in those not able to perform exercise stress testing, may unmask long QT syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sodium channel blocker provocation (SCBP) may identify a concealed form of Brugada syndrome.

National registry data suggests the yield of the drug-induced type 1 Brugada pattern (DI-T1BP) following SCBP with procainamide is 6.9% in cardiac arrest survivors with preserved ejection fraction, while the yield of the DI-T1BP following SCBP with ajmaline has been described in relatives of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome victims, its utility in a large consecutive cohort of cardiac arrest survivors has yet to be reported. – Furthermore, the potential for false positives with ajmaline provocation has been highlighted by a Turkish study in which 27.1% of patients with atrio-ventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia and 4.5% of unrelated controls developed the DI-T1BP following ajmaline provocation.

Following the systematic assessment described above, those patients without a reversible metabolic or toxic cause and not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for a recognized structural or electrical cardiac disorder may be classified as suffering from idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). The most recent consensus-derived diagnosis of IVF relies on the exclusion of an alternative structural or primary electrical disorder following comprehensive evaluation. A meta-analysis of long-term outcomes in patients with IVF suggests the estimated recurrent event rate may be as high at 31% during an average follow-up period of 5 years.

We aimed to determine the yield and significance of the DI-T1BP in a consecutive cohort of survivors with otherwise unexplained cardiac arrest (UCA) undergoing SCBP with either ajmaline or procainamide. We also investigated whether baseline clinical and ECG parameters predict either response to SCBP or the recurrence of VF.

### Arm exercise stress testing: diagnostic options in stable coronary artery disease [^114mWFxW]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and prognostic testing in coronary artery disease (CAD) is a rapidly expanding field and now includes a range of functional tests, imaging modalities and combinations of the two (stress imaging). For patients suspected of having occlusive CAD, current European Society of Cardiology and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidancerecommends an approach where the probability of obstructive disease and the risk of future events are estimated to determine the next steps. Those at low-risk on the basis of history, examination and basic investigations do not need further assessment, while those at high-risk can proceed directly to treatment, including invasive angiography, if needed. However, for intermediate risk patients, there are a number of options.

Ideally, investigations for this population should be non-invasive, acceptable and applicable to a wide patient population and affordable for the health service. It should perform well enough to exclude the diagnosis while stratifying the risk of future events in those with occlusive CAD, so providing a guide to future medical or interventional management. None of the currently available options tick every box and a tailored approach is needed for each patient. CT coronary angiography performs well but exposes the patient to ionising radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agents. Stress imaging can be carried out using echocardiography, MRI, positron emission topography or single photon emission CT (SPECT), and can utilise either physiological exercise or pharmacological agents as the stressor. However, often, these tests are expensive, time-consuming, and require highly qualified staff to perform and interpret. Exercise ECG testing is widely available, non-invasive and relatively simple to perform, but can be difficult or impossible to read in those with resting ECG abnormalities. In addition, those who are unable to perform exercise on a bike or treadmill are currently excluded from this test.

### Regadenoson [^114QFeHh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ECG Abnormalities

The frequency of rhythm or conduction abnormalities following regadenoson or ADENOSCAN is shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Respiratory Abnormalities

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 999 patients with asthma (n = 532) or stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 467), the overall incidence of pre-specified respiratory adverse reactions was greater in the regadenoson group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001). Most respiratory adverse reactions resolved without therapy; a few patients received aminophylline or a short acting bronchodilator. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the reduction of > 15% from baseline at two-hours in FEV1(Table 3).

Renal Impairment

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 504 patients (regadenoson n = 334 and placebo n = 170) with a diagnosis or risk factors for coronary artery disease and NKFK/DOQI Stage III or IV renal impairment (defined as GFR 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), no serious adverse events were reported through the 24-hour follow-up period.

Inadequate Exercise Stress

In an open-label, multi-center trial evaluating regadenoson administration following inadequate exercise stress, 1,147 patients were randomized into one of two groups. Each group underwent two regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) procedures. Group 1 received regadenoson injection 3 minutes following inadequate exercise in the first regadenoson stress (MPI 1). Group 2 rested 1 hour after inadequate exercise to allow hemodynamics to return to baseline prior to receiving regadenoson injection (MPI 1). Both groups returned for a second stress MPI 1 to 14 days later and received regadenoson injection without exercise (MPI 2).

The most common adverse reactions are similar in type and incidence to those in Table 1 above for both Groups. The timing of the administration of regadenoson injection following inadequate exercise did not alter the common adverse reaction profile.

Table 4 shows a comparison of cardiac events of interest for the two groups [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The cardiac events were numerically higher in Group 1.

Table 12 — Recommendations for stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms or suspected stable coronary artery disease — non-invasive testing for ischemic heart disease (IHD) states that in suspected stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with intermediate pretest probability and preserved ejection fraction, stress imaging, such as stress echocardiography, is preferred as the initial test option; in patients without typical angina, an imaging stress test is recommended as the initial test for diagnosing stable CAD if the pretest probability is high or if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced; with resting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that prevent accurate interpretation of ECG changes during stress, an imaging stress test is recommended; with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and symptoms consistent with IHD, stress echocardiography (either exercise stress echocardiography [ESE] or dobutamine stress echocardiography [DSE]) is preferred over SPECT imaging because of greater specificity and versatility for detecting other cardiac conditions associated with LBBB; for women with an indication for a noninvasive imaging test for known or suspected CAD, stress echocardiography is the preferred test because of safety and greater specificity; for children with suspected IHD, ESE is the preferred imaging stress test because of the absence of radiation, the absence of need for an intravenous line, and the assessment of exercise capacity; a pharmacologic stress test such as DSE is recommended when patients who meet these indications are unable to exercise; in exertional dyspnea of uncertain etiology, stress echocardiography is the preferred test and tricuspid regurgitation velocity and diastolic function should be assessed at rest and with stress; an imaging stress test should be considered in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and new cardiac symptoms; and an imaging stress test should be considered to assess the functional severity of intermediate lesions on coronary arteriography.

### Implications of abnormal exercise electrocardiography with normal stress echocardiography… [^116gPjwk]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The addition of stress ECG findings to clinical and exercise data yielded incremental prognostic value. Patients with −ECG/−Echo imaging results had the least downstream testing, followed by +ECG/−Echo, and +Echo. In light of this uncertainty, we sought to define the +ECG/−ECG population and assess whether these discordant stress results have a prognostic implication. Compared with patients with −ECG/−Echo, we hypothesized that patients with +ECG/−Echo would have a higher rate of adverse clinical events and a worse long-term prognosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied a large cohort of patients who underwent exercise stress Echo for the evaluation of suspected CAD and had long-term clinical follow-up. Patients with +ECG/−Echo had lower resting heart rates, but higher resting systolic blood pressure compared with patients with −ECG/−Echo.

This study demonstrated that in a large stress Echo cohort, 8. 5% of patients had the discordant findings of +ECG/−Echo, which was associated with increased downstream testing and a higher rate of short- and long-term adverse cardiac events, particularly hospitalization for unstable angina and coronary revascularization in the 30 days following testing. The finding of positive exercise ECG added modest incremental prognostic value to clinical factors and exercise performance and helped to further risk stratify patients with normal stress Echo. At Duke University Medical Center, to alert referring clinicians of the increased risk associated with +ECG/−Echo, we now report these stress test findings as, "abnormal stress echocardiogram; positive ECG without wall motion abnormalities at rest and stress. " In addition, by recognizing that patients with +ECG/−Echo are at increased cardiac risk, there is an opportunity to intervene and potentially decrease adverse outcomes in this population.

This study suggests that in a large cohort of patients undergoing stress Echo imaging, those with the discordant findings of +ECG/−Echo had a slightly higher rate of short- and long-term adverse cardiac events than patients with −ECG/−Echo. Further study is needed to assess the impact of intensification of medical management, promotion of lifestyle modification, and increased clinical follow-up in the population with +ECG/−Echo.

### Cardiotoxicity from chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy for advanced malignancies [^115seRub]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Pre-therapy assessment, monitoring, and treatment

Owing to the high incidence of CRS with subsequent stress on the CV system and potentially life-threatening consequences, algorithms for the cardio-oncology management of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy have recently been proposed (Figure 4). Baseline assessment is recommended for all patients before therapy [medical history, clinical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG)]. Echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers [cardiac troponin and (N-terminal pro-) brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro) BNP] should be obtained at baseline as references for dynamics during and after therapy and to identify patients with undiagnosed CV disease. Echocardiography should include the assessment of GLS, which has been shown to decrease during CAR-T cell therapy. In addition to those with malignant cardiac/pericardial involvement (e.g. pericardial effusion), the following CV disease entities require evaluation, as CAR-T cell therapy may lead to decompensation: (i) patients with heart failure as it may further complicate distributive shock; (ii) patients with coronary artery disease, which increases susceptibility to microvascular dysfunction, inflammation-induced plaque destabilization, and myocardial ischaemia during severe CRS; (iii) patients with moderate to severe valvular heart disease, particularly aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, as it may provoke rapid decompensation; (iv) patients with arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (such as systemic inflammation and neurogenic drive), can experience an aggravation of arrhythmia burden. These patients and any others with concerns for CV risk should be referred for a cardiology assessment before therapy for potential additional testing (e.g. stress test or Holter ECG), optimization, and outline of a surveillance plan.

### Impact of exercise on heart rate recovery [^1139d64h]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR) has been shown to predict mortality. Although small studies have found that HRR can be improved with cardiac rehabilitation, it is unknown whether an improvement would affect mortality. The aim of this study was to determine whether HRR could be improved with cardiac rehabilitation and whether it would be predictive of mortality.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 1070 consecutive patients who underwent exercise stress testing before and after completion of a phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation program. Heart rate recovery, defined as the difference between heart rate at peak exercise and exactly 1 minute into the recovery period, and mortality were followed up as the primary end points. Of 544 patients with abnormal baseline HRR, 225 (41%) had normal HRR after rehabilitation. Of the entire cohort, 197 patients (18%) died. Among patients with an abnormal HRR at baseline, failure to normalize after rehabilitation predicted a higher mortality (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, the presence of an abnormal HRR at exit was predictive of death in all patients (hazard ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval 1.43–3.25). Patients with abnormal HRR at baseline who normalized afterward had survival rates similar to those of the group with normal HRR at baseline and after cardiac rehabilitation (P = 0.143).

Conclusions

Heart rate recovery improved after phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation in the overall cohort. There was a strong association of abnormal HRR at exit with all-cause mortality. Patients with abnormal HRR at baseline who normalized HRR with exercise had a mortality similar to that of individuals with baseline normal HRR.

### The role of treadmill exercise testing in women [^112v1Uvy]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Treadmill exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used noninvasive tests for the assessment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Sex-specific challenges in diagnostic and prognostic tests methods for IHD outlined the importance of pretest probability evaluation and referral bias using risk-prediction charts available for both asymptomatic and symptomatic women. Accordingly, exercise ECG has been indicated as the initial test for the symptomatic women at intermediate risk of IHD who has a normal resting ECG and is capable of maximal exercise. However, the difficulties of using exercise testing for diagnosing IHD in women have led to an initial speculation that stress imaging may be preferred to standard stress testing. This editorial analyzed a large body of evidence on the diagnostic and prognostic powers of treadmill ECG and exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) according to new advanced imaging technologies.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^115RNEVN]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Pacing stress testing — protocol and termination criteria: "In patients with a permanent pacemaker, stress testing can be achieved by increasing the pacing rate until the target heart rate is reached", and the technique "can be used with or without dobutamine". Transesophageal atrial pacing is presented as "an efficient alternative for the detection of CAD in patients unable to exercise". The catheter is "housed in a 10F sheath", pacing is initiated "at 10/min above the patient's baseline heart rate" at "approximately 10 mA", and the protocol uses "2-minute stages" with paced heart rate increased to "85% and 100%" for prepeak and peak stress; images are obtained at rest, first stage, prepeak, and peak. Termination occurs with "age-predicted maximal heart rate", "new or worsening moderate regional wall-motion abnormalities", "greater than 2-mm horizontal or downsloping S-T depression", or intolerable symptoms; pacing has the advantage of rapid restoration of baseline with uncommon side effects.
