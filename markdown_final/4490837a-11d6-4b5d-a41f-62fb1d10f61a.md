## Question

Pt endorsed "Ok thank you. Also I have a question one morning when I woke up and went to the bathroom as I always do I didn't have a bowl movement but when I wiped I had a substantial amount of blood on the paper wiped 2 more times and the results were the same what can it be. I also sent the stole sample for testing you gave me please advise on what to do next" However fecal occult blood test was negative. He is presenting today in outpt clinic to further workup. Any suggestions? / what questions should i ask on interview

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for outpatient suggestions on how to evaluate a patient who reports blood on wiping with a negative fecal occult blood test, including which interview questions to ask and the appropriate diagnostic and management steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical meaning of bright red blood on wiping and whether a negative FOBT changes risk. Then, I should verify guideline-based triage and whether this symptom mandates colonoscopy rather than FIT/FOBT. Next, I will outline focused history and examination, including anoscopy versus colonoscopy, followed by initial labs and timing of endoscopy. After that, I need to construct a differential diagnosis and management pathways for stable versus unstable patients. Finally, I should justify why repeat FOBT/FIT or limited lower endoscopy is inadequate, consider anticoagulation, portal hypertension, and rare mimics, and close with a pragmatic plan and safety-netting advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Bright red blood on wiping constitutes hematochezia and suggests a distal source, but I must not anchor there because proximal colonic or even upper GI sources can still present with red blood if bleeding is brisk. A negative FOBT does not exclude clinically significant pathology in a symptomatic patient; in fact, stool tests are designed for asymptomatic screening and can be falsely negative if bleeding is intermittent or distal and not admixed with stool, so I should not let a negative FOBT/FIT delay definitive evaluation in this symptomatic context [^1165kSwW] [^111qnUGz] [^115gAPiS].

> I need to check triage guidance next. Multiple societies classify hematochezia as a high-risk symptom that warrants diagnostic colonoscopy rather than FIT-based triage in symptomatic patients, and delaying colonoscopy after FIT/FOBT in this setting risks later-stage diagnoses. So, even with a negative FOBT, the correct next step is colonoscopy, not repeating stool tests or relying on FIT to triage this presentation [^111qnUGz] [^111WVBDw] [^113643zL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before gathering targeted history. I should verify the bleeding pattern (amount, frequency, pain with defecation, dripping into bowl, blood coating the stool vs mixed), duration, change in bowel habits, anemia symptoms, weight loss, abdominal pain or tenesmus, and risk factors including age, family history of CRC/IBD, prior colonoscopy findings, and medication exposures such as anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and NSAIDs. I also need to check for portal hypertension clues and recent anorectal trauma or procedures, because these alter pretest probabilities and urgency of care [^1175KzQd] [^1165fCHX].

> I will now examine the patient with attention to hemodynamics, general appearance, and an abdominal exam, and then proceed to a digital rectal exam to assess for gross blood, masses, tenderness, and stool character. Wait, let me verify whether a quick office anoscopy helps; yes, it can identify fissures, hemorrhoids, proctitis, and varices, but I should not let anoscopy substitute for colonoscopy when red flags or persistent bleeding exist because proximal pathology will be missed [^112MCnTW] [^112MCnTW] [^1165e1y1].

> Next, I should review initial labs. I need a complete blood count to assess hemoglobin and indices, coagulation studies if on anticoagulants or if bleeding is significant, and a basic metabolic panel; iron studies are appropriate if anemia is present. I should confirm type and screen if bleeding is more than trivial or if the patient is unstable, aligning with risk-stratified resuscitation principles in lower GI bleeding [^1165fCHX] [^1175KzQd].

> For diagnostic testing, colonoscopy is the definitive test of choice and should be complete to the cecum with adequate preparation to allow diagnosis and therapy such as biopsy, polypectomy, or hemostasis. In unstable or high-risk presentations, urgent colonoscopy after rapid purge is appropriate; in stable outpatients, timely elective colonoscopy remains indicated to resolve the bleeding source and rule out neoplasia [^1165e1y1] [^111XpU6A] [^112hdC4v].

> But wait, what if bleeding is too brisk for colonoscopy or the source cannot be identified endoscopically. In those cases, I should consider CT angiography to localize active bleeding and guide potential embolization, and a tagged red blood cell scan can help localize intermittent bleeding and guide timing of angiography. If both upper and lower endoscopies are negative with ongoing or recurrent bleeding, I should pivot to a small-bowel evaluation pathway with capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy as indicated [^1113VKwU] [^1146s6TT] [^114a8nzD].

> Let me think about the differential systematically. Distal causes suggested by blood on wiping include hemorrhoids, anal fissure, proctitis, solitary rectal ulcer, anorectal varices, and rectal polyps or cancer. I should also ensure I do not miss common proximal colonic causes like diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, ischemic or infectious colitis, and IBD, as well as post-polypectomy bleeding, because hematochezia is a syndrome, not a diagnosis, and source distribution spans the colon and anorectum in population data [^1165kSwW] [^114JWPM8].

> For a hemodynamically stable outpatient, I should confirm plans for colonoscopy within a prompt window, ensure high-quality split-dose prep, and manage likely anorectal contributors conservatively with fiber and stool-softening strategies while avoiding diagnostic delay due to presumed hemorrhoids alone. I should double-check that guidelines still endorse diagnostic colonoscopy for hematochezia in adults, including those under 50 with colorectal bleeding symptoms, to ensure the plan is aligned with best practice [^1121CxEt] [^111WVBDw] [^113643zL].

> If the patient is unstable or has major bleeding features, I need to admit, initiate resuscitation with IV access and fluids, apply a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL in most patients or 8 g/dL in those with cardiovascular disease, and proceed with urgent colonoscopy after rapid purge, considering interventional radiology if endoscopy fails to localize or control bleeding. Hold on, I should verify whether I should screen for an upper source in severe hematochezia; yes, when clinical suspicion persists after lower evaluation, upper endoscopy is appropriate because a subset of severe hematochezia originates proximally [^1165fCHX] [^111XpU6A] [^112KKwEd].

> I should confirm how to handle antithrombotics. For minor bleeding with low intervention likelihood, continuation may be reasonable, but if significant bleeding or high-risk endoscopic therapy is anticipated, holding and correcting coagulopathy may be necessary with coordination of thrombotic risk. After hemostasis, I need to resume anticoagulation in a timely fashion because this reduces thromboembolism and mortality, typically within 1–2 weeks for most mild to moderate GI bleeds on DOACs, individualized by indication and risk, with patient counseling and consideration of reversal agents in life-threatening scenarios [^111uadbg] [^113YEN2U].

> Let me consider portal hypertension specifically. Anorectal varices can occur in a high proportion of portal hypertensive patients, often presenting with painless bleeding, and can be distinguished from hemorrhoids by their serpiginous, compressible submucosal appearance crossing the dentate line on anoscopy. I should screen for liver disease and, if suspected, integrate management within the broader lower GI bleeding algorithm while planning targeted therapy as needed [^1178KYL7] [^112MCnTW].

> I should double-check why alternative strategies are inadequate here. Repeating FOBT or using FIT to triage a symptomatic high-risk presentation is inappropriate and risks harmful delay because even a positive result only funnels the patient back to colonoscopy, and a negative can falsely reassure. Likewise, relying on anoscopy alone risks missing proximal lesions, so anoscopy should be adjunctive rather than definitive in adults with hematochezia [^111qnUGz] [^112MCnTW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could flexible sigmoidoscopy suffice. Initially, that seems attractive for distal symptoms, but hold on, I should verify detection gaps; sigmoidoscopy can miss important proximal pathology and is not an adequate sole test when hematochezia or red flags are present, so complete colonoscopy remains the recommended evaluation in this context [^111WVBDw] [^1165e1y1].

> Next, I should review less common but relevant scenarios. Prior pelvic radiation can cause radiation proctopathy with bleeding that requires careful endoscopic confirmation of typical appearance and avoidance of unnecessary biopsy or injurious interventions; management should balance symptom burden, anticoagulant use, and disease-modifying options such as sucralfate enemas when indicated after excluding malignancy [^113ApLDw].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the plan is explicit. Despite a negative FOBT, this symptomatic patient should undergo timely, high-quality colonoscopy after focused history, exam including DRE and adjunctive anoscopy, and appropriate labs, with escalation to urgent inpatient evaluation if instability or high-risk features emerge. I will avoid FIT/FOBT triage or limited endoscopy in this high-risk symptom context, maintain vigilance for upper GI sources in severe cases, and individualize antithrombotic management with early resumption after control of bleeding, aligning the approach with contemporary ACG, BSG, ASGE, and ESGE guidance [^1165e1y1] [^111qnUGz] [^112hdC4v] [^1165fCHX].

The most likely cause of a single episode of bright red rectal bleeding with a negative fecal occult blood test is a benign anorectal source such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure. A negative test does not exclude visible bleeding [^115gAPiS]; a focused history and exam are essential [^1175KzQd]. Colonoscopy is indicated for patients older than 50 years, those with **risk factors**, or when **bleeding recurs** or remains unexplained [^113643zL] [^111WVBDw]. Immediate evaluation is required when **red flags** are present — anemia, weight loss, change in bowel habits, family history of colorectal cancer, or anticoagulant use [^1175KzQd].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for **bright red rectal bleeding** with a negative fecal occult blood test includes:

- **Hemorrhoids**: Most common cause of painless bright red bleeding.

- **Anal fissures**: Painful bleeding associated with defecation [^114JWPM8].

- **Rectal polyps or neoplasms**: May cause intermittent bleeding [^1165kSwW].

- **Diverticular disease**: Typically painless, intermittent bleeding [^114xzrJC].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Associated with chronic inflammation and intermittent bleeding [^114JWPM8].

- **Angiodysplasia**: Vascular malformations causing intermittent bleeding [^1165kSwW].

- **Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome**: Rare, associated with defecation abnormalities [^1116GhYy].

---

## Clinical interview questions

A **focused clinical interview** should include the following questions [^1175KzQd]:

### Characterization of bleeding

Ask about the **color and amount** observed; whether bleeding was painful or associated with discomfort; whether blood was mixed with stool or only on the toilet paper; and whether any clots or mucus were present [^113u9Lat].

---

### Temporal pattern and frequency

Determine whether this was a **single episode or recurrent bleeding**; document changes in bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, altered stool caliber); and screen for systemic features (recent weight loss, fatigue, weakness) [^113643zL].

---

### Associated symptoms

Ask about **gastrointestinal symptoms** (abdominal pain, cramping, bloating), rectal pain, itching, or discomfort, and any recent fever or chills [^114JWPM8].

---

### Medical and surgical history

Review medical and surgical history, including prior hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or inflammatory bowel disease, as well as any gastrointestinal surgeries or procedures; document any **personal history of colorectal polyps or cancer** [^1165fCHX].

---

### Medication and lifestyle factors

Review medication use — particularly **anticoagulants**, **antiplatelet agents**, or **NSAIDs** — and ask about recent changes in diet, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and any travel or potential exposure to infectious agents [^1165fCHX] [^1168ehhz].

---

### Family history

Ask about family history of **colorectal cancer**, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease [^111WVBDw].

---

## Physical examination

Perform a thorough exam, including vital signs to assess **hemodynamic stability** [^1175KzQd], and an abdominal examination to palpate for masses, tenderness, or organomegaly. Conduct a **digital rectal examination** to evaluate for hemorrhoids, anal fissures, masses, or other anorectal lesions [^111ndzB7]. When available, perform anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy for direct visualization of the anorectal canal to identify hemorrhoids, fissures, or other lesions [^113643zL].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Given the negative fecal occult blood test, further diagnostic evaluation should be guided by **clinical suspicion and patient risk factors** [^115gAPiS]:

- **Colonoscopy**: Recommended for patients over 50 years old, those with risk factors for colorectal cancer, or if bleeding recurs or remains unexplained [^113643zL] [^1165e1y1].

- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy**: Useful for younger patients without risk factors, particularly if bleeding is suspected to originate from the distal colon or rectum [^111WVBDw].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia, coagulation profile if anticoagulant use is suspected [^1175KzQd].

---

## Management and follow-up

Tailor management to the **identified cause**. For hemorrhoids or anal fissures, use conservative measures such as dietary modifications, topical treatments, and lifestyle changes [^113k7RmW]. Polyps or neoplasms require endoscopic removal or biopsy followed by appropriate oncological management [^113wjXd5]. Diverticular disease or angiodysplasia may require endoscopic or surgical intervention if bleeding persists [^114xzrJC]; inflammatory bowel disease is treated medically with anti-inflammatory medications and regular follow-up [^112pxZgr].

---

## Patient education and reassurance

Patients should be educated about the benign nature of most anorectal bleeding episodes and advised to monitor for recurrence or worsening symptoms [^1165kSwW]. They should be instructed to **seek immediate medical attention** if they experience:

- Persistent or recurrent bleeding

- Significant abdominal pain

- Weight loss or fatigue

- Changes in bowel habits

- Signs of anemia (pallor, dizziness, shortness of breath) [^1165fCHX]

---

A single episode of bright red rectal bleeding with a negative fecal occult blood test is most likely due to a **benign anorectal condition**. A focused history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic evaluation are essential to identify the cause and guide management.

### Delphi initiative for early-onset colorectal cancer (DIRECt) international management guidelines [^111qnUGz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy is recommended for the diagnostic evaluation of individuals with hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or unexplained weight loss. Colonoscopy should be complete to the cecum and of high quality. The use of colonoscopy for the evaluation of other symptoms, including a change in bowel habits or abdominal pain, is discussed in section D.2.

Use of alternative diagnostic modalities, including fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), for symptomatic individuals remains controversial. An expanded statement that included FIT reached only 67% agreement (A+, 30.0%; A, 37.5%; A−, 20.0%; D−, 7.5%; D, 5.0%) and was therefore eliminated: "A diagnostic colonoscopy is recommended for evaluation of alarming symptoms and signs of eoCRC (and in case of FIT positivity)". Recent studies have found that FIT performs well in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients younger than age 50. However, the reasons for such disagreement include that a positive FIT result would still require a colonoscopy, which may lead to delays in diagnosis. Delays in obtaining a colonoscopy are associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage disease. Therefore, FIT is not recommended for symptomatic patients. Triaging patients with low-risk symptoms with FIT may be an option (i.e. change in bowel habits or abdominal pain). However, for high-risk symptoms (hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or unexplained weight loss), diagnostic colonoscopy remains the modality of choice.

The systematic review found three studies on the use of FIT and colonoscopy for asymptomatic individuals.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically in the context of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend performing lower gastrointestinal endoscopy for the evaluation of chronic intermittent scant hematochezia in patients over 50 years old. It is also recommended in patients with iron deficiency anemia, risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, or the alarming symptoms of weight loss or changes in bowel habits.

### How I treat gastrointestinal bleeding in congenital and acquired von Willebrand disease [^116jMTzu]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is distinctive of severe von Willebrand disease (VWD), generally arising in older patients; in most cases, blood transfusion and hospitalization are required. The presence of arteriovenous malformations is often described when endoscopic examinations are performed. Patients with congenital type 3, 2A, and 2B are those most frequently affected by this symptom, possibly due to the loss of high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF). GI bleeding can also occur in patients affected by acquired von Willebrand syndrome.

Endoscopic examination of the GI tract is necessary to exclude ulcers, polyps, or cancer as possible causes of GI bleeding. In congenital VWD, prophylaxis with VWF/factor VIII concentrates is generally started after GI-bleeding events, but this therapy is not always successful. Iron supplementation must be prescribed to avoid chronic iron deficiency.

Possible rescue therapies — including high-dose statins, octreotide, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and tamoxifen — were described in a few case reports and series; however, surgery may be necessary in emergency situations or if medical treatment fails to stop bleeding. In this article, we present several clinical cases that highlight the clinical challenges of these patients and possible strategies for their long-term management.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rectal cancer, specifically with respect to indications for testing, the USMSTF 2017 guidelines recommend performing a colonoscopy or an adequate evaluation to determine the resolution of bleeding in adult patients under 50 years old with colorectal bleeding symptoms. These symptoms can include hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and melena with a negative upper endoscopy. The goal is to determine the cause of bleeding, initiate treatment, and ensure complete follow-up.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1178KYL7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected anorectal varices, we suggest checking vital signs, determining hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and assessing coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In cases of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Anorectal varices (ARV) are defined as discrete, dilated, submucosal veins extending proximal to the dentate line and into the rectum. They are a known complication of portal hypertension and can occur in up to 89% of patients with portal pressure above 10 mmHg, although the overall incidence in the general population is low. Despite this high prevalence, serious hemorrhage from ARV is uncommon, with significant bleeding reported in less than 5% of such patients, but it can be fatal. The presence of ARV is not directly related to a specific cause of portal hypertension, nor to the grade or extension of other varices (esophageal or gastric); the only clue to suspect this disease is the presence of anorectal bleeding in patients with a history of long-standing or uncontrolled portal hypertension.

As mentioned in relation to bleeding hemorrhoids, the first assessment of patients with hematochezia should follow the indications for the management of acute lower intestinal gastrointestinal bleeding (LIGB). In the case of ARV, a correct and thorough medical history is crucial to suspect this specific disease and can guide the subsequent diagnostic process. It is necessary to define the severity of bleeding and to correctly stratify.

### Special considerations in GI bleeding in VWD patients [^113LW7ys]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in von Willebrand disease (VWD). It has been noted that GI bleeding caused by angiodysplasia is overrepresented in VWD patients compared to other causes. The bleeding from angiodysplasia is notoriously difficult to treat; recurrences and rebleeds are common. A growing body of basic science evidence demonstrates that von Willebrand factor negatively regulates angiogenesis through multiple pathways. VWD is clinically highly associated with angiodysplasia. The predisposition to angiodysplasia likely accounts for many of the clinical difficulties related to managing GI bleeding in VWD patients. Diagnosis and treatment are challenging with the tools available, and much further research is needed to further optimize care for these patients regarding acute treatment, prophylaxis, and adjunctive therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of the available literature on GI bleeding in VWD and explore the molecular underpinnings of angiodysplasia-related GI bleeding. Considerations for diagnostic effectiveness are discussed, as well as the natural history and recurrence of these lesions and which therapeutic options are available for acute and prophylactic management.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^111QfyGj]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The patient was monitored in the hospital for 5 days, after which he was deemed fit for discharge back to the nursing home. His anticoagulation was held pending review of the haematoma in 6 weeks, and the thrombotic and bleeding risks were explained to the patient and his next of kin. He was booked for a repeat full blood count 1 week later.

### Thinking out of the: a case of obscure lower GI bleeding [^112tSUFE]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

A middle-aged man was admitted for episodes of fresh per-rectal bleeding, which were not associated with defecation. He was recently investigated for macrocytic anemia in the outpatient hematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal hemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding. Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL, normal 12.9–17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular hemoglobin 95.3 fL, normal 80.0–95.0 fL). The peripheral blood film showed blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells, and hypogranular platelets.

The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal hemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. However, the bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop of hemoglobin to 4.8 g/dL, requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography, performed during an episode of significant bleeding, revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding.

Bleeding subsequently recurred, and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12 units of packed cell transfused, exploratory laparotomy and on-table enteroscopy (figure 1) with small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen was conducted (figures 2–4).

### Pradaxa [^1168ehhz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients or their caregivers that they may bleed more easily and longer, and should call their healthcare provider for any signs or symptoms of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Serious bleeding**: Instruct patients or their caregivers to seek emergency care immediately if they have any of the following signs or symptoms:
	- Unusual bruising (bruises that appear without known cause or that get bigger)
	- Pink or brown urine
	- Red or black, tarry stools
	- Coughing up blood
	- Vomiting blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds

Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider or promptly seek medical attention if they experience any signs or symptoms of bleeding:

- Pain, swelling, or discomfort in a joint
- Headaches, dizziness, or weakness
- Reoccurring nosebleeds
- Unusual bleeding from gums
- Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop
- Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, particularly if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise them to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient or their caregivers to contact their physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

- **Gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider if they experience any unusual symptoms.

### Impact of blood transfusion on mortality and rebleeding in gastrointestinal bleeding: An 8-year cohort from a tertiary care center [^116YbxPb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Mortality and rebleeding were confirmed by reviewing medical records or by phone interviews with the patient and/or family members. The cause of death was determined based on a review of the medical records or through interviews with family members. Rebleeding was defined as a recurrence of overt bleeding occurring 24 hours or longer after the initial endoscopic evaluation and/or hemostatic therapy and initial stabilization. This recurrence had to be accompanied by either a change in vital signs or a decrease in hemoglobin concentration by 2 g/dL or more. Rebleeding events during the index hospitalization or those requiring readmission were combined into a single variable.

- **Primary and secondary endpoints**: Our primary endpoints were the impact of blood transfusion (BT) on mortality and rebleeding at 1 month and at the end of follow-up in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Our secondary endpoints included:
	1. The impact of BT on the composite outcome of rebleeding and/or mortality at 1 month and at the end of follow-up.
	2. The impact of transfusion threshold (hemoglobin ≤ 7 vs. > 7 g/dL) on 1-month and end-of-follow-up rebleeding and mortality.
	3. The impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy on 1-month and end-of-follow-up rebleeding and mortality in patients with GIB who received a BT.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: An updated ACG guideline [^111uadbg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in relation to anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, the ACG 2023 guidelines recommend resuming anticoagulation after the cessation of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. This is because the resumption of anticoagulation decreases the risks of post-bleeding thromboembolism and mortality.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^112KKwEd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically with respect to lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend performing lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to evaluate for a high-risk upper gastrointestinal lesion if the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy result is negative.

### Jujitsu kick to the abdomen: A case of blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematochezia and transient ischemic colitis [^112HzWrr]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma is a common presentation to the emergency department. Ischemic colitis is a rare complication of this and its possible sequelae are important for an emergency physician to recognize. A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and hourly episodes of bright red blood per rectum shortly after being kicked in the stomach at his jujitsu class. He had no significant medical history, and results of his systems review were otherwise unremarkable.

On examination, he appeared well, with normal vital signs. He had mild lower abdominal tenderness, but there were no peritoneal signs present. There was blood on the digital rectal examination. His hemoglobin, platelet, and international normalized ratio levels were normal, and his abdominal radiograph was unremarkable.

The gastroenterology service was contacted because of the hematochezia, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. The sigmoidoscopy showed erythema, ulceration, and edema of a segment in the left colon, consistent with ischemic colitis. This was later confirmed on biopsy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was conducted, which revealed left colonic inflammation consistent with colonic ischemia. There was no mesenteric vascular thrombosis or mesenteric hematoma found on CT.

His hematochezia and abdominal pain subsided spontaneously, and he was discharged home. This case illustrates transient ischemic colitis as a potential presentation of blunt abdominal trauma, and emergency physicians should consider this uncommon diagnosis in the differential diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^111XpU6A]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

The ACG 2016 guidelines for diagnostic procedures in cases of lower gastrointestinal bleeding recommend performing a rapid bowel purge following hemodynamic resuscitation in patients exhibiting high-risk clinical features, alongside signs or symptoms of ongoing bleeding. It is advised to conduct a colonoscopy within 24 hours of the patient's presentation.

### Visible vessel in diverticular bleeding: A rare sighting [^117Jph9R]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old male with a remote history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease presented to the emergency department after having hematochezia. He denied having abdominal pain, hematemesis, rectal tenderness, or prior hemorrhoids. Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient experienced a syncopal event while having another episode of hematochezia. The patient was stabilized with intravenous fluids and one unit of packed red blood cells. His hematocrit remained stable, and he was prepped for colonoscopy overnight.

A colonoscopy revealed moderately severe diverticulosis. Using an Olympus® 190 colonoscope, a diverticulum was noted to have old blood covering it. After irrigation, there was a non-bleeding visible vessel within the base of the diverticulum. Using near-focus resolution and water immersion, the visible vessel was closely evaluated. A Cook® Instinct clip was then placed across the base of the visible vessel. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no further bleeding during his hospitalization.

- **Figures**:
	- **Figure 1**: Diverticulum with non-bleeding visible vessel in the base of a diverticulum.
	- **Figure 2**: Cook® Instinct clip placed across the base of the visible vessel.

Early colonoscopy is indicated as a safe and efficacious diagnostic and therapeutic modality for acute lower GI bleeding. While diverticular bleeding is one of the most common causes of lower GI hemorrhage, more than 70% of episodes resolve without intervention. Stigmata of bleeding, such as adherent clot and non-bleeding visible vessel, have prognostic significance.

Emergency physicians must determine both the location and the severity of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

- **Objectives**: To identify the historical features, symptoms, signs, bedside maneuvers, and basic laboratory test results that distinguish acute upper GIB (UGIB) from acute lower GIB (LGIB). Additionally, to risk stratify those patients with a UGIB least likely to have severe bleeding that necessitates an urgent intervention.

- **Data sources**: A structured search of MEDLINE (1966-September 2011) and reference lists from retrieved articles, review articles, and physical examination textbooks.

- **Study selection**: High-quality studies were included of adult patients who were either admitted with GIB or evaluated in emergency departments with bedside evaluations and/or routine laboratory tests; studies that did not include endoscopic findings in prediction models were also considered. The initial search yielded 2628 citations, of which 8 were retained that tested methods of identifying a UGIB and 18 that identified methods of determining the severity of UGIB.

- **Data extraction**: One author abstracted the data regarding prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) and assessed methodological quality, with confirmation by another author. Data were combined using random effects measures.

- **Data synthesis**: The majority of patients (N = 1776) had an acute UGIB (prevalence, 63%; 95% CI, 51%-73%). Several clinical factors increase the likelihood that a patient has a UGIB, including a patient-reported history of melena (LR range, 5.1–5.9).

### Massive rectal bleeding from acquired jejunal diverticula [^115QgFyB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Haemorrhage as a presenting symptom occurs in 3.4% to 8.1% of patients with this condition. There have been fewer than 60 case reports in the English literature describing massive haemorrhage from jejunal diverticula. Unfortunately, neither the history nor the physical examination are helpful in diagnosing jejunal diverticula. These patients often experience acute massive bleeding per rectum, and most have had no previous gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, the acute haemorrhage is likely to recur if the diagnosis of bleeding jejunal diverticula is missed at the initial presentation, as was the case with our patient.

In patients with rectal bleeding, the diagnostic challenge is identifying the location of the bleeding source. If the bleeding site is in the colon, it can usually be located by colonoscopy. However, this is often challenging due to poor visualization in an unprepared colon, and massive haemorrhage can obscure the bleeding site. If the bleeding source is in the small intestine, it is often impossible to find it endoscopically. Although there are some reports showing success with capsule endoscopy and double balloon endoscopy, the utility of these examinations is limited in emergency situations, as in the presented case.

Non-invasive imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99)-labelled red blood cell scintigraphy can be used to detect and localize gastrointestinal bleeding. It has been reported to have a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95% for detecting a bleeding site with a bleeding rate as low as 0.2 mL/min. However, Tc-99 scintigraphy has a false localization rate.

### Distal inferior mesenteric veins to renal vein shunt for treatment of bleeding anorectal varices: case report and review of literature [^1177LtPn]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Isolated intractable bleeding from anorectal varices is a rare complication of portal hypertension. We report a case involving a patient with cirrhosis and hepatofugal flow who experienced severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding from anorectal varices. This case represents the first report of the construction of a distal inferior mesenteric vein shunt to the left renal vein as a selective shunt for treating bleeding anorectal varices in such a patient.

The patient is a 39-year-old white man with a medical history significant for alcohol abuse. He presented with bright red blood per rectum and required 10 units of packed red blood cells over the course of a year. The work-up revealed anorectal varices with no other colonic lesions. Consequently, the patient underwent the construction of a distal inferior mesenteric vein to left renal vein shunt.

### Manifestation of leech infestation as severe gastrointestinal bleeding in a 3-year-old boy: a case report and review of the literature [^111rnyiu]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

When serving as a physician in developing countries, some extremely rare differential diagnoses should be considered. Leech infestation is one of those rare conditions that can be the source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Leeches are a group of hermaphroditic parasites that can attach to several areas in the human body and start sucking blood. They can engorge up to 890% of their body weight. Furthermore, they possess anticoagulant-like enzymes in their saliva that can lead to severe bleeding after infestation, potentially resulting in the patient's death in complicated cases. They can affect various parts of the GI tract and the respiratory system, including the nasopharynx, oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and rectum. GI bleeding, caused by leech infestation, can manifest in different patterns such as epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, and fresh rectal bleeding. Here, we present a 3-year-old boy who was transferred to our center with tarry stool and bloody vomiting. He was eventually diagnosed with a leech in his stomach.

### Is non-Helicobacter pylori, non-NSAID peptic ulcer a common cause of upper GI bleeding? A prospective study of 977 patients [^116cT8Rn]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Non-Helicobacter pylori, non-NSAID ulcer is relatively common in Western countries. Whether it is a significant problem in the Orient is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of non-H pylori, non-NSAID ulcers presenting with GI bleeding.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was conducted on 1,675 consecutive patients presenting with upper GI bleeding over a 12-month period. Upper endoscopy was performed with biopsy specimens taken from the antrum and body of the stomach for a biopsy urease test (BUT) and histology for the detection of H. pylori. Exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or aspirin within 4 weeks of hospitalization was carefully scrutinized. A six-week course of treatment with an H2-receptor antagonist was prescribed for patients who did not use an NSAID and had a negative BUT result. Follow-up endoscopy was conducted to confirm H. pylori status using BUT and histology. Positive histology at either initial or follow-up endoscopy was used as the standard for diagnosing H. pylori infection.

- **Results**: Among 977 patients found to have ulcer bleeding, 434 (44%) had exposure to aspirin or an NSAID. Of the 543 non-NSAID users, 431 (79.4%) had a positive BUT and 112 (20.6%) were BUT negative on initial endoscopy. Eighty-nine of the 112 patients who were NSAID negative and BUT negative returned for follow-up endoscopy. Forty-nine of 89 (55.1%) were found to have a positive BUT and positive histology at follow-up endoscopy. Only 40 of 977 (4.1%) patients admitted with ulcer bleeding were confirmed to have non-H. pylori, non-NSAID ulcers.

### Management of patients with severe hematochezia — with all current evidence available [^115ss9Cz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of routine urgent colonoscopy in severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding is reported in this journal from Duke. The only significant differences in results between the standard management — emergency red blood cell (RBC) scanning and angiography with elective colonoscopy — and urgent colonoscopy were in rates of finding a definitive bleeding site, one with a major stigmata of hemorrhage, and in not making a diagnosis. The trial was stopped early for logistical reasons a decade ago. The strengths and limitations of the study are discussed and contrasted with recent reports of other investigators. Similar to the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) hemorrhage, triaging patients to the level of care by comorbidity scores and stigmata of hemorrhage, successful colonoscopic hemostasis of focal lesions, and individualization of long-term medical, endoscopic, and surgical care are recommended based on promising reports by other investigators. Meanwhile, further RCTs for patients with severe hematochezia are warranted.

### A case of rectal ulcers during aspirin therapy in acute Kawasaki disease [^111AQcdb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a febrile multisystem vasculitis of unknown etiology, especially involving coronary arteries. Although the prevalence of gastrointestinal involvement in KD is unknown, gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, are relatively common. However, KD with lower gastrointestinal bleeding is quite rare. Here, we describe a 3-year-old boy with typical KD who had lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by rectal ulcers on the third day of aspirin therapy.

A 3-year-old boy was first seen on day 2 of high fever. On physical examination, enlarged tonsils, pharyngeal hyperemia, and coarse respiratory sounds of both lungs were noted. No other abnormal findings were present at that time. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 14.8×10⁹/L, neutrophil 84.8%, hemoglobin 131 g/L, and platelet count 228×10⁹/L. C-reactive protein was 122 mg/L. He was admitted and treated with intravenous antibiotics empirically. The boy remained febrile. Three days later (day 5), the onset of a maculopapular rash on the trunk and limbs, nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, edema of hands and feet, and an enlarged right cervical lymph node led to the diagnosis of KD. Fortunately, echocardiography revealed no dilatation of coronary arteries (2.2 mm left and 2.0 mm right). Then, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg) and oral aspirin (50 mg/kg per day) were administered. After IVIG, his fever resolved rapidly. However, hematochezia occurred on day 3 of aspirin therapy. Repeated laboratory examinations revealed white blood cell counts similar to the initial findings.

### The learning experience for endoscopic submucosal dissection in a non-academic western hospital: a single operator's untutored, prevalence-based approach [^111mfQ9z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Three patients presented with delayed bleeding.

- **Case #34**: Minor rectal bleeding occurred 24 hours after ESD of a 6-cm mid-rectum lesion. Hemoglobin level was stable. The bleeding was managed with repeat endoscopy and additional coagulation of the post-resection ulcer. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 1 (moderate AE).

- **Case #38**: A patient with atrial fibrillation and chronic anticoagulation underwent ESD for a 3.5-cm rectal lesion with extension into the anal canal. Rivaroxaban was held 3 days before ESD, but the patient resumed therapeutic subcutaneous heparin as a bridge immediately after the procedure for 7 days. Severe rectal bleeding occurred 10 days after the ESD, resulting in hypotension. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days, received 2 units of blood transfusions, and endoscopic clipping achieved hemostasis (severe AE).

- **Case #54**: Resection of a 9-cm anorectal lesion was performed. On postoperative day 3, the patient experienced minor bleeding without intervention, and the hemoglobin level remained stable throughout (mild AE).

No other AEs were experienced. Specifically, patients did not experience post-resection abdominal pain or fever, and no deaths occurred.

Our case series showed a low risk of bias in totality in all domains of quality assessment.

### Major stigmata of recent hemorrhage on rectal ulcers in patients with severe hematochezia: Endoscopic diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes [^114vJjik]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of hematochezia caused by rectal ulcers is poorly described.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients hospitalized with severe hematochezia underwent urgent colonoscopy after purge. Those with rectal ulcers were divided into two groups based on the absence or presence of major stigmata of recent hemorrhage: active bleeding, visible vessel, or adherent clot. Major stigmata were treated with epinephrine injection and coagulation with a bipolar probe. The primary outcome endpoint was rebleeding within four weeks of diagnosis.

- **Results**: Rectal ulcers were identified in 23 of 285 (8%) patients. Twelve of 23 patients had major stigmata; these patients had an arithmetically greater decrease in hematocrit and required more blood transfusions than patients without major stigmata. Initial hemostasis was achieved in all, but bleeding recurred in five with stigmata. Four patients died of comorbid conditions. There was no rebleeding or death in those without stigmata.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with rectal ulcers harboring major stigmata are at high risk for severe bleeding, rebleeding, and death. For ulcers with major stigmata, endoscopic hemostasis is feasible, but rates of rebleeding are high.

### Bilateral phlegmasia cerulea dolens after warfarin reversal for acute rectal bleeding: A case report [^112CZYEB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease diagnosed in approximately 1 in 1000 adults annually. Extensive DVT can lead to life- or limb-threatening conditions such as phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD), phlegmasia alba dolens, and venous gangrene. PCD, also known as massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis, is rare and is a severe complication of DVT.

- **Case report**: We report a case of a 94-year-old bedridden woman with a past medical history of dementia, hypertension, pulmonary embolism, DVT, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the hospital for bright red blood per rectum and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 5.7. On admission, her dose of warfarin was suspended, and she was given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma as well as 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. She was discharged home with an INR normalized to 1.3 and cessation of her rectal bleeding. At discharge, she was not restarted on warfarin, nor was any bridging therapy used. The patient returned to the emergency department a week later for worsening pain and bluish discoloration of her bilateral lower extremities. An ultrasound examination showed that she had developed bilateral PCD after INR reversal.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Emergency physicians commonly care for patients who present with acute DVT or treat patients on anticoagulant therapy who require cessation of medications or administration of prothrombotic agents to reverse bleeding. Cases of extensive clot burden leading to PCD have been reported in the literature. However, reports of bilateral…

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111ndzB7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, no recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations based on the available literature.

For patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, it is suggested to collect a focused medical history and perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. These are weak recommendations based on low-quality evidence (2C).

Additionally, in cases of suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, it is suggested to check vital signs, determine hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and assess coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding. This is also a weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence (2C). In cases of severe bleeding, blood typing and cross-matching are suggested, which is a weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence (2D).

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is a rarely reported condition in children. The typical presentation includes anorectal pain with passage of blood and mucus per rectum during defecation abnormalities. Diagnosis is made via endoscopy and biopsy. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome alone is usually a benign condition; however, significant morbidity can occur if complicated by underlying disease states. We report an adolescent with hemophilia A and SRUS who presented with a rectal bleed that required a blood transfusion.

### Emergency medicine updates: Lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1113VKwU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

- **Objective**: This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning LGIB for the emergency clinician.

- **Discussion**: LGIB is most commonly due to diverticulosis or anorectal disease, though there are a variety of etiologies. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously, but patients can have severe bleeding resulting in hemodynamic instability. Initial evaluation should focus on patient hemodynamics, the severity of bleeding, and differentiating upper gastrointestinal bleeding from LGIB. Factors associated with LGIB include prior history of LGIB, age over 50 years, and presence of blood clots per rectum.

Computed tomography angiography is the imaging modality of choice in those with severe bleeding to diagnose the source of bleeding and guide management when embolization is indicated. Among stable patients without severe bleeding, colonoscopy is the recommended modality for diagnosis and management. A transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL hemoglobin is recommended based on recent data and guidelines (8 g/dL in those with myocardial ischemia), though patients with severe bleeding and hemodynamic instability should undergo emergent transfusion. Anticoagulation reversal may be necessary. If bleeding does not resolve, embolization or endoscopic therapies are necessary. There are several risk scores that can predict the risk.

### Endoscopic treatment of lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^113wjXd5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Urgent colonoscopy has emerged as the initial diagnostic and main therapeutic tool in the evaluation and treatment of colonic lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic therapy can effectively treat most cases of colonic bleeding, with a demonstrable improvement in clinical outcome parameters. The identification of high-risk stigmata of hemorrhage enables selective targeting of endoscopic therapy to lesions at high risk of rebleeding. Advances in technologies, such as novel mechanical methods of hemostasis (e.g. metallic clips) and injection techniques (e.g. cyanoacrylate injection), alongside the widening application of established endoscopic hemostatic techniques (e.g. rubber-band ligation) to colonic lesions, offer the possibility of further improvements in the efficacy of endoscopic hemostasis. Clinical trials are needed to compare these novel endoscopic techniques with more conventional approaches to establish the best form of endoscopic therapy for different bleeding lesions and to determine more definitively the optimal timing of colonoscopy.

### Mucinous carcinoma of the rectum in a boy presenting with bloody diarrhea [^114tvQHQ]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Colorectal carcinoma, primarily a disease of adulthood, accounts for 0.2% of malignancies in adolescents and has very rarely been reported in childhood. Here, we report a 15-year-old boy who presented with rectal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, and diarrhea. His physical examination revealed a tender abdomen with hepatomegaly. A hard mass was palpated by digital rectal examination. Histological examination revealed mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma. He died four months after diagnosis.

This case highlights the need for awareness of colorectal carcinomas and their invasive nature in the differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding and diarrhea in adolescents.

### Positive guaiac and bloody stool are poor predictors of intussusception [^117K7g1u]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Currant jelly stool is a late manifestation of intussusception and is rarely seen in clinical practice. Other forms of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding have not been thoroughly studied, and little is known about their respective diagnostic values.

- **Objective**: To assess the predictive value of GI bleeding (positive guaiac test, bloody stool, and rectal bleeding) in the evaluation of intussusception.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study cohort of all children, aged 1 month to 6 years, who had an abdominal ultrasound obtained for evaluating intussusception over a 5-year period. We identified intussusception if diagnosed by ultrasound, air-contrast enema, or surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed.

- **Results**: During the study period, 1,258 cases met the study criteria; the median age was 1.7 years (interquartile range 0.8, 2.9), and 37% were females. Overall, 176 children had intussusception; 153 (87%) were ileo-colic and 23 were ileo-ileal. Univariate risk ratio and adjusted odds ratio were 1.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.8, 2.0) and 1.3 (0.7, 2.4) for positive guaiac test; 1.1 (0.6, 2.1) and 0.9 (0.3, 3.0) for bloody stool; and 1.7 (1.02, 2.8) and 1.3 (0.5, 3.1) for rectal bleeding.

- **Conclusion**: Blood in stool, whether visible or detected by a guaiac test, has poor diagnostic performance in the evaluation of intussusception and is not independently predictive of intussusception. If the sole purpose of a rectal exam in these patients is for guaiac testing, it should be reconsidered.

### British Society of Gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^113ApLDw]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

Radiation-induced rectal bleeding is a complex issue stemming from pelvic radiotherapy. Appropriate endoscopic or radiological investigation of the bowel should be arranged, as it cannot be assumed that rectal bleeding post-radiotherapy is solely due to radiation-induced telangiectasia. The diagnosis of radiation proctopathy should be based on its typical appearance; biopsy confirmation is not advised. Since radiation-induced bleeding is an ischemic problem, interventions in ischemic tissue may not heal and can lead to necrosis and perforation.

Interventions aimed at stopping significant bleeding should only proceed after patients have been informed of the associated risks and benefits and have provided signed informed consent. If the bleeding is not impacting quality of life and an assessment has excluded underlying malignancy, patients should be reassured, and the natural history of radiation-induced bleeding explained, with no intervention required.

However, if radiation-induced telangiectasia is the bleeding source affecting quality of life or causing anemia, optimizing irregular bowel function will often mitigate bleeding to a level where it no longer affects quality of life. Stopping anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents, whenever possible, can also reduce bleeding to a manageable level. Sucralfate enemas can be beneficial as a temporary treatment until definitive disease-modifying therapy is effective in patients with heavy bleeding or for long-term use in those with problematic bleeding that is unsuitable for definitive therapy.

### Benign rectal ulcer: An underground cause of inpatient lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^115JdwoD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Although it is uncommon, significant bleeding per rectum presents one of the most difficult emergency problems. Bleeding from a rectal ulcer is not well recognized as a cause of such bleeding.

The study methodologies included a review of 195 consecutive patients with significant blood loss per rectum from July 2000 through December 2000.

- **Results**: Forty-eight cases in whom significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding occurred following prior hospitalization were identified. Sources of bleeding were gastroduodenal in 38 cases (79%) and colorectal in 10 cases (21%). The causes of inpatient colorectal bleeding were benign rectal ulcer (n = 4), ischemic colitis (n = 3), neoplasia (n = 2), and diversion colitis (n = 1).

The differential diagnosis for inpatients who develop new inpatient GI bleeding differs from that of patients who develop outpatient GI bleeding. Careful examination of the rectum following rectal instrumentation is critical. In addition to the standard resuscitative measures, the identification and treatment of rectal ulcers in this group of patients is of paramount importance. Treatment options for bleeding rectal ulcers include conservative therapy, cauterization, embolization, banding, and local excision.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly: a rare aetiology masquerading as a diverticular bleed [^111GcsfE]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Bleeding per rectum is a relatively common acute surgical presentation. Common causes include diverticular disease, colitis, haemorrhoids, and polyps. An 83-year-old man with a history of rectosigmoid diverticulitis and bilateral internal iliac artery aneurysms for two years presented with rectal bleeding. He was suspected to have a diverticular bleed based on history and examination. A CT scan revealed a large haematoma adjacent to the right isolated internal iliac artery aneurysm (IIIAA), almost indistinguishable from the adjacent rectosigmoid. This was consistent with a ruptured IIIAA and an ileorectal fistula. The fistula was of a primary vascular enteric type and was accentuated by the inflammation arising from the diverticulitis.

The presence of more common or apparently obvious causes should not deter clinicians from thoroughly investigating the case. Rare causes should be considered, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, when dealing with common acute presentations.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^114a8nzD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

Bleeding from the small intestine is a relatively uncommon event, accounting for approximately 5–10% of all patients presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Given advances in small bowel imaging with video capsule endoscopy (VCE), deep enteroscopy, and radiographic imaging, the cause of bleeding in the small bowel can now be identified in most patients. The term "small bowel bleeding" is therefore proposed as a replacement for the previous classification of obscure GI bleeding (OGIB). It is recommended that the term OGIB be reserved for patients in whom a source of bleeding cannot be identified anywhere in the GI tract. A source of small bowel bleeding should be considered in patients with GI bleeding following a normal upper and lower endoscopic examination.

- **Recommendation**: Second-look examinations using upper endoscopy, push enteroscopy, and/or colonoscopy can be performed if indicated before small bowel evaluation.

- **Procedure**: VCE should be considered a first-line procedure for small bowel investigation. Any method of deep enteroscopy can be used when endoscopic evaluation and therapy are required. VCE should be performed before deep enteroscopy if there is no contraindication.

- **Imaging**: Computed tomographic enterography should be performed in patients with suspected obstruction before VCE or after negative VCE examinations.

- **Emergency protocol**: When there is acute overt hemorrhage in the unstable patient, angiography should be performed emergently. In patients with occult hemorrhage or stable patients with active overt bleeding, multiphasic computed tomography should be performed after VCE or CTE to identify the source.

### Diagnosis and management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114JWPM8]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) can present as an acute and life-threatening event or as chronic bleeding, which might manifest as iron-deficiency anemia, fecal occult blood, or intermittent scant hematochezia. Bleeding from the small bowel has been shown to be a distinct entity, and LGIB is defined as bleeding from a colonic source. Acute bleeding from the colon is usually less dramatic than upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and is self-limiting in most cases.

Several factors might contribute to increased mortality, a severe course of bleeding, and rebleeding, including advanced age, comorbidity, intestinal ischemia, bleeding as a result of a separate process, and hemodynamic instability. **Common causes**: Diverticula, angiodysplasias, neoplasms, colitis, ischemia, anorectal disorders, and postpolypectomy bleeding are the most common causes of LGIB.

Volume resuscitation should take place concurrently upon initial patient assessment. Colonoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice for both acute and chronic bleeding. Angiography is used if colonoscopy fails or cannot be performed. **Other methods**: The use of radioisotope scans is reserved for cases of unexplained intermittent bleeding when other methods have failed to detect the source. Embolization or modern endoscopy techniques, such as injection therapy, thermocoagulation, and mechanical devices, effectively promote hemostasis. Surgery is the final approach for severe bleeding.

### Significant rectal bleeding as a complication of a fecal collecting device: Report of a case [^115wjxGK]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 65-year-old man who developed massive rectal bleeding associated with the use of a fecal collecting device: the Flexi-Seal Fecal Management System. A colonoscopy showed an acute laceration of the anterior rectal wall mucosa, 6 cm from the anal verge, with active bleeding. The tear was most likely the result of an acute event, such as the sudden movement of the device within the rectum or trauma sustained during insertion. Massive transfusion was required, and surgical endoscopic treatment was necessary to ensure hemostasis. To our knowledge, this is the first such case to be reported.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: A review [^111pAmLY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) continues to be a problem for physicians. Acute LGIB is defined as bleeding that originates from a source distal to the ligament of Treitz. Although 80% of all LGIB will stop spontaneously, identifying the bleeding source remains challenging, and rebleeding can occur in 25% of cases. Some patients with severe hematochezia require urgent attention to minimize further bleeding and complications. This article reviews the causes, diagnostic methods, and endoscopic treatment of LGIB.

### Delphi consensus statement for the management of delayed post-polypectomy bleeding [^116WCXqq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The definitions for delayed post-polypectomy bleeding and related terms are outlined as follows:

- **Definition of delayed post-polypectomy bleeding**: Delayed post-polypectomy bleeding is defined as any rectal bleeding occurring within 30 days after the completion of the index colonoscopy, requiring emergency room presentation, hospitalization, or reintervention (repeat endoscopy, angiography, or surgery). (Strongly agree: 69.2%; agree: 30.8%)

- **Definition of stigmata of recent bleeding**: Stigmata of recent bleeding is described as the presence of any of the following findings at a polyp resection mucosal defect: active bleeding (either jet or oozing), a visible vessel, or an adherent clot that remains despite targeted jet irrigation. (Strongly agree: 71.4%; agree: 25%)

- **Definition of rebleeding**: Rebleeding is specified as:
	1. A new episode of hematochezia or rectorrhagia at least 48 hours after successful hemostatic therapy of the initial delayed post-polypectomy bleeding or after discharge.
	2. A new drop in hemoglobin levels greater than 3 g/dL or additional transfusion requirements 48 hours after resolution of the baseline bleeding episode.
	3. Confirmation of stigmata of recent bleeding at the scar responsible for the initial delayed post-polypectomy bleeding on repeat endoscopy or angio-CT/angiography.
	4. Any colonoscopy performed for suspicion of bleeding in research studies. (Strongly agree: 50%; agree: 42.3%)

The definitions provided in this document are based on the available literature and agreed-upon consensus, prioritizing clinical relevance and applicability. They are intended to be used both in clinical practice and for research purposes in future studies.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^113YEN2U]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Following the resolution of bleeding, deciding whether and when to restart anticoagulation can be challenging. This decision is often complicated by extensive comorbidities, the degree of stroke risk, circumstances surrounding the initial bleed, and patient preference. Generally, it is reasonable to restart DOAC therapy 1–2 weeks after most mild to moderate gastrointestinal bleeding. The American Stroke Association recommends an interval of at least 4 weeks before restarting treatment following a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, but no definitive guidelines have been agreed upon for situations like the one discussed here. Given the potential for life-threatening complications with both under- and over-treatment, the decision remains difficult.

With the expanding role of DOAC therapy in modern practice, clinicians should be cognizant of potential risks that accompany prolonged anticoagulation, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Reversal agents are licensed and effective, though costly and potentially prothrombotic. Prompt recognition and early intervention can sometimes greatly improve outcomes. Supportive care only is indicated if a bleed is minor. The decision regarding the appropriateness and timing of restarting anticoagulation is challenging, given the potential for profound consequences. Further research is needed to construct substantive guidelines.

- **Learning points**: The incidence of adverse effects is lower with DOAC therapy than with vitamin K antagonists. However, there is an increased risk of hemorrhage.

### Systematic review of anorectal varices [^111WKFyk]. Colorectal Disease (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anorectal varices:

- **Definition**: Anorectal varices are enlarged, tortuous veins located in the lower rectum and anus.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of anorectal varices is primarily related to portal hypertension. This increased pressure forces blood to flow through smaller collateral veins, leading to the development of varices in the anorectal region. The prevalence of anorectal varices is higher in patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction compared to those with liver cirrhosis.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of anorectal varices associated with different pathologies varies from 38% to 95%, with an incidence of up to 89% in patients with portal hypertension.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with anorectal varices may present with symptoms such as rectal bleeding, pain, and discomfort. However, these varices are often asymptomatic until they rupture and bleed.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of anorectal varices is largely dependent on the severity of the underlying condition causing portal hypertension. Complications can include bleeding, which can be significant in some cases.

### Management of rectal foreign bodies [^116W73HM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients may complain of vague abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or pain, and sometimes constipation. Signs of infection or perforation may be evident in complicated cases. Physical examination should include a careful abdominal examination to assess for signs of peritonitis or the ability to palpate an object transabdominally. The rectal foreign body can be palpated in either the left or right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

A rectal examination is essential for diagnosis but should be performed after an abdominal X-ray to prevent accidental injury to the surgeon from sharp objects. The foreign body may be palpable in the distal rectum. While bright red blood per rectum is often seen, it is not always present. Careful attention should also be paid to the status of the sphincter, especially in patients without a prior history of foreign body placement and in those non-voluntary cases. In patients without sphincter injury, the rectal sphincter may have increased tone secondary to muscular spasm due to the foreign object. The sphincter may also show obvious damage with visible injury to both the internal and external sphincter and should be carefully examined.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^112MCnTW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

It is extremely important to make a correct differential diagnosis between hemorrhoids and anorectal varices (ARV), but this distinction can be difficult, especially in cases of massive bleeding. Occasionally, patients may have other causes of massive bleeding, such as solitary rectal ulcer syndrome or diverticulosis of the colon. Thus, a correct diagnosis is essential.

At clinical examination with a proctoscope or anoscope, ARV are usually discrete, compressible, and serpiginous submucosal varicose veins that cross the dentate line and extend cranially into the rectum, while hemorrhoids are abnormal anal cushions with dilatation of the hemorrhoidal venous plexus that are confined within the anal canal. Therefore, a simple clinical examination using a proctoscope or an anoscope is a valuable method for accurately identifying ARV. Some studies have shown that flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are as effective as anoscopy in diagnosing ARV.

It is important to remember that patients with ARV might have other, more proximal, sources of bleeding; anorectal bleeding presents a clinical dilemma in terms of the associated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The estimated risk of CRC in patients with rectal bleeding has been reported to range from 2.4% to 11%; hence, a full colonoscopy may be necessary to identify such a source. Furthermore, a randomized trial by Laine et al. showed that up to 15% of patients presenting with serious hematochezia — defined as an alteration of hemodynamic status, hemoglobin drop ≥ 1.5 g/dL, or necessity of blood transfusion — have an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding identified with an upper endoscopy.

### Diverticular bleeding [^114xzrJC]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Diverticular bleeding is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients typically present with massive and painless rectal hemorrhage. If bleeding is severe, initial resuscitative measures should include airway maintenance and oxygen supplementation, followed by the measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and blood typing and crossmatching. Patients may need intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution, followed by transfusion of packed red blood cells in the event of ongoing bleeding. Diverticular hemorrhage resolves spontaneously in approximately 80 percent of patients. If there is severe bleeding or significant comorbidities, patients should be admitted to the intensive care unit.

The recommended initial diagnostic test is colonoscopy, performed within 12 to 48 hours of presentation and following a rapid bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol solutions. If the bleeding source is identified by colonoscopy, endoscopic therapeutic maneuvers can be performed. These may include injection with epinephrine or electrocautery therapy. If the bleeding source is not identified, radionuclide imaging (i.e. technetium-99m-tagged red blood cell scan) should be performed, usually followed by arteriography. For ongoing diverticular hemorrhage, other therapeutic modalities such as selective embolization, intra-arterial vasopressin infusion, or surgery should be considered.

### The management of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage [^112CHuZp]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a common clinical problem, which accounts for approximately 1 to 2 percent of acute hospital admissions. The colon is responsible for approximately 87 to 95 percent of all cases of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, with the remaining cases arising in the small bowel. The etiology, diagnostic evaluation, management, and treatment options available for lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reviewed.

- **Methods**: A review of lower gastrointestinal bleeding was performed, which discussed the most common etiologies along with a few rare and unusual causes. The literature about different diagnostic techniques, management problems, and therapeutic options was reviewed. Management strategies and treatment options for the various causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding were reviewed.

- **Results**: A review of the different causes of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage and available diagnostic studies was performed. Management strategies based on the etiology of the bleeding and results of the diagnostic studies were discussed. An algorithm was provided to develop a diagnostic and therapeutic treatment strategy for lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

- **Conclusions**: Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be a difficult and frustrating problem for both the clinician and the patient. Knowledge of the available diagnostic tests to help identify the source of bleeding is essential for the practicing clinician. Once the source is identified, management strategies and available treatment options need to be specific for each individual case.

### Massive rectal bleeding from acquired jejunal diverticula [^112d667S]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The rectal bleeding recurred at home 10 hours after discharge; she experienced an episode of syncope and passed red blood per rectum. She was urgently brought back to the emergency department at our hospital. On physical examination, she appeared pale and diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 105/53 mmHg and a pulse rate of 105 beats/min. The abdomen was non-tender, and fresh blood was observed in the rectum. Laboratory tests revealed a haemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, haematocrit value of 25%, and thrombocytes of 122 × 10⁹/L.

To localize the source of bleeding, the patient underwent acute abdominal CT angiography, which revealed bleeding in a jejunal diverticulum (Figure 2). The abdominal CT also demonstrated multiple colonic diverticula but did not show any bleeding in the colon. Immediately after the diagnosis of jejunal diverticular haemorrhage was made, the patient was brought to the operating room. During laparotomy, multiple large diverticula in a 30 cm segment of the jejunum were confirmed, beginning 90 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz (Figure 1). Some smaller diverticula in the distal jejunum were also noted. Systematic exploration of the abdomen revealed diverticulosis of the left colon, but no other lesions.

To localize the exact bleeding site, an enterotomy proximal to the most proximal diverticulum was performed, and a gastroscope was introduced. Blood in the intestine at the level of the second diverticulum was found. The 30 cm segment of the jejunum containing large diverticula was resected, and a primary anastomosis was performed. The patient was transfused with 4 units of packed red cells, 3 units of…

### Gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin undetected by multiple tests for fecal occult blood and diagnosed only by capsule endoscopy: A case report [^115gAPiS]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The term gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin is used to describe bleeding of unknown origin that persists or recurs following a negative initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. We report the case of a middle-aged woman with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin who had 9 stool specimens that tested negative for occult blood but was found to have adenocarcinoma of the distal duodenum on capsule endoscopy. This case illustrates that, in the presence of unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, multiple negative fecal occult blood tests do not exclude the presence of GI blood loss, and that capsule endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic study in this context.

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: What you need to know [^112rKvE9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

### Diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^1165fCHX]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

- **Initial assessment**: ESGE recommends that the initial assessment of patients presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should include a history of comorbidities and medications that promote bleeding, hemodynamic parameters, physical examination (including digital rectal examination), and laboratory markers. A risk score can be used to aid but should not replace clinician judgment. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

- **Use of Oakland score**: ESGE recommends that, in patients presenting with a self-limited bleed and no adverse clinical features, an Oakland score of ≤ 8 points can be used to guide the clinician's decision to discharge the patient for outpatient investigation. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

- **Transfusion strategy - no cardiovascular disease**: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy. A hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 7g/dL should prompt red blood cell transfusion, with a desirable post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of 7–9g/dL. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

- **Transfusion strategy - with cardiovascular disease**: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a history of acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, a more liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy. A hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 8g/dL should prompt red blood cell transfusion, with a desirable post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 10g/dL. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

- **Major bleeding management**: ESGE recommends that, in patients with major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy should be performed urgently.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^115rZXrp]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

DOACs are becoming increasingly prescribed. According to the American Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, apixaban was the 48th most commonly prescribed drug in 2020, ranking higher than both warfarin and rivaroxaban. They have been shown to be more efficacious, better tolerated, and safer than previous anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke. They have a rapid onset of action, a short half-life, do not require monitoring, and have fewer drug and dietary interactions than vitamin K antagonists. New antidotes for the reversal of acute major bleeding continue to be developed, further mitigating the risk of severe complications. As their prevalence continues to grow, so does the incidence of their uncommon but significant adverse effects.

Despite their favorable safety profile when compared with vitamin K antagonists, the risk of hemorrhage is nevertheless increased during prolonged anticoagulation, particularly in those with comorbid renal failure, liver failure, malignancies, or thrombocytopenia. Bleeding is the most common adverse effect of DOAC therapy, including an increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, as well as possibly increasing the risk when used in patients with trauma injuries. A number of incidents of serious bleeds have been reported, many with no history of trauma. Spontaneous internal bleeding is difficult to diagnose quickly given its lack of signs and symptoms until the bleed has progressed significantly. Management of DOAC-induced hemorrhage remains a challenge due to its complexity, requiring prompt diagnosis and appropriate intervention.

### Uceris [^112pxZgr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In each trial, Study 1 and Study 2, the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in remission after 6 weeks of treatment. Remission was defined as a decrease or no change in the stool frequency subscore from baseline, a rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and an endoscopy score of 0 or 1. An endoscopy subscore of zero indicates normal or inactive disease, while a subscore of 1 indicates erythema and decreased vascular pattern.

In both studies, a higher proportion of patients in the UCERIS rectal foam group compared to the placebo group were in remission at Week 6 and had a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at Week 6.

- **Study 1 results**: The percentage of patients with an endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 6 was 55.6% in the UCERIS rectal foam group versus 43.2% in the placebo group.

- **Study 2 results**: The percentage was 56.0% in the UCERIS rectal foam group versus 36.7% in the placebo group.

In patients meeting the primary endpoint of remission in Study 1, the mean (SD) decrease in stool frequency subscore was 1.2 (0.9) in the UCERIS rectal foam group and 1.2 (0.8) in the placebo group. In Study 2, the mean (SD) decrease in stool frequency subscore was 1.3 (0.8) in the UCERIS rectal foam group and 1.1 (0.9) in the placebo group.

### Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1165kSwW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lower gastrointestinal bleeding:

- **Definition**: LGIB is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding originating distal to the ileocecal valve, including the colon, rectum, and anus.

- **Pathophysiology**: Notable causes of LGIB include diverticulosis (42.5%), ischemic colitis (12.5%), hemorrhoids (12.5%), colorectal polyps or neoplasms (8.5%), angioectasias (7.5%), postpolypectomy bleeding (4.5%), IBD (4%), infectious colitis (3.5%), stercoral ulceration (< 2.5%), colorectal varices (< 1.5%), radiation proctopathy (< 1%), NSAID-induced colopathy (< 1%), and Dieulafoy's lesions (< 1%).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of hospitalization for LGIB is estimated at 35.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: LGIB classically manifests as hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed through the rectum). Uncommonly, bleeding from the right colon may present with melena. If bleeding is severe, manifestations of hemorrhagic shock may be present.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: LGIB is associated with an estimated bleeding-related mortality of 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6–1.8%) and an overall rebleeding rate of 13.5% (95% CI, 11.8–15.5%).
