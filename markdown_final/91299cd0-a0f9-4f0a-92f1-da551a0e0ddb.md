## Question

dupixent GI indications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Dupixent's gastrointestinal indications, including what is FDA-approved, what is off-label, dosing by age, efficacy, safety, and guideline positioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled GI indication and its exact wording. Then, I should verify the age and weight criteria and the approved dosing regimens. Next, I will examine the pivotal trial evidence and real-world data to confirm efficacy and durability. After that, I need to check safety signals and monitoring considerations. Then, I should review guideline recommendations to understand where dupilumab fits in the treatment algorithm. Finally, I will consider off-label use in non-EoE EGIDs and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled gastrointestinal indication. Dupilumab is approved for eosinophilic esophagitis in patients aged 1 year and older who weigh at least 15 kg; this is the only FDA-approved GI indication at present, and I should be careful not to overextend beyond EoE to other eosinophilic GI diseases without explicit evidence or labeling support [^115fbT2c] [^114C96YN].

> Wait, let me verify the age and weight thresholds and the dosing specifics because these are easy to misstate. For patients 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg, the approved regimen is 300 mg subcutaneously once weekly; for patients 1 to 11 years old who weigh at least 15 kg, the regimen is weight-based every other week, with 200 mg for 15 to less than 30 kg and 300 mg for 30 to less than 60 kg, and 300 mg weekly for those 40 kg and above to match adult exposure; I initially thought the pediatric dose was always weekly, but hold on, I should correct that — only those ≥ 40 kg receive weekly dosing, while those 1–11 years and < 40 kg receive every-other-week dosing, which aligns with the pediatric trial design and FDA pharmacokinetic modeling [^116i5Wim] [^111xw3gV] [^114GQFLw].

> Next, I should review the pivotal trial evidence to ensure the efficacy claims are precise. In adults and adolescents 12 years and older, the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET program showed that 300 mg weekly dupilumab achieved histologic remission (≤ 6 eosinophils per high-power field) in about 60% versus about 5% with placebo at 24 weeks, and significantly improved dysphagia symptoms by roughly 10–12 points on the DSQ; importantly, weekly dosing improved symptoms, whereas every-other-week dosing did not in the hierarchical analysis, which explains the weekly label for ≥ 12 years [^112TMNUf] [^112rLNQ5] [^1132xWfN].

> I will now examine pediatric data to confirm consistency. In children 1–11 years, the EoE KIDS trial showed histologic remission rates of 68% with higher-exposure and 58% with lower-exposure regimens versus 3% with placebo at 16 weeks, with responses maintained through 52 weeks; caregiver-reported signs also improved, supporting both efficacy and durability in younger children, which underpins the pediatric approval and the weight-tiered dosing strategy [^114GQFLw] [^116i5Wim].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about durability without checking longer-term outcomes. The 52-week LIBERTY EoE TREET extension demonstrated sustained histologic remission and continued symptom and endoscopic improvements with ongoing weekly therapy, and a small open-label food reintroduction study suggested that some patients on dupilumab could safely reintroduce trigger foods without worsening histology or symptoms, though that latter signal is preliminary and should be interpreted cautiously [^112rLNQ5] [^111yCK7C].

> I need to ensure the safety profile is accurately summarized. Across EoE trials, dupilumab was generally well tolerated, with injection-site reactions and nasopharyngitis being the most common adverse events; transient eosinophilia can occur but is usually clinically insignificant, and rare eosinophil-related systemic conditions like EGPA have been reported in broader programs, often in the context of steroid withdrawal rather than direct causation; routine screening for TB, HIV, or hepatitis is not required, and therapeutic drug monitoring is not currently recommended [^111G4mEZ] [^111pamuM] [^1113xcnW] [^1149p887] [^116cyteu] [^111HKBqk].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to contextualize use. ACG 2025 suggests dupilumab as a conditional option for EoE in patients 12 years and older who are nonresponsive to PPI therapy, and also suggests it for children 1–11 years nonresponsive to PPIs, reflecting the pediatric trial data; many guidelines frame dupilumab as step-up therapy or as a preferred option when multiple atopic comorbidities are present, aligning with its type 2 anti-inflammatory mechanism [^114aQN7q] [^114aSati] [^111XbTvZ] [^111EzS6i].

> But wait, what about non-EoE eosinophilic GI diseases like eosinophilic gastritis, enteritis, or colitis; I should double-check the status there. There is no FDA approval for dupilumab in non-EoE EGIDs, and pediatric guidelines explicitly state insufficient data to recommend biologics for childhood non-EoE EGIDs; however, small case series and translational reviews report clinicohistologic remissions with dupilumab in refractory cases, so off-label use may be considered in select, carefully monitored patients after standard therapies fail, ideally within research or registry frameworks [^111E5bkZ] [^112GXVMJ] [^116QbXdD].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical picture to ensure internal consistency. Dupilumab is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis, with robust phase 3 data demonstrating histologic remission and symptom improvement in adults and adolescents, and supportive pediatric data enabling approval down to age 1 year with weight-based dosing; its mechanism of dual IL-4/IL-13 blockade addresses upstream type 2 inflammation, and guideline bodies position it as a key option after PPIs or when comorbid type 2 diseases coexist, while off-label exploration in non-EoE EGIDs remains investigational [^116sqqFq] [^112TMNUf] [^114GQFLw] [^111XbTvZ] [^111E5bkZ].

Dupilumab (Dupixent) is **FDA-approved for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)** in patients aged ≥ 1 year and weighing ≥ 15 kg [^115fbT2c] [^114C96YN], with **300 mg weekly dosing** for those ≥ 12 years and weight-based dosing for 1–11 years [^116i5Wim]. It is not approved for other eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. gastritis, enteritis, colitis) [^115fbT2c], though case series suggest potential benefit; use in these conditions is off-label and investigational [^112GXVMJ]. Dupilumab is recommended as step-up therapy for EoE refractory to PPIs or swallowed steroids, with strong efficacy in histologic remission and symptom improvement [^112TMNUf] [^112rLNQ5] [^114aQN7q].

---

## Off-label gastrointestinal indications

### Eosinophilic gastritis (EoG), eosinophilic enteritis (EoN), and eosinophilic colitis (EoC)

- **Approval status**: Not FDA-approved for EoG, EoN, or EoC [^115fbT2c].
- **Evidence**: Case series report clinicohistologic remission in refractory non-EoE EGIDs, but data are limited [^112GXVMJ].
- **Guidelines**: ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN states insufficient evidence to recommend biologics for non-EoE EGIDs [^111E5bkZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

ACG 2025 suggests dupilumab as **step-up therapy** for EoE refractory to PPIs or swallowed steroids, and to consider it when multiple atopic comorbidities are present [^114aQN7q] [^111EzS6i]. ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend biologics for **non-EoE EGIDs** at this time [^111E5bkZ].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and transient eosinophilia [^111G4mEZ] [^1113xcnW].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare events include eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypersensitivity reactions [^1149p887] [^114wgjmr].
- **Monitoring**: Routine lab monitoring is not required; monitor for infections and allergic reactions [^111HKBqk].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing trials include REMODEL, evaluating long-term effects on **esophageal distensibility and fibrostenosis** [^113L6HKi] [^116RBRfv], and pediatric studies further characterizing **efficacy and safety in non-EoE EGIDs** [^111E5bkZ]. Future directions include exploring **combination therapies**, identifying biomarkers to predict response, and expanding access through cost-effectiveness analyses [^111yCK7C] [^112vgcew] [^114h7bmG].

---

Dupilumab is **FDA-approved for EoE** in patients aged ≥ 1 year and ≥ 15 kg, with strong efficacy and a favorable safety profile; it is not approved for other EGIDs, though off-label use is reported in refractory cases [^115fbT2c] [^112TMNUf] [^111E5bkZ].

Introduction

Dupilumab, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), lacks real-world data on use and effectiveness.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 70 patients with EoE prescribed dupilumab, comparing prescriber type, indication, follow-up, and response.

Results

Indications varied with gastroenterologists commonly prescribing for treatment-refractory cases and allergists as first-line therapy. Endoscopic assessment was lacking in 25.9%, but those with follow-up showed high histologic remission (92.3% first-line and 85% previous treatment failure).

Discussion

Dupilumab demonstrates effectiveness across EoE severity, including milder disease without previous treatment failure. Improving follow-up and assessing cost-effectiveness will help clarify its role in the treatment algorithm.

Data

Animal Data

In an enhanced pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of homologous antibody against IL-4Rα up to 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis of 100 mg/kg/week) from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition. No treatment-related adverse effects on embryo-fetal toxicity or malformations, or on morphological, functional, or immunological development were observed in the infants from birth through 6 months of age.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of dupilumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure to dupilumab on the breastfed infant are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for DUPIXENT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DUPIXENT or from the underlying maternal condition.

### A case series on the use of dupilumab for treatment of refractory eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders [^112GXVMJ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EoG), eosinophilic enteritis (EoN), and eosinophilic colitis (EoC) are increasing (1). These conditions will inevitably become more widely recognized and better understood. There is currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for EoE, but there are standard-of-care treatments that are well established and widely used. In contrast, there is a paucity of data regarding standard-of-care treatment for non-EoE eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID). We identified 3 patients that all achieved clinical and histopathologic remission on dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the downstream signaling of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. These patients had extra-esophageal forms of EGID with two patients failing to achieve remission on standard-of-care therapies and one patient experiencing significant side effects on swallowed budesonide therapy. The reduction in mucosal eosinophilia in several GI tract segments in these 3 patients highlights a new potential clinical indication for dupilumab in the treatment of pediatric EGID patients.

The Joint Task Force for the American Academy of Allergy Asthma Immunology and American College of Allergy Asthma Immunology and the American Gastroenterology Association recently published guidelines for the management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Because the guideline was published, dupilumab became the first and only medication to gain regulatory approval for the treatment of EoE. This expert opinion document provides a framework for how the clinician can consider using dupilumab in the treatment strategy for patients with EoE.

Study Highlights

### Pharmacologic management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1149QaQo]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), swallowed topical corticosteroids (STSs), and dupilumab are highly effective therapies for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Shared decision-making informs the choice of therapy and factors such as ease of use, safety, cost, and efficacy should be addressed. PPIs are the most common medication utilized early in the disease course; however, for nonresponders, STSs are an excellent alternative. Dupilumab is unlikely to replace PPIs or STSs as first-line therapy, except in highly specific circumstances. Identification of novel biologic pathways and the development of small molecules may lead to a wider range of treatment options in the future.

Pediatric Subjects 1 to 11 Years of Age, Weighing at Least 15 kg, with EoE

The efficacy and safety of DUPIXENT was evaluated in pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age, weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group, multicenter trial (Study EoE-2 Parts A and B; NCT04394351). Eligible subjects had ≥ 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) despite a treatment course of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) either prior to or during the screening period and a history of EoE signs and symptoms. Part A evaluated weight-based dosing regimens of DUPIXENT, 200 mg Q2W (≥ 15 to < 30 kg) and 300 mg Q2W (≥ 30 to < 60 kg), or placebo in 61 subjects during the 16-week treatment period.

The recommended dosage of 300 mg QW for pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age weighing ≥ 40 kg is based on modeled pharmacokinetic data to provide comparable exposures to the 300 mg QW dosage in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older weighing ≥ 40 kg with EoE [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

Forty-seven subjects who completed Part A were evaluated in the 36-week extended active treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part B). All subjects in Part B were treated with the weight-based dosing regimens of DUPIXENT described for Part A.

Dupilumab randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence — design, endpoints, and efficacy: an international phase 3 RCT on 321 subjects had three parts in which part A compared 300-mg weekly dupilumab with placebo for 24 weeks, part B compared weekly with every other week dosing and placebo for 24 weeks, and part C was an active extension to 52 weeks; coprimary endpoints were histologic remission defined as ≤ 6 eos/hpf and absolute change in Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire. Inclusion required patients to be 12 years and above, at least 40 kg, and PPI nonresponders, with exclusions for screening dilation or severe stricturing; in part A, 60% achieved histologic remission with dupilumab compared with 5% with placebo (P < 0.001), and weekly dosing reduced Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire by 21.9 points vs 9.6 (P < 0.001), whereas every other week dosing was not different than placebo; based on these data, 300-mg dosing was approved by the FDA in 2022 for patients at least 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Adults and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with EoE

A total of 239 adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with EoE were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, including two 24-week treatment periods (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B) and received either DUPIXENT 300 mg QW or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 2% of the placebo group and 2% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg QW group.

Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in Parts A and B.

The safety profile of DUPIXENT in 72 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age, weighing at least 40 kg, and adults in Parts A and B was similar.

Pediatric Subjects 1 to 11 Years of Age, Weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE

A total of 61 pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age, weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE were evaluated in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group, multicenter trial, including an initial 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part A) and a 36-week extended active treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part B). Subjects in Part A received a weight-based dosing regimen of DUPIXENT or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. All subjects in Part B completed Part A and received active treatment with weight-based dosing regimens of DUPIXENT in Part B (N = 47).

The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 16 of Study EoE-2 Part A was generally similar to the safety profile in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with EoE. In Part B, a helminth infection was reported in one DUPIXENT-treated subject.

### Dual blockade of IL-4 and IL-13 with dupilumab, an IL-4R α antibody, is required to broadly inhibit type 2 inflammation [^1122gbPZ]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, the above studies, together with the clinical findings with dupilumab, support both IL‐4 and IL‐13 as key initiators and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. By blocking the central drivers of the type 2 immune response, IL‐4 and IL‐13, dupilumab affects multiple downstream effector cells and cytokines (both IgE and eosinophils, but also IL‐5, IL‐13, FcεRIα, pathogenic Th2 cells, alveolar macrophages, etc). In asthma, effective dual IL‐4/IL‐13 blockade with dupilumab (in contrast to IL‐13, IL‐5, or IgE blockade) not only reduces exacerbations, but also improves lung function 3, 5, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66; a corollary to this is that mediators in addition to eosinophils and IgE are critical for impacting lung function in asthma, and simply targeting eosinophils or IgE may only manage the signs and symptoms. All too frequently, patients have manifestations in multiple tissues and suffer from numerous related comorbidities (eg, AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, etc). Emerging data regarding the central role of both IL‐4 and IL‐13 across all provides important new hope to such patients — that is, that a single therapeutic, attacking the fundamental systemic drivers of their immune deviation may benefit and correct all of their disease manifestations whether in skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory systems.

### Advancements in biologic therapies for eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases: a comprehensive review [^116QbXdD]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) encompass a group of disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of eosinophils in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract. EGIDs present with a wide range of symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, and food impaction. Monoclonal antibodies, targeting inflammatory cytokines or eosinophils, are the next emerging therapy for EGIDs. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibody is dupilumab, and it has been approved for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). In this article, the authors will discuss biologics that have been used in the treatment of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases.

### Dupilumab in children with eosinophilic esophagitis: a retrospective multicenter study [^113j2Pzo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent guideline by the Joint Task Force for the American Academy of Allergy Asthma Immunology and American College of Allergy Asthma Immunology and the American Gastroenterology Association recently published the use of dupilumab for EoE management. 18 This expert opinion document provides a framework for how the clinician can consider using dupilumab in the treatment strategy for patients with EoE.

Guidelines on how to initiate dupilumab for the treatment of childhood EoE and longitudinal follow-up data on dupilumab are required. A recent randomized clinical trials in children younger than 12 years have shown dupilumab resulted in histologic remission in a significantly higher percentage of children with EoE than placebo.

Study limitations

A limitation of this study is its retrospective design. Based on chart reviews, clinician-to-clinician variability in symptom reporting made it difficult to fully assess changes in symptoms after dupilumab initiation in some patients. Despite the limitations of this small retrospective analysis, these data demonstrate the significant effectiveness of dupilumab in treating EoE in children.

Dupilumab recommendation context — trial population and rationale for conditional strength: a conditional recommendation was favored for dupilumab because of cost and issues with generalizability stemming from 1 phase 3 study with a population of patients with established and moderate to severe EoE; these patients had a mean EoE duration of 5 years, approximately 40% had required esophageal dilation, all were PPI nonresponders, and approximately 70% had previously been treated with topical steroids, half of whom were either nonresponsive or intolerant to this medication class.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^114aSati]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis — pediatric dupilumab (ages 1–11 years) is suggested for patients nonresponsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy, with low-quality evidence and conditional strength, supported by a randomized pediatric trial showing histologic benefit and subsequent regulatory approval details. We suggest dupilumab as a treatment for EoE in pediatric patients (ages 1–11 years) who are nonresponsive to PPI therapy (quality of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: conditional). Dupilumab was studied in 102 children aged 1–11 years in a 2-part randomized trial of 2 dosing regimens compared to placebo; in part 1 over 16 weeks the primary outcome was histologic response defined as ≤ 6 eos/hpf, and in part 2 patients received active treatment for an additional 36 weeks. After 16 weeks, histologic response rates were 68%, 58%, and 19% in the high-exposure, lower-exposure, and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.0001), and 16-week responses were maintained through 52 weeks. Based on these data, in February 2024 the FDA approved dupilumab for EoE in patients aged 1–11 years and weighing at least 15 kg, with 2 weight-based dosages administered every other week, contrasted with a weekly dose in patients 12 years and above; the pediatric safety profile was consistent with adolescent/adult EoE trials and other dupilumab programs.

A single randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, including two 24-week treatment periods (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B) was conducted in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with EoE (NCT03633617). In both parts, subjects were randomized to receive 300 mg DUPIXENT every week or placebo. Eligible subjects had ≥ 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) following a treatment course of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) either prior to or during the screening period and symptoms of dysphagia as measured by the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ). At baseline, 43% of subjects in Part A and 37% of subjects in Part B had a history of prior esophageal dilations.

Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar in Parts A and B. A total of 81 subjects (61 adults and 20 pediatric subjects) were enrolled in Part A and 159 subjects (107 adults and 52 pediatric subjects) were enrolled in Part B. The mean age in years was 32 years (range 13 to 62 years) in Part A and 28 years (range 12 to 66 years) in Part B. The majority of subjects were male (60% in Part A and 68% in Part B) and White (96% in Part A and 90% in Part B). The mean baseline DSQ score (SD) was 33.6 (12.4) in Part A and 37.2 (10.7) in Part B.

The coprimary efficacy endpoints in Parts A and B were the (1) proportion of subjects achieving histological remission defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤ 6 eos/hpf at Week 24; and (2) the absolute change in the subject-reported DSQ score from baseline to Week 24.

Efficacy results for Parts A and B are presented in Table 29.

In Parts A and B, a greater proportion of subjects randomized to DUPIXENT achieved histological remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤ 6 eos/hpf) compared to placebo. Treatment with DUPIXENT also resulted in a significant improvement in LS mean change in DSQ score compared to placebo at Week 24. The results of the anchor-based analyses that incorporated the subjects' perspectives indicated that the observed improvement in dysphagia from Parts A and B is representative of a clinically meaningful within-subject improvement.

Introduction

Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, progressive, type 2 inflammatory disease with substantial impact on quality of life and increasing incidence and prevalence. Historically, there has been a lack of treatments approved for EoE, and options were non-specific, presented adherence challenges and offered suboptimal long-term disease control. Swallowed topical corticosteroids (STC) are a current treatment option for EoE and a budesonide formulation is approved in most Western countries. Several studies have demonstrated the short-term and long-term efficacy of STC in improving clinical and histological aspects of EoE, with the majority of patients achieving histological disease remission. Notably, long-term treatment with budesonide orodispersible tablets showed maintenance of clinical and histological remission in most patients compared with placebo. However, treatment adherence can be challenging, and there is a high prevalence of disease recurrence should the treatment for EoE be stopped; histological and symptomatic relapses (ie, loss of response) can also occur despite ongoing STC treatment. Although rare, STC side effects include candida infections and adrenal insufficiency.

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases including EoE. A phase 3 study of dupilumab 300 mg once a week (LIBERTY EoE TREET) demonstrated histological remission and improvements in symptoms, as well as consistent improvement in endoscopic and molecular aspects of the disease, in adults and adolescents with EoE up to 52 weeks. Dupilumab is approved in the United States and EU for the treatment of EoE in adults and adolescents 12 years or older weighing at least 40 kg. In some gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, failure on corticosteroids is an unfavourable prognostic characteristic associated with failure on subsequent treatments and increased occurrence of complications. Therefore, an assessment of the efficacy of dupilumab on patients with previous use of glucocorticoids has been previously suggested. The aim of the current subgroup analysis of the LIBERTY EoE TREET study was therefore to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab 300 mg versus placebo once a week for up to 52 weeks of treatment in patients according to previous use of STC, and inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to STC.

### The role of biologics in pediatric food allergy and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders [^114wRzNd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Continuing insight into the molecular mechanisms of atopic disorders has enabled the development of biologics to precisely target these diseases. Food allergy (FA) and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are driven by similar inflammatory molecular mechanisms and exist along the same atopic disease spectrum. Therefore, many of the same biologics are being investigated to target key drivers of mechanisms shared across the disease states. The enormous potential of biologics for the treatment of FA and EGIDs is highlighted by the significant increases in the number of ongoing clinical trials (more than 30) evaluating their use in these disease states, as well as by the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of dupilumab for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Here we discuss past and current research into the use of biologics in FA and EGIDs and their potential role in improving treatment options in the future, with the need to have biologics widely clinically available.

Methods

Study design

This was a pre-specified analysis of data collected during parts A, B and C of the phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled LIBERTY EoE TREET study (NCT03633617), details of which have been previously published. Briefly, patients with active EoE despite the use of high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were randomised 1:1 to subcutaneous placebo or dupilumab 300 mg once a week (part A) or 1:1:1 to subcutaneous placebo or dupilumab 300 mg once a week or dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, for 24 weeks (part B). PPI use at baseline was maintained throughout the treatment period, while new initiation of PPI was prohibited. Prior use of STC was permitted, however use of STC was prohibited within 8 weeks prior to baseline and as a background therapy during the treatment period. Patients who completed parts A and B entered part C (parts A–C and B–C, respectively) for 28 weeks. Part A patients who continued to part C received dupilumab 300 mg once a week; part B patients who received dupilumab continued on the same regimen in part C and those who received placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to dupilumab 300 mg once a week or every 2 weeks. The current analysis included patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg once a week (the approved regimen) or placebo, unless otherwise stated.

### Dupilumab for eosinophilic esophagitis in patients 1 to 11 years of age [^114GQFLw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways and has shown efficacy in five different atopic diseases marked by type 2 inflammation, including eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents.

Methods

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:2:1:1 ratio, patients 1 to 11 years of age with active eosinophilic esophagitis who had had no response to proton-pump inhibitors to 16 weeks of a higher-exposure or lower-exposure subcutaneous dupilumab regimen or to placebo (two groups) (Part A). At the end of Part A, eligible patients in each dupilumab group continued the same regimen and those in the placebo groups were assigned to higher-exposure or lower-exposure dupilumab for 36 weeks (Part B). At each level of exposure, dupilumab was administered in one of four doses tiered according to baseline body weight. The primary end point was histologic remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count, ≤ 6 per high-power field) at week 16. Key secondary end points were tested hierarchically.

Results

In Part A, histologic remission occurred in 25 of the 37 patients (68%) in the higher-exposure group, in 18 of the 31 patients (58%) in the lower-exposure group, and in 1 of the 34 patients (3%) in the placebo group (difference between the higher-exposure regimen and placebo, 65 percentage points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 48 to 81; P < 0.001]; difference between the lower-exposure regimen and placebo, 55 percentage points [95% CI, 37 to 73; P < 0.001]). The higher-exposure dupilumab regimen led to significant improvements in histologic, endoscopic, and transcriptomic measures as compared with placebo. The improvements in histologic, endoscopic, and transcriptomic measures between baseline and week 52 in all the patients were generally similar to the improvements between baseline and week 16 in the patients who received dupilumab in Part A. In Part A, the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019, nausea, injection-site pain, and headache was at least 10 percentage points higher among the patients who received dupilumab (at either dose) than among those who received placebo. Serious adverse events were reported in 3 patients who received dupilumab during Part A and in 6 patients overall during Part B.

Conclusions

Dupilumab resulted in histologic remission in a significantly higher percentage of children with eosinophilic esophagitis than placebo. The higher-exposure dupilumab regimen also led to improvements in measures of key secondary end points as compared with placebo.

### Biologics in eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases [^11781kJN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases are a constellation of conditions categorized by the location of eosinophilic infiltration in the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms vary based on location of eosinophils and age of the patient. There are no approved medications at the current time with individuals using off-label steroids or dietary therapy. Translational research has identified potential pathways to target in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastritis (EoG), and enteritis (EoN), including type 2 pathways, mast cells, and eosinophils. Preliminary studies found cendakimab (anti-interleukin [IL]-13) and dupilumab (anti-IL-4 receptor alpha) to have an effect on eosinophil count and symptoms with dupilumab recently approved. In addition, mepolizumab (anti-IL-5), reslizumab (anti-IL-5), and lirentelimab (anti-Siglec 8) were found to have reduction in eosinophils without reduction of symptoms. For EoG and EoN, both benralizumab (anti-IL-5 receptor) and lirentelimab were found to have histologic and symptom improvement. There are no agents studied for eosinophilic colitis. Results of ongoing phase 3 trials in EoE and EoG/EoN are also anticipated.

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^1113xcnW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Across the trials for AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and CSU indications, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 500 cells/mcL) was similar in DUPIXENT and placebo groups.

In the trials for the PN indication, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 500 cells/mcL) was lower in DUPIXENT than in the placebo group.

In the trial for the BP indication, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 500 cells/mcL) was higher in DUPIXENT (21%) than in the placebo group (11%).

Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 5,000 cells/mcL) was observed in < 3% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects and < 0.5% in subjects receiving placebo (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021; DRI12544, QUEST, and VOYAGE; SINUS-24 and SINUS-52; PRIME and PRIME2; BOREAS and NOTUS; CUPID Study A, B, and C). Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline or remained below baseline levels (PRIME and PRIME2; BOREAS and NOTUS; ADEPT) during treatment. In trial AD-1539, treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in 8% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects and 0% in subjects receiving placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Management of IgE-mediated food allergy in the 21st century [^114zfXDW]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab is another biologic currently investigated for the treatment of FA, with/without concomitant OIT. Dupilumab is an anti‐IL4/13 mAb approved for the treatment of type 2 asthma, nasal polyposisand atopic dermatitis. An ongoing trial is assessing the tolerability of peanut protein in paediatric patients (6–17 years old) treated with dupilumab as monotherapy. A phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double‐blind, parallel group, 2 arm study in approximately 40 subjects, aged 4 to 50 years, allergic to cow's milk is evaluating dupilumab as an adjunct to milk oral immunotherapy compared to placebo.

However, by affecting type 2 cellular immunity, it is hoped that it may stop the atopic march and prevent FA in high‐risk infants. It is also of great interest in non‐IgE‐mediated food allergies. Phase 2 and phase 3 trials have found it effective for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis, and there are case reports of successful use in eosinophilic gastroenteritis secondary to type 4 food allergies.

On the contrary, mepolizumab, an anti‐IL5 mAb, was found ineffective at improving eosinophilic esophagitis signs and symptoms despite reducing the number of eosinophils on biopsies. This suggests that eosinophils may only be an epiphenomenon of type 2 inflammation without a key role in the disease.

Tezepelumab is another candidate for preventing sensitization and treating type 2 inflammation. It is currently studied for asthma with good results, but it is too early to tell if it will be of use for FA.

Unfortunately, the long‐term treatment, the very high cost of biologics, as well as the lack of indication for FA create new challenges in terms of access and sustainability.

In summary, new generation of treatments is emerging for IgE‐mediated food allergy, using different approaches. Clinical trials of these promising new treatments are underway or planned by pharmaceutical, medical or academic entities, but currently are doing so without achieving consensus on how best to measure clinical effectiveness. There is no agreed set of 'core outcomes' for evaluating these new treatments. Core outcome sets would ensure that trial outcomes are relevant to different stakeholders; and allow to combine evidence in meta‐analysis.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab up to 52 weeks in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic oesophagitis (LIBERTY EoE TREET study): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^112rLNQ5]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Long-term management options that specifically target the underlying inflammation in eosinophilic oesophagitis are needed. Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13; we aimed to assess its long-term efficacy and safety in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic oesophagitis enrolled in part B of the LIBERTY EoE TREET study who continued to part C (part B-C).

Methods

LIBERTY EoE TREET was a three-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study conducted at 65 hospitals and private clinics across ten countries in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. Adults or adolescents (aged ≥ 12 years) with a diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis by endoscopic biopsy (peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field [eos/hpf]) from at least one oesophageal region despite 8 weeks of high-dose proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and a Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score of at least 10 at baseline were eligible. In part B, patients were randomly (1:1:1) assigned to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg either weekly or every 2 weeks or weekly placebo until week 24. Randomisation was done centrally by interactive voice response system/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) in blocks and stratified according to age (< 18 years vs ≥ 18 years) and use of PPI at randomisation (yes vs no). Patients, study sponsors, and investigators involved in the study were masked to the randomisation outcome. Eligible patients who received placebo in part B and continued to part C were randomly assigned again (1:1) to either weekly dupilumab (placebo/weekly dupilumab group) or dupilumab every 2 weeks (placebo/dupilumab every 2 weeks), with matching placebo alternating with dupilumab doses. Patients who were randomly assigned to one of the dupilumab dose regimens in part B remained on the same regimen in part C for an additional 28 weeks (weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group or dupilumab every 2 weeks/dupilumab every 2 weeks group). Treatment assignment in part C was managed by IVRS/IWRS to maintain blinding of treatment assignment in part B. The primary endpoint of this trial has been reported; here, we report the week 52 outcomes of part B-C. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the part C safety-analysis set, which included all patients who were randomised in part B, entered part C, and received any study drug in part C. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03633617.

Findings

Between Aug 12, 2019, and March 11, 2021, 240 patients were randomly assigned into part B, of whom 227 (74 in placebo group, 74 in weekly dupilumab group, and 79 in dupilumab every 2 weeks group) continued into part B-C and were included in the current analysis. 37 patients switched from placebo to weekly dupilumab, and 37 from placebo to dupilumab every 2 weeks; 74 patients continued on weekly dupilumab and 79 continued on dupilumab every 2 weeks. Of the patients who entered part B-C, 75 (33%) were adolescents, 145 (64%) male, 82 (36%) female, and 206 (91%) White. At week 52, 55 (85%) patients in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group, 25 (68%) in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group, 54 (74%) in the every 2 weeks dupilumab/every 2 weeks dupilumab group, and 23 (72%) in the placebo/every 2 weeks dupilumab group achieved a peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 6 eos/hpf or less. Mean percent change from part B baseline in peak eosinophil count was -95·9% (95% CI -96·9 to -94·9) in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group, -84·2% (-98·3 to -70·2) in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group, -84·8% (-94·3 to -75·2) in the every 2 weeks dupilumab/every 2 weeks dupilumab group, and -91·2% (-95·9 to -86·5) in the placebo/every 2 weeks dupilumab group at week 52. At week 52, mean change from part B baseline in eosinophilic oesophagitis Histology Scoring System (HSS) grade score was -1·0 point (95% CI -1·1 to -0·9) in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group and -0·9 points (-1·0 to -0·8) in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group; mean change in eosinophilic oesophagitis HSS stage score was -0·9 points (-1·0 to -0·8) in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group and -0·9 points (-1·0 to -0·8) in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group. Similar improvements were observed in the every 2 weeks dupilumab groups. Mean absolute change from part B baseline in DSQ score was -30·3 points (95% CI -34·5 to -26·1) in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group, -27·3 points (-32·1 to -22·4) in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group, -20·9% (-25·4 to -16·3) in the every 2 weeks dupilumab/every 2 weeks dupilumab group, and -23·7% (-29·1 to -18·3) in the placebo/every 2 weeks dupilumab group at week 52. Mean change from part B baseline in endoscopic reference score was -5·4 points (95% CI -6·1 to -4·6) in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group, -6·1 points (-7·3 to -4·9) in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group, -5·2% (-6·0 to -4·4) in the every 2 weeks dupilumab/every 2 weeks dupilumab group, and -4·3% (-5·4 to -3·1) in the placebo/every 2 weeks dupilumab group at week 52. During part B-C, one (3%) patient in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group, one (1%) in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group, and one (3%) in the placebo/every 2 weeks dupilumab group received rescue medication. One (3%) patient in the placebo/every 2 weeks dupilumab group and one (1%) in the dupilumab every 2 weeks/dupilumab every 2 weeks group underwent a rescue oesophageal dilation procedure. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection-site reactions (ten [14%] in the weekly dupilumab/weekly dupilumab group and four [11%] in the placebo/weekly dupilumab group).

Interpretation

Improvements in histological, symptomatic, endoscopic, and molecular features of eosinophilic oesophagitis observed after 24 weeks of weekly dupilumab treatment were maintained or continued to improve to week 52. These findings reinforce the importance of weekly dupilumab, rather than every 2 weeks, for the improvement of symptoms in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic oesophagitis.

### Study design of the phase IV, randomized, placebo-controlled REMOdeling with dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis long-term (REMODEL) trial [^114rSKru]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, all patients, care providers, and investigators will be blinded to the study intervention. To achieve blinding, study patients, care providers, and investigators will not have access to the randomization list, and study drugs will be visually indistinguishable. If rescue treatment is medically necessary, and at the discretion of the investigator, patients can switch to open-label treatment or receive emergency dilation, and the patient's intervention will be unblinded before rescue. The investigator will have sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a patient's intervention assignment is warranted, with patient safety being the first consideration in making the decision. Sponsor staff may unblind the intervention assignments for any patient with a serious adverse event. The study will be unblinded at the first early analyses, when all patients complete the 24-week treatment period, or upon early discontinuation from the study (see Supplemental Methods for further information). The 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period will be followed by an open-label period of 104 weeks in which all patients will receive dupilumab. Recruitment for REMODEL ended in May 2025, and the primary data readout of the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period is anticipated in December 2025.

Study interventions

For the first 24 weeks, patients will be randomized to receive either dupilumab 300 mg once weekly (qw), corresponding with the US Food and Drug Administration-approved dupilumab dosing in adults with EoE, or placebo. During the open-label period, all patients will receive dupilumab 300 mg qw. Dupilumab 300 mg and placebo will be provided in identically matched, 2 mL prefilled syringes and will be administered by subcutaneous injection, which, after appropriate training, can be administered by the patient at home. Patients' adherence to treatment will be monitored during the study by site investigators (see).

Asthma

The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of DUPIXENT for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Pediatric Subjects 12 to 17 Years of Age:

A total of 107 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled in QUEST and received either 200 mg (N = 21) or 300 mg (N = 18) DUPIXENT (or matching placebo either 200 mg [N = 34] or 300 mg [N = 34]) Q2W. Asthma exacerbations and lung function were assessed in both pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age and adults. For both the 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W doses, improvements in FEV1(LS mean change from baseline at Week 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg Q2W dose, subjects had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. Dupilumab exposure was higher in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age than that in adults at the respective dose level which was mainly accounted for by difference in body weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The adverse event profile in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age was generally similar to the adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Ethical considerations and data collection

REMODEL will be conducted in accordance with (i) consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the applicable amendmentsand Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences international ethical guidelines, and (ii) applicable regulatory requirements in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice E6 (R2) guidelines. The protocol and other relevant documents were submitted for institutional review board (IRB) review and were approved before the study was initiated. Any substantial amendments to the protocol will require health authority and IRB/independent ethics committee (IEC) approval before implementation, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patients. The reporting of this study conforms to the SPIRIT statement.

During enrollment, patients were informed that their participation was voluntary and were required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 Code of Federal Regulations 50, local regulations, International Council for Harmonisation guidelines, privacy and data protection regulations, and the requirements of the IRB/IEC and/or study center. The informed consent form contains two separate sections, each subject to independent consent, that address the use of patients' data and/or samples for future research. Written consent was obtained by the investigator or an authorized representative. Data will be collected and stored in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and any other applicable data protection laws (details related to data access and dissemination are found in the).

A placebo arm consisting of patients who may be exposed to background therapies, including PPIs and/or dietary therapy, was deemed necessary to assess natural disease progression and robustly measure dupilumab treatment effects while controlling for other factors, for example, background treatment adherence. A randomization ratio of 2:1 for the active treatment versus placebo was used to limit the number of patients exposed to placebo and avoid excessive and unjustified burden on patients. All patients were appropriately informed and provided written consent for the potential eventuality of receiving a placebo and may withdraw from the study intervention or from the study at any time. Furthermore, if medically necessary and at the discretion of their physician, patients may receive other treatments, switch to open-label treatment, and/or have emergency dilation at any time.

Of the total subjects evaluated in Part A, the mean age was 8 years, the median weight was 28 kg, and 75% were male. Seven percent identified as Hispanic or Latino; 85% identified as White, 12% as Black, 2% as Asian, and 2% identified as another racial subgroup.

The primary efficacy endpoint in Part A was the proportion of subjects achieving histological remission defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤ 6 eos/hpf at Week 16.

Efficacy results for Part A are presented in Table 30.

In Part B, histological remission was achieved at Week 52 in 17/32 subjects treated with DUPIXENT in Parts A and B and 8/15 subjects treated with placebo in Part A and DUPIXENT in Part B.

In Study EoE-2 Part A, an observer-reported outcome, the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-Caregiver (PESQ-C), was used to measure signs of EoE. A greater decrease in the proportion of days with 1 or more signs of EoE (based on the PESQ-C) was observed for subjects treated with DUPIXENT compared to placebo after 16 weeks of treatment.

Novel biologics used in other allergic conditions (such as dupilumab, cendakimab and benralizumab) have shown promise for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis

GRADE of evidence: Low.

Level of recommendation: Weak.

Level of agreement: 88%.

The anti-interleukin (IL)4 receptor monoclonal antibody dupilumab has been used in the management of chronic allergic diseases such as eczema, and asthma. Mechanistically, targeting the IL-4 and IL-13 pathway has been considered a potentially useful strategy in managing patients with EoE. In a phase 2 randomised trial of adult patients with active EoE, the effects of dupilumab were investigated in 23 patients and compared with 24 placebo controls. The group receiving weekly injections of dupilumab (300 mg for 12 weeks) were found to have a significant reduction in their symptoms of dysphagia at week 10 using the Straumann Dysphagia Instrument patient-reported outcome score (mean reduction of 3.0 compared with 1.3 in the placebo group, p = 0.0304). Furthermore, the peak mean eosinophil count per hpf was reduced by 86.8 eosinophils (107.1%) compared with placebo, (p < 0.001). Endoscopic parameters also improved with the treatment group (both EREF score) and oesophageal distensibility, at week 12 compared with placebo (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001, respectively). While some side effects were described in the treatment group, these were mild and generally well tolerated (35% had erythema at the injection site, and 17% had nasopharyngitis, compared with placebo, 8% and 4%, respectively, with no serious adverse events reported).

### Future of therapy and monitoring for eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases [^112vgcew]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, including eosinophilic esophagitis, are chronic T H 2-mediated diseases. Establishing a diagnosis and initiating treatment are crucial to limit disease progression that may lead to tissue remodeling and the development of strictures that significantly affect patients' quality of life. Expert consensus guidelines provide a framework for treating eosinophilic esophagitis with diet elimination, proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical steroids, or dupilumab, and for monitoring with sedated endoscopy for gross and histologic evaluation. Although this provides an established algorithm for treating and monitoring eosinophilic esophagitis, there is less established research for the rarer eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (eosinophilic gastritis, enteritis, and colitis). Research advancements continue rapidly to emerge, identifying potential biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and monitoring strategies. In this article, we review the currently accepted methods for treating and monitoring eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders with a focus on eosinophilic esophagitis, assess methods currently under investigation, and provide an aspirational vision for future disease management with a streamlined algorithm of personalized medicine and less invasive monitoring.

### Dupilumab in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis [^112TMNUf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling, which have key roles in eosinophilic esophagitis.

Methods

We conducted a three-part, phase 3 trial in which patients 12 years of age or older underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous dupilumab at a weekly dose of 300 mg or placebo (Part A) or in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 300 mg of dupilumab either weekly or every 2 weeks or weekly placebo (Part B) up to week 24. Eligible patients who completed Part A or Part B continued the trial in Part C, in which those who completed Part A received dupilumab at a weekly dose of 300 mg up to week 52 (the Part A-C group); Part C that included the eligible patients from Part B is ongoing. The two primary end points at week 24 were histologic remission (≤ 6 eosinophils per high-power field) and the change from baseline in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score (range, 0 to 84, with higher values indicating more frequent or more severe dysphagia).

Results

In Part A, histologic remission occurred in 25 of 42 patients (60%) who received weekly dupilumab and in 2 of 39 patients (5%) who received placebo (difference, 55 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 40 to 71; P < 0.001). In Part B, histologic remission occurred in 47 of 80 patients (59%) with weekly dupilumab, in 49 of 81 patients (60%) with dupilumab every 2 weeks, and in 5 of 79 patients (6%) with placebo (difference between weekly dupilumab and placebo, 54 percentage points; 95% CI, 41 to 66 [P < 0.001]; difference between dupilumab every 2 weeks and placebo, 56 percentage points; 95% CI, 43 to 69 [not significant per hierarchical testing]). The mean (± SD) DSQ scores at baseline were 33.6 ± 12.41 in Part A and 36.7 ± 11.22 in Part B; the scores improved with weekly dupilumab as compared with placebo, with differences of -12.32 (95% CI, -19.11 to -5.54) in Part A and -9.92 (95% CI, -14.81 to -5.02) in Part B (both P < 0.001) but not with dupilumab every 2 weeks (difference in Part B, -0.51; 95% CI, -5.42 to 4.41). Serious adverse events occurred in 9 patients during the Part A or B treatment period (in 7 who received weekly dupilumab, 1 who received dupilumab every 2 weeks, and 1 who received placebo) and in 1 patient in the Part A-C group during the Part C treatment period who received placebo in Part A and weekly dupilumab in Part C.

Conclusions

Among patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, subcutaneous dupilumab administered weekly improved histologic outcomes and alleviated symptoms of the disease. (Funded by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03633617.).

### Dupilumab as an adjunct to oral immunotherapy in pediatric patients with peanut allergy [^116rkgLq]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Since IL‐4 and IL‐13 can be upregulated during up‐dosing of OIT and are critical to the induction and perpetuation of the type 2 inflammatory response, inhibiting IL‐4 and IL‐13 signaling could potentially enhance the desensitization effects of OIT while improving safety and tolerability. In addition to IgE‐dependent activation, IL‐4 and IL‐13 can also activate mast cells through IgE‐independent mechanisms. IL‐4 has been demonstrated to promote mast cell activation and expansion through epigenetic regulation of regulatory T cell reprogramming, and IL‐4 and IL‐13 increase FcεRIα expression at the mast cell surface, driving mast cell gene changes independently and in combination with IgE cross‐linking. All of these effects can be completely blocked by the IL‐4Rα antibody, which prevents effector cell activation and the downstream allergic cascade. In mouse asthma models, treatment with dupilumab blocks pathogenic T and eosinophil immune cell infiltration into the tissue of the lung and gastrointestinal tract, while blockade of IL‐4 and IL‐13 has also been shown to prevent anaphylaxis in mouse models of food allergy and to improve OIT‐induced gastrointestinal symptoms in a human patient.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dupilumab improved the efficacy of OIT in children and adolescents with peanut allergy, as determined by tolerance of a higher cumulative peanut protein dose level during a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) after 28 weeks of treatment, and whether dupilumab influences biomarkers important in allergic responses to peanut.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111EzS6i]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to biologic agents, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to offer dupilumab as step-up therapy in difficult-to-treat patients, and consider using it in patients with EoE with multiple atopic conditions that would also meet requirements for dupilumab use.

### Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study [^1161n4V8]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this pre-specified analysis show that prior treatment with STC does not negatively affect responsiveness to subsequent treatment with dupilumab 300 mg once a week. In addition, patients with an inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to STC also demonstrated improvements with dupilumab 300 mg once a week compared with placebo.

### Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study [^114ntcsU]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

STCs are used as a standard-of-care treatment for EoE and although they may be effective, they can fail to induce histological remission in some patients. Relapses or loss of response are common, and adherence to treatment can be challenging. Additional treatment options currently include PPIs and dietary elimination therapy, but up to half of patients may not respond. Consistent with this, all patients enrolled in the LIBERTY EoE TREET study had failed PPIs, many had a lack of response to STC (73% in part A and 59% in part B) or had previously been on a food elimination diet (57% and 58%, respectively). This highlights the value of treatment options that address the underlying inflammatory processes and prevent or control disease.

In this subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study, taking into account the current lack of standardised definition for refractory EoE, patients with STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication were defined at baseline by clinicians based on whether STC treatment was ineffective or presented side effects, or whether STC treatment was overall contraindicated. The results demonstrated that, regardless of a patient's prior STC use or STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication, dupilumab 300 mg once a week reduced the peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count versus placebo. Notably, 100% of patients receiving dupilumab treatment for 52 weeks in part B–C of the study had an intraepithelial eosinophil count < 15 eos/hpf, which is the histological diagnostic threshold for EoE. While some studies noted reduction in eosinophil count without improvement in symptoms, we found that dupilumab 300 mg once a week improved patient-reported symptoms versus placebo, as demonstrated by decreases in DSQ total score and percentage change from baseline to week 24 regardless of prior STC use or STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication, with scores at least maintained when dupilumab treatment was extended for 28 weeks. Dupilumab weekly treatment also improved EREFS, HSS grade and stage scores versus placebo at week 24, and at least maintained this improvement when dupilumab treatment was extended up to 52 weeks, regardless of prior STC use or STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication.

### Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study [^115dVX7M]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab biweekly treatment led to similar results in histological, endoscopic and molecular outcomes to weekly treatment, except for symptoms (as measured by DSQ scores), which did not improve versus placebo at week 24 or to the same degree as patients receiving weekly dupilumab through week 52. These results confirm those previously observed in the overall TREET population where dupilumab biweekly treatment improved histological, endoscopic and molecular outcomes but not DSQ, EoE impact or symptom questionnaire scores. This emphasises the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg once a week, which is the approved dosage.

STC treatment regimens for EoE are not standardised and can include different active ingredients, doses, modes of administration and variable durations, resulting in inconsistent outcomes. While patients with EoE in Europe, Australia and Canada are more likely to be prescribed orodispersible budesonide as it is approved in these regions, STCs are not FDA approved for EoE in the United States. While a majority of patients respond to STC treatment, less than half of those who do not respond to this first-line therapy achieve a response in other second-line therapy, highlighting the lack of treatment options for patients not responding to STC. Dupilumab is approved in the United States and EU for the treatment of EoE, and the results of the current analysis indicate that it provides similar efficacy regardless of prior therapy, suggesting that it may be a reliable therapeutic option for patients with EoE who did not respond to first-line treatment. Dupilumab was also well tolerated, with safety in subgroups similar to overall safety profile reported previously.

Limitations of the current analysis include the lack of standardised definition for inadequate response, intolerance or contraindication to STC, which in this study relied on clinician judgement. There is also no information on the STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication for patients from part A of the study. Despite this, there was a reasonable number of patients for analysis in both subgroups in parts B and B–C and these patients were representative of the wider population of patients with EoE. Finally, although the number of patients in the subgroups without prior STC use in part A was small (placebo n = 8 and dupilumab n = 13), numerical improvements were observed.

### Assessment of real-world disease severity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States [^116QGUpW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated esophageal disease characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic inflammation in the esophageal mucosa (⩾15 eosinophils per high power field (eos/hpf)). Early diagnosis of EoE is crucial; if left untreated, the disease can progress from an inflammatory to a fibrostenotic phenotype that is associated with stricture formation and esophageal remodeling. – The clinical symptoms associated with EoE can vary by age; difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and food impaction are the most frequently reported symptoms in adolescents and adults.

Clinical practice guidelines for EoE strongly recommend treatment with topical corticosteroids over no treatment. Dietary restriction and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are used off-label, are both conditionally recommended. Since the publication of the American Gastroenterological Association and the Joint Task Force on Allergy-Immunology Practice Parameters (AGA/JTF) 2020 guidelines, Dupixent (dupilumab), a biologic therapy, has become the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for patients aged 1 year and older with EoE. In 2024, Eohilia (budesonide oral suspension (BOS)) became the first US FDA-approved swallowed corticosteroid for the 12-week treatment of patients aged 11 years and older with EoE.

Despite the identification of standardized metrics and validated outcomes to monitor EoE and patient response to treatment, disease severity is not consistently measured in clinical practice. Some metrics that could be used to assess EoE disease severity include: patient-reported outcomes, endoscopic assessments, and histologic indicators of disease activity. A clinical severity index, known as the Index of Severity for EoE (I-SEE), was developed in 2022 by a multidisciplinary team of experts during an AGA-sponsored consensus conference; the AGA has developed an application to provide physicians with easy access to the I-SEE. This standardized EoE disease severity scoring system considers three domains: symptoms and complications; inflammatory features; and fibrostenotic features. Initial studies have shown that the I-SEE is suitable for capturing patient response to topical corticosteroid treatment in EoE, and results correlate with aspects of molecular disease activity. – However, the distribution of clinical severity across patients with EoE in real-world clinical practice is not well established. This information could improve understanding of EoE disease features and consequently inform management strategies in EoE.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^111hXFw3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Concerning PPIs, 43.62% of physicians reported unsatisfactory patient responses to monotherapy, with approximately 5% discontinuing treatment due to side effects, with an average treatment duration of 19 months.

Regarding TCS, physicians noted that 15.84% of treatments were discontinued due to lack of drug efficacy, approximately 11% of patients were unsuitable candidates, with an average treatment duration of 24.08 months.

It is important to emphasize that the data concerning PPIs and TCS are solely based on the perceptions of participating clinicians in the survey. Moreover, regarding the discontinuation rate, it remains unclear whether clinicians considered possible nonadherence to prescribed treatments.

Among responding clinicians, 23.1% agree that first-line treatment with PPIs is equivalent in efficacy to TCS, while the remainder disagree. Additionally, the expert panel agreed that due to adverse events (e.g. candidiasis up to 18%), TCS are not typically prescribed continuously but rather in intermittent courses, which might not be suitable for the continuous treatment of a chronic disease.

Apart from current therapies, novel biological treatments are in development, such as Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, key and central drivers in EoE and other type 2 inflammation diseases, has shown promising results in reducing statistically symptoms, histological and endoscopical features of EoE. – Its approval as the first and sole biological therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency has marked its efficacy. However, various other biologic drugs are currently undergoing development.

The panel of experts suggests (Figure 4) that Dupilumab could be a significant option for adults and adolescents (transitional age) inadequately controlled by, intolerant to, or ineligible for at least one conventional therapy. Additionally, in EoE patients with one or more type-2 inflammatory diseases, considering treatment in the first line with Dupilumab is recommended as well as in the adolescents (transitional age) patients who are at risk of TCS use.

### One year into dupilumab: physician and patient experiences in initiating dupilumab for pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis [^1112wG2W]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The aims of this study were to report physician and patient perspectives on initiating dupilumab. A 2-pronged approach was used: (1) data on physician prescribing practices was gathered via retrospective chart review of EoE patients prescribed dupilumab and (2) pediatric patients on dupilumab were approached to complete a questionnaire regarding reasons for initiation. During this time, 42 patients were prescribed dupilumab. From the physician's perspective, the primary reasons for dupilumab included nonresponse to topical corticosteroids (TCS) (52%), nonadherence (28%), adverse effects (10%), or to treat multiple atopic diseases (5%). The median dupilumab initiation time, from day prescribed to first injection, was 37 days [interquartile range (IQR) 37]. Almost all required prior authorization (PA) (98%), while 17% required letter of appeal and 2% required peer-to-peer. Fifteen patients (36%) completed the questionnaire portion of the study. From the patient's perspective, the primary reasons for dupilumab initiation included nonresponse to TCS (27%), nonadherence to TCS (27%), concern about adverse effects of TCS (7%), and treatment of multiple atopic diseases (33%). In conclusion, physicians are prescribing dupilumab primarily for nonresponse to TCS and almost all required PA with a long delay to starting dupilumab.

### Cost-utility analysis of sequential therapies for pediatric-onset eosinophilic esophagitis [^114h7bmG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a Th‐2 antigen‐mediated clinicopathologic condition. Its main clinical features are on account of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil‐predominant mucosal inflammation. However, pediatric‐onset EoE may present with a different and less specific spectrum of symptoms than adults, and an unalike response to available treatments as well.

International consensus on the management of EoE is consistent in recommending proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), dietary elimination, and topical corticosteroids (TCS) as first‐line therapies. Regarding the latter, budesonide orodispersible tablets (BOT), and viscous solution preparations of either budesonide, fluticasone or mometasone have shown efficacy in induction and maintenance of remission.BOT is the first specific formulation approved in Europe for the treatment of adult EoE and has shown to be cost‐effective compared to no treatment in patients nonresponsive to PPI. The six‐food elimination diet (ED), although favored over TCS in previous cost‐utility analyses, is currently considered an outdated first‐line approach, and there is increasing evidence in favor of a step‐up ED starting with two foodsor even cow's milk restriction alone. Furthermore, biological treatments are mainly considered as a way to treat severe or refractory cases. A clinical guideline for the indication of dupilumab (DUP) in EoE suggests considering its use not only as a step‐up therapy, but also as first‐line therapy in cases of multiple comorbid atopic conditions, and when avoidance of dietary restriction or TCS is strongly preferred.

EoE is known to have substantial direct costs and to be responsible for a significant burden of disease. Moreover, the impact on quality of life is not only determined by disease activity, but is also directly influenced by treatment regimens. Differences in age at onset, induction success rate, eventual loss of response, long‐term treatment adherence, non‐covered off‐label pharmacologic indications, and sequence of therapies for non‐first‐line responders may have an impact in managing to get a cost‐effective care.

Given the availability of several equally recommended therapies, the gaining knowledge of optimal EDs, and the presumably future broadening of age indications for DUP and new TCS formulations, we aim to conduct a cost‐utility analysis of all potential sequences of treatments for pediatric EoE.

### The new biologic drugs: which children with asthma should get what? [^117VyPBt]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

6 DUPILUMAB

6.1 Mechanism of action

IL‐4 and IL‐13 are two structurally similar cytokines which play key roles at multiple stages of the allergic response, including by enabling differentiation of naïve T‐helper cells, upregulating MHC class II and Fcϵ receptor expression, promoting secretion of IgE, inducing B cell class switching, activating mast cells, and supporting proliferation of eosinophils and basophils. IL‐4 and IL‐13 are therefore promising targets for therapeutic intervention in allergic diseases.

Dupilumab (Dupixent, Sanofi Biotechnology) is a human monoclonal antibody which blocks IL‐4Rα, the shared receptor for both IL‐4 and IL‐13 (Figure 2). Because IL‐4 and IL‐13 also increase production of nitric oxide by airway epithelial cells during eosinophilic inflammation, FeNO is a very useful biomarker for identifying children who may benefit from dupilumab.

6.2 Indications

Dupilumab was initially licensed for atopic eczema and is now licenced for use in the UK in children age 6 years and over, with severe type‐2 mediated asthma as an add‐on therapy. The dosing is calculated by age and body weight in the 6–11 year‐old group. In children over 12 years, it is prescribed as a single initial dose of 400 mg, administered subcutaneously as two consecutive 200 mg injections at different sites, followed by 200 mg every 2 weeks. Criteria for dupilumab are blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 cells/µl, FeNO ≥ 25 parts per billion and poorly controlled asthma (≥ 4 asthma attacks), in the last 12 months (Table 5). NICE stipulates that dupilumab can only be prescribed if the child is either not eligible for or exhibited an undefined poor response to mepolizumab, the latter defined as less than 50% reduction in severe asthma attacks over 12 months. However, given the better results of VOYAGE compared to MUPPITS‐2, this may not be fully justified. NICE recommends a review after 12 months of initiating treatment, which can be continued if the rate of severe attacks (need for short course of oral corticosteroids) has been halved. Table 3 summarizes the main pediatric studies looking at the efficacy of dupilumab.

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^111xw3gV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

EoE

The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for the treatment of EoE have been established in pediatric subjects 1 year of age and older, weighing at least 15 kg. Use of DUPIXENT in this population is supported by an adequate well-controlled study in adults and 72 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age (Study EoE-1), a clinical study in 61 pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age (Study EoE-2), and pharmacokinetic data in adult and pediatric subjects 1 to 17 years of age. The safety of DUPIXENT in pediatric subjects 1 to 17 years of age was similar to adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age, or weighing less than 15 kg, with EoE.

Prurigo Nodularis

Safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have not been established in pediatric patients with PN.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have not been established in pediatric patients with COPD. COPD is largely a disease of adult patients.

Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for the treatment of CSU in patients who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. The use of DUPIXENT in this indication is supported by evidence from two adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic data in 6 pediatric patients 12 years of age and older, and safety data in pediatric patients in other indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.7)].

Safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age, and/or weighing less than 30 kg, with CSU.

### A nationwide experience of biological treatments in children with eosinophilic esophagitis [^116dvtfb]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

No biological treatment has been approved for pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in France. For patients refractory to conventional treatments, although compassionate use of monoclonal antibodies has developed, experience remains limited.

Methods

We conducted a national multicenter study across French pediatric tertiary care centers where children (younger than 18 years) who presented with EoE were treated with biological therapies between January 2015 and December 2023. The main objective was to characterize this patient population, and the indications for prescribing biologics. The secondary goals were to assess these patients' clinical, endoscopic, and histologic finding, as well as patient tolerance, and to compare our cohort at baseline with pediatric patients from two European registers of EoE treated with conventional therapies.

Results

Thirty-six patients were prescribed 37 biologics (omalizumab, n = 1; mepolizumab, n = 6; dupilumab, n = 30). At diagnosis, the mean patient age was 7.4 (± 4.4) years, and most patients had at least one atopic comorbidity (91.7%, n = 33). Failure of first-line treatments was the main reason for starting biological therapy (75.7%, n = 28), prescribed as compassionate use (54.1%, n = 20). Dupilumab showed significant clinical (48%, p < 0.01) and histological (82.6%, p < 0.01) improvement. Compared with children treated with conventional therapies, patients in our cohort at baseline presented significantly more asthma, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis, as well as more fibrostenotic phenotype and digestive symptoms. No severe side effect was reported within a 6–12-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Dupilumab is the most frequently prescribed, and appears to be the most effective biotherapy, regarding clinical and histologic remission. All biologics were well-tolerated.

Impact

Pending marketing authorization, biological therapies for pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis are mainly prescribed after failure of first-line treatments and on a compassionate basis in France. Dupilumab is the biotherapy most frequently used, is associated with clinical and histological efficacy and is well-tolerated. Children and adolescents requiring biologics appear to be younger and more severe at diagnosis than naive pediatric patients in Europeans registries.

Research is needed to compare available drug therapies, including new biological drugs and/or diets in randomised clinical trials

New drug developments such as the introduction of the biological agents need to be assessed, both in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Some circumstances, such as multiple atopic conditions coinciding may favour their use especially if the symptoms are severe. There may be age cohorts that benefit more than others, such as young or adolescent patients where aggressive therapies may make a bigger difference to long-term quality of life, and where the lack of needing concordance with a daily tablet regime could give greater reliability with disease response.

The issues of concordance and long-term viability of dietary regimes needs support and research to ensure that not all patients end up requiring a drug therapy if an alternative effective diet can be identified and maintained.

Work on the role of biological therapy and novel targets in EoE is underway, although at an early stage currently. In addition to phase 3 trials for dupilumab, NCT03633617 (adults) and NCT04394351 (paediatrics), cendakimab NCT04753697, and benralizumab (adults) NCT04543409which are underway. There are also novel drugs and drug targets such as losartan, kallikrein and Siglec-8. It is important that the medical community are able to work with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that these trials are performed and completed to a high standard so that the scientific outcomes add to our knowledge of EoE disease management. With better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, we may also be able to identify phenotypes for more personalised treatment.

Research is needed to understand the application of clinical guidelines in eosinophilic oesophagitis

As a final recommendation, we consider that research is needed to ensure that guidelines have true clinical applicability, are acceptable to clinicians and patients. Methods of dissemination and uptake should be researched and validated. Until now guidelines have been produced but it is common to hear that practice does not necessarily follow guidelines and it is important to understand why.

Other research needs have been summarised in table 2.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^115pcFcP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) — general treatment approach — an algorithm presents anti-inflammatory treatments in parallel with dilation for fibrostenotic disease, and both aspects should be assessed and treated in all patients; in dysphagia with stenosis or narrow-caliber esophagus, dilation can be performed, and if dysphagia persists despite objective treatment response, dilation could be considered. For anti-inflammatory therapy, the initial choice is between pharmacologic or dietary elimination, and because there are no comparative efficacy studies, shared decision-making should be used; if medication is selected, either PPIs or STCs could be used and the authors favor using a single anti-inflammatory agent, whereas for diet they favor starting with less-restrictive options, a 1-food elimination diet (1FED) or 2FED. Endoscopy with biopsies should be performed in 8–12 weeks to assess response, with continuation, possible dose reduction, and monitoring including endoscopy and biopsy if there is a good response; because EoE is chronic with no known cure, treatment should be continued long term. If there is nonresponse to pharmacologic treatment, dilation would be considered; if there is nonresponse to dietary elimination, a more-restrictive diet could be considered or the patient could switch to pharmacologic options, and clinical trials can be considered for nonresponsive patients; cost and insurance should be considered, dupilumab can be considered earlier when other atopic indications are present, and referral for adjunctive behavioral interventions is warranted particularly in children with concern for feeding dysfunction.

### Scientific journey to the first FDA-approved drug for eosinophilic esophagitis [^113Te8Qq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

When eosinophilia was first associated with esophagitis, it was thought to reflect gastroesophageal reflux disease, especially given the efficacy of reflux medications to abate esophageal eosinophilia in many individuals. Subsequent studies demonstrated disease remittance with amino acid-based formulas and conversely induction of esophageal eosinophilia in mice following allergen challenge. These results, along with the finding that proton pump inhibitors alleviated esophageal eosinophilia by an anti-inflammatory mechanism, turned attention away from an acid-induced pathogenesis and established eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) as a separate disease entity driven by allergic inflammation. The disease underpinnings were elucidated by analysis of esophageal transcriptomic profiling, revealing gene signatures orchestrated by type 2 cytokine signaling, mainly IL-13. Preclinical studies showed that IL-13 overproduction was sufficient to induce EoE-like changes in mice and human ex vivo systems and conversely that inhibiting IL-13 signaling attenuated these processes. An early proof-of-principle study with a humanized anti-IL-13 mAb in patients with EoE revealed correction of the EoE transcriptome and attenuation of esophageal eosinophilia, providing a rationale for advancing anti-type 2 cytokine therapy for EoE. Dupilumab, a precision therapeutic mAb that blocks the shared IL-13 and IL-4 receptor, is the first drug to advance through clinical trials and receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for EoE. The ability of dupilumab to improve clinical, histologic, endoscopic, and molecular features of EoE and garner US Food and Drug Administration approval is a victory for science, rare diseases, patients, and advocacy and provides a framework for developing additional EoE treatments and approved treatments for eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease beyond the esophagus.

### Italian eoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^114D3rhK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and objective

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, progressive T-helper type 2-mediated inflammatory disorder of the esophagus, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of eosinophils in the esophageal epithelium. If left untreated, EoE can progress to fibrostenotic lesions, up to the development of esophageal strictures. The etiopathogenesis of EoE is multifactorial, involving a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, immunological responses to antigenic and environmental factors. The clinical presentation is often heterogeneous and shows age-dependent characteristics that include a broad spectrum of symptoms: failure to thrive in the youngest children, vomiting in older children, abdominal pain in young adolescents, dysphagia and food impaction, retrosternal pain, and manifestations mimicking gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in older adolescents and adults. All these features make EoE diagnosis quite challenging. – Patients with EoE have substantially impaired quality of life (QoL), with several social and psychological implications of food-related illness.

The diagnosis of EoE requires an integrated analysis of the patient's clinical history in the context of a proper endoscopic and histological evaluation in a multidisciplinary setting with gastroenterologists, pathologists, allergists, and pediatric specialists' involvement. Current treatment schedules include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), topical corticosteroids (TCS), exclusion of trigger foods (elimination diets), and, in specific cases, esophageal dilation.

It is necessary to underline that currently in Europe there are no in-label conventional treatments for EoE in pediatric population (< 12 years old), which leads to off-label use of medications for these patients,: in this age group (1–11 years old, weighing ⩾15 kg), only biological therapy (Dupilumab) has been investigated and more recently received positive opinion by EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). For European adolescents and adults, approved treatments include TCS, such as budesonide in orodispersible formulation (Jorveza in EU for people ⩾18 years old), and Dupilumab (⩾12 years old). Moreover, in February 2024, budesonide oral suspension (Eohilia™; Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S. A. Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with EoE aged ⩾11 years, based on the data from ORBIT1 and NCT01642212.

### Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study [^1152oa65]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

In part A, 42 patients were randomised to dupilumab once a week and 39 to placebo; in part B, 80 patients were randomised to dupilumab once a week, 81 to dupilumab every 2 weeks and 79 to placebo. Thirty-seven patients from part A switched from placebo to dupilumab and 40 continued dupilumab (part A–C); 37 patients from part B switched from placebo to dupilumab once a week and 37 to dupilumab every 2 weeks; 74 continued dupilumab once a week and 79 continued dupilumab every 2 weeks (part B–C).

The proportions of patients with a history of prior STC use were 74% in part A and 70% in part B. Demographics and disease characteristics of patients with and without prior STC use are shown in table 1 and online supplemental table 1 and were generally similar between subgroups.

Primary endpoints

With/without prior STC use

Dupilumab increased the proportion of patients achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤ 6 eos/hpf versus placebo at week 24 in both patients with prior STC use (52% dupilumab vs 0% placebo, p < 0.0001, and 64% vs 5%, p < 0.0001 in parts A and B, respectively) and patients without prior STC use (77% vs 25%, p < 0.05 and 48% vs 9%, p < 0.01, respectively) (figure 1A). In both subgroups, after the 28-week extension period (week 52) the proportion of patients achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤ 6 eos/hpf was either maintained (part A–C) or further increased (part B–C) from week 24 in patients receiving continuous dupilumab and increased for the patients who switched from placebo to dupilumab at week 24 (figure 1B). Similar results were observed with dupilumab every 2 weeks treatment (online supplemental figure 1A).

### Assessment of real-world disease severity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States [^116c4f9u]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Following diagnosis, first-, second-, and third-line treatment options for EoE were independent of EoE disease severity. The treatments used aligned with the AGA/JTF 2020 clinical guidelines for EoE management, which strongly recommended topical corticosteroids over no treatment and conditionally recommended PPIs as primary pharmacologic choices. However, a greater proportion of patients received PPIs than topical corticosteroids first-line, despite this difference in strength of recommendation in the clinical practice guidelines available at the time. This could be related to the ease of administration, access to and/or familiarity with PPIs, or a lack of availability of compounding pharmacies for preparation of topical corticosteroids. Furthermore, although not mentioned in the guidelines at the time, histamine-2-receptor blockers were used by approximately 15% of adolescents and adults first-line. However, this result is surprising as there is no evidence to support that this medication class is effective in treating EoE. Systemic corticosteroids were not used first-line but were used in approximately 10%–15% of patients as a second- or third-line treatment option. This may also be considered relatively high when taking into account that topical corticosteroids were recommended over systemic corticosteroids in the clinical practice guidelines. Reasons for this may include patient preference for administration method, concomitant treatment of non-EoE related conditions or, as mentioned, the lack of availability of compounding pharmacies. It should be noted that an update to the EoE clinical guidelines has recently been published. A greater number of treatment lines were used by patients with moderate or severe disease than by those with mild disease, perhaps indicating that initial treatment strategies may need to be tailored to EoE disease severity. Current literature indicate that dupilumab could be used to treat patients with refractory or severe EoE. However, neither dupilumab nor BOS was examined because they were approved by the US FDA after this study was conducted, and after the publication of the current clinical EoE guidelines,–; further studies are needed to assess where on the EoE disease spectrum these treatments are used in the real world.

### Dupilumab improves health-related quality of life and a range of symptoms in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis [^116ryfcy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

In part A, 42 received dupilumab 300 mg qw and 39 placebo. In part B, 80 patients received dupilumab 300 mg qw, 81 dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, and 79 placebo. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar across all trial groups, as detailed previously. EoE-SQ Frequency and Severity total scores and individual item scores, along with EoE-IQ average and individual item scores, were similar between the dupilumab 300 mg qw and placebo groups at baseline (see Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 1, 2, and 3, Supplementary Digital Content 1).

### Study design of the phase IV, randomized, placebo-controlled REMOdeling with dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis long-term (REMODEL) trial [^111PRKPc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

EndoFLIP is not often used in clinical practice, and therefore, standardization of the procedure in patients with EoE is not well established. REMODEL may provide evidence to help standardize this process and support the use of EndoFLIP for patient monitoring, particularly in patients with fibrostenotic disease. Fibrotic remodeling in EoE likely progresses over substantial periods of time, with observational data indicating that increased EoE duration is directly correlated with a fibrostenotic phenotype. Clinically significant fibrostenosis may therefore take longer to develop than the study duration, limiting potential conclusions regarding disease modification. In addition, stipulating evidence of dysphagia as an eligibility criterion limits the study population to patients who likely have established fibrostenotic disease. Although this population is likely to derive treatment benefit, this may preclude assessment of dupilumab in preventing the initial stages of fibrostenotic progression. Data collected during the extended treatment period may be influenced by open-label bias, particularly in PROs. However, evidence suggests that the potential for bias should not prevent the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment effects.

### Dupilumab provides acceptable safety and sustained efficacy for up to 4 years in an open-label study of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^112n5K9D]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Concomitant treatments for AD, including TCSs and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), were permitted, although use of SCSs and nonsteroidal systemic immunosuppressive medications (including phototherapy) as rescue medications required temporary discontinuation from the study treatment for the duration of rescue treatment and for five half-lives of the rescue treatment. Following Protocol Amendment 7 (June 2, 2017), patients were not required to temporarily discontinue study treatment following rescue treatment with SCSs. Originally, the planned study duration per patient was up to 3 years of dupilumab treatment or until regulatory approval of dupilumab in the patient's enrollment country, whichever came first. The study duration was later amended to 5 years in Protocol Amendment 8 (January 8, 2018), allowing some patients to re-enter the study and resume dupilumab treatment at week 156 following a treatment interruption. Protocol amendment history has been reported in greater detail previously.

Ethics

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Council for Harmonisation guideline, good clinical practice, and local applicable regulatory requirements, including institutional review board approval. All patients provided written informed consent before any study procedures began.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and British society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (BSPGHAN) joint consensus guidelines on the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic oesophagitis in children and adults [^116cFS23]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

The anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody cendakimab (RPC4046) has also been studied in phase 2 trials. In 99 adults in a 16-week trial, there was a significant reduction in mean eosinophil count and dysphagia scores. This was also true in steroid refractory cases (n = 47). A phase-3 multicentre study is underway (CC-93538) to evaluate its use for induction and maintenance treatment.

Other targets such as the IL-5 pathway may be important in the management of EoE. The anti-IL5 agent, mepolizumab was studied in a randomised, placebo controlled double blind trialand found to show a 54% reduction in oesophageal eosinophil count compared with controls (5%), p = 0.03, although symptom improvement was not demonstrated.

The anti-IL5 receptor monoclonal antibody, benralizumab has also been demonstrated to be efficacious for the treatment of eosinophilic asthmaand thus a potential candidate for patient management. There have been cases reported of EoE in patients with eosinophilic asthma in whom benralizumab was prescribed for the asthma but also resulted in complete resolution of dysphagia symptoms and histological evidence of deep remission. Benralizumab use in patients with hypereosinophilic disorder in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled phase-2 study resulted in significant lowering of eosinophil count in both serum as well as tissuewith 74% of patients having sustained response at 48 weeks, and no adverse events limiting treatment.

The phase 3 trial MESSINA, evaluating the use of benralizumab in patients with EoE will add further to the understanding of whether IL-5 inhibition can help both symptomatic and histological response at week 24.

In the absence of randomised controlled trial data in EoE alone, the GDG cannot currently recommend the use of dupilumab, cendakimab or benralizumab, but they may be treatment options in patients with coexisting allergic diseases. Pending the results of further studies, these drugs do show promise as future treatment options (figure 3).

### Study design of the phase IV, randomized, placebo-controlled REMOdeling with dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis long-term (REMODEL) trial [^113L6HKi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are limited data on how effective therapies may be at preventing fibrotic remodeling of the esophagus in EoE. In a phase II study, compared with placebo, dupilumab was associated with increased esophageal distensibility at 12 weeks, measured by EndoFLIP in an exploratory endpoint. However, there is a need for more data to determine the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing inflammation and preventing and/or reducing fibrostenosis over longer treatment periods. The REMOdeling with Dupilumab in Eosinophilic esophagitis Long-term (REMODEL) trial aims to assess the long-term efficacy of dupilumab, including its impact on esophageal function and remodeling, in adult patients with EoE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06101095). The primary objective of REMODEL is to assess the efficacy of dupilumab in improving the esophageal distensibility plateau. The secondary objectives of the study include determining the long-term effect of dupilumab on esophageal function and histologic, endoscopic, and molecular features of EoE.

### Study design of the phase IV, randomized, placebo-controlled REMOdeling with dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis long-term (REMODEL) trial [^116RBRfv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal distensibility, measured by endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP), identifies esophageal fibrostenotic changes and is impaired in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Early-phase clinical trials suggested dupilumab could increase esophageal distensibility. However, there are limited data on the long-term impact of dupilumab treatment on fibrostenosis.

Objectives

To evaluate the long-term efficacy of dupilumab, including its impact on esophageal fibrostenotic progression, in adult patients with EoE.

Design

The phase IV study is comprised of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial period for 24weeks, followed by an open-label extension for 104weeks.

Methods and Analysis

In total, 69 adult patients with endoscopically and histologically active EoE have been recruited from 30 global sites and randomized 2:1 to receive dupilumab 300mg once weekly (qw) or placebo during the double-blind treatment period. Eligible patients continuing into the open-label extension period will receive dupilumab 300mg qw. The primary endpoint is absolute change from baseline in esophageal distensibility plateau at week (W)24 measured by EndoFLIP. Secondary endpoints include change in esophageal distensibility plateau at W76 and W128; histologic, endoscopic, and molecular features of EoE at W24, W76, and W128; and long-term safety. After the double-blind treatment period, endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics.

Ethics

REMODEL will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences international ethical guidelines, and the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by an institutional review board before study initiation.

Discussion

REMODEL will address whether long-term dupilumab treatment can mitigate fibrostenotic progression in patients with EoE and may provide new insights into the roles of interleukin-4 and -13 in the pathophysiology and progression of EoE.

Trial Registration

All patients will provide informed consent. REMODEL was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06101095) on October 19, 2023.

### Current state of biologics in treating eosinophilic esophagitis [^112QmBNu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, allergen-mediated, eosinophil-predominant, type 2 inflammatory disease that progresses to fibrostenosis of the esophagus if left untreated. This review focuses on biologics therapy in EoE.

Data Sources

Manuscripts on EoE treatments are identified on PubMed.

Study Selections

Original research, randomized controlled trials, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, case series, and case reports of high relevance are selected and reviewed.

Results

Biologics have been used as investigational therapies for EoE in clinical studies over the years, based on earlier work that identified key cytokines and mediators of eosinophilic inflammation and, more recently, type 2 inflammation that underlie EoE pathogenesis. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin (IL)-4Rα chain, thereby interfering with IL-4 and IL-13 binding with the receptor, was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for EoE. Dupilumab improved clinical symptoms, endoscopic scores, histologic inflammation, and esophageal distensibility. Several clinical trials that target key cytokines such as IL-5, IL-13, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in EoE are still ongoing.

Conclusion

Topical corticosteroid, proton pump inhibitor therapy, elimination diet, and dilation are widely accepted treatment modalities for EoE. Dupilumab is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for EoE. Other studies evaluating biologics that target eosinophils, key cytokines, and inflammatory pathways in EoE are ongoing. Treatment algorithms are needed to position EoE therapies as they emerge.

With/without prior STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication

Treatment with dupilumab increased the proportion of patients achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤ 6 eos/hpf versus placebo both in patients with (55% vs 8%, p < 0.0001) and in patients without (62% vs 5%, p < 0.0001) STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication at week 24 (figure 1C). In both subgroups, the proportion of patients achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤ 6 eos/hpf further increased between week 24 and week 52 for the patients receiving continuous dupilumab treatment (83% with and 86% without) and increased in patients who switched from placebo to dupilumab at week 24 (70% with and 65% without). Similar results were observed with dupilumab every 2 weeks treatment (online supplemental figure 1B).

Dupilumab treatment also improved the DSQ scores versus treatment with placebo through week 24 both in patients with (−12.10 (−19.66 to –4.53)) and in patients without (−7.31 (−13.90 to −0.73)) prior STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication (figure 2C and online supplemental figure 2C,3C). In both subgroups, the DSQ score further improved between week 24 and week 52 for the patients receiving continuous dupilumab (absolute change (SD) change with −33.32 (15.55), without −27.98 (15.12)) and improved in patients who switched from placebo to dupilumab (with −24.94 (11.88), without −29.20 (11.18)) (figure 2D and online supplemental figure 2D,4C). Similar to patients with and without prior STC use, the DSQ scores of patients treated with dupilumab every 2 weeks did not improve versus those receiving placebo at week 24 or to the same extent as those receiving dupilumab once a week through week 52 (online supplemental figures 5B, 6B and 8).

### Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study [^111KHijk]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of long-term dupilumab on histological, symptomatic and endoscopic aspects of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) in adolescent and adult patients with and without prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids (STC) or prior inadequate response, intolerance or contraindication to STC.

Design

Pre-specified analysis of data from the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study on patients who received dupilumab 300 mg once a week or placebo for 24 weeks (W24) in parts A and B, and an additional 28 weeks (W52) in part C. Patients were categorised as with/without prior STC use and with/without inadequate/intolerance/contraindication to STC. The proportion of patients achieving ≤ 6 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf), absolute change in Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score, mean change in Endoscopic Reference Score and Histologic Scoring System grade/stage scores were assessed for each subgroup.

Results

Regardless of prior STC use, dupilumab increased the proportion of patients achieving ≤ 6 eos/hpf and improved DSQ score versus placebo at W24, with improvements maintained or improved at W52. The DSQ score and the proportion of patients achieving ≤ 6 eos/hpf after switching from placebo to dupilumab at W24 were similar to those observed in the dupilumab group at W24, regardless of prior STC use or inadequate/intolerance/contraindication to STC. Improvements in other outcomes with dupilumab were similar in patients with/without prior STC use or inadequate/intolerance/contraindication to STC.

Conclusion

Dupilumab 300 mg once a week demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated in patients with EoE regardless of prior STC use or inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to STC.

### Efficacy of dupilumab on facilitated food reintroduction in eosinophilic esophagitis [^111yCK7C]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, type 2 inflammatory disease of the esophagus commonly triggered by food allergens. Eliminating dietary EoE trigger foods can effectively treat EoE in some cases, but maintaining adherence can be challenging and can reduce quality of life. We aimed to assess the efficacy of dupilumab on reintroducing these foods based on clinical outcomes in patients with EoE.

Methods

We conducted an open-label pilot study in which patients aged 6 to 25 years with EoE induced by milk, egg, soy, or wheat were treated with weight- and age-tiered dupilumab for 3 months, followed by standardized reintroduction of trigger foods at months 3, 6, and 9, while continuing on dupilumab treatment. Symptoms, histology, endoscopy, and esophageal diameter were compared prior to and following every phase of food reintroduction to month 12. All patients had previously failed trigger food reintroduction on their current EoE medication.

Results

Twenty-one patients were enrolled. All patients who completed the study were able to reintroduce at least one serving size of trigger foods by month 12 and eight patients were able to add foods every 3 months. There was no worsening of any clinical outcome including symptoms, histology, and esophageal diameter. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events.

Conclusion

Patients with EoE treated with dupilumab were able to safely reintroduce EoE trigger foods into their diet without exacerbation of histologic, endoscopic, or symptomatic measures of EoE severity. Some patients were able to reintroduce food at an earlier timepoint than others. (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05247866).

### Development of a core outcome set for therapeutic studies in eosinophilic esophagitis (COREOS) [^114DWKiB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterized histologically by esophageal eosinophil–predominant inflammation and clinically by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Since its initial description in the early 1990s, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of EoE; prevalence rates from population-based studies estimate that approximately 50 to 100 per 100,000 persons are affected. The diagnosis of EoE is based on both symptoms consistent with esophageal dysfunction, particularly dysphagia in adolescents and adults, and the presence of histologic inflammation, defined as a peak eosinophil count (PEC) of ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf), with exclusion of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia. Untreated EoE can progress to the development of fibrostenotic complications such as strictures and endoscopically impassable rings, which are associated with progressive symptoms, food impaction, and poor quality of life (QoL). –

Consensus treatment recommendations for EoE have historically included: (1) elimination diets that restrict exposure to potential food allergens, (2) endoscopic dilation for fibrostenotic complications, (3) proton pump inhibitors, and (4) swallowed topical corticosteroids that reduce eosinophilic inflammation. However, these approaches have inherent limitations. Patients must adhere to substantial lifestyle changes for dietary strategies to be effective, dilation carries procedural risks and does not address the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology, and proton pump inhibitors are not effective in all EoE patients. A lack of approved esophageal-specific formulations in many jurisdictions, potential treatment-related adverse effects, and short duration of efficacy limit the potential of using swallowed topical corticosteroids in the long term for managing a chronic disease that almost universally recurs after treatment cessation. – Accordingly, there has been tremendous interest in developing EoE-specific pharmacotherapies, with over 50 active or enrolling interventional studies for the treatment of EoE registered at. Furthermore, recent positive results from phase 3 trials of dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4 receptor alpha, budesonide orodispersible tablets as both induction and maintenance therapy, and budesonide oral suspension have inspired even greater enthusiasm for drug development in this field. –

### Paternal and maternal use of dupilumab in patients with atopic dermatitis: a case series [^116XBvBu]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Two previous case reports have been published on dupilumab in pregnancy and lactation. The first case concerned a patient who discontinued dupilumab at 2 weeks of gestation, followed by reintroduction at 20 weeks. In the second case dupilumab was initiated at 24 weeks of gestation, in addition to treatment with prednisone. Both patients delivered a healthy baby, without complications, at 40 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. The first patient breastfed her infant while receiving dupilumab, during an uncomplicated observation period of 4 months.

It is unknown whether dupilumab is excreted in breast milk or whether systemic absorption occurs after ingestion. Because dupilumab is a large protein molecule, the amount in breast milk is expected to be low, and absorption is unlikely because it is probably destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract. However, the molecule size does not prevent placental transfer.

The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for dupilumab indicates that it is preferable to avoid the drug in pregnancy, unless a physician advises it and only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks. In addition, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or dupilumab, taking into account the benefits for mother and child. The SmPC does not mention any restrictions for men taking dupilumab who wish to father a child.

The European Task force on Atopic Dermatitis advises avoiding dupilumab by pregnant or breastfeeding women until there is more experience. They report that there is no literature on men taking dupilumab who wish to father a child, and that theoretically there could be a transfer of dupilumab to the seminal fluid. For both sexes, preference is given to treatment with topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, systemic corticosteroids, ciclosporin and, only in select cases, azathioprine, if a child is desired. Owing to the lack of evidence, guidelines recommend avoiding dupilumab during pregnancy and lactation. Absolute contraindications exists for treatments such as methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. Similarly to dupilumab, there are few human data available for emergent treatments such as Janus kinase inhibitors and other biologics, resulting in negative recommendations for use during conception and pregnancy.

### Dupilumab efficacy in children with eosinophilic esophagitis with prior swallowed topical corticosteroid use: a subgroup analysis [^115RCv1o]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Swallowed topical corticosteroids (STCs) are commonly used to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE); however, not all patients respond, and others may be intolerant or have contraindications. We assessed dupilumab efficacy in children with EoE with prior STC use, and with prior inadequate response/intolerance/contraindication (IRIC) to STCs in the phase 3 EoE KIDS study.

Methods

Eligible patients were aged 1–11 years with EoE unresponsive to proton-pump inhibitors. In Part A, patients were randomized to weight-tiered higher- or lower-exposure dupilumab, or placebo up to Week (W)16. In Part B, dupilumab groups continued treatment, while patients receiving placebo switched to higher- or lower-exposure dupilumab through W52. Efficacy by prior STC status was assessed at W16 and W52.

Results

Of 102 patients, 82 (80%) received prior STCs and 59 (58%) had prior IRIC to STCs. At W16, higher-exposure dupilumab improved rates of histologic remission vs placebo in patients with prior STC use (60.7% vs 0.0%, nominal P < 0.0001) and prior IRIC to STCs (60.9% vs 0.0%, nominal P < 0.0001). Secondary endoscopic and histologic outcomes were similar. Responses were maintained at W52 with higher-exposure dupilumab, with improvements observed in patients who switched from placebo to higher-exposure dupilumab. Results were similar or numerically lower with lower-exposure dupilumab. Findings appeared comparable in those without prior STC use or prior IRIC, although patient numbers were small. Dupilumab safety was consistent with the known safety profile.

Discussion

Dupilumab may be an effective treatment in children with EoE with prior STC use, or prior IRIC to STCs.

### Study design of the phase IV, randomized, placebo-controlled REMOdeling with dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis long-term (REMODEL) trial [^113NSHbL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by esophageal eosinophilia and symptoms associated with esophageal dysfunction, and is rising in incidence and prevalence. EoE is driven by type 2 inflammation, a specific immune response involving pro-fibrotic and homeostatic signaling via the key type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-33, and the actions of activated mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and pro-fibrotic macrophages. If left untreated, persistent uncontrolled type 2 inflammation contributes to pathologic fibrosis and epithelial remodeling, – leading to the development of a fibrostenotic EoE phenotype. – Fibrostenosis causes the clinical manifestations and complications of EoE, including dysphagia, strictures, and food impactions, that can significantly impact patients' quality of life (QoL).

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^112hS8Je]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is recognized as a chronic type 2 inflammatory disease characterized by the eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal tissue, posing a significant disease burden and highlighting the necessity for novel management strategies to address unmet clinical needs.

Objectives:

To critically evaluate the existing literature on the epidemiology and management of EoE, identify evidence gaps, and assess the efficacy of current and emerging treatment modalities.

Design:

An extensive literature review was conducted, focusing on the epidemiological trends, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic interventions for EoE. This was complemented by a survey among physicians and consultations with a scientific expert panel, including a patient's association (ESEO Italia), to enrich the study findings.

Data sources and methods:

The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, scrutinizing epidemiological studies and management research to compile comprehensive insights into the disease's landscape. The physician survey and expert panel discussions aimed to bridge identified evidence gaps.

Results:

The review included 59 epidemiological and 51 management studies, uncovering variable incidence and prevalence rates of EoE globally, with an estimated diagnosed prevalence of 41 per 100,000 in Italy. Diagnostic challenges were identified, including nonspecific symptoms and the lack of definitive biomarkers, which complicate the use of endoscopy. Treatment options such as elimination diets, proton-pump inhibitors, and swallowed corticosteroids were found to have varying success rates, while Dupilumab, an emerging therapy targeting interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, shows promise.

Conclusion:

Despite advancements in understanding and managing EoE, significant unmet clinical needs remain, particularly in biomarker identification, therapy personalization, and cost-effectiveness evaluation. A comprehensive, multidimensional approach to patient management is required, emphasizing the importance of early symptom recognition, accurate diagnosis, and tailored treatment strategies. Dupilumab offers potential as a novel treatment, underscoring the need for future research to explore the economic and social dimensions of EoE care pathways.

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^1131up9J]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Dupilumab is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4Rα subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor.

Inflammation driven by IL-4 and IL-13 is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma, AD, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, COPD, CSU, and BP. Multiple cell types that express IL-4Rα (e.g., mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, goblet cells) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines) are involved in inflammation. Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced inflammatory responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE. The mechanism of dupilumab action has not been definitively established.

### The emerging role of dupilumab in dermatological indications [^117La5Ti]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupilumab represents a breakthrough in the management of atopic dermatitis (AD), thanks to its powerful T-helper (Th)2-mediated immunity modulating activity. It can reduce the atopic skin molecular signature and induce a significant decrease in the clinical signs and symptoms of AD patients.

Areas Covered

Th2 activation has been confirmed or suspected in skin diseases other than AD, and several reports about the treatment with dupilumab in these conditions have been published. In order to review the new indications of dupilumab in dermatology, we performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Skin databases, and clinicaltrials.gov.

Expert Opinion

The analysis of available literature suggests that dupilumab may have a large application in dermatology, besides AD. Clinical trials are underway on some widespread disease (i.e. chronic urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, alopecia areata, or allergic contact dermatitis). The data are still partial, but they seem to indicate that dupilumab is efficacious and safe. On the other hand, the dupilumab use in some rare skin diseases remains only hypothetical or linked to few case reports. Dupilumab could have a prominent position in the therapeutic algorithm of chronic skin diseases that significantly affect the quality of life of patients, require long-term treatment, or lacking effective therapies.

Endoscopic severity (EREFS)

At week 24, dupilumab-treated patients (figure 4A) had lower EREFS score versus placebo regardless of prior STC use in both parts A and B. From week 24 to week 52 (figure 4B), EREFS scores further improved (decreased) in patients who continued dupilumab and improved in patients who switched from placebo to dupilumab at week 24, regardless of prior STC use. Similar results were observed in patients treated with dupilumab every 2 weeks (online supplemental figure 10A).

Figure 4
Absolute change in EREFS total score from baseline part A or B with or without use of prior STC at (A) week 24 and (B) week 52, and with or without inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to STC to (C) week 24 and (D) week 52. EREFS, Endoscopic Reference Score; LS, least squares; qw, once a week; STC, swallowed topical corticosteroids.

Dupilumab decreased the EREFS scores versus placebo both in patients with and in patients without a history of inadequate response to STC at week 24 (figure 4C). From week 24 to week 52 (figure 4D), patients who switched from placebo to dupilumab at week 24 improved their EREFS scores to levels close to those of patients who were continuously on dupilumab, regardless of STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication. Similar results were observed in patients treated with dupilumab every 2 weeks (online supplemental figure 10B).

### Roads to remission: evolving treatment concepts in type 2 inflammatory diseases [^115DmZrP]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Less common type 2 inflammatory diseases: eosinophilic esophagitis as an example

Remission concepts are currently gaining attention in less common type 2 inflammatory diseases, too. One example is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Current estimates suggest that the prevalence of EoE is about 0.1% in general populations (with large variations across countries and age groups). EoE is associated with type 2 inflammation (and often type 2 comorbidities), an impaired mucosal barrier (leading to tissue remodeling and progressive organ dysfunction) and symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, feeding intolerance (younger patients) or heartburn, dysphagia and food impactions (adults). Recent trials, have not only shown that a biologic (dupilumab) can be more effective than traditional options (e.g. food allergen avoidance, use of swallowed corticosteroids) in EoE, but have also introduced the concept of remission in EoE, which will be explored in future clinical trials.

Peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count

Dupilumab treatment resulted in a greater percentage decrease from baseline in peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 24 versus placebo (figure 3A) in both patients with and patients without prior STC use. Regardless of prior STC use, at week 52 (figure 3B), the percentage change from baseline (parts A or B) in peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of patients continuously on dupilumab further increased from week 24 and increased in patients who switched from placebo to dupilumab to levels similar to those observed for patients continuously on dupilumab. Similar results were observed in patients treated with dupilumab every 2 weeks (online supplemental figure 9A).

The percentage change from baseline in peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 24 improved (decreased) with dupilumab versus placebo both in patients with STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication and those without STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication (figure 3C). At week 52, continuous dupilumab treatment further improved the percentage change in peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from week 24, and switch from placebo to dupilumab at week 24 improved the percentage change in peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count to levels similar to patients who received dupilumab continuously, regardless of prior inadequate response to STC (figure 3D). Similar results were observed in patients treated with dupilumab every 2 weeks (online supplemental figure 9B).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113m112B]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis long-term control — Relapse and maintenance rates are described alongside durability of medical therapy. Reported relapse included 78% histologic relapse (> 15 eos/hpf) by 1 year and 94% with some eosinophilic infiltration on biopsy. For PPI therapy, in both children and adults, 70%–85% can maintain PPI response at 1 year, with a 69% remission rate after at least 6 months in the EoE CONNECT database and more than 60% of adults maintaining histologic and symptom responses at a mean follow-up time of 3.6 years. For biologics, dupilumab showed continued histologic, endoscopic, and symptom efficacy through 52 weeks, with some cases having higher response rates at 52 weeks than at 24 weeks. Regarding steroid dosing, some data suggest that every other day dosing may not be effective.

### Eczematous liraglutide eruption managed by dupilumab: a case report [^114sQtok]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The case report highlights a potential adverse reaction to liraglutide, an antidiabetic medication increasingly prescribed for its efficacy in managing type 2 diabetes and obesity. Despite its benefits, this case underscores the necessity for clinicians to be vigilant about potential side effects of this GLP-1 receptor agonist. While gastrointestinal issues are the most common side effects, dermatological reactions, though less frequent, can significantly impact patient quality of life.

A review of 33 identified patients revealed several types of cutaneous reactions: dermal hypersensitivity reactions 33.3%, eosinophilic panniculitis 30.3%, bullous pemphigoid 9.1%, morbilliform drug eruptions 6.1%, and angioedema 6.1%.

Liraglutide was implicated in 6 cases, with exenatide extended-release being the most commonly associated GLP-1 agonist (57.6%). Most patients (30 of 33) recovered completely, although 3 reports did not provide outcome details. Permanent discontinuation of the offending agent was common, with 2 patients undergoing successful desensitization.

In this case, the patient developed a severe pruritic rash shortly after initiating liraglutide therapy, suggesting a temporal relationship between the drug administration and the onset of symptoms. The rapid development of symptoms postadministration raises the likelihood of liraglutide being the causative agent. It appears that the reaction to the drug triggered a kind of eczematization in the patient, which was partially and transiently improved by prednisone. However, upon tapering off prednisone, the severe pruritus and some eczematous lesions reappeared. These symptoms were only resolved through the action of dupilumab, which was able to interrupt the inflammatory pathway activated by the drug-induced rash.

The treatment approach in this case involved the off-label use of dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor alpha antagonist primarily indicated for atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab has shown effectiveness in managing severe pruritus associated with various dermatological conditions due to its ability to inhibit key inflammatory pathways. For example, dupilumab has been used off-label to control generalized granuloma annulareand to treat uremic pruritus, according to the experience of Silverberg JI et al. In general, it is a valuable ally against chronic pruritus. In this scenario, dupilumab not only reduced the intense itching but also accelerated the resolution of the rash, demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic option in managing adverse cutaneous reactions to medications like liraglutide.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in children: a multicenter study evaluating current practices in Mexico [^1179gn3y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, the process of population identification within the Mexican demographic is highlighted; García-Compeán et aland De la Cruz-Patiño et aloffer significant insights. In the adult population, we would anticipate a significantly larger prevalence, estimated at 1.5% to 4%, yet the actual incidence remains below 1%. This discrepancy may be attributed to the chronic and progressive nature of the disease, resulting in limited initial clinical data within the pediatric demographic, thereby contributing to a notably low national incidence rate. Alternatively, it may reflect a lack of awareness among health care professionals regarding the disease during pediatric consultations, complicating the patient's journey to receive appropriate care. Consequently, cases of EoE may not be recognized or suspected by primary care physicians, leading to referrals to subspecialists, secondary care, or specialized centers with clinical allergists/immunologists, which hinders early disease identification. Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge that even in reports including adults, early gastrointestinal symptoms did not manifest comprehensively. This indicates that the Mexican population generally presents at later ages, notwithstanding the restricted coverage of these reports, which are either monocentric or regional.

Ultimately, dupilumab has shown effectiveness as a therapeutic approach for EoE, yielding both clinical alleviation and histologic remission. This finding considerably enhances the growing evidence for the efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of EoE, as demonstrated in recent clinical studies. Dupilumab exhibits therapeutic promise by efficiently suppressing the inflammatory activity mediated by type 2 interleukins, which are implicated in the pathophysiology of EoE and other associated disorders.

In Mexico, dupilumab has not yet been approved by national regulatory agencies to treat EoE. Its off-label prescription presents a compelling perspective, suggesting that patients with EoE and concomitant atopic diseases, such as severe T2D, may possibly benefit from the early introduction of dupilumab. This method may enhance the integration of medical therapies, thereby improving the overall management plan. Consistent clinical and histologic improvements highlight the potential for a significantly more effective and safer treatment option for affected individuals. This potential is especially encouraging compared to the limited effectiveness and associated adverse effects of current treatment methods, which frequently detrimentally affect the quality of life of these individuals — even more so when there are already reports that the effect persists even after suspension of biological therapy.

### Study design of the phase IV, randomized, placebo-controlled REMOdeling with dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis long-term (REMODEL) trial [^116rxYeC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

REMODEL is a parallel-group, phase IV study that consists of a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by an open-label period during which all patients receive dupilumab for 104 weeks. Previous phase III dupilumab clinical studies established the link between treating type 2 inflammation and achieving durable (up to 52 weeks) improvements in histologic, symptomatic, endoscopic, and molecular (transcriptomic) features of EoE.REMODEL aims to address an important data gap — that is, to explore whether long-term treatment of type 2 inflammation potentially modifies fibrostenotic progression of EoE. Addressing this data gap could have implications for whether treatment could prevent or modify overall EoE disease progression.

Esophageal eosinophilia often does not correlate with symptoms or endoscopic features of EoE, including esophageal distensibility, nor is it a predictor for the development of clinical complications. A more comprehensive evaluation of EoE beyond eosinophil counts to determine disease extent and response to treatment is therefore required. In addition to its application in research, EndoFLIP has the potential to provide valuable clinical information in EoE. Decreased esophageal distensibility, as measured by EndoFLIP, has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of clinical complications, including food impaction and the requirement for dilation in patients with EoE. As a measure of fibrostenotic disease, EndoFLIP may provide information relevant to risks for clinical complications that have been shown to directly impact patient QoL. Demonstrating prevention of fibrostenotic progression and reversal of existing fibrosis in EoE is therefore a key target for long-term management of the disease. Dupilumab has previously been shown to have the potential to reverse fibrosis in EoE, increasing esophageal distensibility in a phase II study. In REMODEL, EndoFLIP will be used to provide a quantitative assessment of esophageal fibrosis and rigidity in response to dupilumab treatment compared with placebo, and may therefore provide novel evidence of an EoE therapy that can reverse and modify disease progression.

### Efficacy of dupilumab in a phase 2 randomized trial of adults with active eosinophilic esophagitis [^114vWfEp]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergen-mediated inflammatory disease with no approved treatment in the United States. Dupilumab, a VelocImmune-derived human monoclonal antibody against the interleukin (IL) 4 receptor, inhibits IL4 and IL13 signaling. Dupilumab is effective in the treatment of allergic, atopic, and type 2 diseases, so we assessed its efficacy and safety in patients with EoE.

Methods

We performed a phase 2 study of adults with active EoE (2 episodes of dysphagia/week with peak esophageal eosinophil density of 15 or more eosinophils per high-power field), from May 12, 2015, through November 9, 2016, at 14 sites. Participants were randomly assigned to groups that received weekly subcutaneous injections of dupilumab (300 mg, n = 23) or placebo (n = 24) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 10 in Straumann Dysphagia Instrument (SDI) patient-reported outcome (PRO) score. We also assessed histologic features of EoE (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count and EoE histologic scores), endoscopically visualized features (endoscopic reference score), esophageal distensibility, and safety.

Results

The mean SDI PRO score was 6.4 when the study began. In the dupilumab group, SDI PRO scores were reduced by a mean value of 3.0 at week 10 compared with a mean reduction of 1.3 in the placebo group (P = 0.0304). At week 12, dupilumab reduced the peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count by a mean 86.8 eosinophils per high-power field (reduction of 107.1%; P < .0001 vs placebo), the EoE-histologic scoring system (HSS) severity score by 68.3% (P < .0001 vs placebo), and the endoscopic reference score by 1.6 (P = 0.0006 vs placebo). Dupilumab increased esophageal distensibility by 18% vs placebo (P < .0001). Higher proportions of patients in the dupilumab group developed injection-site erythema (35% vs 8% in the placebo group) and nasopharyngitis (17% vs 4% in the placebo group).

Conclusions

In a phase 2 trial of patients with active EoE, dupilumab reduced dysphagia, histologic features of disease (including eosinophilic infiltration and a marker of type 2 inflammation), and abnormal endoscopic features compared with placebo. Dupilumab increased esophageal distensibility and was generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT02379052.

### Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study [^114D2tWc]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients

In the LIBERTY EoE TREET study, inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for parts A and B as previously described. Briefly, adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years) and adults (≥ 18 years) with confirmed diagnosis of EoE (peak eosinophil count ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf)) despite 8 weeks of high-dose PPI treatment and a Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score of ≥ 10 at randomisation were eligible. Patients were required to have an STC washout period of 8 weeks. At the screening visit, clinicians categorised patients according to their clinical history of STC. For parts A and B, patients who had previously used STC were categorised as 'with prior STC use' and patients with no previous use as 'without prior STC use'. For part B only, (1) patients for whom STC use for the treatment of EoE was deemed ineffective in relieving EoE symptoms by the clinician were categorised as 'with inadequate response to STC', (2) patients who had to stop effective STC treatment for EoE due to concomitant medical concerns or contraindications or side effect(s) were categorised as 'with intolerance to STC', and (3) patients who never used STC for the treatment of EoE due to concomitant medical concerns, or contraindication (eg, diabetes, immunomodulating treatment) or potential side effect(s) from STC were categorised as 'with contraindication to STC'; all together, these patients were categorised as with or without 'inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to STC'. In this manuscript, an 'inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to treatment with STC' will be stated as 'STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication' to facilitate reading.

Analysis of prior STC use (with/without) included all patients; analysis with STC inadequate/intolerance/contraindication included only patients from parts B and B–C (as data related to this were not collected for part A).

### Dupilumab provides favourable long-term safety and efficacy in children aged ≥ 6 to… [^117EQdav]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

R668‐AD‐1434 (LIBERTY AD PED‐OLE; NCT02612454) is an ongoing, long‐term, OLE phase III study enrolling paediatric patients who participated in previous dupilumab AD trials, including the phase IIa study reported here and a phase III study in children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years (LIBERTY AD PEDS; R668‐AD‐1652) (Figure 1c) (long‐term safety and efficacy data were not available from the phase III study at the time of publication; the phase III study data will be reported in a future manuscript). 13 The aim of the OLE is to assess the long‐term safety and efficacy of dupilumab.

Children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years were included if they had participated in a previous dupilumab study and adequately completed the visits and assessments required per protocol in the previous study. Patients were excluded if they developed a serious adverse event (SAE) or an adverse event (AE) deemed related to dupilumab that presented an unreasonable risk for the patient during the previous study. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously reported. 14 In the OLE study, patients continued to receive their assigned treatment regimen as in the phase IIa study (2 or 4 mg kg −1 administered qw).

Low‐ and mid‐potency topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, or both were allowed at the discretion of the investigator in either study. The use of systemic treatments for AD (systemic immunosuppressants and corticosteroids) was prohibited. If required, rescue treatment could be considered, initially with higher‐potency TCS and then escalated to systemic treatment (corticosteroids or noncorticosteroid immunosuppressants; study treatment discontinuation was required during rescue treatment use). 14

The studies were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline and applicable regulatory requirements. The protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards/ethics committees at all study sites. An independent data monitoring committee monitored patient safety. For all patients, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian and assent was obtained from the patient.

The phase IIa and OLE data presented here only include children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years who participated in both studies. The OLE data is provided for 52 weeks of treatment.

### The safety data of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate ‑ to ‑ severe atopic dermatitis in infants, children, adolescents, and adults [^112MegVh]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a type 2 inflammatory skin disease that affects patients of all ages and can have a profound impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The high burden and chronic systemic nature of type 2 inflammation in moderate-to-severe AD support the need for well-tolerated, long-term systemic treatment. Although nontargeted systemic therapies, including systemic corticosteroids and nonsteroidal immunosuppressants, have been used for moderate-to-severe AD, many are recommended only for short-term treatment in specific populations owing to safety considerations and require routine laboratory testing. For children in particular, many nontargeted systemic therapies are often used off-label and may be associated with impacts on bone mineralization, adrenal suppression, increased risk of infections, and subsequent hospitalizations. Thus, there is a critical need for efficacious systemic treatments that have demonstrated long-term safety profiles.

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, inhibiting signaling of both IL-4 and IL-13, two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases. Dupilumab is currently approved in AD, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis in the United States, and in one or more of these indications in Europe, Japan, and more than 60 countries worldwide. In multiple, phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), dupilumab with or without topical corticosteroids (TCS) versus placebo significantly improved AD signs, symptoms, and quality of life and was well tolerated in infants, adolescents, and adults with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe AD, and in children with severe AD. Improvements in response to dupilumab were sustained up to 5 years of continued treatment in open-label extension (OLE) trials in adults and up to 2 years in adolescents, children, and infants.

This paper provides the most comprehensive analysis of safety data to date from phase 3 RCTs and OLEs of dupilumab for patients aged ≥ 6 months with moderate-to-severe or severe AD. This in-depth overview of the safety profile of dupilumab is based on data from > 6000 patients and > 7000 total patient-years of exposure for multiple dose regimens, including the currently approved regimens. A comprehensive understanding of dupilumab's safety profile is key to appropriate benefit–risk assessments by clinicians and patients.

### Dupilumab improves health-related quality of life and a range of symptoms in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis [^113yV7Kd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Improvements in symptomatic experience and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are among the most important treatment benefits in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We assessed the impact of dupilumab treatment on HRQoL, patients' impression of dysphagia, and symptoms beyond dysphagia in adults/adolescents (≥ 12 years) with EoE in parts A and B of the LIBERTY EoE TREET (NCT03633617) study.

Methods

The EoE Symptom Questionnaire (EoE-SQ; frequency and severity of nondysphagia symptoms), EoE Impact Questionnaire (impact of EoE on HRQoL), and Patient Global Impression of Severity and Patient Global Impression of Change of dysphagia were used to assess the efficacy of weekly dupilumab 300 mg vs placebo.

Results

At week 24, dupilumab reduced EoE-SQ Frequency (least squares mean difference vs placebo [95% confidence interval] part A -1.7 [-2.9, -0.5], part B -1.4 [-2.3, -0.5]; both P < 0.01) and EoE-SQ Severity (part A -2.0 [-3.9, 0.0], P < 0.05, part B -1.5 [-3.0, 0.1], P = 0.07) overall scores, and improved scores across all individual items. Improvement in the dupilumab group was clinically meaningful to patients. Dupilumab also meaningfully improved EoE Impact Questionnaire average scores and improved individual item scores at week 24, particularly emotional and sleep disturbance. More dupilumab-treated patients reported improvement in the Patient Global Impression of Change of dysphagia vs placebo or reported having no symptoms per the Patient Global Impression of Severity of dysphagia at week 24.

Discussion

Dupilumab reduced the impact of EoE on multiple aspects of HRQoL, patients' impression of dysphagia, and frequency and severity of symptoms beyond dysphagia in adults/adolescents with EoE.

### Safety of dupilumab in T2 airways conditions: focus on eosinophilia across trials and real-life evidence [^113oe42Y]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, effectively blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 mediated pathways. Its introduction has represented a significant advancement in the treatment of severe asthma and other Type 2 (T2) conditions, including nasal polyps, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis. To date, Dupilumab has demonstrated optimal efficacy and safety profile.

Areas Covered

The safety profile of dupilumab has been extensively studied, especially for its effects on blood eosinophil count. Transient eosinophil increase during treatment is typically insignificant from a clinical point of view and related to its mechanism of action. Rare cases of hyper-eosinophilia associated with clinical conditions like eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) have been reported. Those cases are often related to the drug's steroid-sparing effect or the natural trajectory of the underlying disease rather than a direct cause-effect relationship with dupilumab.

Expert Opinion

The management of hyper-eosinophilia during dupilumab treatment requires comprehensive diagnostic work-up and strict follow-up monitoring for early detection of systemic disease progression in order to avoid unnecessary discontinuation of an effective treatment. This approach highlights the importance of a personalized treatment.
