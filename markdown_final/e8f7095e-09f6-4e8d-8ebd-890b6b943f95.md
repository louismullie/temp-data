## Question

What dose of prednisone is used to treat highly inflammed skin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prednisone dosing for highly inflamed skin, including when to use systemic steroids, what doses to choose, how to taper, and how to integrate topical therapy and safety monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining "highly inflamed skin" and when systemic therapy is indicated. Then, I should verify the standard prednisone dosing ranges across common dermatologic scenarios. Next, I will examine disease-specific nuances and tapering strategies. After that, I need to check how topical corticosteroids fit alongside or instead of systemic therapy. Finally, I should confirm safety thresholds, monitoring, and special populations before synthesizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "highly inflamed skin" and when systemic glucocorticoids are appropriate, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing. Highly inflamed skin spans severe atopic dermatitis flares, extensive psoriasis, autoimmune blistering diseases, severe drug eruptions including SJS/TEN, and severe immune-related cutaneous toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors; systemic steroids are generally reserved for acute, severe exacerbations unresponsive to optimized topical therapy or when rapid control is required, with guidelines advising against routine systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis except as short-term bridges to steroid-sparing therapy [^116CeFCp].

> I should confirm the standard adult prednisone dosing framework before anchoring on a single number. FDA labeling provides a broad 5–60 mg/day range for several inflammatory dermatoses, including contact dermatitis and exfoliative dermatitis, which sets the outer bounds but lacks disease-specific nuance, so I need to layer guideline-based weight-based dosing on top of that [^113rLNuo] [^113aokPe]. Weight-based dosing of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day is consistently recommended for severe inflammatory dermatoses such as immune checkpoint inhibitor–related rashes and bullous dermatoses, with 1 mg/kg/day commonly used for more extensive or refractory presentations, and tapering over at least 4 weeks to mitigate rebound and adrenal suppression risk [^1167tfbn] [^1111JHtu].

> Hold on, let me verify disease-specific starting doses so I don't overgeneralize. For immune checkpoint inhibitor–related cutaneous toxicities, ASCO recommends 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for grade 2 rashes and 1 mg/kg/day for grade 3–4 rashes or bullous disease, with IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for severe cases, all tapered over at least 4 weeks once controlled [^1167tfbn] [^1111JHtu] [^113KnPQC]. For bullous pemphigoid, European guidance and observational data support 0.5 mg/kg/day as an initial dose, with escalation based on severity and response, and early consideration of steroid-sparing agents to reduce cumulative steroid exposure [^11743rV7]. For pemphigus vulgaris, randomized data show that rituximab combined with short-course prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) improves remission rates and reduces steroid-related adverse events compared with prednisone monotherapy, supporting a lower steroid target when rituximab is used [^116i3BNF]. For severe atopic dermatitis, expert consensus restricts systemic steroids to short-term rescue only, typically 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for brief courses while initiating steroid-sparing therapy, to avoid rebound and long-term harms [^116kTLPy] [^116Y33zD].

> Wait, I should double-check the tapering strategy because abrupt withdrawal is a common pitfall. ASCO guidance specifies tapering systemic corticosteroids over at least 4 weeks for cutaneous immune-related adverse events, and many dermatologic uses align with this minimum, with longer tapers for higher cumulative exposure or prolonged treatment durations; for example, pemphigus protocols often extend tapers to 12–18 months depending on disease control, and chronic steroid use requires individualized tapering to prevent adrenal insufficiency and disease flare [^1167tfbn] [^116i3BNF] [^1117zpjX]. I need to ensure that once prednisone is reduced below about 10 mg/day in the context of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, it is reasonable to consider resuming immunotherapy if the skin toxicity has resolved to grade 1 or less, per ASCO [^1111JHtu].

> Let me consider whether topical therapy could obviate systemic steroids or serve as a bridge, because I should not jump straight to oral prednisone if high-potency topicals can control the inflammation. Multiple analyses show that many ultrapotent topical corticosteroids achieve higher effective skin concentrations than standard oral prednisone doses, and guideline-based topical therapy remains first-line for extensive psoriasis and eczema flares, reserving systemic therapy for refractory or special contexts; weekend proactive therapy reduces relapse in eczema, and short courses of class 1 agents are generally safe when limited to 2–4 weeks with careful monitoring [^113t2yME] [^115RDtSd] [^115UxMcC] [^111Q8jBU]. But wait, what if the disease is too extensive or the patient cannot comply with topical regimens? In those cases, systemic therapy becomes appropriate, and combining approaches can be synergistic while minimizing steroid exposure [^116kTLPy].

> I should confirm safety thresholds and monitoring because prednisone above certain doses carries meaningful risks. High-dose systemic steroids, generally defined as prednisone greater than 20 mg/day, are associated with immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, infection risk, and bone loss, and in oncology populations, doses above 10 mg/day have been linked to worse outcomes independent of indication, underscoring the need to use the lowest effective dose and taper promptly [^notfound]. I need to ensure baseline and follow-up checks include blood pressure, weight, glucose, electrolytes, and infection surveillance, and in prolonged or repeated courses, bone health assessment and ophthalmologic exams are prudent; topical steroids over large areas or with occlusion can rarely cause HPA axis suppression, reinforcing the principle of using the least potent effective agent for the shortest duration [^1117zpjX] [^113qfpde].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts so I don't overapply adult dosing. In children, systemic steroids are generally avoided for atopic dermatitis except for very short rescue courses due to growth suppression and other risks, and pediatric dosing when needed is weight-based with careful tapering; in older adults with bullous pemphigoid, lower starting doses such as 0.5 mg/kg/day are often effective and better tolerated, and in patients facing immunotherapy, minimizing steroid exposure to 10 mg/day or less before initiation is preferred when feasible [^116kTLPy] [^11743rV7] [^1126PDvZ]. For cellulitis in nondiabetic adults, a short adjunctive course of prednisone 40 mg/day for 7 days can hasten clinical improvement when combined with antibiotics, but this is a distinct inflammatory-infectious context and not a generalizable approach to sterile dermatitis [^117V2ULq] [^1129GeAk].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation, but I will keep verifying assumptions as I go. For an adult with highly inflamed skin due to a severe dermatologic disease in whom systemic therapy is indicated, a reasonable starting dose is prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, typically capped at 60 mg/day, with 1 mg/kg/day favored for extensive involvement, bullous disease, or immune-related toxicities; treatment should continue until clear clinical control, often 1–3 weeks, followed by a taper over at least 4 weeks, longer if the course was prolonged or the disease is chronic, while concurrently optimizing high-potency topical therapy and initiating steroid-sparing agents when appropriate [^1167tfbn] [^1111JHtu] [^11743rV7] [^113rLNuo] [^113aokPe]. I should confirm that for atopic dermatitis specifically, systemic steroids are a last resort and should be limited to very short rescue only, given rebound risk and inferior long-term outcomes compared with steroid-sparing systemic therapies [^116kTLPy] [^115ahS9M].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a fixed 40–60 mg/day might suffice across the board, but I should correct that to weight-based dosing because 0.5–1 mg/kg/day better captures interpatient variability and aligns with contemporary guidelines; fixed 40–60 mg/day fits many average-weight adults but under-treats larger patients and over-treats smaller or frail patients, reinforcing the preference for mg/kg-based dosing with clinical judgment applied to the ceiling and taper cadence [^1167tfbn] [^1111JHtu] [^11743rV7].

For highly inflamed skin, use **topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy** [^114WrPkL], selecting potency based on severity and site [^116uNXib]; apply once or twice daily [^115UxMcC] for 1–2 weeks, then taper to the lowest effective dose [^notfound]. For widespread or refractory disease, use **systemic corticosteroids** (prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day) [^1167tfbn] for 2–3 weeks with a gradual taper to avoid rebound [^1111JHtu]. Limit topical use to ≤ 2 weeks on thin skin [^113qfpde] and avoid prolonged systemic use to minimize adverse effects [^116kTLPy] [^111JXAbK].

## Topical corticosteroids: first-line therapy for localized inflammation

Topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment for localized highly inflamed skin [^113LBWjF]. They provide **anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antiproliferative effects**, rapidly reducing erythema, edema, and pruritus [^111hBDpv].

---

### Classification of topical corticosteroids by potency

Topical corticosteroids are classified into seven potency classes, from ultra-high (Class I) to low (Class VII) [^116uNXib]. The **choice of potency** depends on disease severity, lesion thickness, and treatment area [^115RDtSd].

| **Potency class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultra-high (Class I) | - Clobetasol propionate 0.05% <br/> - Halobetasol propionate 0.05% | - Thick, chronic plaques <br/> - Severe psoriasis <br/> - Lichen planus |
| High (Class II) | - Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% <br/> - Fluocinonide 0.05% | - Moderate-to-severe eczema <br/> - Psoriasis <br/> - Seborrheic dermatitis |
| Medium (Class III-V) | - Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% <br/> - Mometasone furoate 0.1% | - Mild-to-moderate eczema <br/> - Dermatitis <br/> - Intertriginous areas |
| Low (Class VI-VII) | - Hydrocortisone 1% <br/> - Desonide 0.05% | - Face <br/> - Intertriginous areas <br/> - Infants <br/> - Thin skin |

---

### Application guidelines

- **Frequency**: Once or twice daily [^115UxMcC]; twice daily may be used initially for severe inflammation, then reduce to once daily as improvement occurs [^notfound].
- **Duration**: Limit continuous use to 1–2 weeks [^notfound]; taper frequency or switch to lower potency as inflammation subsides.
- **Quantity**: Use the fingertip unit (FTU) method: 1 FTU = 0.5 g, sufficient to treat an area equivalent to two adult palms.
- **Avoidance**: Do not use ultra-high potency steroids on the face, intertriginous areas, or in infants due to risk of atrophy and systemic absorption [^115RDtSd].

---

## Systemic corticosteroids: for widespread or refractory inflammation

Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for **widespread, severe, or refractory inflammatory skin conditions** [^115kbn4f], such as severe atopic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pemphigus vulgaris, or severe drug eruptions [^115kbn4f].

---

### Recommended systemic corticosteroid regimens

- **Initial dose**: Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) [^1167tfbn] for 2–3 weeks, depending on disease severity and response [^1111JHtu].
- **Tapering**: Gradually taper over 4–6 weeks to prevent rebound inflammation and adrenal suppression [^1167tfbn].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Combine with topical corticosteroids, emollients, and antihistamines for optimal control [^112YcZPn].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Infection risk**: Systemic corticosteroids increase susceptibility to infections; monitor for signs of bacterial, fungal, or viral infections [^1117zpjX].
- **Adverse effects**: Long-term systemic use can cause hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, and adrenal suppression; limit duration and use the lowest effective dose [^113yCpwb].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid systemic corticosteroids in patients with systemic fungal infections, known hypersensitivity, or certain viral infections [^1154VZqb].

---

## Alternative therapies

When corticosteroids are contraindicated or ineffective, consider **calcineurin inhibitors** (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) for sensitive areas or as steroid-sparing agents, and **systemic immunosuppressants** such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or biologics (e.g. dupilumab) for severe or refractory cases [^114aHnb3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended corticosteroid therapy** | **Duration and tapering** |
|-|-|-|
| Localized inflammation | Topical corticosteroids (potency based on severity and site) | 1–2 weeks; taper frequency or switch to lower potency |
| Widespread or refractory inflammation | Systemic prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day | 2–3 weeks; taper over 4–6 weeks |
| Sensitive areas (face, intertriginous) | Low-potency topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors | Short-term use; avoid ultra-high potency steroids |

---

Corticosteroids are highly effective for highly inflamed skin: use **topical therapy first-line** [^114WrPkL] and reserve systemic therapy for widespread or refractory disease [^115YddEr]. To minimize adverse effects, tailor potency and duration to disease severity and treatment area, and taper gradually [^115RDtSd].

### Comparison of skin concentrations following topical versus oral corticosteroid treatment: reconsidering the treatment of common inflammatory dermatoses [^113t2yME]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are often considered to have greater safety and poorer efficacy than oral corticosteroids in treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. There are limited data for assessing relative efficacy of topical and systemic corticosteroids, however. The concentration of corticosteroid in skin, adjusted for the relative potency of the active compound, may be a predictor of clinical efficacy and can be estimated for both topical and oral administration.

Purpose

To analyze the assumption that oral corticosteroid therapy should be more potent than topical therapy by comparing relative corticosteroid concentrations in the skin expected with topical versus systemic administration.

Methods

The estimated skin concentration of prednisone following oral dosing was calculated based on data showing 70–100% bioavailability and an even tissue distribution. Data on the concentration of corticosteroids found in skin after topical application were obtained from the literature. The relative potencies of corticosteroid molecules were then used to compare skin concentrations of corticosteroid following topical versus oral treatment.

Results

Data derived from the existing literature demonstrated that hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, triamcinolone 0.1% ointment, and clobetasol 0.05% foam achieved effective skin concentrations greater than the effective concentration achieved by oral prednisone. Betamethasone 0.1% cream achieved effective concentrations in skin within the range created by oral prednisone.

Limitations

This analysis was limited by the paucity of data regarding cutaneous concentrations of corticosteroids after topical application, and by the differing experimental designs utilized in the available studies.

Conclusion

Most topical corticosteroids have the potential to achieve greater effective drug levels in the superficial layers of skin than those achieved with standard doses of oral prednisone. The apparently greater efficacy of oral corticosteroid therapy may be attributable, in part, to poor patient compliance with topical therapy. Systemic alterations in immune function following oral, but not topical, corticosteroid use may also play a role.

### The safety of low-dose glucocorticoids in rheumatic diseases [^116o634F]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids (GC) remain the most commonly used agents for managing inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The adverse effects (AE) associated with high-dose GCs are well established, but there is a widespread misconception that AEs of high-dose GC therapy (> 30 mg prednisone or equivalent daily) are similar in low-dose therapy (≤ 7.5mg prednisone equivalent a day). Although high-quality evidence on AEs of low-dose GC therapy is still lacking, risks and safety of low-dose GC therapy in rheumatic diseases are reviewed based on current evidence by category, including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, infectious, gastrointestinal, neuropsychiatric, endocrine and metabolic, dermatologic, and ophthalmologic AEs. Recommendations concerning monitoring AEs with low-dose GC therapy are provided for each category of AEs on the basis of our literature review and clinical experience. There is emerging evidence that low-dose GCs are associated with a much lower level of AEs, which would allow their use over long periods in patients with rheumatic disease who gain clinical effectiveness and well-being from their use. Nonetheless, knowledge and understanding of AEs from low-dose GCs is vital to maximise benefits and minimise risks to patients.

Cutaneous toxicities — rash or inflammatory dermatitis grading and management (G1–G2): G1 is "Rash covering < 10% BSA, which may or may not be associated with symptoms of pruritus or tenderness", managed by "Continue ICPI", "Treat with topical emollients and/or mild-moderate potency topical corticosteroids", and "Counsel patients to avoid skin irritants". G2 is "Rash covering 10%-30% BSA with or without symptoms (eg, pruritus, burning, and tightness); limiting instrumental ADL; rash covering > 30% BSA with or without mild symptoms", and management states "Consider holding ICPI and monitor weekly for improvement. If skin toxicity is not improved after 4 weeks, then regrade toxicity as grade 3", add topical emollients, oral antihistamines, and medium-to-high potency topical corticosteroids, and "Consider initiating prednisone (or equivalent) at dosing 0.5–1 mg/kg, tapering over 4 weeks", with topical anti-itch remedies for pruritus without rash.

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

### Effectiveness and safety of lower dose prednisone for initial treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease: a randomized controlled trial [^116h3hS2]. Haematologica (2015). Low credibility.

We conducted a phase III study to test the hypothesis that initial therapy with "lower dose" prednisone is effective and safe for patients with newly diagnosed acute graft-versus-host disease. We hypothesized that a 50% decrease in the initial dose of prednisone for treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease would suffice to control graft-versus-host disease without increasing the incidence of secondary treatment. Patients with grade IIa manifestations (upper gastrointestinal symptoms, stool volumes < 1.0 L/day, rash involving < 50% of the body surface, no hepatic dysfunction; n = 102) were randomized to start treatment with prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day. Those with grade IIb or higher manifestations (rash involving ≥ 50% of the body surface, stool volumes ≥ 1.0 L/day or hepatic involvement; n = 62) were randomized to start treatment with prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg/day. The primary study end point (a ≥ 33% relative reduction of the mean cumulative prednisone dose by day 42 after initial treatment with lower dose prednisone) was not reached. With a median follow up of 36 months (range 7–53), initial treatment with lower dose prednisone appeared to be effective for patients presenting with grade IIa manifestations since it did not increase the likelihood of requiring secondary immunosuppressive therapy. Further exploratory analyses suggested that for patients presenting with skin-predominant grade IIb or higher manifestations, initial treatment with lower dose prednisone was associated with an increased risk of requiring secondary immunosuppressive therapy (41% vs. 7%; P = 0.001). In summary, initial treatment of newly diagnosed acute graft-versus-host disease with lower dose prednisone is effective. Within the statistical limitations of the study, results showed no suggestion that initial use of lower dose prednisone adversely affected survival.

Systemic corticosteroids — use in acne and acne fulminans: Low-dose prednisone in doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg daily, administered alone or with high-estrogen containing COCs, has shown efficacy in the treatment of acne and seborrhea; however, long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids prohibit use as a primary therapy for acne. Prednisone in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day is indicated for treatment of the systemic and cutaneous manifestations of acne fulminans and for treatment and prevention of isotretinoin-induced acne fulminans–like eruptions, and a slow taper over several months is recommended while transitioning to isotretinoin or oral antibiotics in order to minimize relapses.

Topical corticosteroid selection and use in psoriasis should consider severity, site, patient preference, and age; lower potency corticosteroids should generally be used for limited periods on the face, intertriginous areas, areas with thin skin, and in infants, whereas in other areas and in adults, mid- or high-potency agents are generally recommended as initial therapy; patients with thick, chronic plaques often require the highest potency corticosteroids; for class I corticosteroids, the available data allow for 2 to 4 weeks of use with increased risk if used continuously for longer periods; when topical corticosteroids are used, it is recommended that a gradual reduction in frequency of usage following clinical response be instituted; many factors can alter efficacy including vehicle, area, occlusion, patient preference, and age; topical steroids range from 1% hydrocortisone to superpotent clobetasol propionate.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1165ve7z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A total of 104 trials and 8443 participants were included in this review. These covered a wide range of clinically plausible strategies for using topical corticosteroids in treating eczema, which fell into three broad categories:

which topical corticosteroid to use;
how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for; and
how best to apply the topical corticosteroid.

Summary of main results

The main findings, for which we have drawn up summary of findings tables, address 1. which topical corticosteroid to use, and 2. how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for.

Which topical corticosteroid to use

See: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4.

Our review focused on four comparisons of topical corticosteroid of one potency with another topical corticosteroid of a different potency (moderate versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus moderate topical corticosteroid, and very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid) for treating eczema flare‐ups, which reflects clinical practice decision making based on a stepped approach. In mainly moderate to severe eczema, potent and moderately potent topical corticosteroid probably result in an increased number of participants achieving clinician‐reported treatment success compared to mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence), with insufficient data to determine whether this applied to people with mild disease. There was also insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroid compared to moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence). Again, the trials were mainly in moderate to severe eczema but perhaps more representative of the population that may be offered these higher‐potency topical corticosteroids There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroid, with only three small trials included in the meta‐analysis (low‐certainty evidence). These trials usually included more children than adults. The number of reported cases of skin thinning was very low, with a relatively even spread across groups but tending towards more events with increasing potency of topical corticosteroid. Most trials were of short duration so may not detect longer‐term adverse events (low‐certainty evidence for local adverse events, except for the comparison of very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid which we assessed as very low‐certainty.)

In six trials involving 188 participants, 16 participants had levels of cortisol outside of the normal range (very low‐certainty evidence). There were minimal data on whether the levels returned to normal once the topical corticosteroids were stopped, minimal data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression, and no data regarding impact on growth (see: Completeness of outcomes; safety).

### Long-term prednisone in doses of less than 5 mg / day for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: personal experience over 25 years [^1118hDuJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

This article summarises the experience of one academic rheumatologist in treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 25 years from 1980–2004 with low-dose prednisone, most with < 5 mg/day over long periods. A database was available which included medications and multidimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ) scores for physical function, pain, and routine assessment of patient index data (RAPID3), completed by all patients at all visits in the infrastructure of care. Most patients were treated with long-term low-dose prednisone, often from the initial visit and indefinitely, and with methotrexate after 1990. The mean initial prednisone dose declined from 10.3 mg/day in 1980–1984 to 3.6 mg/day in 2000–2004. Although no formal criteria were used to determine the initial dose, prednisone doses were higher in patients who had more severe MDHAQ/RAPID3 scores, as expected, reflecting confounding by indication. Similar improvements were seen in clinical status over 12 months in patients treated with < 5 vs. ≥ 5 mg/day prednisone, and maintained for > 8 years. Adverse effects were primarily bruising and skin-thinning, with low levels of hypertension, diabetes, and cataracts, although this information was based only on self-report rather than systematic assessment by a health professional. These data reflect limitations of observational data. However, a consecutive patient database may provide long-term information not available from clinical trials. The data document that prednisone at doses < 5 mg/day over long periods appears acceptable and effective for many patients with RA at this time. Further clinical trials and long-term observational studies are needed to develop optimal treatment strategies for patients with RA with low-dose prednisone.

Cutaneous toxicities — bullous dermatoses (grades 1–2) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy are graded by body surface area (BSA) and managed as follows: Grade 1 is defined as "Asymptomatic or blisters covering < 10% BSA and no associated erythema", and when blisters are " < 10% BSA, are asymptomatic and noninflammatory… cessation of ICPI is not necessary and only observation or local wound care is warranted", whereas symptomatic bullae or erosions indicate "the cutaneous irAE is considered at least grade 2". Grade 2 is "Blistering that affects QoL… Blisters covering 10%-30% BSA", managed to "Hold ICPI therapy and consult with dermatology", "Initiate class 1 high-potency topical steroid… and reassess every 3 days", use a "Low threshold to initiate treatment with prednisone (or equivalent) at 0.5–1 mg/kg/d dosing and taper over at least 4 weeks", and "Monitor patients closely for progression to greater BSA involvement and/or mucous membrane involvement", with consideration to follow "using serial photography".

Applying topical corticosteroid twice daily probably does not increase the proportion of participants (adults and children) who achieve clinician‐reported treatment success for treating a flare (1 to 4 weeks) compared to once daily application (moderate‐certainty evidence). This still applied when restricting to trials where the same topical corticosteroid was used in both arms; however, most of those trials were in participants with moderate to severe eczema, using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid. It also applied in the trials that spanned more than one strategy, comparing higher‐potency, often newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroid applied once a day with lower‐potency topical corticosteroid applied more frequently.

The evidence suggests that frequency of application results in little to no difference between strategies in the risk of developing skin thinning (low‐certainty evidence). The number of reported cases was low, and more than three‐quarters of cases were seen in participants using very potent topical corticosteroid. The evidence addressing whether using topical corticosteroids more than once daily affects cortisol levels is very uncertain and there were no data on clinically relevant effects.

No trials looked at longer‐ versus shorter‐term duration of treatment for induction of remission from a flare.

Weekend, or 'proactive' therapy, in which topical corticosteroids are applied twice a week for two consecutive days in between flares, aims to prevent rather than treat eczema flares. Weekend therapy likely results in a large decrease in the likelihood of experiencing a new flare compared to no topical corticosteroid application, with moderate‐certainty evidence. This effect was seen in children and adults and across all eczema severities, although most evidence was in moderate to severe eczema. With regard to safety, no cases of skin thinning, or new cases of abnormal cortisol levels were reported (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence), but there were no data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression or impact on growth. The trials of weekend therapy were significantly longer in duration (16 weeks to 12 months) than trials identified for other strategies, primarily because of the need to detect the number of new flares rather than treating the existing flare. Whilst these trials may be better designed to detect adverse events that take longer to manifest, such as skin thinning, it should be noted that the data are not necessarily comparable with the other strategy comparisons as the topical corticosteroid use was intermittent (two days per week) rather than daily as is normal for treating a flare.

Immunosuppressants — systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) in adults with atopic dermatitis (AD) are not favored; for adults with AD, we conditionally recommend against systemic corticosteroids, and their use should be reserved exclusively for acute, severe exacerbations and as a short-term bridge therapy to other systemic, corticosteroid-sparing therapy.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer [^112JVbvw]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are immunocompromised in addition to being at increased risk of developing MCC. Patients with some NMSC and concurrent hematological malignancies may have worse outcomes with ICI treatment; however, prospective data are lacking at this time and trials are ongoing. A small number of reports have demonstrated general safety using ICIs alone or in combination with ibrutinib.

Some patients who are being considered for immunotherapy are on immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, to treat pre-existing autoimmune conditions. Corticosteroids suppress the immune system, and steroid exposure is independently associated with worse survival outcomes in advanced solid tumors. However, corticosteroids are also a cornerstone of irAE management, and studies to date have not conclusively demonstrated that short-term (ie, limited duration for the purposes of toxicity management and promptly weaned when AEs resolve) immunosuppression affects clinical benefit with ICI therapy. A systematic review of 4,045 patients with a variety of tumor types found that patients taking high-dose steroids (> 10 mg prednisone or equivalent) were at increased risk of death or disease progression compared with patients who were not. This increased risk was greatest in subgroups of patients who were taking steroids for supportive care or for brain metastases. Notably, patients who received steroids to treat irAEs stemming from ICI therapy did not exhibit reduced OS. Similar results were found in a study of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, where patients who received ≥ 10 mg prednisone at the time of beginning immunotherapy had worse median OS and PFS if receiving the prednisone for palliative care, but those receiving ≥ 10 mg prednisone for cancer-unrelated reasons (such as prior autoimmune conditions) experienced OS and PFS similar to those who received < 10 mg prednisone. While these studies demonstrate that the context of steroid use is important, in general, for patients with immunological comorbidities (other than solid organ transplant preservation) who are taking high-dose corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppresives, a reduction to the minimum necessary dose is best practice prior to treatment with ICIs, and enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged if available. A skin cancer multidisciplinary tumor board or referral to a tertiary care center with a tumor board for evaluation of clinical trial eligibility may be beneficial for these difficult-to-treat patient populations.

What Is the Utility of Corticosteroids in the Management of Toxicity of ADCs in UC?

Corticosteroids are used in the management of dermatological AEs associated with enfortumab vedotin. Mild-to-moderate skin disorders can be treated with moderate potency topical corticosteroids. Treatment is usually required for ≥ 4 weeks and may be utilised as-needed once the event has resolved or decreased by one grade of severity. Oral corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone-equivalent 0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) are advisable for grade 3 events, although the use of systemic corticosteroids can cause enfortumab-associated hyperglycaemia.

Corticosteroids can be used prior to sacituzumab govitecan infusions in patients who have previously had infusion-related reactions. Corticosteroids are also used to treat pneumonitis, which can occur during treatment with the ADC enfortumab vedotin.

Expert Opinion

In conjunction with recommended dose interruptions and/or delays based on AE severity, topical and/or systemic corticosteroids can be used as part of supportive care to manage ADC toxicities, such as dermatological AEs and pneumonitis. Prompt recognition and management of such events with corticosteroids may allow for continued ADC therapy.

What Are the Methods to Prevent ADC Toxicity?

Patients receiving enfortumab vedotin must be advised of the potential for serious skin reactions, common symptoms, and the importance of early reporting. Patients with a history of dermatological conditions (i.e. psoriasis), rash/pruritus, allergies, dry skin, immunosuppression, and/or high sun exposure may be predisposed to skin reactions. Prophylactic strategies include the use of barrier-protecting agents (e.g. zinc-containing moisturizers), especially in intertriginous areas like the axillae and groin; fragrance-free, gentle emollients (e.g. white petrolatum) at least twice daily; and protection from ultraviolet radiation with sunscreen on exposed skin. For patients with a skin reaction, full-body examination helps ensure accurate estimation of the affected body surface area. Treating mild skin reactions allows for more rapid and effective management, potentially preventing development of severe skin reactions that could lead to treatment delays. Early referral to a dermatologist for lower-grade skin reactions is also a reasonable approach for proactive evaluation and management.

### Corticosteroids: options in the era of steroid-sparing therapy [^111tkvzf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids remain the most commonly used topical treatments for inflammatory dermatoses, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles-creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and, more recently, foam. The vehicle used can substantially affect the individual agent's clinical action, potency, and acceptability to the patient. Moreover, some vehicles are better suited for specific body areas. Selection of the appropriate product should be determined by area of usage, physician experience, cost, and patient preference, particularly regarding vehicle. Although topical corticosteroids are associated with several side effects, including skin atrophy, telangiectases, purpura, and striae formation, appropriate usage can minimize these occurrences. Judicious use includes short-term, appropriate application as initial monotherapy or in combination strategies with other therapeutic agents that ideally possess complementing mechanisms of action. Examples include pulsing with high-potency topical corticosteroids and combination regimens with other topical agents such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, or tazarotene. Appropriate education of patients and caregivers alike will facilitate the optimal use of these medications.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^116uNXib]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids — classification and selection in adult psoriasis — are classified into 7 categories based on skin vasoconstrictive activity, ranging in strength from ultra-high (class 1) to low (class 6 and 7), and choosing potency and vehicle should be based on disease severity, disease location, patient preference, and age. In adults, corticosteroids in classes 2 through 5 are generally recommended as initial therapy; lower potency corticosteroids should be used on the face, intertriginous areas, and areas that are susceptible to steroid atrophy (eg, forearms) and other adverse effects, while areas with thick, chronic plaques often require treatment with class 1 (ultrahigh-potency) corticosteroids.

Cutaneous toxicities — rash or inflammatory dermatitis (G3–G4) definitions and management: G3 is "Rash covering > 30% BSA with moderate or severe symptoms; limiting self-care ADL", with management to "Hold ICPI therapy and consult with dermatology to determine appropriateness of resuming", use emollients, antihistamines, high-potency topical corticosteroids, and "Initiate oral prednisone or equivalent (1 mg/kg/d) tapering over at least 4 weeks". It specifies, "Once downgraded to ≤ G1 and prednisone (or equivalent) below 10 mg/d, clinicians may consider resuming ICPI therapy", and for pruritus without rash clinicians "may treat with gabapentin, pregabalin, aprepitant, or dupilumab". G4 is "Severe consequences requiring hospitalization or urgent intervention indicated or life-threatening consequences", with management to "Immediate hold ICPI. May admit patient immediately with direct oncology involvement and with an urgent consult by dermatology", administer "Systemic steroids: IV methylprednisolone (or equivalent) dosed at 1–2 mg/kg with slow tapering when the toxicity resolves", "Monitor closely for progression to SCAR", and "Consider alternative antineoplastic therapy over resuming ICPIs if the skin irAE does not resolve to ≤ G1", or if necessary "consider restarting once these side effects have resolved to a G1 level with close dermatology follow-up".

### Prednisolone vs. ciclosporin for severe adult eczema. An investigator-initiated double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^117JZ6LE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with severe eczema frequently receive systemic glucocorticosteroids. The efficacy of prednisolone and other steroids, however, has never been evaluated appropriately. A meta-analysis indicated that ciclosporin is the best evaluated systemic treatment for eczema.

Objectives

To investigate the comparative efficacy of prednisolone and ciclosporin for severe eczema.

Methods

In an investigator-initiated double-blind randomized multicentre trial, adults with severe eczema (objective SCORAD ≥ 40 and Dermatology Life Quality Index ≥ 10) were randomly allocated to receive prednisolone (initial dose 0.5–0.8 mg kg(-1) daily) for 2 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks or ciclosporin (2.7–4.0 mg kg(-1) daily) for 6 weeks and followed for another 12 weeks. Concomitant treatment included a moderately potent topical steroid, emollients, and continuation of antihistamines. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with stable remission, i.e. ≥ 50% SCORAD improvement under active treatment and no flare (≥ 75% of baseline SCORAD) during follow-up. Sample size calculation indicated that 66 patients were needed to see clinically relevant differences between groups. Analysis was by intention-to-treat (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00445081).

Results

Because of unexpectedly high numbers of withdrawals due to significant exacerbations of eczema (n = 15/38) an independent data monitoring and safety board proposed early study termination. Thirty-eight patients were randomized and analysed. Stable remission was achieved in one of 21 patients receiving prednisolone compared with six of 17 patients treated with ciclosporin (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

Ciclosporin is significantly more efficacious than prednisolone for severe adult eczema. Despite its frequent use in daily practice, prednisolone is not recommended to induce stable remission of eczema.

### First-line rituximab combined with short-term prednisone versus prednisone alone for the treatment of pemphigus (ritux 3): a prospective, multicentre, parallel-group, open-label randomised trial [^116i3BNF]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

High doses of corticosteroids are considered the standard treatment for pemphigus. Because long-term corticosteroid treatment can cause severe and even life-threatening side-effects in patients with this disease, we assessed whether first-line use of rituximab as adjuvant therapy could improve the proportion of patients achieving complete remission off-therapy, compared with corticosteroid treatment alone, while decreasing treatment side-effects of corticosteroids.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised trial in 25 dermatology hospital departments in France (Ritux 3). Eligible participants were patients with newly diagnosed pemphigus aged 18–80 years being treated for the first time (not at the time of a relapse). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive either oral prednisone alone, 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg per day tapered over 12 or 18 months (prednisone alone group), or 1000 mg of intravenous rituximab on days 0 and 14, and 500 mg at months 12 and 18, combined with a short-term prednisone regimen, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg per day tapered over 3 or 6 months (rituximab plus short-term prednisone group). Follow-up was for 3 years (study visits were scheduled weekly during the first month of the study, then monthly until month 24, then an additional visit at month 36). Treatment was assigned through central computer-generated randomisation, with stratification according to disease-severity (severe or moderate, based on Harman's criteria). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission off-therapy at month 24 (intention-to-treat analysis). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00784589.

Findings

Between May 10, 2010, and Dec 7, 2012, we enrolled 91 patients and randomly assigned 90 to treatment (90 were analysed; 1 patient withdrew consent before the random assignment). At month 24, 41 (89%) of 46 patients assigned to rituximab plus short-term prednisone were in complete remission off-therapy versus 15 (34%) of 44 assigned to prednisone alone (absolute difference 55 percentage points, 95% CI 38.4–71.7; p < 0.0001. This difference corresponded to a relative risk of success of 2.61 (95% CI 1.71–3.99, p < 0.0001), corresponding to 1.82 patients (95% CI 1.39–2.60) who would need to be treated with rituximab plus prednisone (rather than prednisone alone) for one additional success. No patient died during the study. More severe adverse events of grade 3–4 were reported in the prednisone-alone group (53 events in 29 patients; mean 1.20 [SD 1.25]) than in the rituximab plus prednisone group (27 events in 16 patients; mean 0.59 [1.15]; p = 0.0021). The most common of these events in both groups were diabetes and endocrine disorder (11 [21%] with prednisone alone vs six [22%] with rituximab plus prednisone), myopathy (ten [19%] vs three [11%]), and bone disorders (five [9%] vs five [19%]).

Interpretation

Data from our trial suggest that first-line use of rituximab plus short-term prednisone for patients with pemphigus is more effective than using prednisone alone, with fewer adverse events.

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^113eiStZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in the adult patient is both an underappreciated and a difficult to treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch is the result of inflammatory skin disease and therefore may be responsive to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, often in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings. Skin findings, when present, can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous change, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching. Hereby, we describe our algorithm for evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus (urticarial dermatitis in particular), including evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for treatment of recalcitrant itch.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^114WrPkL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first‐line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician‐reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient‐reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty‐five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data.

Stronger‐potency versus weaker‐potency topical corticosteroids

Sixty‐three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician‐reported signs of eczema.

We pooled four trials that compared moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low‐certainty evidence).

Twice daily or more versus once daily application

We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks.

Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare‐up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher‐potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low‐certainty evidence.

Longer versus shorter‐term duration of application for induction of remission

No trials were identified.

Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare‐ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application

Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe).

Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty.

Other comparisons

Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare‐ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare‐ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low‐ or very low‐certainty, short‐term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer‐term trials, in people with mild eczema.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer [^1126PDvZ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) — immunotherapy in special populations: For solid organ transplant recipients with CSCC who are potential candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, healthcare professionals should have a careful risk–benefit discussion with the patient that includes the potential risk of allograft loss, which may result in the need for dialysis (ie, for kidney transplant recipients) or death (eg, recipients of heart, lung, or liver transplants), and chemotherapy and/or EGFR inhibitors are acceptable alternative first-line therapies in this population; Enrollment in clinical trials should be encouraged. For patients with CSCC who are receiving high-dose corticosteroids for reasons other than solid organ allograft preservation, the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) per day, if possible, prior to initiation of ICI therapy. Caution is advised when treating with ICIs in patients with CSCC who have a history of autoimmune disease, and healthcare professionals should have a careful risk–benefit discussion with the patient, which includes the potential risks associated with an autoimmune flare. For patients with CSCC on therapeutic immune suppression, a discussion should be initiated on reducing or modifying immune suppression, if appropriate, before proceeding with ICI therapy.

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^1135NE3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles altering the potency and giving the option of tailoring them for use based on specific anatomic locations, area of involvement, age of the patient, and most importantly, severity of the condition. Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most of the preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers such risk for side effects, and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

### Update on systemic glucocorticosteroids in dermatology [^1117zpjX]. Dermatologic Clinics (2001). Low credibility.

Although dermatology now has the most extensive group of systemic medications available for the treatment of skin diseases at any time, GCSs remain the most important agents for managing inflammatory disorders. It is important that the dermatologist have a broad knowledge of guidelines for clinical use, pharmacology, and adverse effects of these drugs. Acute and chronic side reactions should be well recognized. An understanding of the HPA axis and reasons for administering GCSs in different ways is of great value. A good medical history should be taken on any patient treated with GCSs, including knowledge of conditions that would make GCSs inadvisable and other concomitant systemic medications that might produce drug interactions. During the course of therapy, physical examination should include all systems pertinent to side effects caused by these agents, including frequent evaluations of weight and blood pressure. Blood chemistries should be performed on a regular basis, including glucose, electrolytes, and serum lipids. Osteoporosis is one of the most significant adverse affects to be evaluated, with bone mineral density studies recommended on an annual basis for persons continuing on GCS therapy. If hip or other joint pain develops, MR imaging is the most specific and sensitive radiologic examination for evaluating the possibility of osteonecrosis. An ophthalmology examination should be performed every 6 to 12 months to detect early cataract or glaucoma development. Any early signs of infection should be evaluated by appropriate smears, wet preparations, and cultures. Many other studies, including gastrointestinal and pulmonary examinations, may be dictated by specific acute situations. It is important to begin early prevention of the bone loss that occurs with GCS-induced osteoporosis. The 1996 guidelines of the American College of Rheumatology, including adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, should be followed. Hormonal replacement, a bisphosphonate, calcitonin, or a thiazide diuretic may be indicated. Restriction of sodium in the diet is important, as well as adequate potassium intake. The diet should be low in saturated fat and calories and should be high in vegetable protein. Because osteoporosis is so prevalent with GCSs, keeping the patient as active as possible with mild-to-moderate exercise is important. Whenever possible, exposure to persons with infectious processes should be avoided, and proper treatment should be instituted at the initial signs of systemic or cutaneous infection. Oral doses of GCSs are best taken with food to prevent gastrointestinal irritation, and agents for gastric acidity occasionally may be indicated. Significant trauma should be prevented, as should severe exposure to the sun. Many situations may call for consultation with other medical or surgical subspecialists. The patient must be aware of the importance of regular physician evaluations and reporting of any adverse effects while on long-term GCSs. A good relationship and understanding between the patient and physician are vital in minimizing potential problems from these agents. If the dermatologist maintains the proper guidelines of care, patients on GCSs have the highest benefits and lowest risks possible.

### Radiation-induced skin injuries to patients: what the interventional radiologist needs to know [^113ZbDtp]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of Radiation-Induced Skin Reactions

A considerable number of compounds have been tested for their ability to mitigate radiation dermatitis. Previous publications demonstrated that topical treatment with corticosteroids improves epidermal barrier function and ameliorates the clinical severity of radiation injury to the skin. The benefits of topical corticosteroids are likely due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Inhibition of the radiation-induced cytokine secretion by glucocorticoids constitutes an important treatment principle for radiation-induced skin inflammation. Yet, despite the short-term benefits, the adverse effect profile of glucocorticoids makes them less than optimal for therapy. Topical corticosteroids inhibit epidermal proliferation and differentiation by down-regulating lipid synthesis and also impair the permeability barrier function of the skin.

Therefore, a considerable number of alternate emollients have been tested for their ability to mitigate radiation-induced skin injury. However, the published data lack standardization across treatment protocols, which precludes an assessment of the comparative efficacy of these agents. Consequently, there currently is no entirely evidence-based gold standard for mitigating or treating radiation dermatitis, but topical corticosteroids in the inflammatory phase and emollients for longer term treatment are generally accepted. In the case of skin ulceration, treatment should follow the general principles of wound care, e.g. debridement and moist wound dressings (hydrogel, foam and hydrocolloid). In some cases, excision of the ulcer and skin grafting is necessary.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A. Oral prednisone
B. Methotrexate
C. Low-dose aspirin
D. Interleukin-1 blockade
E. Ultrapotent topical corticosteroids

Answer:

A. Oral prednisone – Correct. The majority of AOSD patients require oral prednisone 40 to 60 mg daily, usually tapered after 4 to 6 weeks. Forty-five percent of these patients become chronically steroid dependent.
B. Methotrexate – Incorrect. If relapse occurs upon tapering prednisone, methotrexate is a common second-line option.
C. Low-dose aspirin – Incorrect. Patients with AOSD may respond to high-dose aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen.
D. Interleukin-1 blockade – Incorrect. Case series report utility in AOSD that has been refractory to treatment with other medications, including glucocorticoids and methotrexate, but it is not a first-line treatment.
E. Ultrapotent topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. This patient has AOSD, and oral corticosteroids are first-line treatment.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113yCpwb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — systemic corticosteroids: Summary Statement 83 notes systemic corticosteroids are "frequently used in patients with refractory CU, but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy", and that "short-term use (eg, 1–3 weeks' duration) might be required" until other therapies control symptoms, whereas "long-term use for treatment of patients with CU should be avoided as much as possible". Short-term use guidance specifies that "Dose adjustment tapering is not necessary in patients receiving 40 mg or equivalent doses of prednisone daily for 3 weeks or less", and long-term risks include "osteoporosis with increased risk of fracture, avascular necrosis, cataracts, hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, risk of infection, and thinning of the skin". Evidence cited includes a study of "40 patients with DPUA" using a "7-week taper of prednisone" in which "Thirty percent of subjects withdrew from the prednisone treatment group because of adverse effects", and a prospective series of "17 patients… (3–30 days per month)" where "47% had a short relapse or worsening of their urticaria on withdrawal of corticosteroids".

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder that most commonly affects the lungs, lymphatic system, eyes, and skin. Cutaneous involvement is present in approximately 20% to 30% patients. Prednisone and corticotropin repository are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for sarcoidosis. We review the varied cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis and the recommended evaluation for this disease. We also discuss histopathologic findings and outline disease pathogenesis, incorporating newer molecular data. Treatment approaches for cutaneous sarcoidosis and their associated levels of evidence are also delineated.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^113qfpde]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis topical corticosteroids — precautions, dosing limits, and systemic effects: Local cutaneous side effects, which occur more frequently than systemic side effects, are more commonly seen at steroid-sensitive sites, including the face and intertriginous areas, as well as in any areas that are treated over the long term; these include skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae distensae, acne, folliculitis, and purpura, and rebound can occur wherein disease recurs worse than the pretreatment baseline after discontinuation. Systemic side effects, although infrequent, may occur, with the greatest risk when ultra-high-potency or high-potency corticosteroids are used over a large surface for a prolonged period or under occlusion; the continuous use of class I topical corticosteroids should normally be limited to no more than twice daily for up to 2 to 4 weeks and no more than 50 g/wk. Although symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is a relatively uncommon side effect, laboratory evidence is more common with more potent agents, and in two distinct studies, 20% of patients treated with clobetasol ointment (class I) had laboratory evidence for HPA suppression compared to 3% with desonide ointment (class VI). Infants and younger children are at increased risk of local and systemic side effects, all topical corticosteroids are pregnancy category C and of unknown safety in nursing women, and approaches to minimize side effects include transitioning to weaker potency agents after clinical improvement and intermittent usage (weekend only).

### Corticosteroid use in autoimmune blistering diseases [^117DyH49]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids, while providing rapid remission and ongoing control of symptoms of autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBD), have numerous potentially serious acute and long-term side effects. Evidence-based medicine has reevaluated the various types of corticosteroids and forms of corticosteroid delivery in AIBD to ascertain whether any advantages of specific delivery systems or regimens exist. Careful monitoring of patients and simple preventive measures are effective in minimizing the adverse outcomes associated with their use. This article outlines the current level of evidence for corticosteroid use in AIBDs, and discusses appropriate investigations and interventions to minimize or prevent the associated adverse effects.

### Where does rituximab fit in the treatment of autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering skin disease? [^116aKiCz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

We propose rituximab as a first-line therapy for pemphigus vulgaris and steroid-dependent bullous pemphigoid with or without systemic steroids. A brief review of the literature substantiates the significant risk associated with the use of long term, high-dose prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and azathioprine. No head-to-head studies are available with respect to safety and efficacy of rituximab versus these therapies. When comparing the side effects of rituximab to MMF, both are found to be mild when used as monotherapy in dermatologic patients. The most severe side effects of rituximab include fatal infusion reactions and hypersensitivity, pancytopenia, infection and organ dysfunction. With MMF, malignancy, pancytopenia, infection, and organ dysfunction are the most concerning side effects. The frequencies of these observed adverse events are difficult to compare, but the side effect profiles of rituximab and MMF are clearly similar. Therefore, there is equipoise whether to use rituximab before rather than after MMF and/or systemic corticosteroids.

### International multicentre observational study to assess the efficacy and safety of a 0. 5 mg kgper day starting dose of oral corticosteroids to treat bullous pemphigoid [^11743rV7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

European guidelines propose a 0.5 mg kg -1 per day dose of oral prednisone as initial treatment for bullous pemphigoid (BP). We assessed the safety and efficacy of this regimen depending on BP extent and general condition of the patients.

Methods

In a prospective international study, we consecutively included all patients diagnosed with BP. Patients received a 0.5 mg kg -1 per day dose of prednisone, which was then gradually tapered 15 days after disease control, with the aim of stopping prednisone or maintaining minimal treatment (0.1 mg kg -1 per day) within 6 months after the start of treatment. The two coprimary endpoints were control of disease activity at day 21 and 1-year overall survival. Disease severity was assessed according to the Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI) score.

Results

In total, 198 patients were included between 2015 and 2017. The final analysis comprised 190 patients with a mean age of 80.9 (SD 9.1) years. Control of disease activity was achieved at day 21 in 119 patients [62.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 55.3–69.5]; 18 of 24 patients (75%, 95% CI 53.3–90.2), 75 of 110 patients (68.8%, 95% CI 59.2–77.3) and 26 of 56 patients (46.4%, 95% CI 33.0–60.3) had mild, moderate and severe BP, respectively (P = 0.0218). A total of 30 patients died during the study. The overall Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival was 82.6% (95% CI 76.3–87.4) corresponding to 90.9%, 83.0% and 80.0% rates in patients with mild, moderate and severe BP, respectively (P = 0.5). Thresholds of 49 points for BPDAI score and 70 points for Karnofsky score yielded maximal Youden index values with respect to disease control at day 21 and 1-year survival, respectively.

Conclusions

A 0.5 mg kg -1 per day dose of prednisone is a valuable therapeutic option in patients with mild or moderate BP whose general condition allows them to be autonomous.

### Factors affecting prescription of ultra-high potency topical corticosteroids in skin disease: an analysis of US national practice data [^1173ccsa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Of the topical preparations available, the ultra-high potency corticosteroids have an important role in treating psoriasis. However, the use of these agents in many other conditions and patient populations may not be appropriate. This study examines the prescribing patterns of Class I topical corticosteroids in patients with skin disease by analyzing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1990–2000). Of the nearly 718 million visits for skin disease, Class I topical corticosteroids were prescribed in nearly 3% of all skin disease-related visits, with prescription rates being highest in psoriasis (22%). The study found greater prescription rates of Class I topical steroids by dermatologists compared to non-dermatologists [Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.39 (95% CI: 2.15, 8.99)]. However, there were also a large number of questionable prescriptions for other conditions, which could be construed as misuse of these medications. Despite limitations and the potential dubious use seen here, Class I topical corticosteroid use is relatively commonplace. Education efforts and novel preparations of Class I agents will help to ensure the best possible care for patients suffering from significant skin diseases like psoriasis.

### Corticosteroids in Stevens-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis: current evidence and implications for future research [^117W9m53]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for the use of steroids in adults presenting with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), or overlap.

Data Sources

EMBASE (1974 to April 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to April 2014), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to January 2014) were searched using the terms: prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, steroids, glucocorticoids, corticosteroids, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and SJS/TEN overlap.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language, full reports of experimental and observational studies were included. Bibliographies from pertinent publications were reviewed for additional references. Prespecified outcomes included survival, survival to discharge, hospitalization without intensive care, length of intensive care stay, duration of hospitalization, ophthalmological complications, infection rates, and adverse events.

Data Synthesis

Six studies that used steroids for SJS, TEN, and/or overlap were included. All studies were retrospective cohort studies with no case-control or cross-sectional studies; 5 studies reported on steroid doses, and 2 studies reported time from disease onset to steroid use (2–4 days). Only 1 of 6 studies reported a statistically significant impact on mortality with steroids use (odds ratio = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2–0.9). Adverse event rates were not reported in any of the studies.

Conclusions

A review of the current evidence reveals a need for prospective, randomized controlled studies to provide more definitive conclusions on steroid use in patients with SJS, TEN, and/or overlap.

### An aberrant reaction toantigen used for recalcitrant warts successfully treated with oral prednisone [^112Md4L4]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although considered safe, CA antigen is reported to cause exuberant reactions in some cases. Of interest, this reaction might be dose dependent, with less chance of reaction using diluted CA antigen. Neither the original test site nor the first wart injection resulted in significant inflammation. This finding suggests that having a minimal antecedent reaction does not predict a future exuberant one.

We report this case to increase awareness of the possible complications that may arise when using CA antigen in an otherwise healthy patient. Moreover, as no specific treatment (other than surgical incision to the area because of worries about compartment syndrome) was described in original reports of CA reactions, this report indicates that a course of systemic prednisone at 1 mg/kg with rapid taper has efficacy.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^1148vEA2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Patch testing — effects of systemic corticosteroids, topical anti-inflammatories, and antihistamines (Summary Statement 235): Patch test results are affected by oral corticosteroids but not by antihistamines (A). Immunocompromised adult patients taking oral corticosteroids (> 20 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent) may show diminished or absent reactivity, and systemic steroids in doses of less than 20 mg/d were not likely to suppress strongly positive patch test results but could suppress mild irritant responses. The skin site for application should have had no topical potent corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor applied for 5 to 7 days before testing since these agents can diminish or obliterate results. The effect of systemic corticosteroids on patch testing is less understood for children, and systemic antihistamines do not affect interpretation.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^112hUYpn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We GRADE assessed almost all clinician‐reported effectiveness outcomes as moderate, with only one judged very low. The reason for downgrading the effectiveness outcomes was due to issues identified by the risk of bias assessment and in the comparison classed as low, imprecision. Only half of the comparisons from the summary of findings table reported complete numerical data for the most reported patient‐reported outcome; patient global assessment. Of those that did, one provided moderate‐quality evidence, one low, and one very low. The reason for downgrading the data obtained from this analysis was again issues from the risk of bias assessment, and in the trials assessed as low, unexplained heterogeneity. In the comparison classed as very low, small numbers of events and participants meant we downgraded the comparison twice for this outcome in addition to the risk of bias concerns.

We judged all but one comparison low with regards to the data concerning skin thinning. This was again due to issues highlighted by the risk of bias assessment and imprecision. The comparison in which we classed the skin thinning data as very low was downgraded twice for imprecision due to low numbers of events and participants.

In all assessments of the evidence associated with abnormal cortisol assessment, we judged the certainty of the evidence as very low. This was due to risk of bias issues and low numbers of events and participants. One comparison also demonstrated inconsistency.

Where we sought further information from authors relating to risk of bias assessments, our requests for further data did not always get a response (see Table 10). In many cases, this is likely owing to the age of the included trials.

We did not downgrade any GRADE assessments due to publication bias. However, only two analyses that included assessment of short‐term IGA from the potent versus moderate and twice or more versus once daily topical corticosteroid comparisons, included enough trials to allow the generation of valid funnel plots. Both showed no clear asymmetry (Figure 5 relating to Analysis 3.1; Figure 6 relating to Analysis 7.1).

### Long-term use of oral corticosteroids and safety outcomes for patients with atopic dermatitis [^111JXAbK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What duration of oral corticosteroid use is associated with adverse effects among adult patients with atopic dermatitis?

Findings

In this nested case-control study including 1 025 270 patients with atopic dermatitis, use of oral corticosteroids for more than 90 days during 1 year was associated with a slightly increased risk of composite adverse outcomes. There was no increased risk with use of oral corticosteroids for more than 30 days.

Meaning

This study suggests that for patients with exacerbations of atopic dermatitis, limiting the duration of oral corticosteroid treatment to 90 days or less may limit adverse effects.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^115N1Szm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

Key areas where this review supports NICE guidance (NICE 2007).

NICE says do not use very potent preparations in children without specialist dermatological advice. Most cases of skin thinning collated into this review were in participants using very potent steroids. We assessed the evidence found within this review relating to the rates of skin thinning using GRADE as low or very low certainty.
NICE says start with mild steroids for those with mild eczema. Within the potent versus mild topical corticosteroid comparison, there was no difference between mild and potent topical corticosteroid in participants with mild to moderate eczema, suggesting that mild steroids may work well enough for this group, however this only considered 43 participants from two trials and the confidence interval was wide compared to the data in moderate to severe eczema, which favoured potent topical corticosteroid. Furthermore, as there were more reports of skin thinning in more potent steroids, the trade‐off of more effectiveness from higher potency does not seem necessary for this group unless it fails to control the flare. The evidence for potency in relation to specific disease severities was not GRADE‐assessed independently from the overall analysis of potency.
NICE says healthcare professionals should discuss risks and benefits, emphasising that the benefits outweigh possible harms when topical corticosteroid are applied correctly. Most participants had a good response to topical corticosteroids, these results were taken from within trials usually GRADE‐assessed to be of moderate certainty. Rates of adverse events such as skin thinning were generally very low, though we GRADE‐assessed this evidence as low or very low certainty.
NICE says prescribe according to lowest acquisition cost. We did not find any data that compared generic and branded topical corticosteroids.
NICE says healthcare professionals should consider treating problem areas of atopic eczema with topical corticosteroids for two consecutive days per week to prevent flares, instead of treating flares as they arise, in children with frequent flares (2 or 3 per month) once the eczema has been controlled. This strategy should be reviewed within three months to six months to assess effectiveness. This review supports weekend (proactive) therapy for the prevention of eczema flares, including in children, however more trials are needed to verify for how long this should be continued (effectiveness evidence for weekend (proactive) therapy GRADE‐assessed as moderate certainty).
This review confirms the research gap identified by NICE regarding a lack of good, long‐term data on topical corticosteroid safety. For example, we GRADE‐assessed the safety data reported for the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables as low or very low certainty.

### What's new in the pathogeneses and triggering factors of bullous pemphigoid [^112THJDF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

5.3 Immune checkpoint inhibitors

Immunotherapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1), and cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4 (CTLA‐4) have emerged as highly effective treatments for an increasing number of malignancies. Because the PD‐1 and CTLA‐4 pathways play important roles in regulating immune responses, their blockade leads to both generalized and organ‐specific inflammation called immune‐related adverse events (irAEs). The skin is a major target of irAE, presenting with nonspecific itchy maculopapular rashes, lichenoid reactions, psoriasis, acneiform rashes, vitiligo‐like lesions, autoimmune skin diseases (e.g. dermatomyositis, alopecia areata), sarcoidosis, or nail and oral mucosal changes.BP is a well‐known skin irAEs whose frequency is reported to range from 0.3% to 0.8% among patients under ICI treatment, which far exceeds the incidence of BP in the general population (0.0012%–0.0076%). Siegel et al.reported seven cases of BP associated with ICI therapy (ICI‐BP) as well as a case of bullous lichenoid dermatitis and a case of linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and they showed that the time from therapy initiation to rash was variable, with a mean latency of 6.25 months and a range of 2 weeks to 20 months. All nine patients had either an initial positive tumor response or stable disease, although six eventually developed disease progression. In all cases, ICIs were discontinued or interrupted. Eight of the nine patients required systemic steroids for the treatment of rash. Apalla et al. summarized 13 cases of ICI‐BP and showed that ICI was unaltered in seven, temporarily interrupted in two, and permanently discontinued in four, and seven patients who continued ICI remained free of BP with an average prednisolone dose of 2.5–5 mg/day. The authors proposed that grade‐1 or grade‐2 eruptions can be managed with low doses (0.3–0.5 mg/kg/day) of prednisolone and potent topical steroids, without impeding the administration of ICI. In more severe cases, treatment starts with a low dose of prednisolone without altering the ICI, and if there is no response, BP can be controlled by increasing the prednisolone to 0.7 mg/kg/day while withholding one or tw doses of the ICI. Juzot et al.reported 85 ICI‐BP cases. In those cases, the first‐line therapy for BP was topical steroids (the whole‐body application of topical clobetasol) in 84% (n = 71), systemic corticosteroids in 5%, topical and systemic corticosteroids in 8%, and topical steroids and doxycycline in 2%. The ICI was permanently discontinued for 40 patients. Seventy‐one patients were treated with topical steroids as monotherapy, and 31 patients discontinued the ICI while 39 continued it. Of note, among those who discontinued the ICI, 17 (55%) had their BP controlled, whereas among those who continued the ICI, 29 (74%) had their BP controlled. These results show that high‐potency topical steroids may be sufficient to control BP even with continuing ICIs in some cases.

### Effective prescribing in steroid allergy: controversies and cross-reactions [^112BuWKp]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids should be considered in all patients who do not respond to, or are made worse by, the use of topical steroids. The incidence of steroid allergy in such patients is reported as 9% to 22% in adult patients and in 25% of children. It can often go undiagnosed for a long time in patients with a long history of dermatologic conditions and steroid use. Although rare, both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to systemic corticosteroids with an incidence of 0.3%. Reported reactions range from localized eczematous eruptions to systemic reactions, anaphylaxis, and even death. Delayed type reactions to systemically administered steroids may present as a generalized dermatitis, an exanthematous eruption, or occasionally, with blistering or purpura. In this contribution, we clarify the issues surrounding the pathogenesis of steroid allergy, cover the importance of cross-reactions, and describe strategies for the investigation and management for patients with suspected steroid allergy.

### Standardised nomenclature for glucocorticoid dosages and glucocorticoid treatment regimens: current questions and tentative answers in rheumatology [^116Md2Bg]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In rheumatology and other medical specialties there is a discrepancy between the widespread use and the imprecise designation of glucocorticoid treatment regimens. Verbal descriptions of glucocorticoid treatment regimens used in various phases of diseases vary between countries and institutions. Given this background, a workshop under the auspices of the EULAR Standing Committee on International Clinical Studies including Therapeutic Trials was held to discuss this issue and to seek a consensus on nomenclature for glucocorticoid treatment. This report summarises the panel's discussion and recognises that answers derived from consensus conferences are not definitive. Nevertheless, recommendations on glucocorticoid treatment are presented that (1) reflect current and best knowledge available and (2) take into account current clinical practice. A question-answer rationale presentation style has been chosen to convey the messages, to summarise the meeting in a readable format, and to avoid dogmatism.

### The role of patch testing in evaluating delayed hypersensitivity reactions to medications [^113g7ywq]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
General guidelines for patch testing for delayed hypersensitivity reactions to medications

In general, it is recommended that testing be performed around 3 months following resolution of the eruption, depending on patient recovery and the severity of cutaneous manifestations (recommendations in the literature range from 3 weeks to 6 months). This timing is largely based on expert consensus; studies have not formally evaluated how or if patch test reactivity varies in the weeks to months following resolution of an eruption. Patients should ideally also be off all oral immunosuppressive agents such as prednisone, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil for at least 1 month prior to testing so as to minimize the risk of false negative results. In practice, the specific timing should vary relative to the half-life of the drug in question. The extant literature on the effect of specific immunomodulatory agents, including biologics, on patch testing is limited. As such, clinical practice is largely informed by guidelines developed on the basis of expert consensus. While successful patch testing has been reported in the setting of low doses (10mg) of prednisone, evidence from a handful of studies suggests there is incremental dose-dependent inhibition and in some cases, complete suppression of allergic reactions to haptens with doses as low as 20 mg. We recommend testing on the lowest possible dose of prednisone, ideally 10 mg or less. Observed attenuation or complete suppression of reactions has also been noted following topical application or intradermal or intramuscular injection of mid to high potency steroids for as few as 3 days prior to testing. Expert consensus recommendations are to avoid topical application of steroids for 1 week and wait 4 weeks after intramuscular triamcinolone or oral prednisone before pursuing patch testing.

### Rituximab is an effective treatment in patients with pemphigus vulgaris and demonstrates a steroid-sparing effect [^1153DRVt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary end point was the proportion of patients at month 24 who achieved CR on 0 mg prednisone for at least two consecutive months (CRoff ≥ 2 months). CRoff ≥ 3 months at month 24 was also analysed. CR was defined as complete epithelialization and absence of new and/or established skin and mucosal lesions. Secondary objectives included the proportion of patients who relapsed ('relapse' was defined as the appearance of at least three new lesions in 1 month, which did not heal spontaneously within 1 week, or the extension of established lesions in a patient who had previously achieved disease control), median cumulative prednisone dose at month 24, duration off CS therapy in patients who responded at month 24, and incidences of treatment‐related AEs, all serious AEs (SAEs), and CS‐related AEs. For IRRs, symptoms of intolerance to treatment were documented at the first planned visit after the infusion.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^115ahS9M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The divergence between guidelines discouraging systemic CS use vs. their frequent use in routine clinical practice are a concern. Ease of use, a rapid response in a distressed patient, cost and familiarity of primary care physicians with systemic CS for other conditions are all likely to contribute. The divergence between treatments physicians suggest in guidelines in a hypothetical clinical scenario and decisions they make when dealing with an individual patient in one‐to‐one consultations has been studied using a behavioural economics approach. 27 Physicians often deviate from agreed best practice when confronted with a distressed patient. Systematic approaches to better understand the implementation gaps between guidelines and practice have been advanced in a recent white paper by the healthcare quality organization Joint Commission International, and may be applicable to systemic CS use for AD. 28

The major strength of our study is the large, geographically diverse group of IEC expert AD clinicians and researchers who participated in the consensus process. During the panel discussion preceding the formal consensus survey, it was clear that clinical practice, even among experts, differed significantly from country to country. Particularly given the sparsity of RCT and high‐quality nonrandomized study evidence to support any one viewpoint, keeping an open mind to different practices is important. Despite the diversity of respondents, there was over‐representation from some countries, including the U.S. A. which may have biased the results, and we would have benefited from a higher response rate.

The major limitation of this project is the limited evidence to support the consensus statements. While RCT evidence would be ideal, many in the IEC would deem it unethical to subject trial participants to systemic CS at this point. Additionally, RCT follow‐up is not likely to be long enough to detect many of the long‐term consequences of systemic CS use. The lack of data likely also contributed to our inability to reach consensus on specific dosing and duration recommendations for systemic CS. Nonrandomized prospective registry studies being planned or currently under way may help to answer some comparative efficacy and safety questions in the AD population. 20, 29

As with any consensus project, our results are influenced by the rules chosen to reach consensus. Using rules chosen a priori, we reached consensus on 12 statements. However, if we had used stricter rules, as in our second sensitivity analysis, we would have only reached consensus on three statements, limiting the recommendations we could make. Another limitation is the broad age range (0–12 years) used to define the youngest group of children. More precise age categorization may have yielded different results.

### Topical tacrolimus 0.1% improves symptoms of hand dermatitis in patients treated with a prednisone taper [^116tYanw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hand dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder for which systemic immunosuppressive therapy is often needed. Topical treatments could complement the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Objective

To evaluate symptoms of hand dermatitis in subjects treated with a prednisone taper combined with topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment versus vehicle.

Methods

Thirty-two subjects with moderate to severe hand dermatitis were enrolled in a randomized double-blind controlled trial. Subjects received a 3-week taper of prednisone and was randomized 2:1 to apply topical tacrolimus or its vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks. Disease severity was evaluated at baseline and at 5 follow-up visits (weeks 1–14). Any occurrence of relapse was recorded by patients.

Results

Twenty-two of the 32 subjects (69%) had relapse of their disease. The mean time to recurrence for tacrolimus versus vehicle was 48 versus 39 days, respectively (P = 0.78). A greater improvement of induration (P = 0.003) and scaling (P = 0.003) for patients with tacrolimus compared to vehicle was detected, as well as subjective improvement (%) from week 1 to week 12 (P = 0.04) compared to vehicle. Improvement in erythema (P < .0001), fissuring (P = 0.0003), pruritus (P = 0.06), and investigator's global assessment (P < .0001) with tacrolimus was not found to exceed improvement with vehicle.

Limitations

Small sample size provides limited power to detect differences in response.

Conclusions

Topical tacrolimus improves induration and scaling, and there is a trend suggesting it prolongs the time to recurrence.

### Treatment of bullous pemphigoid [^115YddEr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most frequent auto-immune blistering skin disease. Up to recently, it was treated with oral corticosteroids. High dose steroids are poorly tolerated in the elderly and probably contributed to the high mortality rates observed in several cohorts. For years, efforts have been devoted to looking for steroid sparing agents including immunosuppressive drugs, plasma exchanges, intravenous immunoglobulins, tetracycline. Many seemed useful in open series but proved ineffective or marginally effective when tested in randomized controlled trials. An important breakthrough was the demonstration by a large randomized trial that a "super-potent" topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate) was not only associated with a significant decrease in severe complications and mortality of BP patients but was also more effective than oral prednisone. New strategies for BP should include topical clobetasol propionate as the first line treatment and consider adjuvant therapy only in the very rare cases that are either resistant to or intolerant of this treatment.

### Favorable outcomes with reduced steroid use in juvenile dermatomyositis [^1115dhg3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

During this era of gradual improvement in treatment outcomes, there were no randomized controlled trials or published corticosteroid treatment regimens to guide therapeutic decisions. In fact, only recently has a randomized controlled trial studied superiority of two different immunomodulatory agent in combination with prednisone to prednisone alone; however, this manuscript was published in 2016 many years after practice trends had developed. Generally, different doses, routes, and duration of glucocorticoids were first-line therapy for mild, moderate, and severe JDM in combination with other immunomodulatory agents. However, a number of published reports advocated that initial high-dose, intravenous and/or pulsed intervals of glucocorticoids were needed to aggressively suppress disease activity, sustain remission, and prevent calcinosis, a highly morbid JDM complication. Despite this trend, there remained tremendous variety in practice, with most authors advocating an initial oral prednisone dose of 2 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day), with pulses of high-dose (up to 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g daily) intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) for moderate to severe cases as induction therapy, followed by a slow taper of oral steroids over 1 year. However, lower to medium doses of prednisone (1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) were also reported effective, particularly after taking into account the disability associated with higher glucocorticoid dosing. Another report showed comparable outcomes using combinations of other immunosuppressive agents with no use of systemic glucocorticoids, albeit in an admittedly mild disease phenotype where the practice was not universal amongst treated patients. Not only have disease outcomes improved with addition of steroid-sparing agents, but it is recognized that aggressively utilizing these agents can reduce the burden of adverse effects of glucocorticoids without sacrificing outcome. Regardless, the most current recommendations continue to endorse high-dose glucocorticoids: Consensus-based treatment plans published by the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) for the initial treatment of moderate to severe JDM recommended 2 mg/kg/day oral prednisone in combination with methotrexate in their most conservative protocol, with the two more aggressive protocols utilizing intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g) for 3 days and continuing with weekly or monthly intravenous methylprednisolone pulses ⁠. Similarly, European recommendations from the Single Hub and Access point for Pediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) recommended high-dose intravenous dosing of methylprednisolone (15–30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g/day) for all patients at diagnosis or with a disease flare, followed by an oral prednisone taper beginning at 1–2 mg/kg/day. To our knowledge, there have been no reports describing outcomes with lower doses of glucocorticoids used consistently in early combination with other immunosuppressive agents as a universal approach in a single referral center.

### Yearly reduction of glucocorticoid dose by 50% as tapering schedule achieves complete remission for 124 pemphigus vulgaris patients [^116Ntsaw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment for pemphigus vulgaris. Among 140 patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids, 124 patients achieved complete remission off or on a prednisone dose of ≤ 10 mg/day or less for 6 months or more. The mean average steroid controlling doses were 0.65, 0.62, 0.80, 1.08 and 1.38 mg/kg per day for the mucosal-dominant patients and the mild, moderate, severe and extensive cutaneous-involved patients, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean durations of the initial tapering after controlling doses started were 77.98, 48.78, 31.74 and 28.83 days when the disease was controlled with doses of 40 mg/day or less, 45–60 mg/day, 65–80 mg/day and more than 80 mg/day for the cutaneous-involved types, respectively (P < 0.005). Of the patients, 79.51% achieved complete remission within 3 years, 98.36% within 5 years and all within 6 years, which corresponded to a 50% yearly reduction of glucocorticoid dose. These successfully treated patients indicate that a severity-tailored initial dose of glucocorticoids, an initial tapering duration based on the initial dose and a subsequent 50% yearly tapering regimen may cure pemphigus vulgaris within 3–6 years.

Survival in patients with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with or without corticosteroid treatment.

Overall survival (a) and progression-free survival (b) in patients with irAEs with or without corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroid dose cut-offs represent prednisone equivalent dose. For immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) type and, tumour heterogeneity type, green (+) indicates restriction to one ICI regimen/tumour type, yellow (−) indicates adjustment for ICI regimen/tumour type and red (X) indicates that heterogeneity was not accounted for. In studies by Li et al. and Faje et al. corticosteroids irrespective of their indication (irAE or non-irAE) were included, which may have induced bias. In well-intended efforts to account for immortal-time bias, Robert et al. may have introduced bias rather than corrected for time to irAE onset and Lafayolle et al. have potentially overestimated the negative effect of corticosteroids on survival. Other studies accounted for immortal-time by analysing post-irAE survival (green +), did not account for difference in time-to-irAE onset (yellow −) or did not clearly describe start-point of survival analyses (blue?). *Thompson et al. compared two dosages of corticosteroids against the lowest dose of < 7.5 mg/d for at least 2 weeks prednisone equivalent. HR hazard ratio for death, CI confidence interval, n number of participants in analysis, IS immunosuppressant, N/A not applicable.

In a retrospective study of anti-PD-1-treated melanoma patients with irAEs in two independent cohorts, Bai et al. examined the correlation between both PFS and OS with early high-dose corticosteroid exposure defined as 1-day peak dosage of ≥ 60 mg prednisone equivalent. They assessed post-irAE PFS and OS in a landmark analysis in which only corticosteroid use within 8 weeks after anti-PD-1 initiation was considered and patients who had progressive disease or died within 8 weeks were excluded. Early high-dose corticosteroid exposure was strongly associated with worse post-irAE PFS and post-irAE OS in both cohorts. Similarly, in a cohort of infliximab-treated colitis patients with various tumour types and ICI regimens, patients with high peak dose of corticosteroids (≥ 75 mg prednisolone equivalent on 1 day) had a significantly worse overall survival than patient with lower dosages corticosteroids when corrected for tumour type and age, but not for type of ICI.

### Systemic immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory skin diseases in children: expert consensus-based guidance for clinical decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114FpoAS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the approach to management of systemic immunosuppressive therapies for dermatologic indications in children. Change to: Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and systemic immunosuppressive therapies in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians.

Methods

A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring.

Results

Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications. The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications. In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried. The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for new infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering.

Conclusions

The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families. Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^114aHnb3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by current guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the current treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

### Favorable outcomes with reduced steroid use in juvenile dermatomyositis [^116CEXna]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

High-intensity glucocorticoid regimens are commonly used to induce and maintain remission in Juvenile Dermatomyositis but are associated with several adverse side-effects. Evidence-based treatment guidelines from North American and European pediatric rheumatology research societies both advocate induction with intravenous pulse steroids followed by high dose oral steroids (2 mg/kg/day), which are then tapered. This study reports the time to disease control with reduced glucocorticoid dosing.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records at a single tertiary-care children's hospital of patients diagnosed with Juvenile Dermatomyositis between 2000 and 2014 who had a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. The primary outcome measure was time to control of muscle and skin disease. Additional outcome measures included glucocorticoid dosing, effect of treatment on height, frequency of calcinosis, and complications from treatment.

Results

Of the 69 patients followed during the study period, 31 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Median length of follow-up was 4.58 years, (IQR 3–7.5). Myositis control was achieved in a median of 7.1 months (IQR 0.9–63.4). Cutaneous disease control was achieved in a median of 16.7 months (IQR 4.3–89.5). The median starting dose of glucocorticoids was 0.85 mg/kg/day, (IQR 0.5–1.74). The median duration of steroid treatment was 9.1 months, (IQR 4.7–17.4), while the median duration of any pharmacotherapy was 29.2 months (IQR 10.4 to 121.3). Sustained disease control off medications was achieved in 21/31 (68%) patients by the end of review. Persistent calcinosis was identified in only one patient (3%).

Conclusion

Current accepted treatment paradigms for Juvenile Dermatomyositis include oral glucocorticoids beginning at 2 mg/kg/day and reduced over a prolonged time period. However, our results suggest that treatment using reduced doses and duration with early use of steroid-sparing agents is comparably effective in achieving favorable outcomes in Juvenile Dermatomyositis.

Prick/puncture skin testing — medication effects and withholding: first- and second-generation antihistamines should be discontinued 2 to 3 days before skin tests (with notable exceptions listed), and the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin may suppress responses for as long as 6 days; histamine2 antagonists may cause mild suppression and should be discontinued for 24 hours before testing; prostaglandin D2 inhibitors (eg, indomethacin) given several hours before testing may increase wheal area by 17%, whereas cysteinyl leukotriene antagonists had negligible effects; short-term oral corticosteroids (30 mg of prednisone daily for 1 week) do not suppress skin tests, but there are dissenting opinions about long-term and relatively high-dose corticosteroids (> 20 mg/d); potent topical corticosteroids for greater than 3 weeks may suppress skin tests over treated areas, so skin tests or corticosteroids should be avoided in such sites for 2 to 3 weeks before testing.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^113Q43ho]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where randomisation is at any level (including cluster and within‐participant trials).

Types of participants

Participants of any age and gender with a diagnosis of eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) of any severity by a healthcare professional, or using established diagnostic criteria for eczema, e.g. the standardised diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (Hanifin 1980) or the UK Working Party diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis (Williams 1994). We also accepted modified versions of standard diagnostic criteria. Where it was unclear whether a trial included participants with atopic eczema, a senior clinician (HCW) made a judgement as to whether the trial was to be included. This was primarily based upon the pattern of symptoms described in the paper.

We included trials that included participants with other types of eczema such as contact dermatitis, varicose eczema, and seborrhoeic eczema, or other inflammatory or 'steroid‐responsive' skin conditions such as psoriasis, only if the trial also included people with eczema and the data were reported separately.

Types of interventions

The intervention was any topical corticosteroid of any preparation and potency in a trial where one strategy of using the topical corticosteroid was compared to a different strategy. This included the following strategies (see Figure 1).

### The treatment and prognosis of dermatomyositis: an updated review [^116gPTjM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. The mainstay of treatment for DM is oral corticosteroids. However, the dose and length of treatment is debated. Adding to the confusion, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the use of various corticosteroid doses and taper rates, and no controlled long-term studies assessing the hypothesis that, unlike systemic lupus erythematous, patients with DM can often achieve long-term remission off therapy. This literature review supports an approach that prednisone should be started at about 1 mg/kg/d, which is then tapered slowly based on the response. As patients respond differently to prednisone, additional therapies may be necessary. When to initiate these therapies requires clinical judgment. In addition, as we learn more about the pathophysiology of DM, newer medications that target specific mechanisms in the immune response may help us better treat the disease. Evidence-based data with long-term follow-up will allow for selection of the best treatment to maximize long-term remission, not simply short-term lowering of the systemic corticosteroid dose.

### Dermatologic toxicity occurring during anti-EGFR monoclonal inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a systematic review [^1152JWf8]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Skin Rash and Dermatitis.

The treatments commonly used for the management of skin rash are detailed in Table 3. The reported data have described treatment of patients with grade 1 or 2 skin rash to include petrolatum emollients, medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids, oral minocycline or doxycycline, 0.5% to 2.5% hydrocortisone cream, H 1 antihistaminic loratadine, and saline/boric acid compresses.– Topical antibiotics such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole and benzoyl peroxide can be used to treat skin toxicities; however, these are usually avoided in patients with papulopustular or acneiform eruption because these treatments have drying properties that can induce rosacea and can be irritating. Additionally, the use of topical retinoids is typically avoided because of their greater potential for irritation. Patients are cautioned to avoid sunbathing, direct sunlight, hot temperatures, and humidity. Patients should avoid manipulation of skin or hot blow-drying of the hair because these can increase the risk of infection. Although the use of greasy creams such as petroleum jelly is highly effective, the treatment can cause folliculitis owing to its occlusive properties.

For patients with grade 3/4 skin rash, the reports most commonly suggested temporary dose interruption and/or reduction of anti-EGFR therapy, depending on the severity of the rash and the patient's tolerance level. In addition to the suggested reductions, other possible recommended treatment methods include the administration of doxycycline; minocycline; oral; intramuscular; intravenous antihistamine; high-dose tetracycline; oral corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisone); oral retinoids (low-dose isotretinoin); or intravenous antibiotics.,

Treatment of xerosis and/or pruritus often includes the use of moisturizers or oral antihistamines. Emollients and cyanoacry-late tissue adhesives can effectively treat xerosis but must be used with care because their occlusive properties can lead to folliculitis. For patients who experience eczema, treatment with cortico steroids is recommended; for those who experience eczema with blisters (wet eczema), cultures should be conducted to ensure no bacterial or viral infection is present.

### Amcinonide [^112J13Am]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amcinonide TOP:

- **Adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia**: use extreme caution with prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids or use in areas where the epidermal barrier is disrupted (i.e., skin abrasion), and the use of an occlusive dressing. Limit the use of high-potency corticosteroids to the shortest duration necessary. Avoid applying corticosteroids to areas with disrupted skin barrier or using occlusive dressings. Discontinue Amcinonide immediately. Manage Cushing's syndrome, HPA suppression, hyperglycemia, or other adverse effects under medical guidance.
- **Hyperglycemia**: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly, especially in individuals at risk for hyperglycemia. Manage hyperglycemia under medical supervision, considering appropriate interventions or adjustments to diabetes management.
- **Mask symptoms of infections**: use caution receiving topical corticosteroids to areas of infection, including tuberculosis of the skin, dermatologic fungal infection, and cutaneous or systemic viral infection. Prior to using Amcinonide, perform a thorough examination of the affected area to identify any existing infections. Discontinue Amcinonide and promptly address the underlying infection with appropriate medical treatment.
- **Skin ulceration**: use caution in patients with markedly impaired circulation or peripheral vascular disease. Regularly monitor high-risk patients, use minimal Amcinonide dose, avoid occlusive dressings, and promote proper wound care. Discontinue Amcinonide, seek medical attention for wound assessment, implement proper wound management, and consider alternative treatments.

Patch testing (PT) during immunosuppression — medication and topical therapy management is advised: Avoid or reduce doses of immunosuppressant medications such as systemic corticosteroids (CS) and other systemic immunosuppressives before patch testing, and avoid application of topical corticosteroids (TCS), TCi, or ultraviolet radiation to the PT site, because these may reduce allergic PT responses (Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence). The majority of adult patients treated with oral CS exceeding 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent have been shown to diminish skin test reactivity at 48 hours to 5% nickel sulfate; the effect of systemic CS on the results of PT is less understood for children. Patch tests in patients on low doses of prednisone and cyclosporine may still yield clinically relevant results, and there are no supporting data that guide the duration of steroid reduction or withdrawal before performing PT.

Immunosuppression levels relevant to live vaccination — examples of low versus higher level immunosuppression are listed. Low level immunosuppression includes short term steroids (i.e., < 14 days) and low to moderate dose (i.e., < 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day or < 2 mg/kg body weight per day for a young child), as well as long‑term, alternate‑day treatment with short acting steroid preparation, maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy), topical (skin or eyes), inhaled, or by intra‑articular, bursal, or tendon injection, and vedolizumab. Higher level immunosuppression includes high‑dose steroids > 20 mg per day of prednisone, methotrexate or azathioprine, biologic therapy (anti‑TNF therapy), non‑TNF biologic agents (ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab), and JAK inhibitors and S1P (tofacitinib, upadacitinib, ozanimod, etrasimod).

### Glucocorticoid dosing and implications for vaccination: evolution of global definitions [^116QnqEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite widespread adoption of "high-dose" glucocorticoid definitions across international immunisation guidelines (ie, prednisone-equivalent dosing > 20mg/day, or > 2mg/kg/day in children), the rationale remains unclear. Literature searches were performed through academic databases for this narrative review to identify relevant evidence regarding glucocorticoid dosing on vaccine responses and safety. In people receiving prednisone < 7mg/day, vaccine responses are maintained. In people on "high-dose" glucocorticoids (> 20mg/day), antibody titres and seropositivity are reduced, whereas the impact of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids (7 to 20mg/day) on vaccine efficacy remains inconclusive. Due to inconsistent paediatric dosing regimens, data is insufficient to support a unified "high-dose" glucocorticoid threshold. Non-live vaccines are well tolerated in patients receiving glucocorticoids with rheumatic/inflammatory disorders, but enhanced reactogenicity after live vaccination may occur in those with severe immunodeficiencies. Clinicians should consider individual risk-benefit profiles, rather than following strict dosing thresholds, when curating immunisation programs for patients prescribed glucocorticoids.

Cutaneous toxicities — bullous dermatoses (grades 3–4) in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy include "G3: Skin sloughing covering > 30% BSA with associated pain and limiting self-care ADL" and "G4: Blisters covering > 30% BSA with associated fluid or electrolyte abnormalities". For grade 3, directives are to "Hold ICPI therapy and consider admitting patient", "Administer IV methylprednisolone (or equivalent) 1–2 mg/kg/d and when appropriate convert to oral steroids, tapering over at least 4 weeks", consider that "If bullous pemphigoid is diagnosed, it may be possible to avoid long-term use of systemic steroids and transition to steroid-sparing options (eg, IVIG and rituximab)", and "Consult with dermatology to determine appropriateness of resuming ICPI once symptoms improve". For grade 4, management is to "Permanently discontinue ICPI", "Admit patient immediately and place under supervision of a dermatologist", and "Administer IV methylprednisolone (or equivalent) 1–2 mg/kg/d… with tapering over at least 4 weeks", with the note that "If bullous pemphigoid is diagnosed, it may be possible to avoid long-term use of systemic steroids and treat with steroid-sparing options… (eg, IVIG and rituximab)".

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^116CeFCp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority (65%) disagreed that nonresponse to topical therapy was an indication for use of systemic CS. Consensus was reached that among the appropriate circumstances for the use of systemic CS in AD were a lack of other viable treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in cases that were the most severe. Consensus was reached that, if used, systemic CS treatment of severe AD should be limited to short‐term use.

In their responses to the open‐ended questions, individual participants qualified their responses in several ways. Some expressed strong support for the use of systemic CS, whereas others expressed strong opposition.

In the sensitivity analysis using < 20% disagreement as a more stringent cut‐off, only five statements would have reached consensus (Box S1; see Supporting Information). In the sensitivity analysis in which no more than 30% of voters marked within the left two‐thirds of the VAS (counting more of the 'neutral' range as disagreement), only three statements would have reached consensus (Box S2; see Supporting Information).

### Rapid-onset bilateral scalp ulceration with visual loss [^115YgXSU]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following would be the most optimal initial therapy for the case presented?
A. Observation
B. Systemic corticosteroids
C. Topical steroids
D. Tocilizumab
E. Methotrexate

Answer:

A. Observation – Incorrect. Visual loss is — most of the time — an irreversible complication of GCA. This makes GCA an ophthalmic emergency.
B. Systemic corticosteroids – Correct. Intravenous pulse corticosteroid therapy is prescribed (250–1000 mg methylprednisolone for up to 3 days) for newly diagnosed GCA with acute visual loss. Oral high-dose corticosteroids (40–60 mg/day prednisone-equivalent or prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) are advised in patients without manifestations of ischemia (visual and neurologic involvement). The dose is gradually tapered once remission is achieved.
C. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids may resolve localized areas of cutaneous involvement in cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (a medium-sized vessel vasculitis). They are not an option in GCA.
D. Tocilizumab – Incorrect. Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, is not systematically prescribed as a first-line treatment. It may be combined with systemic corticosteroids as initial treatment in newly diagnosed GCA patients already presenting corticosteroid-related adverse events (AE) or at high risk for such AE.
E. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate has long been the corticosteroid-sparing drug for GCA. It is nowadays initially associated with systemic corticosteroids in patients presenting or at high risk of corticosteroid-related AE (as an alternative to tocilizumab) and allows the gradual tapering of the systemic corticosteroid treatment. Although stronger clinical evidence supports the use of tocilizumab compared to methotrexate, the latter can be considered if the patient is at risk of recurrent infections or for cost reasons.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^113dATUJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids — tapering, maintenance strategies, pregnancy/lactation precautions, and tachyphylaxis are detailed as follows: Topical corticosteroids can be tapered off by reducing use to every other day, then eventually 2 times a week, and finally discontinuation if psoriasis is well controlled and stable during the whole process, and to minimize adverse effects, transitioning to lower-potency agents after improvement, using intermittent therapy, and combining treatment with noncorticosteroidal agents can also be considered. Topical corticosteroids are safe during pregnancy when low cumulative doses (< 60 g/wk) are used (expert consensus), though in rare cases, low fetal birth weight has been reported with prolonged potent topical corticosteroid use during pregnancy, and the use of a super potent corticosteroid in the nipple and the areola area should be avoided in nursing mothers. Because psoriasis generally recurs after discontinuation of topical corticosteroid treatment, steroid-sparing agents may be used to supplement and reduce over-reliance on topical corticosteroids as monotherapy, and an example regimen for mild psoriasis flares could include 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with a topical corticosteroid twice daily followed by maintenance with a steroid-sparing agent twice daily on weekdays and a corticosteroid agent twice daily on weekends; proactive treatment typically involves twice-weekly treatment of clinically quiescent areas to reduce the frequency of flares. Tachyphylaxis is defined as the loss of effectiveness of topical corticosteroids with continued use and may compromise effectiveness in certain patients when used for an extended period > 12 weeks.

AMA Arch Derm. 1955; 72: 547–549. doi: 10.1001/archderm.1955.03730360053005 Prednisolone and prednisone, formerly called metacortandralone and metacortandracin, are two new synthetic hormones, which, milligram for milligram, possess greater anti-inflammatory effect and activity than cortisone or hydrocortisone and do not produce sodium and fluid retention or potassium depletion. Prednisolone is produced by dehydrogenation at Positions 1 and 2 of the hydrocortisone nucleus. It is an analogue of hydrocortisone, while prednisone is an analogue of cortisone and is produced by dehydrogenation at Positions 1 and 2 of the cortisone nucleus.
