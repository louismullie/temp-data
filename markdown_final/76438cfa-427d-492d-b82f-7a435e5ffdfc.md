## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pneumonia management presented as a stepwise expert narrative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify pneumonia and risk-stratify severity. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, including when to obtain cultures and how to interpret imaging. Next, I will review empiric antibiotic choices by setting and risk, including the HCAP/DRIP evolution and macrolide considerations. After that, I need to check duration, IV-to-oral switch criteria, and stewardship. I will then examine non-responding pneumonia and how to escalate thoughtfully. Finally, I should consider special populations, prevention, and controversies, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with major guidelines and contemporary evidence [^112DXJyG] [^114cq6uM].

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because everything downstream depends on it. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is infection in patients not recently hospitalized or in long-term care, whereas hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occur 48 hours or more after admission or with mechanical ventilation, respectively; the legacy "healthcare-associated pneumonia" (HCAP) category has been largely abandoned by ATS/IDSA 2019 due to poor predictive value for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and overtreatment, so I should not anchor therapy to HCAP labels without individualized risk assessment [^112DXJyG] [^112J51AP] [^113wt7oq].

> I need to ensure severity is assessed correctly to guide site of care and empiric breadth. CURB-65 and PSI remain standard tools; ICU admission is indicated for septic shock requiring vasopressors or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and severe CAP is also characterized by severe hypoxemia, multilobar infiltrates, or rapid progression, which should prompt broader empiric coverage and aggressive supportive care [^116P1eFg] [^1121Zy9y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostics; I should verify when testing changes management. For outpatients, routine sputum cultures are not recommended, but in hospitalized patients — especially severe CAP, those with risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, prior respiratory isolation of these organisms, or recent parenteral antibiotics — pretreatment Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions are advised to enable de-escalation; blood cultures are reasonable in severe disease or when bacteremia would alter management, acknowledging variable yield and the need for local validation of resistance risks [^115hg7iB] [^112nw1MB] [^115bxj19].

> Next, I should review imaging choices. Chest radiography remains the reference standard to confirm pneumonia and cannot be reliably replaced by clinical judgment alone; lung ultrasound is emerging as a sensitive bedside adjunct in some settings, but I need to be cautious not to overstate its role as a replacement for radiography in routine practice pending broader validation and local expertise [^116N8vas] [^115qR2bM].

> Let me think about empiric therapy for stable outpatients without comorbidities. ATS/IDSA supports beta-lactam monotherapy (e.g., amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) as first-line; macrolide monotherapy is acceptable only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under about 25%, otherwise a doxycycline alternative can be considered, and I should double-check local antibiograms before choosing macrolide monotherapy to avoid undertreatment [^112DXJyG] [^11421XKj].

> For outpatients with comorbidities or more severe presentations, I should confirm combination therapy. A beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone are acceptable regimens; macrolides may confer additional immunomodulatory benefit in severe pneumococcal disease, though I must balance this against QT prolongation and cardiovascular risks in susceptible patients [^112DXJyG] [^112Wx2vw].

> Now, for hospitalized non-ICU patients, I need to ensure I cover typical and atypical pathogens. A beta-lactam plus macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone are recommended; the rationale includes the nontrivial prevalence of atypical pathogens and observational signals of improved outcomes with macrolide-containing regimens in severe disease, even as I acknowledge the evidence base is largely nonrandomized and must be individualized [^112DXJyG] [^116gfmsu].

> For ICU patients with severe CAP, I should confirm the need for broader coverage. A beta-lactam plus macrolide is preferred; if there is a beta-lactam allergy, a respiratory fluoroquinolone plus aztreonam is a reasonable alternative; importantly, I must add MRSA or antipseudomonal coverage only when specific risk factors are present, guided by prior cultures, recent healthcare exposures, or local epidemiology, and I should plan to de-escalate promptly when cultures return [^112DXJyG] [^115bxj19].

> Wait, let me verify the HCAP-to-DRIP transition because overtreatment is common. The HCAP construct performed poorly at predicting MDR pathogens; DRIP (Drug Resistance in Pneumonia) and individualized risk assessment outperform HCAP and should guide whether to empirically cover MRSA or Pseudomonas, with routine cultures enabling safe de-escalation at 48 hours if negative and the patient is improving [^112J51AP] [^115bxj19].

> I should double-check duration and IV-to-oral switch criteria to minimize harm. A minimum of 5 days is recommended for most CAP if the patient achieves clinical stability (defined by improving vital signs, mental status, and oxygenation) for 48–72 hours; longer courses are reserved for complications or specific pathogens like MRSA or Pseudomonas, and step-down to oral therapy should use the same class when feasible to maintain pharmacokinetic continuity [^11422hz5] [^111qE7Fs].

> Next, I should review stewardship touchpoints. Obtaining cultures before antibiotics when indicated, reassessing at 48 hours to de-escalate based on microbiology, and using the shortest effective duration reduce adverse events, C. difficile, and resistance; I need to ensure my local antibiogram informs empiric choices and that I avoid reflexive broad-spectrum therapy in the absence of validated risk factors [^116NEoCU] [^112nw1MB].

> Hold on, I should verify how to define and approach non-responding pneumonia. After 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, persistent or worsening symptoms, rising inflammatory markers, or lack of radiographic improvement should trigger a structured reassessment: verify the diagnosis (alternative noninfectious etiologies, obstructing lesion, empyema), confirm adequate source control and drug delivery, repeat cultures including atypical and viral testing, consider CT or ultrasound for complications, and tailor therapy; importantly, blindly escalating antibiotics solely for rising PCT can cause harm without improving outcomes, so I must integrate clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic data before changing therapy [^1168F72y] [^114h8CLW].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In pediatrics, WHO and pediatric guidelines emphasize oxygen delivery, amoxicillin as first-line therapy where bacterial disease is likely, and judicious use of chest radiography; in immunocompromised hosts, broader diagnostic testing and empiric coverage for typical, atypical, and opportunistic pathogens are warranted, ideally coordinated with infectious diseases specialists; in severe influenza seasons, early antivirals and vigilance for secondary bacterial infection are critical [^115wGgd5] [^113g7e1v] [^117F8r49].

> I need to ensure prevention is not overlooked. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination reduce pneumonia incidence and severity, and smoking cessation counseling should be routine; in older adults and those with chronic disease, vaccination is a key modifiable factor influencing long-term outcomes after pneumonia [^116LA8Eg] [^114cq6uM].

> But wait, what about corticosteroids in severe CAP; I should double-check the latest evidence. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline advises against routine corticosteroids for CAP, and the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain did not show a mortality benefit with hydrocortisone in ICU CAP, so steroids should be reserved for refractory shock or other indications rather than used routinely [^112DXJyG] [^114HPDhK].

> Let me reconsider a few controversies to avoid overgeneralization. The term "atypical pneumonia" remains imprecise and may obscure etiologic diversity; nonetheless, empiric coverage for atypicals is still recommended in hospitalized patients given diagnostic limitations and prevalence, while outpatient macrolide monotherapy should be restricted to settings with low resistance and careful patient selection; and although lung ultrasound is promising, it has not supplanted chest radiography as the diagnostic standard in most settings [^115GqbRu] [^112DXJyG] [^115qR2bM].

> In summary, I should confirm that my approach aligns with major guidelines: classify CAP versus HAP/VAP and avoid HCAP-driven overtreatment; risk-stratify severity to determine site of care and empiric breadth; obtain cultures selectively to enable de-escalation; use beta-lactam–based regimens with atypical coverage in hospitalized patients and reserve MRSA or antipseudomonal therapy for validated risks; treat for at least 5 days once stable with early oral step-down; and reassess non-responders systematically rather than reflexively escalating antibiotics, all while embedding vaccination and stewardship into routine care [^112DXJyG] [^11422hz5] [^112J51AP].

Pneumonia is an **infection of the lungs** [^113JQDfQ] with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide [^114cq6uM]. It is classified as community-acquired (CAP), hospital-acquired (HAP), or ventilator-associated (VAP) [^113JQDfQ] [^1119yGN8], with CAP being the most common. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features plus chest imaging** [^116N8vas] [^113JQDfQ]; in severe cases, obtain blood and sputum cultures [^115hg7iB] [^112DXJyG]. Empiric antibiotics should be started promptly [^117CFqhd] and tailored to local resistance patterns and patient risk factors [^117CFqhd]; typical regimens include a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone for severe CAP [^113heNcV]. Supportive care includes oxygen, fluids, and ventilatory support as needed [^115wGgd5] [^117CFqhd]. Prevention centers on **vaccination, hand hygiene, and infection control** [^116LA8Eg] [^117StAfM]. Complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, and long-term cardiovascular effects; mortality is highest in older adults and those with comorbidities [^114cq6uM] [^111qE7Fs].

## References

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Guidelines and quality measures: do they improve outcomes of patients with community-acquired pneumonia? [^1117WZg8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has a significant impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost of care. Guidelines play an important role in the management of this disease, and evidence supporting the positive effects of guidelines on outcomes in patients with CAP is substantial. However, evidence supporting many of the CAP quality indicators is low, and pay-for-performance measures do not seem to influence clinically important outcomes. Future CAP quality indicators should incorporate evidence-based interventions.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^1168F72y]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of "not resolving", "non-responding", or "progressive" pneumonia along with "treatment failure", are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

### What is healthcare-associated pneumonia and how is it managed? [^111eKsBU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia developing before hospital admission in patients in close contact with the health system was recently termed 'healthcare-associated pneumonia' and proposed as a new category of respiratory infection. We focus on the recent literature concerning the epidemiology, causative organisms, antibiotic susceptibilities, and outcomes of and empirical antibiotic therapy for this condition.

Recent Findings

The reported incidence of healthcare-associated pneumonia among patients requiring hospitalization for pneumonia ranges from 17% to 67%. Hospitalization within 90 days before pneumonia, attending a dialysis clinic and residing in a nursing home were the most common criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Compared with patients with community-acquired pneumonia, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia are older, have greater co-morbidity, and are more likely to have aspiration pneumonia and pneumonia caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia also more frequently initially receive an inappropriate antibiotic therapy, have higher case fatality rates and have longer hospital stay.

Summary

Many patients hospitalized with pneumonia via the emergency department have healthcare-associated pneumonia. There are significant differences in the spectrum of causative organisms and antibiotic susceptibilities between healthcare-associated and community-acquired pneumonia. Physicians should differentiate patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia from those with community-acquired pneumonia to promote a targeted approach when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

### Atypical pneumonia – time to breathe new life into a useful term? [^115GqbRu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens, or to a distinct clinical syndrome the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation, epidemiology, or both.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^117R91bn]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — immunocompromised host pneumonia scope and rationale: Pneumonia imposes a significant clinical burden on people with immunocompromising conditions, and many individuals have compromised immunity due to cytotoxic cancer treatments, biological therapies, organ transplants, and immunodeficiencies. Despite awareness of increased infectious pneumonia risk, immunocompromised people are often excluded from pneumonia clinical guidelines and treatment trials. The report states that the absence of a widely accepted definition for immunocompromised host pneumonia hampers consistent clinical care and research, and describes an American Thoracic Society workshop with participants across pulmonary disease, infectious diseases, immunology, genetics, and laboratory medicine aiming to define this entity and its diagnostic criteria.

### Health care-associated pneumonia: an evidence-based review [^114o2emk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Health care-associated pneumonia is a relatively new classification of pneumonia that includes community-dwelling pneumonia patients having contact with the health care system. Current data indicate that health care-associated pneumonia patients present with more severe disease, are more likely to be infected with drug-resistant pathogens, and suffer increased mortality compared with community-acquired pneumonia patients. Guidelines recommend that these patients receive empiric antibiotics similar to those recommended for nosocomial pneumonia; however, it is not currently known if outcomes are improved when health care-associated pneumonia patients are treated with these therapies. In addition, the individual health care-associated pneumonia risk factors are based on limited data and are a poor predictor of patients likely to be infected with drug-resistant pathogens. Many questions remain on how to most appropriately care for this growing group of pneumonia patients. This review is an evidence-based discussion of current health care-associated pneumonia data, the individual health care-associated pneumonia risk factors, and limitations and additional considerations for the health care-associated pneumonia classification system.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Recommendations for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: review of recent international guidelines [^1119yGN8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

### Is the present definition of health care-associated pneumonia the best way to define risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens? [^111NbTsd]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is associated with an increased risk of infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens compared with community-acquired pneumonia. Recent studies suggest that the designation of HCAP is a poor predictor of resistant pathogens and that antibiotic coverage for multidrug-resistant pathogens is not necessary in all patients with HCAP. This article reviews existing literature on HCAP, discusses the utility of the current definition of HCAP in identifying patients at risk for potentially drug-resistant pathogens, and compares how well the current HCAP designation predicts the risk of drug-resistant pathogens with other proposed algorithms for doing so.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Biomarkers: what is their benefit in the identification of infection, severity assessment, and management of community-acquired pneumonia? [^114ubyXL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been proposed as tools that can guide the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, providing information that supplements the usually available clinical data. Among the available biomarkers, procalcitonin has been studied extensively and seems promising for several purposes. The use of biomarkers needs further study, to validate their utility in daily practice, especially given the limitations of the current tools for identifying the need for antibiotic therapy in patients with influenza and secondary bacterial pneumonia, in patients with aspiration syndromes, and in those infected with atypical pathogens.

### Childhood pneumonia in low-and-middle-income countries: an update [^113sf4xa]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, pneumonia is one of the major causes of death children under the age of five years. In 2015, approximately 700,000 children younger than 5 years died from pneumonia worldwide, despite general improvement in living conditions, improved nutrition and better vaccines. Furthermore, pneumonia continues to be the leading cause of morbidity for young children outside the neonatal period, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Understanding the current epidemiology, and diagnostic and management strategies in these settings may improve preventive, diagnostic and treatment approaches.

The aim of this paper was to review the recent literature on (1) the epidemiology and aetiology of childhood pneumonia in LMICs; (2) diagnostic tools; and (3) prevention and management approaches.

### Pneumonia in adults: the practical emergency department perspective [^113Kb28s]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

In those patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia, mortality is 15%. Close to 90% of deaths attributed to pneumonia are in patients older than 65 years. This article provides the emergency physician with an understanding of how to make the diagnosis, initiate early and appropriate antibiotic therapy, risk stratify patients with respect to the severity of illness, and recognize indications for admission. The discussion is balanced with an emphasis on cost-effective management, an understanding of the changing spectrum of pathogenesis, and a cognizance toward variable and less common presentations.

### Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw [^113wt7oq]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of people to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of patients. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill patients in whom infection might not be present. A vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected patients. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of patients. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Advances in the causes and management of community acquired pneumonia in adults [^115zXsJX]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Usually, the causal organism is not identified and treatment remains empiric. Recent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have challenged the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and epidemiologic studies are changing our perspective of what causes community acquired pneumonia, especially the role of viral pathogens and the frequent finding of multiple pathogens. The past decade has seen increasing overuse of empiric coverage of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic resistant Gram negative pathogens owing to inappropriate application of guidelines for healthcare associated pneumonia. Optimal treatment remains a matter for debate, especially in very sick patients, including the role of combination antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids. Pneumonia care bundles are being defined to improve outcomes. Increased recognition of both acute and long term cardiac complications is shifting our concept of pneumonia from an acute lung disease to a multisystem problem with adverse chronic health consequences.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117XVXpo]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.

### How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia? [^116L3Dg2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The studies reviewed in this article suggest that a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy is comparable to standard therapy in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and promotes reduction of adverse events, microbial resistance, cost, and improved patient compliance.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7–14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^11737JPS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

### Is healthcare-associated pneumonia a distinct entity needing specific therapy? [^111Jjq2E]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was introduced in 2005 by American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines as a new entity of pneumonia, resembling nosocomial pneumonia rather than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in terms of frequency of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and outcomes, thus requiring broad spectrum initial antimicrobial coverage in order to prevent inadequate treatment and, as a consequence, excess mortality. This concept continues to be a subject of controversy. Main concerns relate to the definition of HCAP, the true frequency of MDR pathogens, and the impact of MDR pathogens on outcomes.

Recent Findings

Definitions of HCAP and the relative frequencies of HCAP defining subgroups were highly variable. All studies demonstrated an increased severity of pneumonia at presentation and an excess mortality from HCAP as compared to CAP. The incidence of MDR pathogens in different observational studies was slightly increased but generally low in most studies originating from Europe, South Korea, Canada, and Japan. However, the data do not support a causal relationship of MDR incidence and excess mortality. Instead, after adjustment for confounders, mortality might be related to hidden or documented treatment restrictions in elderly and severely disabled patients. Accordingly, HCAP guideline concordant antimicrobial treatment did not improve outcomes.

Summary

The HCAP concept is based on varying definitions poorly predictive of MDR pathogens. The incidence of MDR pathogens is far lower than supposed in the original guideline document, and MDR pathogens do not seem to be the main cause of excess mortality. Broad antimicrobial coverage does not alter outcomes. As the HCAP concept results in a tremendous overtreatment without any evidence for improved outcomes, it should not be implemented in clinical practice prior to clear evidence that it is superior to a careful assessment of individual risk factors for MDR pathogens.

### Pneumonia [^113JQDfQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem and associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of < 5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^117PyR3C]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The study Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia was published by Ane Uranga and colleagues in 2016 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the trial question was: what is the role of duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia? In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the population was: 312 patients (116 female, 196 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were HIV infection; chronic immunosuppression; lived in a nursing home; discharge from an acute care hospital, an onsite subacute care unit, or a palliative care unit within the previous 14 days; taken antibiotics in the 30 days before admission. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the interventions were: n = 162 discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days (protocolized duration of antibiotic treatment for a minimum of 5 days) n = 150 physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation (duration of antibiotic treatment determined by physicians). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in clinical success at day 10 (56.3% vs. 48.6%; RR 1.16, 95% CI -0.53 to 2.85). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical success at day 30 (91.9% vs. 88.6%; RR 1.04, 95% CI -1.03 to 3.11) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 5 (27.2 vs. 24.7; AD 2.5, 95% CI -0.48 to 5.48) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 10 (17.9 points vs. 18.6 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -3.99 to 2.59). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days were noninferior to physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation with respect to clinical success at day 10.

### Pneumonia: challenges in the definition, diagnosis, and management of disease [^1122AJi7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Atypical pneumonia: definition, causes, and imaging features [^111Dk6Ny]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is among the most common causes of death worldwide. The epidemiologic and clinical heterogeneity of pneumonia results in challenges in diagnosis and treatment. There is inconsistency in the definition of the group of microorganisms that cause "atypical pneumonia". Nevertheless, the use of this term in the medical and radiologic literature is common. Among the causes of community-acquired pneumonia, atypical bacteria are responsible for approximately 15% of cases. Zoonotic and nonzoonotic bacteria, as well as viruses, have been considered among the causes of atypical pneumonia in a patient who is immunocompetent and have been associated with major community outbreaks of respiratory infection, with relevant implications in public health policies. Considering the difficulty of isolating atypical microorganisms and the significant overlap in clinical manifestations, a targeted empirical therapy is not possible. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of atypical pneumonia, as in many cases its findings may first suggest the possibility of an atypical infection. Clarifying and unifying the definition of atypical pneumonia among the medical community, including radiologists, are of extreme importance. The prompt diagnosis and prevention of community spread of some atypical microorganisms can have a relevant impact on local, regional, and global health policies. © RSNA, 2021.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: what's in a name? [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Formerly, patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit were considered as having the severe form of the disease. Recently, guidelines have distinguished severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical definitions. In this review, we describe the different definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and whether a differentiation based on these definitions reflects variation in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic approaches and treatment.

Recent Findings

New definitions do not seem to accurately identify patients with high risks of mortality; patients not admitted to an intensive care unit could also be diagnosed as having severe community-acquired pneumonia. Host-factors, such as genetic factors and underlying diseases, can influence severity of presentation of community-acquired pneumonia. Distribution of pathogens in severe and non-severe disease forms is comparable. Initial antibiotic therapy in patients with severe disease should provide coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delay is associated with worse outcomes. However, recent studies also suggested an additional benefit of atypical coverage in non-severe disease. As a result, initial therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone is recommended for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the value of vaccination against pneumococci to prevent episodes of severe disease is yet unknown.

Summary

As current guidelines do not adequately identify patients with high risk of mortality and intensive care unit admittance, clinical judgment remains important. Based on distribution of pathogens, investigational procedures and therapy recommended in recent guidelines, differentiation between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia does not seem useful. Whether atypical coverage indeed has additional value in non-severe or pneumococcal CAP, however, remains to be determined. In addition, the preventive benefit of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for development of SCAP awaits further evidence.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia: is there any reason to continue to utilize this label in 2019? [^112J51AP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an ongoing controversy on the role of the healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) label in the treatment of patients with pneumonia.

Objective

To provide an update of the literature on patients meeting criteria for HCAP between 2014 and 2018.

Sources

The review is based on a systematic literature search using PubMed-Central full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM).

Content

Studies compared clinical characteristics of patients with HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). HCAP patients were older and had a higher comorbidity. Mortality rates in HCAP varied from 5% to 33%, but seemed lower than those cited in the initial reports. Criteria behind the HCAP classification differed considerably within populations. Microbial patterns differed in that there was a higher incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and, to a lesser extent, enterobacteriaceae. Definitions and rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pneumonia also varied considerably. Broad-spectrum guideline-concordant treatment did not reduce mortality in four observational studies. The HCAP criteria performed poorly as a predictive tool to identify MDR pneumonia or pathogens not covered by treatment for CAP. A new score (Drug Resistance in Pneumonia, DRIP) outperformed HCAP in the prediction of MDR pathogens. Comorbidity and functional status, but not different microbial patterns, seem to account for increased mortality.

Implications

HCAP should no longer be used to identify patients at risk of MDR pathogens. The use of validated predictive scores along with implementation of de-escalation strategies and careful individual assessment of comorbidity and functional status seem superior strategies for clinical management.

### Management of pneumonia in critically ill patients [^117CFqhd]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe pneumonia is associated with high mortality (short and long term), as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Appropriate diagnosis and early initiation of adequate antimicrobial treatment for severe pneumonia are crucial in improving survival among critically ill patients. Identifying the underlying causative pathogen is also critical for antimicrobial stewardship. However, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging in most patients, especially in those with chronic underlying disease; those who received previous antibiotic treatment; and those treated with mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, as antimicrobial therapy must be empiric, national and international guidelines recommend initial antimicrobial treatment according to the location's epidemiology; for patients admitted to the intensive care unit, specific recommendations on disease management are available. Adherence to pneumonia guidelines is associated with better outcomes in severe pneumonia. Yet, the continuing and necessary research on severe pneumonia is expansive, inviting different perspectives on host immunological responses, assessment of illness severity, microbial causes, risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic options.

### Challenges for a broad international implementation of the current severe community-acquired pneumonia guidelines [^11471k5t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) remains one of the leading causes of admission to the intensive care unit, thus consuming a large share of resources and is associated with high mortality rates worldwide. The evidence generated by clinical studies in the last decade was translated into recommendations according to the first published guidelines focusing on severe community-acquired pneumonia. Despite the advances proposed by the present guidelines, several challenges preclude the prompt implementation of these diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The present article discusses the challenges for the broad implementation of the sCAP guidelines and proposes solutions when applicable.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia: the state of evidence to date [^111K4bVL]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As evidence about the importance of correct choice of empiric therapy in the setting of pneumonia accumulates, balancing antibiotic spectrum against the risk of selecting for resistant organisms gains importance. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) defines a set of risk factors to underscore the probability of a resistant etiologic pathogen, requiring broader spectrum treatment than is generally needed in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Controversies persist as to whether HCAP is a useful designation for diagnosis, treatment and outcome prediction.

Recent Findings

HCAP represents a discrete syndrome, where offending organisms and outcomes differ from those for CAP. However, HCAP designation is neither a sensitive nor a specific system to predict the presence of a resistant organism. Several other instruments have been developed that require prospective validation. Recent findings that CAP guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment among HCAP patients does not alter outcomes is confounded by the emerging understanding that culture-negative HCAP may be successfully treated with therapy targeted at CAP pathogens.

Summary

Because HCAP is an important emerging syndrome, a systematic approach to its study is critical. As evidence in this area evolves, it remains important for investigators and clinicians to identify knowledge gaps and to set the research agenda to resolve multiple unanswered questions.

Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality due to hospital-acquired infections. A thorough understanding of the most recent developments in evaluating and managing nosocomial pneumonia is critical for infection control professionals and hospital epidemiologists, given the incidence and cost of this important patient safety problem. We review the evidence on pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of both ventilator-associated and nonventilator-associated pneumonia. Key recommendations are then provided for diagnostic testing strategies, antibiotic selection, and treatment duration. We also summarize the most recent data on how to prevent hospital-acquired infection, in general, and nosocomial pneumonia, in particular.

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Childhood pneumonia in developing countries [^114zDXCV]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a widespread and common infectious lung disease that causes inflammation, which can lead to reduced oxygenation, shortness of breath, and death. An estimated nearly 1.2 million children younger than 5 years died in 2011 from pneumonia. Most of these deaths occured in developing countries where access to care is limited and interventions that have improved care in developed countries are scarce. Despite substantial increases in our understanding of the clinical syndrome of pneumonia and its aetiologies, its accurate diagnosis is challenging when clinical indicators are relied on, and improves only modestly with addition of laboratory, microbiological, or radiographical tests. Prevention programmes and treatment guidelines have led to impressive reductions in disease, but children remain at risk of misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. Research to address challenges in the aetiological diagnosis of pneumonia and widespread implementation of treatment interventions beyond vaccines and antibiotics are necessary to mitigate the burden of pneumonia and improve child survival.

Abstract

In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) by the World Health Organization, respectively. The COVID‐19 epidemic is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID‐19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.

Severity-of-illness assessment is now an accepted part of clinical practice and clinical research for the management of adults who have community-acquired pneumonia. Several approaches to this issue have been devised based on severity-of-illness scores or rules, some related to site of management. No single approach has been found to be superior to others, but further research into their effect on outcome in clinical practice is required. It is likely that different approaches may suit different populations and health care systems.

### Macrolide therapy of pneumonia: is it necessary, and how does it help? [^112Wx2vw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An update and literature review assessing the implications for use of macrolide therapy for patients with pneumonia is very relevant. Multiple studies have focused on assessing the efficacy, clinical effectiveness and clinical risks associated with the use of macrolides.

Recent Findings

The scope of this review is on recently published literature regarding the use of macrolides in patients with pneumonia. Recent evidence suggests that macrolides may benefit several populations of patients with pneumonia that includes ambulatory care, hospitalized patients with nonsevere pneumonia and severe pneumonia patients requiring ICU admission. In addition, there is benefit among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, particularly those patients hospitalized with severe disease. The contradictory results that emerged from recent randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy of macrolide are discussed. Important remarks are made to the risks of cardiovascular events related to the use of macrolides and the clinical implications for care.

Summary

A careful decision on the use of macrolides in patients with pneumonia will need to balance the possible beneficial effects and the risks linked to their use.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes great mortality and morbidity and high costs worldwide. Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies are needed that focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.

CHRONIC PNEUMONIA

Children with chronic respiratory symptoms are likely to have a different spectrum of pathological processes. However, if their disease is sufficiently severe to warrant admission and to meet the definition of severe or very severe pneumonia, then acute pneumonia may be a component of their illness. The underlying etiology of this group may be different, and such differences will be drawn out in the analysis on the basis of length of history, but there are no exclusion criteria in PERCH based on the duration of symptoms.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^112vqFNN]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Are control groups receiving the best care?

A major concern in PCT-guided trials is antibiotic use in the control group. According to the World Medical Association's Helsinki declaration, "the benefits, risks, burdens, and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention", but defining "best current proven intervention" is difficult. Heterogeneity of current practices has been a major argument against using routine care without any constraints as the comparator. When we consider duration of antibiotic treatment and/or antibiotic exposure, the duration of therapy in control groups is systematically above those recommended by guidelines and the best available evidence base (e.g. standard of care for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients in the control group should be 6–8 days, not 13 days). Should any intervention compared to a "suboptimal" standard of care (even when it is usual care) be recommended/adopted in clinical practice?

For instance, usual care is sometimes far from the best available care or what should be standard of care. Trials using a protocolized rather than an unrestricted standard care control group will likely have enhanced validity as long as the protocolized care control group is representative of standard care practices. In PCT studies, a protocolized group with clear stop rules for antibiotic duration, making it more compatible with best available evidence and recommendations, would be important and could lead to better evaluation of biomarker-based antimicrobial treatment.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114h8CLW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
How and when to define a non-responding pneumonia; a patient is considered a non-responder after at least 48–72h of appropriate antibiotic therapy; the identification of non-response results from an integrated re-evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms, lab results namely biomarkers, microbiologic results and no improvement or further progression of imaging infiltrates (see manuscript)

Table 1
Approach to non-responding pneumonia

ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome; CRP C-reactive protein; PCT procalcitonin; WBC white blood cell count

The natural history of non-responder ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is similar to sCAP, that is no clinical improvement within the first 72h of receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy (Fig. 1). The most reliable clinical indicator that a patient with VAP is not responding is lack of improvement in the PaO₂:FiO₂ within the first 3 days (Table 1). Sustained fever is less specific but does indicate an unresolved inflammatory process, one cause of which could be inadequately treated pneumonia. Persistently elevated and/or rising CRP or PCT values after 3–4 days of treatment are also associated with treatment failure. However, a non-decreasing or increasing PCT during antibiotic therapy should not be used to guide antibiotic escalation or intensify diagnostics. A RCT of antimicrobial spectrum escalation in patients with persistently elevated or rising PCT values versus routine care reported that PCT-guided intensification led to more organ-related harm and prolonged ICU length of stay compared to routine care, without improvement in survival rates. Sustained leukocytosis and radiographic infiltrates are features of non-responding pneumonia but are not specific for pneumonia.

### Pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia [^117HYrou]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Pneumococcus remains the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae is well adapted to people, and is a frequent inhabitant of the upper airways in healthy hosts. This seemingly innocuous state of colonisation is a dynamic and competitive process in which the pathogen attempts to engage the host, proliferate, and invade the lower airways. The host in turn continuously deploys an array of innate and acquired cellular and humoral defences to prevent pneumococci from breaching tissue barriers. Discoveries into essential molecular mechanisms used by pneumococci to evade host-sensing systems that are designed to contain the pathogen provide new insights into potential treatment options. Versatility of the genome of pneumococci and the bacteria's polygenic virulence capabilities show that a multifaceted approach with many vaccine antigens, antibiotic combinations, and immunoadjuvant therapies will be needed to control this microbe.

### Pneumonia in the emergency department [^1128nK9k]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Pneumonia remains one of the most common reasons for admission of emergency department (ED) patients to the hospital. Pneumonia also remains one of the most common causes of death in our patients. As with many emergent conditions, the ED management of these patients initiated by ED physicians contributes greatly to the survival and successful management of these patients. Specifically, the recognition of severe pneumonias, precise choice of diagnostic tests, and appropriate antibiotics can have an impact on the outcome.

### Antibiotic-resistant community-acquired bacterial pneumonia [^115muTF9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern, and prudent use of antibiotics is essential to preserve the current armamentarium of effective drugs. Acute respiratory tract infection is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. In particular, community-acquired pneumonia poses a significant health challenge and economic burden globally, especially in the current landscape of a dense and aging population. By updating the knowledge on the common antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in community-acquired respiratory tract infections, their prevalence, and resistance may pave the way to enhancing appropriate antibiotic use in the ambulatory and health care setting.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^111Ho4wf]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Future directions

The BTS Standards of Care Committee will, at a later date, decide on the timing and scope of a future update of the BTS CAP Guideline building on the excellence of the NICE Pneumonia Guideline. Topics to be considered for inclusion in future BTS CAP Guideline include the management of pneumonia associated with viral pathogens, specifically influenza, and aspiration pneumonia.

The relative lack of major differences between the NICE and BTS guidelines might be viewed positively as demonstrating coherence and consistency in guidelines. However, it also highlights the relative lack of substantial innovation and advancement over recent years in the evidence base related to the clinical management of CAP. More attention to translational and clinical research is merited if further improvements in the care of patients with CAP are to be gained.

### World pneumonia day 2024: fighting pneumonia and antimicrobial resistance [^115wGgd5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted our vulnerabilities in the management of pneumonia and our low level of preparedness for pandemic situations worldwide and drew attention to the impact of respiratory infections, the importance of early diagnosis and initiation of therapy, the vital role of oxygen in this global emergency, and the worldwide healthcare inequities. However, the scientific community also demonstrated its ability to respond to an emergency of this scale by developing new vaccines, rapid diagnostic tests, and clinical treatments in record time.

Two questions regarding the impact of pneumonia remain unanswered: first, why does pneumonia, a treatable and preventable disease, still have such a huge impact on global health? And second, how is it possible that pneumococcus was involved in 16% of the deaths attributable to AMR when we have effective pneumococcal vaccines? Maybe the answer to these questions is to be found in an article published in 2022 that focused on the shortcomings in child pneumonia research. The authors identified 20 research priorities in child pneumonia, the most important one being "to explore interventions to prevent neonatal pneumonia", reflecting the concern with the mortality due to the condition in newborns, as 47% of deaths in children 5 years of age or younger occur in this group. Similarly, new research finds that increasing the application of four pneumonia interventions (vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae B, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV], treatment with oral antibiotics, and targeted oxygen treatment of hypoxemia) to reach ≥ 90% by 2030 could prevent half of the predicted deaths from pneumonia in children 5 years old or younger in Chad, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, the countries with the highest rates of child mortality.

In fact, the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance network, a collaborative platform that conducts standardized, comprehensive, and high-quality surveillance of causes of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, reported that, in these high-mortality settings, infectious diseases continue to cause the most deaths in infants and children, often in conjunction with malnutrition. That study identified lower respiratory tract infections as the most common overall cause of death, occurring in almost half of all fatalities. The finding that pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and H. influenzae had an important impact as causes of infections demonstrated the gaps that still exist. Efforts to ensure that pneumonia vaccines achieve optimal coverage and avoid unjustified deaths are needed, despite the fact that the 2023 World Health Organization/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage report showed that more children are being immunized than ever before.

### Nosocomial pneumonia: aetiology, diagnosis and treatment [^114As87W]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent advances in the aetiology of nosocomial pneumonia, and in strategies to increase accuracy of diagnosis and antibiotic prescription while limiting unnecessary antibiotic consumption.

Recent Findings

Bacterial pathogens still cause the bulk of nosocomial pneumonia and are of concern because of ever-rising antimicrobial resistance. Yet, the pathogenic role of fungal and viral organisms is increasingly recognized. Since early appropriate antimicrobial therapy is the cornerstone of an effective treatment, further studies have been conducted to improve appropriateness of early antibiotic therapy. De-escalation strategies combine initial broad-spectrum antibiotics to maximize early antibiotic coverage with a subsequent focusing of the antibiotic spectrum when the cause is identified. Invasive techniques probably do not alter the immediate outcome but have the potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure. Decisions to stop or change antibiotic therapy are hampered due to a lack of reliable parameters to assess the resolution of pneumonia.

Summary

Increasing antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pneumonia both challenges treatment and mandates limitation of selection pressure by reducing antibiotic burden. Treating physicians should be both aggressive in initiating antimicrobials when suspecting nosocomial pneumonia but willing to discontinue antimicrobials when diagnostic results point to an alternative diagnosis. Efforts should be made to limit duration of antibiotic therapy when possible.

### ERS / ESICM / ESCMID / ALAT guidelines for the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia [^1179JdUP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and whilst European and non-European guidelines are available for community-acquired pneumonia, there are no specific guidelines for sCAP.

Methods

The European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) launched a task force to develop the first international guidelines for sCAP. The panel comprised a total of 18 European and four non-European experts, as well as two methodologists. Eight clinical questions for sCAP diagnosis and treatment were chosen to be addressed. Systematic literature searches were performed in several databases. Meta-analyses were performed for evidence synthesis, whenever possible. The quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Evidence to Decision frameworks were used to decide on the direction and strength of recommendations.

Results

Recommendations issued were related to diagnosis, antibiotics, organ support, biomarkers and co-adjuvant therapy. After considering the confidence in effect estimates, the importance of outcomes studied, desirable and undesirable consequences of treatment, cost, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention and implications to health equity, recommendations were made for or against specific treatment interventions.

Conclusions

In these international guidelines, ERS, ESICM, ESCMID, and ALAT provide evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for diagnosis, empirical treatment, and antibiotic therapy for sCAP, following the GRADE approach. Furthermore, current knowledge gaps have been highlighted and recommendations for future research have been made.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### New guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116nZujz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We highlight the recent advances in the guidelines for treating patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP).

Recent Findings

sCAP is a significant cause of hospital admissions. We performed an extensive review of the literature, covering studies from the last several years, to summarise the most important points in the diagnosis and treatment of patients hospitalised with sCAP.

Summary

sCAP is associated with a high clinical burden. Therefore, deep knowledge is necessary for its management. In general, diagnosis, treatment and management are based on many published guidelines. However, the mortality rate is still unacceptably high, indicating the need for clear recommendations in the management of patients with sCAP. The choice of empirical antibiotic therapy for sCAP depends on multiple factors, such as national and local antimicrobial susceptibility data and the characteristics of the patients, including their risk factors for acquiring infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Currently, there are several published international guidelines. The aim of this review is to explore the areas that require further knowledge and new recommendations for current clinical practice.

### Comparing current US and European guidelines for nosocomial pneumonia [^113CKod4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the last 2 years, two major guidelines for the management of nosocomial pneumonia have been published: The International European Respiratory Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases/Asociación Latinoamericana de Toráx guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the American guidelines for management of adults with HAP and VAP; both the guidelines made important clinical recommendations for the management of patients.

Recent Findings

With the increasing emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, paired with a relative reduction in new antibiotic development, nosocomial infections have become one of the most significant issues affecting global healthcare today. Despite several stark differences between the European and American guidelines, they are in agreement about many aspects of nosocomial pneumonia management.

Summary

American and European guidelines promote prompt and appropriate empiric treatment which is immediately guided by local microbiological data, followed by an adequate de-escalation protocol based on culture results with a 1-week course of treatment. Both also questioned the use of biomarkers in HAP/VAP, whether as part of the diagnosis or daily assessment of patients. On the contrary, they have conflicting views in regards to the optimum method of diagnosis, the risk factors used to stratify patients, the use of clinical scoring systems and the various antibiotic classes used. All were presented with varying levels of evidence to support these differences in opinion, indicating that further research into these areas is required before a consensus can be agreed upon.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^112jNuZQ]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Method

Following the release of the NICE Pneumonia Guideline, a small working group was convened under the auspices of the BTS Standards of Care Committee to review the BTS CAP Guideline recommendations taking into account NICE guidance. Each BTS recommendation was mapped to the relevant NICE Guideline recommendation(s), where applicable. Clinical judgement was applied to determine if any 'major differences' existed; in this context, the term 'major difference' is applied to denote a difference in the details of a recommendation that might mean a change in clinical practice, it does not describe the magnitude of any potential impact on clinical practice.

All BTS recommendations were annotated according to the following three levels: (1) Not included in NICE Guideline–BTS recommendation remains valid, (2) Overlap between NICE and BTS recommendations but no major difference exists — BTS recommendation remains valid and (3) Overlap between NICE and BTS recommendations, some difference exists.

Due to differences in the methods used to grade the levels of evidence in each guideline, it was not possible to compare the strength of recommendations between guidelines.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — scope and key clinical questions focus on suspected pneumonia or influenza in nonimmunocompromised patients and frame eight PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions across diagnosis and treatment. The guideline states it "do[es] not include acute bronchitis and other upper respiratory tract infections" and "exclude[s] patients who are immunocompromised". It reports "Eight PICO questions were formulated", addressing diagnostic confirmation (chest radiography plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone; C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin rather than symptoms alone to predict pneumonia; diagnostic algorithm/clinical prediction rule/diagnostic score plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia; microbiological testing plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia) and therapeutic strategies (antibiotics vs no antibiotics; nonantibiotic therapy vs none; antibiotics with atypical coverage vs without atypical coverage; antiviral therapy vs no antiviral therapy with outcomes including antibiotic prescriptions, visits, hospitalizations, or mortality).

### Improving discrimination in predicting level of care needed for patients admitted with pneumonia [^1121Zy9y]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Here, we examined the use of this score to risk stratify patients with pneumonia. We focused on pneumonia because it represents a relatively large population of patients with a single admission diagnosis, for which risk models already exist. We compared the ability of our score to predict clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and escalation of care, with the CURB-65 score — the score that is currently used in our hospital for this purpose. If it performs better, our new score could easily be displayed to clinicians in real time based on information available in the computer system of any modern hospital. This could be a valuable guide for decisions such as whether to admit the patient, and to what setting.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^114BR9op]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^114HPDhK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) was published by REMAP-CAP Investigators and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of hydrocortisone in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia? In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the population was: 658 patients (258 female, 400 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the ICU with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were residents of a nursing home or long-term care facility; inpatient in any healthcare facility within the last 30 days; imminent death; hypersensitivity to corticosteroids; chronic systemic corticosteroid use; lapse of > 24 hours since ICU admission. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the interventions were: n = 536 hydrocortisone (intravenous dose of 50 mg every 6 hours for 7 days) n = 122 no hydrocortisone (no course of corticosteroids). In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 90 (15% vs. 9.8%; OR 1.56, 95% CI 0 to 3.12). In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients admitted to the ICU with severe community-acquired pneumonia, hydrocortisone was not superior to no hydrocortisone with respect to death at day 90.

### Rethinking the concepts of community-acquired and health-care-associated pneumonia [^116eSY19]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

The increasing numbers of patients who are elderly and severely disabled has led to the introduction of a new category of pneumonia management: health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). An analysis of the available evidence in support of this category, however, reveals heterogeneous and misleading definitions of HCAP, reliance on microbiological data of questionable validity, failure to recognise the contribution of aspiration pneumonia, failure to control microbial patterns for functional status, and failure to recognise frequently applied restrictions of treatment escalation as bias in assessing outcomes. As a result, the concept of HCAP contributes to confusion more than it provides a guide to pneumonia management, and it potentially leads to overtreatment. We suggest a reassignment of the criteria for HCAP to reconstruct the triad of community-acquired pneumonia (with a recognised core group of elderly and disabled patients and a subgroup of younger patients), hospital-acquired pneumonia, and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients.

### Deaths from bacterial pneumonia during 1918–19 influenza pandemic [^116xAydP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Implications

Why is it important to determine the major pathophysiologic pathways that led to deaths during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic? After all, the effective prevention and treatment of influenza infections during a future pandemic would prevent all secondary effects, including opportunistic bacterial pneumonias. Yet concerns exist that an effective strain-specific vaccine and effective antiviral drugs may not be produced and distributed to all at-risk populations in time to mitigate the effects of the next pandemic. In the absence of an effective influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs, circumstances during a modern influenza pandemic could resemble those in 1918–19, with the notable exception of the availability of bacterial vaccines and antibacterial drugs. The exclusive focus on the prevention and treatment of a novel strain of influenza virus is risky because it unnecessarily limits options and opportunities for other potentially effective prevention and treatment methods, especially in medically underserved populations in less-developed countries.

We suggest that preparations for the next influenza pandemic should focus on more than preventing and treating influenza virus infections. A modified influenza pandemic plan might include the following components: 1) Before a pandemic, expand indications for and decrease barriers to receipt of vaccination against S. pneumoniae. 2) During a pandemic, in communities not yet affected, universally vaccinate with a safe and effective strain-specific influenza vaccine, if available. 3) During local epidemics, treat all serious clinical cases with an antibacterial agent that is effective against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, and S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus); isolate patients with clinical cases from other patients and as many others as possible (, –). 4) Conduct pandemic-related surveillance that tracks the incidence, nature (e.g. species, affected sites, antimicrobial drug sensitivities), and outcomes of bacterial infections that complicate influenza cases.

### Impact of empirical treatment recommendations from 2017 European guidelines for nosocomial pneumonia [^112m8Ay8]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of nosocomial pneumonia represents a major challenge in the ICU. European guidelines from 2017 proposed an algorithm for the prescription of empirical antimicrobial treatment based on medical history, local ecology, and severity (ie, presence or absence of septic shock). We assessed this algorithm's usefulness by comparing outcomes with and without guideline adherence in a population at high risk of multiresistance and mortality.

Research Question

Are the recommendations of the latest European guidelines effective in reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes in patients with nosocomial pneumonia admitted to the ICU?

Study Design and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 507 patients from 6 ICUs in our center. To minimize bias, we only included patients with microbiologically confirmed pneumonia. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, ICU mortality, inadequate treatment, treatment failure, and overtreatment.

Results

In total, 315 patients met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were comparable in the groups with and without guideline adherence, except for overtreatment, which was higher when guidelines were followed (42.5% vs 66.3%; P < .001). In the subgroup without septic shock treated according to guidelines, reductions were noted in both ICU mortality (28.8% vs 14.5%; p = 0.031) and adjusted 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.13–7.85; p = 0.027). By contrast, no benefit was observed when patients presented with septic shock at diagnosis.

Interpretation

Our findings indicate that the European guideline treatment algorithm is effective in reducing mortality in patients without septic shock but not in those with septic shock at the time of diagnosis. Future studies should clarify whether adjustments need to be made to improve outcomes in patients with septic shock.

### Identification and selection of cases and controls in the pneumonia etiology research for child health project [^115DLh8b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

For PERCH, we will exclude as controls children with case-defining severe or very severe pneumonia but not those with symptoms of URTI or nonsevere pneumonia. Including controls with respiratory illness will give us an opportunity to explore the role of nasopharyngeal infection in the pathogenesis of pneumonia through subgroup analyses. Exploratory questions that can be examined with a URTI subgroup include: (1) Is the URTI in the causal pathway (a gradient of infection)? (2) Which pathogens commonly cause URTI but rarely pneumonia? and (3) Is a virus a facilitating cofactor in pneumonia caused by a bacterial pathogen? If a sufficient number of controls with nonsevere pneumonia are enrolled, we can test the relationship between etiology and intermediary stages on the causal pathway to severe pneumonia. Specifically, we can assess whether the etiologic spectrum of nonsevere pneumonia is more similar to URTI, severe pneumonia, or somewhere in between. Although defining distinct respiratory syndromes that can occur along the continuum of respiratory infections will be challenging because symptoms of each syndrome will overlap, use of standardized definitions and training will help limit misclassification.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^113g7e1v]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is ongoing use of chest radiographs in the management of suspected community-acquired pneumonia in children by clinicians in the developed world that runs contrary to the recommendations of existing guidelines. There is also continued use of chest radiographs by clinicians in the developing world who have a frequent and well-founded concern regarding the identification of tuberculosis as a cause of acute respiratory disease. Guidelines are designed to assist clinicians but should not be considered prescriptive, especially considering the rapidly evolving presentation of pneumonia, ongoing advances in imaging technology, changes in patient management and differing geographic contexts of the practitioner. In addition, radiologists must work to improve radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia, reach consensus on the interpretive terminology that clarifies their confidence regarding the presence of pneumonia and act to replace one imaging technique with another whenever there is proof of improved accuracy or reliability.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Epidemiology and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia [^114qq7Rj]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The seriousness of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), despite being a reasonably common and potentially lethal disease, often is under estimated by physicians and patients alike. CAP results in more than 10 million visits to physicians, 64 million days of restricted activity, and 600,000 hospitalizations. This article discusses the epidemiology and bacterial causes of CAP in immunocompetent adults and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) adults — Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions at diagnosis: We recommend not obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture routinely in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP, especially if they are intubated (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence); or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### Update of the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU [^11326oRW]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

This point of view article summarizes the recently published literature on the management of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill patients that require invasive respiratory support, both those arising from hospital wards that ultimately require ICU admission and those associated with mechanical ventilation. Experts were selected on the basis of their contrasted experience in the field of nosocomial infections, including specialists in anaesthesia and in intensive care medicine. An extensive search of the literature was performed by the authors using the MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane library databases, from 2009 to October 2019, aimed to retrieve relevant studies on diagnosis and treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in ICU patients especially randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), systematic reviews, meta-analysis and expert consensus articles. Priorities have been established in regard to the management, agreed by the group and based on risk factors for their development and prognostic factors. Moreover, the most important clinical entities, methods of rapid diagnostics in clinical microbiological available and new antibiotic treatments recently added to the therapeutic options have been reviewed and updated. After the analysis of the priorities outlined, recommendations that can be applied have been included. An algorithm that takes into account the priorities analysed to update empirical and targeted treatment in ICUs has also been designed.
