## Question

Is it too early to increase the Ritalin dose for a patient who just started school this week, as the mother requests due to disruptive behavior?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is too early to increase a child's Ritalin dose after disruptive behavior in the first week of school. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled titration schedule for immediate-release methylphenidate in pediatrics. Then, I should verify the recommended assessment interval at a given dose and the "start low, go slow" principle. Next, I should consider contextual confounders from the new school transition and assess risk–benefit tradeoffs of early escalation. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline interim nonpharmacologic supports and monitoring to clarify response versus situational effects.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the key question. The child just started school this week, the mother reports disruptive behavior, and she is requesting a dose increase now; I need to ensure I don't conflate a situational adjustment reaction with true pharmacologic nonresponse, especially in the first week of a new academic environment, which often temporarily worsens behavior independent of medication dose.

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling for pediatric dosing and titration of immediate-release Ritalin. The label recommends starting at 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) and increasing by 5–10 mg at weekly intervals as needed, with a maximum of 60 mg/day; it also advises that if no improvement is seen after appropriate dosage adjustment over about one month, discontinuation should be considered, which implies allowing adequate time at each dose before changing again [^115SVGP3].

> Hold on, I should confirm the general dosing principle. The "start low, go slow" approach is emphasized to minimize adverse effects that can appear before benefits are clear, thereby avoiding premature discontinuation or unnecessary escalation; weekly or slower titration based on tolerability and response is recommended, particularly in children where sensitivity to side effects is common [^1121hADU].

> I need to check the appropriate assessment period at a given dose. Although clinical response to immediate-release methylphenidate can be observable within days, evidence-based practice and the FDA schedule point to weekly dose adjustments, allowing several days to a week to evaluate efficacy and side effects with input from parents and teachers before making a change, rather than escalating within the first few days of a new dose or during a major environmental transition [^1121hADU] [^117Az1RR].

> But wait, what if the disruptive behavior is primarily driven by the school transition rather than insufficient stimulant exposure? New classroom routines, novel demands, separation stress, and changes in structure can transiently exacerbate behavior, and guidelines encourage optimizing behavioral and school-based interventions during such transitions before changing medication, so I should not jump to conclusions that this is pharmacologic failure in week one of school [^1145xUKk] [^115Xj9pb].

> Let me consider the risk–benefit profile of premature dose escalation. Increasing too soon can unmask or amplify adverse effects (insomnia, appetite suppression, irritability) and confound interpretation of whether deterioration is drug-related or environmentally driven; it may also incrementally increase cardiovascular parameters (small average increases in heart rate and blood pressure), so clearer baseline behavior under stable conditions is preferable before escalating, in line with labeling and safety monitoring guidance [^112kgPuK] [^114sAuff] [^117Az1RR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a mid-week dose increase might be acceptable if impairment is severe, but I should double-check the label's cadence; the FDA guidance specifies weekly increments, which argues against changing dose within just a few days, particularly when a salient confounder like school start is present, so adhering to the weekly titration interval is more defensible here [^117Az1RR] [^115SVGP3].

> Next, I should review immediate alternatives to escalation. I will now examine nonpharmacologic supports: request structured teacher rating scales, adjust classroom seating and routines, increase home–school communication, and monitor daily for efficacy and side effects; this aligns with guideline-based multimodal management and provides cleaner data to inform any dose change at the next appropriate weekly interval if needed [^1145xUKk] [^115Xj9pb].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I need to ensure the decision aligns with evidence and context. Given the first-week-of-school confounding and the FDA's weekly titration schedule, it is too early to increase the Ritalin dose right now; maintain the current dose for at least a week with close monitoring, optimize behavioral and school supports, and reassess with standardized ratings before considering a dose increase at the next weekly interval under the "start low, go slow" framework [^117Az1RR] [^1121hADU] [^1145xUKk].

---

Yes, it is **too soon** to increase the Ritalin dose after just one week of school [^1145xUKk]. Wait at least **1–2 weeks** at the current dose to allow for school adjustment and to assess response and side effects [^117Az1RR]. Dose changes should be based on **structured teacher ratings and direct observation**, not solely on parent report [^1145xUKk]. If symptoms persist after this period, titrate by 5–10 mg weekly as needed [^117Az1RR], with close monitoring of efficacy and adverse effects [^114sAuff].

---

## Recommended titration schedule for methylphenidate

- **Initial dose**: 5 mg twice daily [^117Az1RR] (before breakfast and lunch) [^115SVGP3].
- **Titration**: Increase by 5–10 mg weekly [^117Az1RR] based on response and tolerability [^1145xUKk].
- **Maximum dose**: 60 mg/day [^117Az1RR] [^115SVGP3].

---

## Clinical guidelines on timing of dose adjustments

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing and gradual titration** [^1145xUKk] to balance efficacy and side effects [^113p8UYm]. The AAP recommends titrating to achieve maximal benefit with tolerable side effects [^1145xUKk], typically **over several weeks**. Early dose changes can obscure the true response and increase adverse effects [^1121hADU].

---

## Risks associated with rapid dose escalation

Rapid dose escalation can increase **adverse effects**, including:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Elevated blood pressure [^114sAuff] and heart rate [^115wTN5y].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety [^115iQSnx], irritability, aggression [^112kgPuK], and rare psychotic symptoms.
- **Growth suppression**: Reduced appetite [^112Srosq] and slowed growth [^111bGuuB].

---

## Importance of monitoring and assessment

Careful monitoring is **essential** [^1145xUKk] to optimize outcomes and minimize risks. Clinicians should use structured teacher ratings and direct observation to guide adjustments, because parent reports alone may not accurately reflect school behavior.

---

## Recommended approach in this scenario

Because the patient has just started school, it is **premature to increase the dose** based solely on early parent reports. The recommended approach is:

- **Maintain current dose**: Continue the current dose for at least 1–2 weeks to allow school adjustment and accurate assessment [^117Az1RR].
- **Collect structured data**: Obtain teacher ratings and direct observations to guide dose changes [^1145xUKk].
- **Reassess after 1–2 weeks**: If symptoms persist, titrate by 5–10 mg weekly with close monitoring [^117Az1RR] [^114sAuff].

---

## Conclusion

It is **too soon to increase the Ritalin dose** after just one week of school [^1145xUKk]. Maintain the current dose for **1–2 weeks** [^117Az1RR], collect structured teacher ratings, then titrate gradually if needed [^1121hADU], balancing efficacy and side effects.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^111mt4Kk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently present with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, which are the cardinal symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The effectiveness of methylphenidate, a commonly used ADHD treatment, is therefore of interest in these children.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of methylphenidate on symptoms of ADHD (inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity) and ASD (impairments in social interaction and communication, and repetitive, restricted, or stereotypical behaviors) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with ASD.

- **Search methods**: In November 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 11 other databases, and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of methylphenidate versus placebo on the core symptoms of ASD or ADHD-like symptoms, or both, in children aged 6 to 18 years who were diagnosed with ASD or pervasive developmental disorder. The primary outcome was clinical efficacy, defined as an improvement in ADHD-like symptoms (inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity) and in the core symptoms of ASD (impaired social interaction, impaired communication, and stereotypical behaviors), and overall ASD. Secondary outcomes examined were the rate of adverse events; caregiver well-being; need for institutionalization, special schooling, or therapy to achieve learning outcomes; and overall quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of immediate-release methylphenidate treatment for preschoolers with ADHD [^115o83bX]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) was a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). It was conducted as a six-center, randomized, controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of immediate-release methylphenidate (MPH-IR), given three times daily to children ages 3 to 5.5 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- **Method**: The 8-phase, 70-week PATS protocol included two double-blind, controlled phases. It involved a crossover-titration trial followed by a placebo-controlled parallel trial. The crossover-titration phase's primary efficacy measure was a combined score from the Swanson, Kotkin, Atkins, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) plus the Conners, Loney, and Milich (CLAM) rating scales. The parallel phase's primary outcome measure was an excellent response based on composite scores on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP) rating scale.

- **Results**: Of 303 preschoolers enrolled, 165 were randomized into the titration trial. Compared with placebo, significant decreases in ADHD symptoms were found on MPH at 2.5 mg (p < 0.01), 5 mg (p < 0.001), and 7.5 mg (p < 0.001) doses three times daily, but not for 1.25 mg (p < 0.06). The mean optimal MPH total daily dose for the entire group was 14.2 ± 8.1 mg/day (0.7 ± 0.4 mg/kg/day). For the preschoolers (n = 114) later randomized into the parallel phase, only 21% on best-dose MPH and 13% on placebo achieved the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA)-defined categorical criterion for remission set for school-age children with ADHD.

- **Conclusions**: MPH-IR, delivered in 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg doses three times daily, produced significant reductions in ADHD symptom scales in preschoolers compared to placebo. However, the effect sizes (0.4–0.8) were smaller.

### Cardiac safety of methylphenidate versus amphetamine salts in the treatment of ADHD [^117FjR7C]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Safety concerns about central nervous system stimulants for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include adverse cardiac effects. This study aimed to compare the risk of cardiac events in users of methylphenidate and amphetamine salts.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort design using claims data from the Florida Medicaid fee-for-service program, representing a total of 2,131,953 children and adolescents, was employed. The analysis included all beneficiaries who were between 3 and 20 years of age, enrolled between July 1994 and June 2004, had at least one physician diagnosis of ADHD, and were newly started on methylphenidate or amphetamine salts. Each month of follow-up was classified according to stimulant use into current use or former use. We defined cardiac events as the first emergency department (ED) visit for cardiac disease or symptoms. The risk between users of methylphenidate versus amphetamine salts and former users of drugs in these categories was compared using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model. This model adjusted for differences in gender; race; age; year of the index date; disability; congenital anomalies; history of circulatory disease; history of hospital admission; and use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and bronchodilators.

- **Results**: A total of 456 youth visited the ED for cardiac reasons during 52,783 years of follow-up. After adjustment for differences in covariates, the risk for cardiac ED visits was similar among users of methylphenidate and amphetamines. Periods of former use had a similar risk.

### Limits of meta-analysis: Methylphenidate in the treatment of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116W7PRC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults advocate methylphenidate as a first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of methylphenidate treatment of adult ADHD and to examine the influence of methods on meta-analytic results. Electronic databases were searched to identify clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo in the treatment of adult ADHD. Studies were summarized with meta-analytic methods.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Conducted with respect to parallel group versus cross-over trials and self versus observer ratings.

- **Relationship between dosage and effect size**: Explored by weighted regression analysis. The results were tested for publication bias, and several sensitivity analyses were performed. Findings and methods were compared with a previous meta-analysis.

Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 16 were included in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size (d = 0.42) was significantly different from zero, but was only half the size expected on the basis of a previous meta-analysis. No significant differences could be observed in the subgroup analyses. The regression analysis showed no significant influence of mean daily dose on effect size.

These results contradict findings of a previous meta-analysis and challenge guideline recommendations. Methodological issues in meta-analyses are discussed.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^113rA9Gf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

While the maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children (except for osmotic release and prolonged release formulations, see below) is 60 mg/day in many countries, some guidelines, such as those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA) and other documents, recommend higher doses. For example, the British National Formulary (BNF) recommends a dose of up to 90 mg/day, under the direction of a specialist. For osmotic-release and prolonged-release formulations of methylphenidate, the maximum licensed dose is 54 mg/day; however, the BNF mentions a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta XL® in children, as well as in adults.

Some prescribers may fail to optimize the dose of treatment to achieve the maximum benefit with the highest tolerated dose, being satisfied with only a moderate improvement in the severity of symptoms. Meta-analytic evidence based on flexible-dose trials for both methylphenidate and amphetamines shows increased efficacy and reduced likelihood of discontinuations for any reason with increasing stimulant doses, up to the maximum FDA-licensed dose. Also, meta-analytic evidence in adults (not available in children) indicates that, at the group level, doses beyond the licensed ones are generally not associated with a favorable benefit–risk profile. However, it is important to appreciate that individual patients may benefit from, and tolerate well, doses beyond the licensed ones. While it should not be a standard practice, using doses beyond the maximum recommended ones could be considered when the patient has presented with…

### Treatment outcomes with licensed and unlicensed stimulant doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138w7NB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) are often prescribed at unlicensed doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Whether dose escalation beyond US Food and Drug Administration recommendations is associated with positive risk benefits is unclear.

- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of stimulant doses on treatment outcomes in adults with ADHD and to determine whether unlicensed doses are associated with positive risk benefits compared with licensed doses based on averages.

- **Data sources**: Twelve databases were searched, including published (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Sciences) and unpublished (ClinicalTrials.gov) literature, up to February 22, 2023, without language restrictions.

- **Study selection**: Two researchers independently screened records to identify double-blinded randomized clinical trials of stimulants against placebo in adults (18 years and older) with ADHD.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Aggregate data were extracted and synthesized in random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and network meta-analyses.

- **Main outcome measures**: Change in ADHD symptoms and discontinuations due to adverse events.

- **Results**: A total of 47 randomized clinical trials (7714 participants; mean age, 35 years; SD, 11 years; 4204 male [56%]) were included. For methylphenidate, dose-response curves indicated additional reductions of symptoms with increments in doses, but the gains were progressively smaller and accompanied by a continued additional risk of adverse event dropouts. Network meta-analyses showed that unlicensed doses also resulted in comparable findings.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^112kgPuK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Aggression: Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the post-marketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility.

Seizures: There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with a prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued.

Priapism: Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.

Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Stimulants, including methylphenidate HCl, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^116vC4sb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, or both, along with hyperactivity. These symptoms affect children, adolescents, and adults. In some countries, methylphenidate is the primary treatment option for adults with moderate or severe ADHD. However, the evidence on the efficacy and adverse events of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in adults is limited and controversial.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and harms (adverse events) of IR methylphenidate for treating ADHD in adults.

- **Search methods**: In January 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight additional databases, and three trial registers. We also reviewed internal reports on the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration websites. Citations of included trials were checked to identify additional trials not captured by the electronic searches.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with placebo or other pharmacological interventions (including extended-release formulations of methylphenidate) for ADHD in adults. Primary outcomes comprised changes in ADHD symptoms (efficacy) and harms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the clinical impression of severity and improvement, level of functioning, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Outcomes could have been rated by investigators or participants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data independently on the characteristics of the trials, participants, and interventions.

The 2024 AAAP/ASAM guidelines focus on managing patients with co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and stimulant use disorder. It is recommended to consider using extended-release formulations when initiating psychostimulant medications in these patients. Additionally, maintaining a level of monitoring that matches the risk profile of the prescribed medication and the patient is advised. This may include methods such as pill counts, drug testing, increased clinical contact, and more frequent checks of the prescription drug monitoring program. This guidance is based on clinical consensus and is strongly recommended.

### Editorial: Evidence concerning dose-dependent effects of stimulants on neurocognitive function in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^111nnyxD]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

The question of how stimulants affect cognitive function in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a challenging one that has been investigated across many studies. Part of the challenge lies in the difficulty of examining the range of cognitive functions that are now evidenced as areas of difficulty within a single study. A lack of studies examining the long-term effects of medication has also challenged advancement of knowledge in this area. When the available research is integrated, what is the conclusion regarding effects of stimulants on neurocognitive function?

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: A population-based cohort study [^113HGT9H]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

There is a clinical concern that prescribing methylphenidate, the most common pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), might increase the risk of psychotic events, particularly in young people with a history of psychosis. We aimed to determine whether the risk of psychotic events increases immediately after the initiation of methylphenidate treatment or, in the longer term, one year after treatment initiation in adolescents and young adults with and without a previously diagnosed psychotic disorder.

- **Methods**: In this cohort study, we used population-based observational data from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, the National Patient Register, and the Total Population Register. These registers contain data on all individuals in Sweden and provide information on sex, birth, death, migration, medication use, and psychotic events for all eligible participants. We screened individuals on these registers to identify those receiving methylphenidate treatment, who were aged 12–30 years at the start of treatment, for inclusion in the study. We used a within-individual design to compare the incidence of psychotic events in these individuals during the 12-week periods immediately before and after methylphenidate initiation. Longer-term risk was assessed by comparing the incidence of psychotic events 12 weeks before methylphenidate initiation and during a 12-week period one calendar year before the initiation of methylphenidate, with the incidence of these events during the 12-week period one calendar year after methylphenidate initiation.

### Ritalin [^112z8i94]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a CNS stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and narcolepsy is not known.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo enantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: A formal QT study has not been conducted in patients taking Ritalin. The effect of dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of Ritalin, on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open-label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study. This followed single doses of dexmethylphenidate XR 40 mg (maximum recommended adult total daily dosage) in 75 healthy volunteers. Electrocardiograms were collected up to 12 hours post-dose. Frederica's method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time-matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern, and there was no evident exposure-response relationship.

### The cardiovascular safety of methylphenidate [^116heBg3]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Regulatory labeling and treatment guidelines for stimulants express caution for use in children with personal or familial history of cardiovascular disease and call for routine monitoring of blood pressure. The study by Shin and colleagues underscores the need to consider the severity of ADHD symptoms and the option of non-stimulants for children with high cardiovascular risk, to avoid uses that are entirely off-label, and to closely monitor patients for whom stimulants are critical for their wellbeing and development.

### Editorial: Time for a new conversation on stimulant use [^111bGuuB]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Psychostimulants are one of the safest and most efficacious pharmacological interventions for a psychiatric disorder. In 1999, the groundbreaking Multimodal Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) Study set the standard of care for long-term treatment for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since then, stimulant use has increased substantially around the world. Because ADHD is a chronic condition, guidelines recommend re-evaluating the continued use of stimulant medications over many years to assess symptom relief and associated poor academic, social, and work-life functioning. Although few long-term adverse effects have been identified, growth suppression was documented in early adulthood in the MTA cohort, with the stimulant-treated group showing an average height decrement from the untreated group of 2.55 cm or 1.00 inch.

In the issue of JAACAP, Greenhill et al. build on this earlier report. They compare growth trajectories for the self-selected ADHD stimulant medication groups and a normative comparison group. The study demonstrates differences in the shape of growth trajectories, especially during puberty, and finds that a greater total lifetime dose of stimulants is associated with increased height suppression and, not previously described, greater gain in weight and body mass index (BMI). In young adulthood, consistent stimulant users were shorter than negligible users by an estimated 4.06 cm or 1.60 inches and heavier by an estimated 4.50 kg or 9.95 pounds. The clinical implications of these findings raise important considerations for long-term treatment strategies in managing ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged 4–5 years. This is advised if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is a moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the patient's functioning. It is important to weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

The mean single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters in 36 healthy adults following the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets 18 mg once daily and methylphenidate 5 mg three times daily are summarized in Table 7.

- **Methylphenidate pharmacokinetic parameters**: The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in healthy adults following single- and multiple-dose administration (steady state) of doses up to 144 mg per day, which is 2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of these tablets. The mean half-life was about 3.6 hours. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of the tablets were noted following single and repeated once-daily dosing, indicating no significant drug accumulation. The area under the curve (AUC) and the half-life (t1/2) following repeated once-daily dosing are similar to those following the first dose of extended-release tablets in a dose range of 18 mg to 144 mg.

- **Effect of food**: There were no differences in either the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic performance of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets when administered following a high-fat breakfast. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarize literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed, and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently, there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults, and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^112bkwRs]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 5.3% of youths and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD present increased risks for a wide array of psychiatric and somatic conditions, serious functional outcomes, and premature death. This makes the delivery of safe and effective treatments, that improve both the core symptoms and related impairments, a key public health issue. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that ADHD medications are effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms, and large observational studies further indicate they are associated with lower risks of real-world outcomes, including injuries, crime, transport crashes, suicide attempts, and unnatural-cause mortality.

Until recent years, in many countries, the administrative prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was much lower than the estimated epidemiological prevalence. However, the diagnosis of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication has increased substantially worldwide over the last decade. A recent study reported an annual rise of 9.7% in ADHD medication use across 64 countries between 2015 and 2019. Sweden has seen a particularly sharp increase in ADHD medication use over the years. From 2006 to 2020, ADHD medication use in children increased nearly fivefold, from 0.6% to 2.8%, and more than tenfold in adults, from 0.1% to 1.3% during this period, positioning Sweden among countries with the highest rates of ADHD medication prescription globally. Similar trends are seen in other European countries.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^1168Qirm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

What are my pharmacological choices for the management of aggression in a child with ASD when standard options seem to have failed?

For some children, behavioural interventions combined with 'first line' medications such as those suggested above fail to alleviate symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, and it is crucial at the outset that these are explored. The diagnostic formulation may have missed an important aetiological factor, or previously identified triggers or perpetuating factors may have been inadequately managed. For example, an environment with certain characteristics, such as routine, predictability, and appropriate level of stimulation, may not be made available. Or there may be an absence of adequately trained support staff, and staff may fail to follow behavioural recommendations. In these circumstances, it is crucial that medication does not become the perceived 'solution'. It is unethical for the psychiatrist to be expected to medicate where services are unable to meet needs.

On the other hand, there will be situations where challenging behaviour continues despite attention to all identified aetiological factors. Such situations are most likely to arise in the context of non-verbal autistic children who are severely or profoundly cognitively impaired. While it remains important to continue to work towards a greater understanding of the behaviour's underpinning, this is often very challenging, and medication may thus be considered as a least restrictive, best interest option in consultation with decision-makers.

### Common practical questions and answers at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116qw8bT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

In cases of moderate-to-severe ADHD with tics, ADHD symptoms are likely to require treatment with psychostimulants, which are the first-line treatment choice for ADHD. Therefore, in cases such as this where tics are also present, augmenting methylphenidate with guanfacine to address the symptoms of both conditions seems preferable. Using guanfacine in this respect also may benefit ADHD symptoms. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, and combined treatment showed no differences in safety or tolerability.

While acknowledging that when prescribing for children and young people, it is optimal for them to receive as few medications as possible at the lowest dose to achieve desired clinical goals, when there is clear impairment from both disorders, it may be beneficial to combine treatment. Therefore, especially when ADHD symptoms are more severe and impairing, a combination of methylphenidate and guanfacine is worth considering.

The addition of guanfacine can also potentially benefit sleep difficulties and nighttime settling and decrease the need for alternatives such as melatonin, which may be beneficial to consider.

- **Consideration of antipsychotics over clonidine/guanfacine for tics**: In a recent prescribing survey among 59 European expert clinicians who were members of the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome, the most commonly used medications for tics in children and adolescents in descending order were aripiprazole, clonidine, tiapride (not available in the United Kingdom).

### Driving performance and ocular activity following acute administration of 10 mg methylphenidate: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113FECVX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). High credibility.

Given the relatively low complexity of the simulated highway drive, the demands on gaze behavior and the necessity for frequent and varied eye movements may be low. Consequently, the repetitive nature of the task may have resulted in a ceiling effect, where the range of required eye movements is inherently limited, regardless of the internal state of the driver. The outcomes of this study should be contextualized with the recognition that real-world driving involves navigating through a broad spectrum of environments. In naturalistic and more challenging driving scenarios that involve direct safety risk and demand greater visuospatial attention, such as maneuvering through urban roads or navigating heavy traffic, a more significant effect of methylphenidate on gaze behavior and scanning efficiency might become apparent.

Furthermore, we used a relatively low, acute dose of methylphenidate in this study, which reflects typical introductory therapeutic doses. Thus, we acknowledge that this may not fully capture alterations associated with higher acute doses or patterns of change following chronic usage, which are arguably more common in real-world misuse scenarios and likely associated with RTCs. The dose-related limitation in the present study is reflective of much of the clinical experimental work assessing acute amphetamine effects, which is limited by complex ethical and methodological constraints. Future research should therefore consider varying the dosing regimens, including higher and repeated doses over extended periods.

### Methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and drug relapse in criminal offenders with substance dependence: A 24-week randomized placebo-controlled trial [^111agSon]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Although efforts were made to maintain blinding, 48% of the participants receiving MPH and 48% of the placebo group identified their medication correctly during the titration phase or after reaching the maximum dose. However, many of the participants in both treatment groups remained uncertain (41% MPH, 26% placebo) or were wrong (11% MPH, 26% placebo) about which treatment arm they were allocated to.

Strengths of the study include trial length, dose range, and an objectively verifiable primary outcome measure. Taken together, the results in the present study suggest that diagnosing and treating ADHD in abstinent patients with comorbid ADHD and SUD is both feasible and effective, as it enhances the retention to treatment for SUD following release from prison, reduces the likelihood of a relapse, and improves ADHD symptoms.

### Once-a-day Concerta methylphenidate versus three-times-daily methylphenidate in laboratory and natural settings [^114Gsvdv]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH), the most commonly prescribed drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has a short half-life, necessitating multiple daily doses. The need for multiple doses poses challenges with medication administration during school and after-school hours, affecting compliance. Previous long-acting stimulants have shown effects equivalent to twice-daily dosing of MPH. This study tests the efficacy and duration of action of an extended-release MPH preparation, designed to last 12 hours, equivalent to three-times-daily dosing.

- **Methods**: Sixty-eight children with ADHD, aged 6 to 12 years, participated in a within-subject, double-blind comparison of placebo, immediate-release (IR) MPH three times a day (tid), and Concerta, a once-daily MPH formulation. Three dosing levels of medication were used: 5 mg IR MPH tid/18 mg Concerta once a day (qd); 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta qd; and 15 mg IR MPH tid/54 mg Concerta qd. All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment, and each child's dose level was based on their MPH dosing before the study. The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to the daily doses of MPH that each child received. To achieve the ascending rate of MPH delivery necessary for continuous coverage, Concerta doses were 20% higher on a daily basis than a comparable tid regimen of IR MPH. Children received each medication condition for 7 days.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^112Srosq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication-treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years) without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.

Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth; however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

- **Visual disturbance**: Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.

- **Use in children less than six years of age**: Methylphenidate HCl should not be used in children under six years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.

### Cardiovascular safety of stimulant medications for pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115wTN5y]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder that is often treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts. Despite their efficacy and long history of use, there is concern about their potential for adverse cardiovascular effects in children and adolescents. Data from placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials published after 2000 were reviewed, and cardiovascular adverse event data were compared. Both placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials have repeatedly shown stimulant-induced increases in mean blood pressure, heart rate, and QT interval in children, adolescents, and adults. Although these increases seem relatively minor, their existence raises questions regarding whether stimulants could influence the likelihood of sudden death or other serious cardiovascular consequences, especially in patients with underlying heart problems. Moreover, questions have been raised regarding the necessity of screening patients for occult or unrecognized heart problems that are felt to be adversely affected by stimulant use. Obtaining a baseline electrocardiogram for any patient starting stimulant treatment is reasonable if access to such screening is readily available and not too costly.

### Common practical questions and answers at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the range of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses exceeding 300 mcg daily due to clonidine's sedating and hypotensive effects. However, some young patients may tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that sedation provides additional benefits to sleep and comorbidities. For these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. Clonidine can be divided into two or three doses, and often, children sensitive to guanfacine's side effects find a BD or TDS regimen of clonidine more suitable than the once-daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is ten times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors. In contrast, guanfacine appears more potent at postsynaptic receptors, which enhances prefrontal activity and impulse control, improving behavioral regulation. Therefore, when comorbidities require behavioral modification, guanfacine seems more effective.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines suggest 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, indicating a rough equivalency: Guanfacine 1 mg = Clonidine 100 mcg.

If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective, it is advisable to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

- **Bottom line**: Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^1121hADU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024).

- **Dosing**: Failing to 'start low and go slow' is a common pitfall. When initiating medication, adverse effects typically occur before therapeutic benefits are seen, which can lead to premature discontinuation. This can be avoided by gradual titration; 'starting low and going slow'. For example, initial syncope (due to postural hypotension) can be related to the initiation of clonidine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) and guanfacine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors). Sedation is potentially related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur. Doses of 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg guanfacine, and 0.5–1 mg aripiprazole once daily are suggested as appropriate initial doses. Titrations should use a weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly approach, depending on the response. However, the initial dose and titration speed could differ according to body weight, age, and other characteristics of the patient.

- **Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose**: When a medication has been initiated, it is important to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. In the case of clonidine, this relates to an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg, for aripiprazole around 5–10 mg daily, and for guanfacine between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents according to weight. Often, young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects.

### Methylphenidate for ADHD rejected from the who essential medicines list due to uncertainties in benefit-harm profile [^1124UCwg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder with estimated global prevalence rates between 3% and 5% in children and 2.5% in adults, depending on the classification system used. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD.

In this analysis article, we describe the evidence in the field, an application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised to the application, and the WHO Expert Committee's decision. The application for getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overzealous in reporting potential benefits without highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions encompassing medicines candidates for the WHO Model List should not be based on speculation about potential benefits and should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties.

Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning the benefits of this medication in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD is uncertain. The decision of the committee was to not include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm.

### Methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and drug relapse in criminal offenders with substance dependence: a 24-week randomized placebo-controlled trial [^113VsLTb]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

More than a decade of research has established that adults with substance use disorders (SUDs) show a high prevalence of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The disproportionately high prevalence rate of ADHD and SUDs in prison populations is noteworthy and represents a major public health problem and challenge to psychiatric and prison services globally.

Methylphenidate (MPH) appears to be an effective and safe treatment in adults with ADHD in doses up to 1.3 mg/kg; however, evidence is lacking on the efficacy of stimulant pharmacotherapy to treat comorbid ADHD and SUDs. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy for ADHD in SUDs, primarily cocaine dependence, have evaluated the utility of MPH in users and in recently abstinent users. Globally, however, the number of amphetamine-type stimulant users (estimated at 34 million) far exceeds the number of opiate and cocaine users combined. Recently, a high rate of ADHD has been reported in amphetamine users. Therefore, management of ADHD in amphetamine-dependent patients is of major importance.

A common denominator in clinical trials of MPH in adults with ADHD and SUDs conducted at the time of writing is the dose (60–90 mg/day) tested. While effective in patients without a history of SUDs, this dose level could be insufficient for the SUD population and might explain the poor treatment effects seen in earlier clinical trials. Evidence from brain imaging studies suggests that long-term drug use may down-regulate brain dopamine systems in chronic drug-dependent individuals, leading to challenges in treatment efficacy.

### Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride [^115zcsFk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years through two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, the safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 6 years of age have not been established. Furthermore, the long-term efficacy of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients remains unestablished.

- **Long-term suppression of growth**: Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may require an interruption in their treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Juvenile animal toxicity data**:
	- Rats treated with racemic methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation exhibited decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. Additionally, a deficit in acquiring a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least six times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to children, on a mg/m² basis.
	- In a study conducted in young rats, racemic methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for nine weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal week 10). When tested as adults (postnatal Weeks 13 to 14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in both males and females.

In specific circumstances involving attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly for patients with stimulant use disorder, the 2024 AAAP/ASAM guidelines recommend arranging for a parent, health professional, such as a trained school nurse, or another trusted adult to directly observe the administration of medication. This is especially important when using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder and ADHD. Additionally, it is advisable to counsel families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

### Model-based approach for optimizing study design and clinical drug performances of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate for the treatment of ADHD [^113ykuWr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is currently used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several extended-release (ER) formulations, characterized by a dual release process, were developed to improve efficacy over an extended duration. In this study, a model-based approach using literature data was developed to:

1. Evaluate the most efficient pharmacokinetic (PK) model to characterize the complex PK profile of MPH ER formulations.
2. Provide PK endpoint metrics for comparing ER formulations.
3. Define criteria for optimizing the development of ER formulations using a convolution-based model linking in vitro release, in vivo release, and hour-by-hour behavioral ratings of ADHD symptoms.
4. Define an optimized trial design for assessing the activity of MPH in pediatric populations.

The convolution-based model accurately described the complex PK profiles of a variety of ER MPH products. It provided a natural framework for establishing an in vitro/in vivo correlation and for defining criteria for assessing comparative bioequivalence of MPH ER products.

### Does long-term medication use improve the academic outcomes of youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^116CiMTr]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2012). Low credibility.

Youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently experience academic impairment, including lower grades than their peers and an elevated risk for grade retention and school dropout. Medication is the most commonly used treatment for youth with ADHD, and it is therefore essential to understand the extent to which medication use improves long-term academic functioning. This paper reviews the literature on the relation between long-term medication use and the academic outcomes of youth with ADHD.

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify pertinent studies published since 2000 that followed youth with ADHD for three or more years. Academic outcomes of interest included school grades, achievement test scores, and grade retention. Nine studies were identified, reporting on eight distinct longitudinal samples (N across studies = 8,721). These studies demonstrate that long-term medication use is associated with improvements in standardized achievement scores. However, the magnitude of these improvements is small, and the clinical or educational significance is questionable. Evidence for long-term improvements in school grades and grade retention is less compelling.

- **Methodological considerations**: This review highlights methodological considerations in providing directions for future research. The importance of using multiple sources to gather information about medication adherence is discussed, including the use of methodologies such as electronic monitors, rather than relying solely on parent reports or chart reviews. Future research should also examine a range of medication adherence definitions.

### Evaluation of methylphenidate safety and maximum-dose titration rationale in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A meta-analysis [^1121eNFn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence on the titration of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is lacking. However, this lack of evidence has not prevented medication guidelines from specifying apparently arbitrary dose limitations, which could discourage clinicians from titrating methylphenidate to higher and, perhaps, more efficacious doses for some patients.

To determine the evidence on dose titration and adverse events associated with dose titration of stimulants for ADHD, data sources like MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and PsycINFO from 1806 through April 1, 2019, were searched to identify relevant articles.

- **Study selection**: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the study was conducted on children up to 18 years of age; (2) children had a diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or hyperkinetic disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases codes; and (3) the dose of methylphenidate was determined by titration.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity were followed. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Jadad scoring system. Statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcomes of interest were: (1) the doses used in published clinical trials, (2) the clinical justification given by researchers for their selected dose range, and (3) the adverse effects associated with methylphenidate when the dose is established by titration.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention; they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD. Despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: In February 2015, we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index) and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behavior, and quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks.

### Efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in 45 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial [^115ZnZWZ]. Psychological Medicine (2004).

Data on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lacking in Europe. This study was undertaken to report on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in an adult outpatient population with ADHD and to compare results with US data.

- **Method**: A double-blind randomized crossover trial compared methylphenidate and placebo in 45 adults with ADHD with childhood onset in a dose-titration design. Methylphenidate was titrated from 0.5 mg/kg per day in week 1 up to 1.0 mg/kg per day in week 3.

- **Results**: Response rates using methylphenidate varied between 38% and 51%, while using placebo ranged from 7% to 18% (p < 0.05), depending on the outcome measure used. Although the overall percentage of subjects experiencing any side effects on both methylphenidate and placebo was rather high, side effects on methylphenidate over and above those on placebo were few and mild.

- **Conclusions**: Methylphenidate proves to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for symptoms of ADHD in adults in the short term. Future research should study the long-term response and clarify the impact of gender, co-morbidity, socioeconomic status, and IQ on response rates in adults with ADHD.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (For) [^117MmqwR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complex to design effectively, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as ADHD medications — such as methylphenidate, amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine — it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. Consequently, almost all RCT evidence for ADHD medications pertains to short-term studies, which provide strong evidence for short-term efficacy. However, they do not address long-term effectiveness.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence on long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that are typically needed for several years. They introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy. This is generally achieved through randomized withdrawal designs, aimed at demonstrating continued efficacy over a period of 6 to 12 months. Several such studies have been completed and published; all, as expected, indicate continued efficacy. The EMA also mandated that all new ADHD medications demonstrate ongoing effectiveness, with adverse effects and safety being assessed up to 2 years. Completed studies so far support continued effectiveness, and although they highlight common, expected adverse effects, no new adverse effects have been identified.

Definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days, these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects.

Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment (that may set a maximum for effectiveness). Magnitude of effectiveness (e.g. small, medium, or large effect size) depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors (including treatment adherence and study design).

Third, "long term" refers to a given time frame (e.g. 1 year), which can be applied to specify the duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment during the follow-up after it is discontinued. Given these definitions, the following questions address long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of new-onset seizures [^1133q3V6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually treated with stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (MPH). ADHD is associated with an increased risk of seizures, and in this context, concerns have been expressed that stimulant drugs, including MPH, may increase the seizure risk. However, four large observational studies have found that ADHD drugs in general, and stimulant drugs in particular, are not associated with increased seizure risk and may, in fact, be associated with a reduced risk of seizures. These studies were largely conducted in children and adolescents, including those with epilepsy, with or without other brain comorbidities. The findings were obtained in both between-subjects and within-subjects analyses; the latter controlled for time-invariant inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds.

These reassuring results support the findings of many small, short-duration trials that found MPH was not associated with increased seizure risk. One other observational study, however, found that MPH was indeed associated with an increased risk of seizures, but only during the first 30 days after drug initiation; there was no increase in risk in earlier or later time windows. There are many reasons why this single finding should be viewed with reservation. In any case, even if the finding is valid, the absolute risk of seizures with MPH appears to be very low. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that MPH may be safely used in children and adolescents, even those with a past history of epilepsy. However, prudence dictates that attention be given to monitoring during initial drug administration.

Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient.

- **Adults**: Administer in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. The average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily, while for others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m.

- **Children (6 years and over)**: Methylphenidate HCl should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued. If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. Methylphenidate HCl should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued. Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: A population-based cohort study [^113wUVro]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Further limitations of our study include an absence of information on methylphenidate dosage, missed doses, and the possibility that milder psychotic events not resulting in hospital visits might have been missed. Our pharmacovigilance study of methylphenidate was limited to psychotic events, and we did not consider other adverse effects or therapeutic benefits. We included the coding of drug-induced psychosis to ensure that stimulant-related psychotic adverse events were recorded. We did not select participants because of their ADHD diagnosis, although this is the only clinically indicated use for methylphenidate.

We studied clinically prescribed methylphenidate use, and so we cannot generalize our findings to non-clinically prescribed use. We cannot exclude the possible moderating effect of comorbid conditions on the effects of methylphenidate. Additionally, we did not study other, less frequently used ADHD medications such as atomoxetine and amphetamines (e.g. dexamphetamine), and hence, we cannot generalize our findings to these medications, which could carry different risks. Finally, we focused on psychotic events associated with methylphenidate treatment, but we did not assess concomitant medication use, including antipsychotics. Hence, we cannot determine from our study whether the risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate in individuals with a history of psychosis is moderated by antipsychotic medication.

In conclusion, contrary to clinical concerns, our study did not detect an increased risk of psychotic events in adolescents and young adults after methylphenidate treatment.

### Effects of a single-dose methylphenidate challenge on resting-state functional connectivity in stimulant-treatment naive children and adults with ADHD [^113qTbC5]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of acute methylphenidate on rs‐fMRI connectivity in stimulant‐treatment naïve children and adults with ADHD. In line with our hypotheses, we found that methylphenidate decreased measures of connectivity and centrality in subcortical ROIs in children with ADHD but increased the same metrics in adults with ADHD, indicating an age‐dependent acute effect of methylphenidate in dopamine‐sensitive regions. Surprisingly, we found no major effects of methylphenidate in frontal ROIs in either children or adults. Interestingly, at pre‐methylphenidate, participants with ADHD showed aberrant connectivity and centrality predominantly in frontal ROIs compared to controls.

- **Effect of methylphenidate in children with ADHD**: A recent review on the effects of stimulant medication on rs‐fMRI connectivity in individuals with ADHD shows that methylphenidate appears to modulate several rs‐fMRI networks, but the number of studies is small, and the results are heterogeneous (Pereira‐Sanchez et al.). In line with findings from Silk et al, we observed that acute methylphenidate decreased connectivity in the striatum and thalamus, whereas in the dACC, we found nonsignificant increases in connectivity following a single dose of methylphenidate. This is in agreement with a previous study reporting that acute methylphenidate increased connectivity in frontal regions (An et al.). Notwithstanding, our study has some methodological differences compared to previous studies. Firstly, all our participants were stimulant‐treatment naïve.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to May 13, 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, hand-searched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' generalisability, including the exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^1125Yco4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Safe and effective medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is available and recommended as the first-line treatment for the core symptoms of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness. Despite impaired functioning during adolescence, many individuals discontinue medication treatment. For children, healthcare decisions are usually made by parents, whereas older youth make their own decisions. Beliefs and attitudes can differ widely. Some families understand that ADHD is a neurobiological condition and accept that medication is indicated; for others, such treatment is unacceptable.

Converging evidence describes negative perceptions of the burden associated with medication use, as well as concerns about potential short- and long-term adverse effects. Indeed, experiences of adverse effects are a frequent explanation for discontinuation among youth. Ways to improve shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, and to monitor effectiveness, safety, and new onset of conditions are likely to optimize outcomes.

### Safety and tolerability of methylphenidate in preschool children with ADHD [^117LuZ5Q]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

To report on the safety and tolerability of methylphenidate (MPH) in children aged 3 to 5 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during one year of treatment, the study involved 183 children. The study included a 1-week open-label lead-in phase (n = 183), a 5-week placebo-controlled, double-blind phase (n = 165), a 5-week double-blind, parallel phase (n = 114), and 10 months of open-label maintenance (n = 140 entered, 95 completed). Mean total daily MPH doses increased from the titration trial best dose of 14.1 (± 8.1) mg/day to a mean total daily dose of 20.5 (± 9.7) mg/day at the end of maintenance. Throughout each phase, pulse, blood pressure, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), parent and teacher AE ratings, and vital signs were recorded.

Thirty percent of parents reported moderate to severe AEs in all study phases after baseline. These included emotional outbursts, difficulty falling asleep, repetitive behaviors/thoughts, decreased appetite, and irritability. During titration, decreased appetite (chi = 5.4, p < 0.03), trouble sleeping (chi = 5.4, p < 0.03), and weight loss (chi = 4.0, p < 0.05) occurred statistically more often on MPH than on placebo. During maintenance, trouble sleeping and appetite loss persisted, while other MPH-related AEs decreased. There were transient, one-time pulse and blood pressure elevations in five children. Twenty-one children (11%) discontinued due to drug-attributed AEs.

In conclusion, eleven percent of preschoolers discontinued treatment due to intolerable MPH AEs.

### Efficacy of osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate for mothers with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Preliminary report of effects on ADHD symptoms and parenting [^117FXBwu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

A preliminary study was conducted to examine the efficacy of osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and parenting behaviors in mothers with ADHD who had children with ADHD.

- **Method**: Participants included 23 mother-child dyads, both diagnosed with DSM-IV ADHD. Mothers underwent a 5-week, double-blind titration to an optimal dose of OROS methylphenidate (placebo, 36 mg/day, 54 mg/day, 72 mg/day, 90 mg/day), followed by a random assignment to 2 weeks of placebo or their maximally effective dose. Primary outcome measures included maternal ADHD symptoms (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale) and parenting (Alabama Parenting Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included ratings of side effects. Data were collected from December 2004 until August 2006.

- **Results**: During Phase 1, mothers reported significant decreases in inattention (p < .001) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (p < .01) with increases in OROS methylphenidate dose. As the dose increased, significant reductions in inconsistent discipline (p < .01) and corporal punishment use (p < .005) were also demonstrated. During Phase 2, small effects on inattention (d = 0.46) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (d = 0.38) were found for those randomly assigned to medication versus placebo. Additionally, medium to large medication effects were found on maternal involvement (d = 0.52), poor monitoring/supervision (d = 0.70), and inconsistent discipline (d = 0.71), with small effects on corporal punishment (d = 0.42). During both phases, few adverse effects were noted.

Serious cardiovascular events:

- **Sudden death and pre-existing structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems**:
	- **Children and adolescents**: Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.
	- **Adults**: Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.

- **Hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions**:
	Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^115iQSnx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should undergo a careful history evaluation, which includes assessing for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia. A physical exam is necessary to assess the presence of cardiac disease, and further cardiac evaluations are warranted if findings suggest such a disease, e.g. electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms indicative of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should receive a prompt cardiac evaluation.

- **Psychiatric adverse events**:
	- **Pre-existing psychosis**: Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavioral disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.
	- **Bipolar illness**: Particular care should be taken when using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing a mixed/manic episode. Before initiating stimulant treatment, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be thoroughly screened to assess their risk for bipolar disorder. This screening should include a detailed psychiatric history with attention to family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.
	- **Emergence of new psychotic or manic symptoms**: Treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania, may occur in children and adolescents.
