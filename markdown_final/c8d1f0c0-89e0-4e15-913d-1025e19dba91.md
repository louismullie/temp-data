## Question

Create a table that summarizes and compares atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a table that summarizes and compares atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and ECG features. Then, I should verify pathophysiology and epidemiology. Next, I will examine risk factors and clinical presentation. After that, I need to compare stroke and heart failure risks. Then I should contrast rate versus rhythm control strategies, including ablation outcomes. I will also check anticoagulation thresholds and post-procedural management. Finally, I will synthesize prognosis and highlight the practical clinical distinctions, making sure to continually self-verify against current ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions and surface ECG patterns to ground the comparison: atrial fibrillation (AF) features diffuse, rapid, and irregularly irregular atrial activity with rates often exceeding 350–400 bpm and an irregular R-R pattern, whereas atrial flutter (AFL) presents organized, regular atrial activation typically 250–350 bpm with sawtooth flutter waves on ECG, most often from a macro-reentrant right atrial circuit producing a regular ventricular response when AV conduction is fixed or 2:1 [^112Ljm8a] [^117H1FU9] [^1173km1Z].

> Hold on, I should verify mechanistic distinctions because they drive therapy: AF is commonly initiated by pulmonary vein triggers superimposed on a remodeled left atrial substrate with multiple wavelet reentry and heterogeneous conduction, while typical AFL most often reflects a single macro-reentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus (cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent) with a stable line of conduction block; importantly, AF and AFL are interrelated, and very rapid flutter can degenerate into AF via fibrillatory conduction, and AF can set up the substrate that stabilizes a flutter circuit [^114xjxRz] [^117H1FU9] [^1164cLun].

> I need to check the epidemiology to frame burden: AF affects roughly 700–775 per 100,000 persons in the U.S. and over 33 million globally with rising prevalence, whereas AFL is less common, with approximately 200,000 affected in the U.S.; nonetheless, AFL contributes meaningfully to cardiovascular morbidity and frequently coexists or alternates with AF in a given patient over time [^112Ljm8a] [^1113c8E3] [^116DqW6g].

> Let me consider shared and distinct risk factors: both AF and AFL increase with age and are associated with hypertension, heart failure, structural heart disease, obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and thyroid disease; a nuance I should confirm is that class IC antiarrhythmics used for AF (flecainide, propafenone) can paradoxically organize AF into typical or atypical flutter, an important management caveat in rhythm control strategies [^112Ljm8a] [^117H1FU9] [^112TYRQW].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation: both arrhythmias may present with palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, dizziness, or be asymptomatic; on exam AF has an irregular pulse, while typical AFL often yields a regular tachycardia; diagnostic confirmation is via ECG, and when structural heart disease is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography is appropriate; ambulatory and wearable/device-based monitoring improve detection and characterization in suspected or intermittent presentations [^112Ljm8a] [^117NybjZ] [^1114waF6].

> Wait, let me verify thromboembolic risk because this dictates anticoagulation: AF confers an approximately fivefold increased stroke risk and accounts for about 15% of all strokes; guidelines advise that AFL should be risk-stratified and anticoagulated using the same CHA2DS2-VASc criteria as AF, even though some observational data suggest the absolute stroke risk in AFL may be somewhat lower than in AF; the take-home is to apply the same anticoagulation thresholds to both [^112Ljm8a] [^114jCWBp] [^115zyyay].

> I will now examine heart failure and adverse outcomes: both AF and AFL are linked to heart failure development and decompensation; epidemiologic data show AFL associates with increased risks of HF hospitalization, myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality, with hazard ratios in the Framingham cohort underscoring a substantial burden; AF generally carries higher event rates, but AFL is by no means benign [^116UX1mA] [^1113c8E3].

> Let me think about rate versus rhythm control strategy in AF first, then test whether it generalizes to AFL: for most AF patients, rate control is a reasonable initial approach using beta-blockers or non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers when not contraindicated; target heart rates are often described as strict < 80 bpm at rest or lenient < 80 bpm at rest — wait, that's not right; the lenient-control target supported by data is generally < 110 bpm at rest in stable patients, not < 80 bpm, so I should correct that here; in AFL, rate control can be more challenging due to fixed AV conduction ratios, making rhythm control and especially ablation more frequently favored [^113XJbmX] [^112NKrMi] [^116AJKtc].

> Next, I should review rhythm-control options and special cautions: electrical cardioversion is effective for both AF and AFL and indicated emergently for hemodynamic instability; pharmacologic rhythm control can be used selectively, but in HFrEF, amiodarone or dofetilide are the guideline-preferred agents; I need to ensure I emphasize that class IC drugs can transform AF into flutter, so they require vigilance for organization to AFL and potential proarrhythmic implications [^114C7n2g] [^1116xxXV] [^112TYRQW].

> Hold on, I should verify ablation specifics because they differ markedly: in AF, catheter ablation centered on pulmonary vein isolation improves freedom from arrhythmia in selected patients but may require repeat procedures, particularly in persistent AF; in contrast, typical right atrial cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for AFL is highly effective, with success rates around 90–95%, leading guidelines to endorse AFL ablation as a first-line option for symptomatic typical flutter or when rate control is difficult [^112T7GaJ] [^113s3h2m] [^112NKrMi] [^1129jMTg].

> I should confirm anticoagulation thresholds and pericardioversion management: both AF and AFL should be anticoagulated according to CHA2DS2-VASc; per guidelines, continue therapeutic anticoagulation for at least four weeks after successful cardioversion or ablation, and for the long term if stroke risk remains elevated; after successful typical flutter ablation, ongoing anticoagulation is continued in those with prior AF or with high thromboembolic risk, with close rhythm surveillance since silent AF is common [^114jCWBp] [^117PnEu1] [^114srEj8] [^115L7xZo] [^1163kV9u] [^111jU6ah].

> But wait, what if the patient has AFL without known AF and undergoes isthmus ablation — do we stop OAC immediately? Hold on, I should verify: guidelines recommend individualized decisions; many patients warrant continued OAC based on stroke risk factors and the substantial incidence of subsequent AF, and structured rhythm monitoring post-ablation is advised to detect silent AF when contemplating OAC discontinuation [^1163kV9u] [^111jU6ah] [^114jCWBp].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring to ensure durable outcomes: after rhythm control or ablation, periodic ECG-based surveillance, ambulatory monitors, or device diagnostics can quantify AF/AFL burden and inform ongoing management, with recognition that algorithm outputs may still require clinician review to exclude other arrhythmias or artifacts [^114Vswzd] [^111jU6ah].

> I will now consider prognosis and natural history: AF often progresses from paroxysmal to persistent to permanent, with recurrent episodes common and higher all-cause mortality; AFL has a strong propensity to evolve into AF over time, with data suggesting nearly half develop AF at 10 years, underscoring the need for longitudinal follow-up and risk factor modification in both conditions [^115ZAt5f] [^116UX1mA].

> Finally, let me distill the key clinical distinctions while I double-check for accuracy: AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm, generally higher stroke risk, and more modest single-procedure ablation success rates, making rate control acceptable for many; typical AFL tends to be a regular tachycardia with sawtooth waves, often slightly lower stroke risk but still significant and managed identically for anticoagulation, and it has very high ablation success such that rhythm control via cavotricuspid isthmus ablation is frequently first-line when symptomatic or rate control is suboptimal; I should confirm again that anticoagulation decisions do not hinge on apparent rhythm alone but on stroke risk factors across both entities [^112Ljm8a] [^117H1FU9] [^112NKrMi] [^114jCWBp] [^115zyyay].

> In summary, the management framework converges where it matters for outcomes — stroke prevention by CHA2DS2-VASc and structured follow-up — while diverging in procedural efficacy, with typical AFL ablation offering a high-probability cure and AF ablation requiring more selective patient selection and expectations; I need to ensure shared decision-making integrates symptom burden, comorbidities, and patient preferences alongside these evidence-based distinctions [^114jCWBp] [^115zyyay] [^1129jMTg].

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are **distinct arrhythmias** with different mechanisms, ECG findings, and management considerations [^112Ljm8a]. AF is characterized by an **irregularly irregular rhythm** driven by multiple micro-reentrant circuits, whereas AFL has a **regular rhythm** due to a single macro-reentrant circuit. AF carries a **higher stroke risk** and is managed with rate or rhythm control, with anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc [^116oC19t] [^114jCWBp] [^116oV7Wb]; AFL is often treated with catheter ablation, with anticoagulation guided by AF risk profiles [^112NKrMi] [^115zyyay].

| **Feature** | **Atrial fibrillation (AF)** | **Atrial flutter (AFL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Multiple micro-reentrant circuits; irregular atrial activation [^112Ljm8a] | Single macro-reentrant circuit [^117H1FU9]; regular atrial activation [^1173km1Z] |
| ECG characteristics | Irregularly irregular rhythm; absent P waves; fibrillatory baseline [^112Ljm8a] | Regular rhythm; sawtooth flutter waves; atrial rate 250–350 bpm [^1173km1Z] |
| Clinical presentation | Palpitations, dyspnea [^112Ljm8a], fatigue, dizziness, syncope, chest pain | Palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, syncope [^112vDy4U], chest pain |
| Stroke risk | Higher stroke risk [^1113c8E3]; anticoagulation based on CHA2DS2-VASc [^114jCWBp] | Lower stroke risk than AF [^116oC19t]; anticoagulation per AF risk profiles [^115zyyay] |
| Rate control | Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers [^112Ljm8a], digoxin | Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers [^116AJKtc], digoxin |
| Rhythm control | Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide); electrical cardioversion [^1137M2Xt]; catheter ablation [^112T7GaJ] [^112Ljm8a] | Antiarrhythmics (ibutilide, dofetilide, amiodarone); electrical cardioversion; catheter ablation (cavotricuspid isthmus) [^112NKrMi] |
| Catheter ablation | Pulmonary vein isolation [^112T7GaJ]; moderate success; recurrence common [^112Ljm8a] | Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation; high success (> 90%); low recurrence |
| Anticoagulation | Required based on CHA2DS2-VASc score [^114jCWBp] | Required if high thromboembolic risk or history of AF [^115L7xZo] [^115zyyay] |
| Progression | Progressive [^115ZAt5f]; can become persistent or permanent [^112Ljm8a] | Less progressive; may convert to AF [^1164cLun] [^112vDy4U] |
| Prognosis | Higher risk of stroke, heart failure, mortality [^1113c8E3] [^112Ljm8a] | Lower risk than AF [^116oC19t]; prognosis improves with ablation |

---

Overall, AF and AFL differ in mechanism, ECG findings, and management: AF carries a **higher stroke risk** [^116oC19t], and AFL is often managed with ablation [^112NKrMi]; anticoagulation is guided by AF risk profiles [^114jCWBp] [^115zyyay].

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter:

- **Definition**: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, heart failure (HF), and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.

- **Disease course**: The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to a poorer prognosis.

Regarding medical management for atrial flutter, specifically in terms of rhythm control, the ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as verapamil or diltiazem, in the absence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), if ablation is not desirable or feasible. Initiating β-blockers should also be considered for managing patients with atrial flutter if ablation is not possible or unsuccessful.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

- **Methods**: Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search performed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

- **Results**: For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (e.g. CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (i.e. oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with one or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy.

### Atrial fibrillation [^112Ljm8a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial fibrillation:

- **Definition**: AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically mitral stenosis (MS), or a prosthetic heart valve.

- **Pathophysiology**: The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, heart failure), genetics, sex, and other factors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AF in the US is estimated at 700–775 cases per 100,000 persons.

- **Disease course**: In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which cause symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of heart failure, as well as stasis of blood in the left atrial appendage (LAA), which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114xjxRz]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting over 33 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to more than double over the next 40 years. AF is associated with a twofold increase in premature mortality and significant adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure, severe stroke, and myocardial infarction. Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological changes that predispose individuals to the induction and maintenance of AF.

Progress has been limited due to the realization that AF is a complex arrhythmia that can be the end result of various pathophysiological processes, with significant heterogeneity between individual patients and species. This focused review aims to succinctly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of AF for the non-specialist.

- **Pathophysiology**: We address all aspects, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of AF, and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may be upstream contributors to the development of AF.

- **Translational implications**: Finally, we outline the translational implications for and future rhythm control strategies in patients with AF.

### Catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation: a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial (SARA study) [^112T7GaJ]. European Heart Journal (2014). High credibility.

In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of patients free of any recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (lasting > 30 seconds) at the end of follow-up was higher in the catheter ablation (CA) group than in the antiarrhythmic drug treatment (ADT) group (60.2% vs. 29.2%; P < 0.001), showing a 31% absolute risk difference (95% CI 14.9–47.1). The need for cardioversion was higher in the ADT group compared to the CA group (50% vs. 34.7%; P = 0.018). During the blanking period, the ADT group experienced a higher rate of recurrences than the CA group (54.2% vs. 29.6%, respectively; P = 0.004), without significant differences in the rate of cardioversions (33.3% vs. 23.5%, respectively; P = 0.206).

Among patients in the ADT group with recurrences during the blanking period, 65.4% were treated with class III antiarrhythmics, while 34.6% were under class Ic. All patients treated with class III drugs remained on this therapy after the recurrence. Conversely, 33.3% of patients on class Ic changed to class III, and 33.3% increased the dose of the same drug. Only 13 patients (13.3%) in the CA group and 7 patients (14.6%) in the ADT group experienced recurrences solely during the blanking period. In the CA arm, early recurrences (blanking period) indicated an increased risk for the occurrence of the primary endpoint (OR 5.30; 95% CI 2.05–13.69; P = 0.002).

At the end of follow-up, 23 patients (47.9%) in the ADT group underwent CA after reaching the primary endpoint, with four requiring two procedures. None of the patients in the ADT group underwent CA before reaching the primary endpoint (0% crossover). In the CA arm, 35.7% of patients received ADT before the end of follow-up.

### Pathophysiology and disease progression of atrial fibrillation: Importance of achieving and maintaining sinus rhythm [^115ZAt5f]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease in which arrhythmia-induced remodeling facilitates evolution from paroxysmal AF to persistent and permanent AF. Changes in the electrical, structural, and contractile properties of cardiac tissue are thought to underlie AF maintenance and progression. The negative impact of AF on clinical outcomes, as well as the potential benefits of restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, are also examined. Because of the limited efficacy and adverse effects of antiarrhythmics, new antiarrhythmic drugs need to be developed to provide safer and more effective rhythm control in AF.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117PnEu1]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial flutter, more specifically concerning pericardioversion anticoagulation, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend continuing anticoagulation for at least four weeks after successful cardioversion or ablation. This approach is advised for patients who have experienced restoration of sinus rhythm in the context of atrial flutter.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation [^115izmTN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). High credibility.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation following a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.

- **Results**: After a mean (± SD) of 2.3 ± 0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was similar in the rate-control group.

### Class IC antiarrhythmic drug induced atrial flutter: Electrocardiographic and electrophysiological findings and their importance for long term outcome after right atrial isthmus ablation [^112TYRQW]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the electrocardiographic and electrophysiological findings of new atrial flutter developing in patients taking class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for recurrent atrial fibrillation and to report the long-term results of right atrial isthmus ablation in relation to the ECG pattern of spontaneous atrial flutter.

- **Design**: Retrospective analysis.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care academic hospital.

- **Patients**: The study involved 24 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation (average age 54 years, standard deviation 12; 5 females and 19 males) who developed atrial flutter while taking either propafenone (n = 12) or flecainide (n = 12).

- **Results**: The ECG was classified into three categories: typical atrial flutter (n = 13; 54%), atypical atrial flutter (n = 8), or coarse atrial fibrillation (n = 3). Counterclockwise atrial flutter was identified as the predominant arrhythmia. Acute success after isthmus ablation was comparable between patients with typical atrial flutter (12 out of 13) and atypical atrial flutter (8 out of 8). After a long-term follow-up period of 13 months on average (standard deviation 6 months; range 6 to 26 months), continuation of antiarrhythmic drug treatment appeared to provide better control of recurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients with typical atrial flutter (11 out of 13) than in those with atypical atrial flutter (4 out of 8), although the difference was not statistically significant. Ablation for coarse atrial fibrillation was unsuccessful.

- **Conclusions**: New atrial flutter developing in patients taking class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for recurrent atrial fibrillation presents with either typical or atypical flutter wave morphology on ECG. The endocardial activation pattern and the acute results of ablation suggest that the flutter circuit was located in the right atrium.

### Non-pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation [^112F86zc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice today. Contemporary medical treatment options include atrioventricular nodal blocking agents to control heart rates during AF, antiarrhythmic drugs aimed at maintaining normal sinus rhythm, and anticoagulation therapies to reduce stroke risk. Invasive treatment of AF has emerged because of the toxicities and lack of long-term efficacy of available antiarrhythmic medications, along with the lack of improvement in symptoms for rate-controlled patients.

The investigators review the evolution of the catheter-delivered AF procedures, starting with surgical maze up to and including left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Individual catheter ablation targets, anatomic and electrophysiologic, are discussed, with a particular focus on the use of an incremental ablation target strategy dependent on the type of AF being treated. In conclusion, the history of invasive AF therapy provides a basic understanding of contemporary ablation strategies and a backdrop for the cutting-edge rhythm and stroke prevention therapies of today.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1163kV9u]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with atrial flutter, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of long-term anticoagulation after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. This is advised for patients with typical atrial flutter who have no known previous history of atrial fibrillation but are at high risk for its development. High-risk factors include left atrium enlargement, inducible atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure (HF). If the thromboembolic risk assessment indicates a high risk (greater than 2% annual risk) for stroke, anticoagulation is recommended.

### Atrial fibrillation nomenclature, definitions, and mechanisms: Position paper from the international working group of the Signal Summit [^1152JEUU]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Low credibility.

The international working group of the Signal Summit is a consortium of experts in the field of cardiac electrophysiology dedicated to advancing knowledge on the understanding and clinical application of signal recording and processing techniques. In 2023, the working group met in Reykjavik, Iceland, and laid the foundation for this manuscript. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in adults, with a rapidly increasing prevalence worldwide. Despite substantial research efforts, advancements in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of AF have been relatively modest.

Since the discovery of pulmonary veins as a frequent trigger region for AF initiation more than two and a half decades ago, advancements in patient care have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve the safety and efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Several factors may explain the limited scientific progress made:

- **Ectopic beat**: Whereas AF initiation usually begins with an ectopic beat, the mechanisms of initiation, maintenance, and electrical propagation have not been fully elucidated in humans, largely owing to suboptimal spatiotemporal mapping.

- **Structural changes**: Underlying structural changes have not been clarified and may involve different types of reentry.

- **Terminology**: Inconsistent definitions and terminology regarding fibrillatory characteristics contribute to the challenges of comparing results between studies.

- **Phenotypical differences**: A growing appreciation for phenotypical differences probably explains the wide range of clinical outcomes to catheter ablation in patients with seemingly similar AF types.

Restoring sinus rhythm remains a challenge.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — a view from a national cohort study [^1113c8E3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular atrial rhythm with a rate of more than 350 beats per minute and electrophysiological mechanisms involving rapidly firing foci and random multiple micro- or macro-reentrant activation wavelets. The number of patients with AF worldwide was reportedly 33.5 million in 2010, and it is expected to double by 2050. The Framingham Heart Study reported that AF is associated with an approximately 5-fold increased risk of embolic stroke, a 2-fold increased risk of heart failure, and a 2-fold higher risk of mortality. Therefore, public awareness of AF and its related complications is an urgent and important issue.

Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia characterized by an organized atrial rhythm with a rate usually between 250 and 350 beats per minute. The prevalence of AFL is around 200,000 in the United States, and AFL has been reported to increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, and mortality. AF and AFL have been observed to switch back and forth clinically. Therefore, AF and AFL are conceptually recognized to be the same risk factor in terms of preventing complications related to atrial tachyarrhythmias, and it is generally recommended, according to guidelines and expert opinions, that AFL patients should be risk stratified and treated in the same manner as AF patients.

Although AF and AFL share several common risk factors with regard to occurrence, and both have been reported to contribute.

### Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and treatment [^113XJbmX]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It impairs cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. Key treatment issues include deciding when to restore normal sinus rhythm, when to control rate only, and how to prevent thromboembolism.

Rate control is the preferred management option in most patients. Rhythm control is an option for patients in whom rate control cannot be achieved or who have persistent symptoms despite rate control. The recommendation for strict rate control is a resting heart rate of less than 80 beats per minute. However, one study has shown that more lenient rate control of less than 110 beats per minute while at rest was not inferior to strict rate control in preventing cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, and life-threatening arrhythmias.

Anticoagulation therapy is needed with rate control and rhythm control to prevent stroke. Warfarin is superior to aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing stroke despite its narrow therapeutic range and increased risk of bleeding. Tools that predict the risk of stroke (e.g. CHADS2) and the risk of bleeding (e.g. Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) are helpful in making decisions about anticoagulation therapy.

Surgical options for atrial fibrillation include disruption of abnormal conduction pathways in the atria, and obliteration of the left atrial appendage. Catheter ablation is an option for restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal left atrial size. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted.

### Global burden of atrial fibrillation and flutter by national income: Results from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Database [^116DqW6g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

The main burden of global atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) prevalence lies on middle-income countries. However, research on AF/AFL does not reflect this reality. Most AF/AFL patients are underrepresented in research, and their characteristics, including ethnicity and comorbidities, may differ significantly from those of individuals typically examined by researchers in the past. Of all papers published on AF from 1945 to 2018, 56% originate from seven high-income countries. The United States accounts for 25.9% of all papers, Japan contributes 8.0%, and China, an upper-middle-income country, contributes 7% of papers. South and Latin America, as well as Africa, are almost not represented.

In large AF clinical trials, mostly located in high-income countries, non-White ethnicities are often underrepresented compared to the overall population, or the ethnicity is not reported. For instance, in the ASSERT trial (Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial), participants of European ethnicity were at a higher risk of AF compared to Black Africans, Chinese, and Japanese participants. Differences in clinical complications between ethnicities have been noted, such as a higher stroke risk in Asians even at a low CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, or higher rates of heart failure in Africans. Hypertension may increase the risk for both bleeding and thromboembolic events in anticoagulated patients.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: A clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation. They developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. These recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care.

- **Recommendation 1**: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control with chronic anticoagulation in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A.

- **Recommendation 2**: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (such as thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, or alcoholism). Grade: 1A.

- **Recommendation 3**: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended: [The list of drugs should continue here if provided in the text.]

### Inter-relationships of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter mechanisms and clinical implications [^1164cLun]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

There is a close interrelationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). Atrial fibrillation of variable duration often precedes the onset of AFL. During AF, the functional components needed to complete the AFL re-entrant circuit, principally a line of block (LoB) between the vena cavae, are formed. If this LoB does not form, classical AFL does not develop. In contrast, a spectrum of atrial re-entrant circuits (drivers) with short cycle lengths (CLs), such as AFL, may exist. When the CL of the AFL re-entrant circuit is so short that it activates only portions of the atria in a 1:1 manner, the rest of the atria will be activated rapidly but irregularly through fibrillatory conduction, resulting in AF. In summary, there are probably several mechanisms of AF, one of which arises from a very rapid AFL causing fibrillatory conduction. All these interactions between AF and AFL have important clinical implications.

### The interrelationship between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter [^111FLSF8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

For a long time, it has been known that atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have a close clinical interrelationship. Recent electrophysiological studies, especially mapping studies, have significantly advanced our understanding of this interrelationship.

- **Atrial fibrillation's relationship with atrial flutter**: Atrial fibrillation of variable duration precedes the onset of atrial flutter in almost all instances. During atrial fibrillation, the functional components needed to complete the atrial flutter reentrant circuit, principally a line of block between the venae cavae, are formed. If this line of block does not form, classical atrial flutter does not develop. If this line of block shortens or disappears, classical atrial flutter disappears. It is fair to say that the major determinant of whether atrial fibrillation persists or classical atrial flutter develops is whether a line of block forms between the venae cavae.

- **Atrial flutter's relationship with atrial fibrillation**: Studies in experimental models and now in patients have demonstrated that a driver (a rapidly firing focus or a reentrant circuit of very short cycle length) can cause atrial fibrillation by producing fibrillatory conduction to the rest of the atria. When the driver is a stable reentrant circuit of very short cycle length, it is, in effect, a very fast form of atrial flutter. There probably is a spectrum of reentrant circuits of short cycle length, i.e. "atrial flutter", that depend, in part, on where the reentrant circuit is located.

### Atrial fibrillation [^1124KDUb]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder and its prevalence increases with age and the number of cardiovascular comorbidities. AF is characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat that can be asymptomatic or lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnea, and dizziness. The condition is associated with serious complications, including an increased risk of stroke.

Important developments in the clinical epidemiology and management of AF have informed our approach to this arrhythmia. This primer provides a comprehensive overview of AF, covering its epidemiology, mechanisms and pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and management. Management strategies including stroke prevention, rate control, and rhythm control are considered. We also address quality of life issues and provide an outlook on future developments and ongoing clinical trials in managing this common arrhythmia.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter-a view from a national cohort study [^116oC19t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFL) has been identified to be equivalent to atrial fibrillation (AF) in terms of preventing ischemic stroke, although differences exist in atrial rate, substrate, and electrophysiological mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate differences in clinical outcomes between nonvalvular AF and AFL.

- **Methods and results**: AF and AFL patients without any prescribed anticoagulation were enrolled from a 13-year national cohort database. Under series exclusion criteria, ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality were compared between the groups in real-world conditions and after propensity score matching. We identified 175,420 patients in the AF cohort and 6,239 patients in the AFL cohort, and the prevalence of most comorbidities and frequency of medications were significantly higher in the AF group than the AFL group. In the real-world setting, the AF patients had higher incidence rates of ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality than the AFL patients (all P < 0.001). After propensity score matching, the incidence rate of ischemic stroke in the AF cohort was 1.63-fold higher than in the AFL cohort (P < 0.001), the incidence rate of heart failure hospitalization in the AF cohort was 1.70-fold higher than in the AFL cohort (P < 0.001), and the incidence rate of all-cause mortality in the AF cohort was 1.08-fold higher than in the AFL cohort (P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: There were differences between AF and AFL in comorbidities and prognosis with regard to ischemic stroke and heart failure hospitalization.

### Quinidine sulfate [^115F8KaZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Quinidine sulfate is indicated for the following uses:

- **Conversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter**: In patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by measures that reduce the rate of ventricular response, quinidine sulfate is indicated as a means of restoring normal sinus rhythm. If this use of quinidine sulfate does not restore sinus rhythm within a reasonable time (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), then quinidine sulfate should be discontinued.

- **Reduction of frequency of relapse into atrial fibrillation/flutter**: Chronic therapy with quinidine sulfate is indicated for some patients at high risk of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter, generally those who have had previous episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter that were so frequent and poorly tolerated as to outweigh, in the judgment of the physician and the patient, the risks of prophylactic therapy with quinidine sulfate. The increased risk of death should specifically be considered. Quinidine sulfate should be used only after alternative measures, such as the use of other drugs to control the ventricular rate, have been found to be inadequate.

	- In patients with histories of frequent symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, the goal of therapy should be an increase in the average time between episodes. In most patients, the tachyarrhythmia will recur during therapy, and a single recurrence should not be interpreted as therapeutic failure.

- **Suppression of ventricular arrhythmias**: Quinidine sulfate is also indicated for the suppression of documented ventricular arrhythmias.

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^116fK9eo]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management by focusing briefly on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodeling, and the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion. Further topics include the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development.

The background of each controversy is reviewed, and our opinions are expressed. Here, we aim to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address the unresolved issues.

### Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^112EyzHx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Two approaches exist for its management: controlling the ventricular rate or converting to sinus rhythm, with the expectation of abolishing adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults on the annual risk of stroke, peripheral embolism, and mortality.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (2000 to 2002), EMBASE (1998 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), and Web of Science (1981 to 2002). Hand searches were conducted in journals: Circulation (1997 to 2002), Heart (1997 to 2002), European Heart Journal (1997 to 2002), and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (1997 to 2002). We also reviewed selected abstracts published on the website of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (2001, 2002).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials of pharmacological cardioversion versus rate control in adults (> 18 years) with acute, paroxysmal, or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and etiology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One reviewer applied the inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Trial quality was assessed, and the data were entered into RevMan.

- **Main results**: We identified two completed studies: AFFIRM (n = 4060) and PIAF (n = 252). There was no difference in mortality between rhythm control and rate control, with a relative risk of 1.14.

### Cross-trial comparisons: A source of confusion, use, or both in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^112a349r]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Many medical therapies are shaped by clinical trial data. However, individual clinical trial results sometimes appear discordant for the same tested treatments, and competing treatment strategies are often not directly tested. Clinicians are forced to make decisions by extrapolating information from different trials of similar but nonidentical therapies. In an era where increasing medical complexity demands sound evidence-based decisions, clinicians must navigate through these issues to arrive at optimal patient-specific management decisions. Using trials investigating therapies for atrial fibrillation, we attempt to highlight the important points for practitioners to consider when making these comparative intertrial judgments.

### Efficacy and safety of ablation for people with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^113s3h2m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The optimal rhythm management strategy for people with non-paroxysmal (persistent or long-standing persistent) atrial fibrillation is currently not well defined. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been the mainstay of therapy; however, recently, in individuals who have not responded to these drugs, the use of ablation (both catheter and surgical) has emerged as an alternative to maintain sinus rhythm and potentially avoid long-term atrial fibrillation complications. Nevertheless, evidence from randomized trials concerning the efficacy and safety of ablation in patients with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation remains limited.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of ablation (catheter and surgical) in people with non-paroxysmal (persistent or long-standing persistent) atrial fibrillation compared to antiarrhythmic drugs.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, conference abstracts, clinical trial registries, and the Health Technology Assessment Database. These databases were searched from their inception to April 1, 2016, without language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) or surgical ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs in adults with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, regardless of any concomitant underlying heart disease, with at least 12 months of follow-up.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

### Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in pregnant women-a population-based study [^112bYM87]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

- **Prevalence by race/ethnicity**: Prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) differed by race/ethnicity. Specifically, prevalence of AF (per 100,000 women) was 111.6 in white women, 101.7 in black women, 45.0 in Asian women, and 34.3 in Hispanic women. Compared to white women, the odds ratio (OR) of having AF was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.2–0.5) in Hispanic women and 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2–0.8) in Asian women.

- **Prevalence by age**: Prevalence of AF also differed by age. There was no significant difference in the rate of AF in mothers who were < 25 years and 25–29 years of age (P = 0.8). However, the rate of AF significantly increased after age 30 years, with a rate of 87.1 per 100,000 pregnancies in mothers age 30 to 34 (P < 0.001), further increased to 104.7 per 100,000 pregnancies in mothers age 35 to 39 (P < 0.001), and reached 109.7 per 100,000 pregnancies in mothers age ≥ 40 (P < 0.001). Compared to women < 25 years of age, the OR of having AF was 4.1, 4.9, and 5.2 in women 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and ≥ 40 years of age, respectively.

### Methodologic differences across studies of patients with atrial fibrillation lead to varying estimates of stroke risk [^117GQ6DP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the analyses. The studies analyzed have been previously published and are easily accessible for review. This article is an analysis of previously published data and methods from multiple reports. No new data were collected, and institutional review board approval was not required to undertake this analysis of published data.

- **Study selection**: The analysis focuses on a subgroup of studies from our previous systematic review of studies reporting stroke rates among patients with AF not taking OAC (Figure 1). We excluded randomized controlled trials, which contribute only a small fraction of follow-up of AF patients off anticoagulants, and we focus exclusively on large observational cohort studies where design and analysis methods are more variable. To this end, we restricted our analyses to studies that included at least 5000 patients. These remaining 9 studies represented 1,137,597 person-years, or 95% of total follow-up from the original set of 24 studies, and also included all cohorts that are repeatedly cited in AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines.

### Case studies with the experts: Management decisions in atrial fibrillation [^112jtifC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled "Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF", held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### Racial and sex disparities in anticoagulation after electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^1177rD6Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 19,108 patients underwent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter during the study period. We excluded 5,928 patients because they were not enrolled in Part D for at least three months before and after the cardioversion date, 219 patients because they were enrolled in Medicare Advantage, and 5,101 patients who underwent cardioversion in the setting of an inpatient admission or emergency department visit. The final study cohort included 7,860 patients.

- **Results**: Overall, 5,510 patients (70.1%) received anticoagulation following cardioversion, while 2,350 (29.9%) did not. Patients who did not receive anticoagulation were younger (mean age, 72.9 ± 10 versus 74.8 ± 7.9 years; P < 0.001), more likely to be women, of minority race, and with a lower burden of most comorbidities, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, lung and kidney disease, anemia, prior bleeding, and prior ischemic stroke. Patients who did not receive anticoagulation had lower frailty scores (median, 2.4 [interquartile range, 0–7.4] versus 3.0 [interquartile range, 0–8.5]; P < 0.01) and lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores (mean, 3.7 ± 1.7 versus 4.2 ± 1.7; P < 0.01).

The indication for cardioversion was atrial fibrillation in the majority of patients (89.2%), and 39.0% had a pre-cardioversion transesophageal echocardiogram.

### Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation: What can clinical registries tell us about stroke prevention and current therapeutic approaches [^112K1DhH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cataloging AF registries: The registries have been grouped into broad categories, such as those focused on thromboprophylaxis and stroke prevention, cardioversion and AAD therapy, ablation, and LAAC. Several registries address multiple aspects of AF diagnosis and management and could be allocated to more than one category. To enable key findings to be visualized more clearly, registries that provide information on medical treatments for AF (including use of agents for rhythm and rate control, warfarin, aspirin, and new oral anticoagulants [NOACs]) are shown separately.

- **Registries with a focus on thromboprophylaxis and stroke prevention**: These registries are highlighted in the overview.
- **Registries reporting on antiarrhythmic drug therapy and cardioversion in AF**: This category provides insights into various therapeutic approaches.
- **Registries providing information on AF ablation**: Registries focus on ablation techniques and outcomes.
- **Registries reporting on LAAC**: This section addresses registries that focus on LAAC procedures.
- **Registries providing information on medical treatment of AF**: Information on medical treatments, including the use of warfarin, aspirin, and NOACs, is provided separately.

The registries offer valuable data on the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), covering various therapeutic approaches and highlighting critical areas of stroke prevention.

### Treatment timing and the effects of rhythm control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation: Nationwide cohort study [^112hyhXs]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

This study emulated a randomized controlled trial, comparing the effect of rhythm control and rate control treatment for atrial fibrillation on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Details of the trial protocol are presented in supplementary table 1. We identified adults with atrial fibrillation who were treated with rhythm control or rate control strategies between 28 July 2011 and 31 December 2015. Participants were older than 75, had a history of a transient ischaemic attack or stroke, or met two of the following criteria: older than 65, female sex, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic kidney disease. This was done using similar inclusion periods and criteria as the EAST-AFNET 4 trial.

Atrial fibrillation was defined according to the ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) code I48. The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation has been previously validated in the NHIS database with a positive predictive value of 94.1%. We used a new user and intention-to-treat design for rhythm or rate control treatments. New use was defined as having no previous records of the prescription or procedure of interest in the database. The NHIS database includes information on drug prescriptions for the entire Korean population from 1 January 2002, allowing for a minimum of a 9.5-year look-back period before each person's date of inclusion (the earliest date of inclusion was 28 July 2011).

Intention to treat with rhythm control was defined as a prescription of more than 90 days' supply of any rhythm control drugs.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111jU6ah]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances regarding atrial fibrillation, particularly for patients with atrial flutter, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring. This is crucial to detect silent atrial fibrillation following a successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter who are deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk without any known previous history of atrial fibrillation if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation, considering the significant risk of atrial fibrillation.

### Association between family history and early-onset atrial flutter across racial and ethnic groups [^116QPAof]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFL) follows second only to atrial fibrillation (AF) as the most common arrhythmia in the world, with more than 200,000 incidence cases diagnosed yearly in the United States. However, little is known about the epidemiological differences between the two. Clinically, both can be managed with antiarrhythmic therapy, anticoagulation, or catheter ablation strategies. However, AFL differs from AF in that it is more difficult to rate control; cavo-tricuspid-isthmus dependent AFL has a higher success rate with ablation, often has a regular rhythm, and has a lower risk of stroke.

In contrast with the well-defined clinical features, characteristics, and genetic basis for AF, the understanding of risk factors and the role of family history of atrial tachyarrhythmias in first-degree relatives (FDRs) toward the development of early-onset atrial flutter (EOAFL) is limited. Similarly, the role that race and ethnicity play is unknown, which is particularly important in the context of the paradoxically lower rate of AF seen in Black individuals despite a similar or increased burden of clinical risk factors.

The overlap in risk factors for AFL and AF is often confounded, as the two diagnoses are often combined in a majority of studies, with few studies attempting to distinguish between the two. Marcus et al. found that alcohol intake was associated with AFL in younger patients; however, this association did not carry over to AF. The largest study before this found a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of AFL in men, those with heart failure, and those with obstructive factors.

### Current controversies in determining the main mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114mpeUv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite considerable basic research into the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF), there has been little progress in the prognosis of patients with AF. With the exception of anticoagulant therapy, treatments for AF still do not improve major cardiovascular outcomes. This may be due in part to the diverse etiology of AF, with an increasing number of factors contributing to the arrhythmia. Additionally, there has been a strong increase in the technological complexity of methods used to quantify the main pathophysiological alterations underlying the initiation and progression of AF. Because of the lack of standardization in current technological approaches, perceptions of the basic mechanisms of AF vary widely in the scientific community.

- **Areas of debate**: These include the role of Ca(2+)-handling alterations associated with AF, the contribution and noninvasive assessment of the degree of atrial fibrosis, and the best techniques to identify electrophysiological drivers of AF.

In this review, we summarize the state of the art of these controversial topics, describe the diverse approaches to investigating leading AF mechanisms, and highlight scientific opinions. Finally, we emphasize the need for transparency in scientific reporting, as well as the standardization of terminology, assumptions, algorithms, and experimental conditions used for the development of better AF therapies.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to ECG monitoring, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend inferring AF frequency, duration, and burden using automated algorithms available from ECG monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead in patients with a diagnosis of AF. It is recognized that periodic review may be required to exclude other arrhythmias.

### The efficacy of pad placement for electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter: A systematic review [^115NCEr1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Electrical cardioversion is commonly used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to restore normal sinus rhythm. There has been considerable debate as to whether the electrode placement affects the efficacy of electrical cardioversion. The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of anteroposterior (A-P) versus anterolateral (A-L) electrode placement to restore normal sinus rhythm.

- **Methods**: A search of eight electronic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane, was completed. Grey literature searching (hand-searching, Google, and SCOPUS) was also conducted. Studies were included if they were controlled clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of A-P versus A-L pad placement to restore normal sinus rhythm in adult patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter. Two independent reviewers judged study relevance, inclusion, and quality (e.g. risk of bias). Individual and pooled statistics were calculated as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity (I²) was reported.

- **Results**: From 788 citations, 13 studies were included; seven involved monophasic, five involved biphasic, and one analyzed both waveform devices. The included studies tended to report cumulative success rates in restoring normal sinus rhythm after one to five sequential shocks of increasing energy; the number of shocks and energy used differed among studies. The risk of bias of the studies was "unclear". After the first shock, pad placement was not associated with an increased likelihood of restoring normal sinus rhythm.

### Atrial flutter: Clinical risk factors and adverse outcomes in the Framingham Heart Study [^116UX1mA]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Few epidemiologic cohort studies have evaluated atrial flutter (flutter) as an arrhythmia distinct from atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of flutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study.

We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. Clinical correlates of flutter were examined by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter using Cox models.

During a mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54–5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03–1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05–4.80), and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26–21.64) were associated with incident flutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, flutter (versus referents) was associated with a 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01, 95% CI 3.14–7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.42–6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.90–8.99), stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.13–4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44–2.79).

We identified the clinical correlates associated with flutter and observed that flutter was associated with multiple adverse outcomes.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^112BvycQ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control and electrical cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as the initial energy. This approach is advised to improve the success of the initial electrical shock in patients with AF undergoing elective electrical cardioversion.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^115L7xZo]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

When managing atrial fibrillation, specifically in patients with atrial flutter, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend initiating ongoing oral anticoagulation as indicated for atrial fibrillation following a successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter and a history of atrial fibrillation detected prior to the atrial flutter ablation.

### Rates of atrial fibrillation in black versus white patients with pacemakers [^115TVFJ3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

- **Cumulative rate of atrial flutter**: The analysis shows the cumulative rate of atrial flutter in patients with pacemakers, stratified by black versus white race. The difference between groups was not significant (P = 0.08 for the log-rank test).

- **Cumulative rate of atrial fibrillation or flutter**: The analysis examines the cumulative rate of atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients with pacemakers, stratified by black versus white race. The difference between groups was significant (P < 0.001 for the log-rank test).

Despite their lower rate of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, black patients had a higher cumulative rate of ischemic stroke (7.3%; 95% CI 6.4–8.3) than white patients (5.1%; 95% CI 4.8–5.3; P < 0.001 for the log-rank test). The higher hazard of stroke in black patients persisted after adjusting for demographic characteristics and vascular risk factors, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (hazard ratio 1.58; 95% CI 1.42–1.76). This association was not substantially different in a sensitivity analysis limited to embolic stroke or in a matched Cox analysis.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1137M2Xt]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, electrical cardioversion, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering performing electrical cardioversion as the initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion in hemodynamically stable patients with AF.

### Rate versus rhythm control in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^1121mx2i]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The management of patients with atrial fibrillation involves three main areas: anticoagulation, rate control, and rhythm control. Importantly, these are not mutually exclusive of each other. Anticoagulation is necessary for patients who are at a high risk of stroke; for example, those who are older than 75 years, or those who have hypertension, severe left ventricular dysfunction, previous cerebrovascular events, or diabetes. It is now clear that patients who are at a high risk of stroke require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin regardless of whether a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy is chosen; one possible exception might be patients who are apparently cured with catheter ablation.

Several published trials comparing rate-control and rhythm-control strategies for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation have shown no difference in mortality between these approaches. The patients enrolled in these studies were typically over 65 years of age. Data comparing rate and rhythm strategies in patients who are younger than 60 years of age are limited. For more elderly patients, it seems reasonable to consider rate control as a primary treatment option and to reserve rhythm control for those who do not respond to rate control. For younger patients, we prefer to start with a rhythm-control approach and to reserve rate-control approaches for patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation, or both, do not ameliorate the symptoms.

### Atrial fibrillation: Common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device.

The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as a first-line therapy.

### Evaluation of quantitative decision-making for rhythm management of atrial fibrillation using tabular Q-learning [^111ZjKmK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Turning to the actual Q-values within the Q-table, we can draw some inferences regarding how different subtypes of patients might have better outcomes under a given treatment approach. For example, clusters 2 and 8 appeared to correspond to subtypes of patients with heart failure, for which an inspection of the Q-table indicates that for both clusters a rhythm-management strategy was favored, with nonischemic heart failure (cluster 8) having a clearly favored treatment approach of ablation. This finding is consistent with the highly cited CASTLE-AF (Catheter Ablation Versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients With Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation) trial, which found a statistically significant improvement in mortality with ablation in patients with heart failure compared with rate control.

Similarly, among patients in cluster 7 with "lone AF", we observed ablation to be the preferred treatment approach, which is also consistent with prior clinical trials showing favorability of AF ablation in this subtype of patient. Additional inferences could be made in other clusters; for example, cluster 5, which corresponded with patients having coronary artery disease, in which the use of an additional rhythm-control modality beyond external cardioversion did not seem as preferable. One could infer validation of this finding from the extensive body of literature supporting a lack of benefit from rhythm-control agents among early studies before the ablation era. Of course, such speculation should be tempered due to the inherent bias in this observational context.

### Prognostic differences between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter [^115UsGYo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This report presents the outcomes of a cohort of 94 patients with atrial fibrillation from the Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation, with particular attention to the probability of stroke and death. We also evaluated warfarin use over time and compared left atrial dimensions in patients with atrial flutter to those with atrial fibrillation.

### Atrial flutter: More than just one of a kind [^1173km1Z]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved. One AFL circuit can have variable electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations depending on the presence of pre-existing atrial lesions or impaired atrial substrate. Conversely, different atrial circuits, whether right-sided or even left-sided, including different mechanisms such as macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal, can present with a very similar surface ECG manifestation.

The development of efficient high-resolution electroanatomical mapping systems has improved our knowledge about AFL mechanisms and facilitated their curative treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation. This article will review ECG features for typical and atypical flutters and emphasize the limitations for circuit location from the surface ECG.

### Motpoly XR [^116QKyEp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. However, both atrial fibrillation and flutter have been reported in open-label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. Among adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of those treated with lacosamide experienced adverse reactions of atrial fibrillation or flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. The administration of Motpoly XR may predispose patients to atrial arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, particularly in those with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

- **Syncope**: In short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures and no significant systemic illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In short-term controlled trials involving adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most syncope cases occurred in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most instances; however, several cases were associated with changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed…

### Long-term outcomes after hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or flutter [^114zpppF]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Statistical methods are utilized to describe the data, where categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables are reported as mean ± standard deviation or as median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences between groups were assessed using the χ² test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and Student's t-test or Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables, as appropriate. Comorbidities were derived using the Condition Category (CC) classification, which groups ICD-10 diagnoses into 180 clinically meaningful conditions based on the selected secondary diagnoses of the index admission and all diagnostic codes from hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months.

Survival probability was estimated using Kaplan–Meier time-to-event analysis, with results reported as percentages and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A flexible parametric survival model was used to estimate the expected survival, observed survival, and the loss in life expectancy, adjusting for patient characteristics and comorbidities that impacted survival. Variables for adjustment were identified by fitting a multivariable Cox regression model, with mortality as the outcome variable. Independent variables included age, sex, presenting region, treatment at a private hospital, receipt of catheter ablation, cardioversion, coronary angiography, or percutaneous coronary intervention during the index hospitalization, and all comorbidities having a statistically significant relationship (P < 0.25) in a univariate analysis or a clinically plausible relationship with the outcome of death.

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^111xAZtD]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the United States and requires 1–3% of healthcare expenditure due to stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge. This challenge is demonstrated by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains: acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control.

The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in the organization of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models providing patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods.

### Stroke with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: A descriptive population-based study from the Brest stroke registry [^11414LHG]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The study focused on the prevalence of atrial arrhythmia-related strokes in 2008, analyzed by age and gender. Out of 733 ischemic stroke patients recorded that year, 231 were identified with atrial arrhythmia (AA), accounting for 31.5% of the cases. Among the 207 patients with known AA before their strokes, CHADS2 scores were calculated: 10 patients (4.8%) scored 0, while 33 (15.9%) scored 1.

- **Demographics and baseline characteristics**: The demographics and baseline characteristics of the population were collected, including important metrics like standard deviation (SD) and details on transient ischemic attacks (TIA).

- **Antithrombotic therapy and CHADS2 score**: Antithrombotic therapy details based on CHADS2 scores revealed that 54 of the 152 patients (73.4%) with a score ≥ 2 received Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA), with aspirin used concurrently in three cases. Importantly, INR was undetermined in two instances for patients on VKA.

- **Proportion of high-risk patients on VKA**: As age increases, the proportion of patients at high risk for thromboembolism (TE) with CHADS2 scores ≥ 2 receiving VKA decreased significantly: 50% for ages 50–74, 43.8% for ages 75–84, and 25% for those aged ≥ 85.

- **Comparison of risk scores**: The CHA2DS2-VASc score was also assessed for the 207 patients with known AA. The CHA2DS2-VASc score showed a higher number of patients at high risk of TE (195) compared to CHADS2 (152).

Figures and tables were used throughout the study to depict prevalence, patient flow, demographics, antithrombotic therapy by CHADS2 score, and INR measurements in treated patients. These visual aids enhanced understanding of the population dynamics and treatment strategies within the studied cohort.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116QXbLS]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for atrial fibrillation, specifically in the initial evaluation, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend obtaining a TTE to assess cardiac structure. Laboratory testing, including a CBC, metabolic panel, and thyroid function, is advised. When clinical suspicion exists, targeted testing is encouraged to assess for other medical conditions associated with AF. This approach helps determine stroke and bleeding risk factors and identifies underlying conditions to guide further management in patients with newly diagnosed AF.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy [^117HXFhq]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and affects at least 1% of the population, amounting to 5.5 to 7 million patients with AF in Europe. AF is characterized by very rapid, irregular electrical activation of the atria (350 to 400 bpm), resulting in:

- **Loss of coordinated contraction and transport function**: Occurs in the atria, leading to impaired cardiac function.
- **Irregular ventricular rate and loss of adaptation**: Arrhythmia absoluta results in the heart's inability to adjust to increased demands.

In an aging population, the prevalence and incidence of AF will increase dramatically in the next decades. Unlike most other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation can usually not be cured. Most patients progress from paroxysmal AF, which alternates with periods of sinus rhythm, to sustained forms, even when currently available therapeutic options are applied. This sobering finding is aggravated by the dramatic consequences that AF implies for affected individuals and society.

- **Natural time course of atrial fibrillation**: A typical chaotic time pattern is shown, with atrial fibrillation in black and sinus rhythm in grey over time. The condition progresses from undiagnosed to first diagnosed, paroxysmal, persistent, and finally to permanent. Flashes indicate cardioversions as examples of therapeutic interventions that influence the natural time course of the arrhythmia.

One of the reasons why atrial fibrillation presents such challenges is due to its progressive nature and the limitations of current therapies in halting its advancement.

### Emergency department management of atrial fibrillation and flutter and patient quality of life at one month postvisit [^111AQG13]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We identified characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter that are associated with favorable assessments of emergency department (ED) effectiveness and 30-day quality of life.

- **Methods**: As part of a prospective, observational study of ED management and short-term outcomes of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or flutter, a disease-specific quality-of-life instrument was adapted. The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-life survey was administered via telephone to patients 30 days after an ED visit during which they were treated for newly diagnosed or recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter and subsequently discharged home. Respondents were asked to rate the effectiveness of their ED treatment. Using data collected prospectively in the ED and extracted from electronic health records, rhythm management (including cardioversion attempts and type) as well as patient and ED treatment characteristics, were recorded. Multivariable regression was used to examine the association between these characteristics and patient-reported effectiveness of ED treatment ("very effective" or not) and any quality-of-life effect related to atrial fibrillation or flutter.

- **Results**: A total of 652 eligible ED patients (response rate 89%) treated between May 2011 and November 2012 completed follow-up. Among these patients, 454 (69.6%) reported their ED treatment as "very effective" and 113 (17.3%) reported no influence on quality of life. Multivariable analyses indicated an association between ED electrocardioversion and perceived ED effectiveness (p < 0.05), though no association was found between the treatment strategy and 30-day quality of life outcomes.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter-a view from a national cohort study [^111YYYe5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This case-control cohort study included a large number of cases and showed different prognoses between atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial fibrillation (AF). In a real-world setting without any preventative ischemic stroke strategy, AF and AFL were associated with different comorbidities and incidences of ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. These differences in the incidences of ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality still existed after propensity score matching.
