## Question

What drug is bedt to add to dtatin for secondary prevention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which drug is best to add to statin therapy for secondary prevention of ASCVD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification for secondary prevention. Then, I should verify the LDL-C targets and thresholds that trigger add-on therapy. Next, I will compare the evidence and guideline positions for ezetimibe versus PCSK9 inhibitors. After that, I need to consider cost-effectiveness and practical issues like administration and adherence. Finally, I will synthesize a stepwise recommendation and note special populations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. Secondary prevention refers to patients with established ASCVD, who are typically categorized as high or very high risk depending on the number and recency of events and major risk enhancers; this risk category drives how aggressively we intensify LDL-C lowering beyond statins [^116uy3zW] [^113geprU].

> I should confirm the LDL-C goals and thresholds that trigger add-on therapy. For very high-risk ASCVD, contemporary guidance targets at least a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline and an on-treatment LDL-C less than 55 mg/dL; if this is not achieved on maximally tolerated statin, we escalate therapy, and in the US, a threshold of LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (or non-HDL-C 100 mg/dL or higher) is commonly used to consider adding nonstatin therapy [^113geprU] [^116uy3zW].

> Now, I will examine the comparative evidence for ezetimibe versus PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on therapy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit and certainty. High-quality network meta-analyses show that adding ezetimibe to statins reduces myocardial infarction and stroke with moderate certainty, and adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to statins reduces MI and stroke to a greater absolute degree in very high-risk patients, though both generally do not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in these trials [^113UCpzm] [^112SYNSK]. I should double-check the landmark trials: IMPROVE-IT demonstrated event reduction with ezetimibe added to statin after ACS, and FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES showed robust event reduction with PCSK9 inhibitors on top of statins in high-risk ASCVD populations [^112BvZ71] [^115yiyoW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which agent to choose first. I need to check guideline hierarchies. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on a stepwise approach: maximize statin intensity first, then add ezetimibe as the initial nonstatin agent if LDL-C remains above threshold, and reserve PCSK9 inhibitor therapy for patients who remain above threshold despite statin plus ezetimibe or for those who are statin intolerant and at high or very high risk. This sequencing reflects efficacy, safety, and cost considerations [^116uy3zW] [^112SYNSK] [^112WPdDc].

> Let me consider cost-effectiveness because it meaningfully influences the first add-on choice. Ezetimibe is generic, oral, and far less expensive than PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies; economic analyses using trial-based NNTs show ezetimibe is dramatically more cost-effective for preventing MACE than PCSK9 inhibitors at typical US prices, reinforcing ezetimibe as the preferred first add-on when available and appropriate [^111cL229].

> I should confirm practical and safety aspects that affect adherence and shared decision-making. Ezetimibe is oral and once daily with a favorable tolerability profile, whereas PCSK9 inhibitors are injectable every 2–4 weeks and can cause injection-site reactions; these burdens matter to patients and can sway the choice toward ezetimibe as the initial add-on in routine practice [^112SYNSK] [^113tPf4r].

> But wait, what if the patient is at very high risk with persistently high LDL-C despite statin plus ezetimibe, or is statin intolerant? In that scenario, I need to ensure we escalate appropriately: adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable and evidence-based, with substantial additional LDL-C lowering and event reduction, and this step is supported by major guidelines and outcome trials in ACS and stable ASCVD populations [^116uy3zW] [^113geprU] [^115yiyoW].

> I will now examine special populations briefly. In diabetes with ASCVD, standards endorse high-intensity statin with very low LDL-C targets and recommend adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor if goals are not met. In older adults, especially over 75, I should verify tolerance and comorbidities before intensifying, but continuation or initiation of statins remains appropriate in many cases with individualized decisions for add-on therapy [^113XtMp8] [^115GfDUL] [^115vtFC5].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Let me first confirm timing: check a lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to assess percent LDL-C reduction and on-treatment level, then monitor adherence and safety every 3–12 months. If targets are not met, proceed with the stepwise escalation described above, documenting shared decision-making when adding injectables or higher-cost agents [^116uy3zW].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear and actionable. For secondary prevention, the best drug to add to statin therapy is ezetimibe as the first-line add-on after maximizing statin intensity, because it achieves meaningful LDL-C lowering and event reduction with strong cost-effectiveness and excellent tolerability; if LDL-C remains at or above threshold or the patient is statin intolerant, then add a PCSK9 inhibitor as the next step, recognizing greater absolute risk reduction but higher cost and injection burden, and engage in shared decision-making throughout [^116uy3zW] [^112SYNSK] [^113UCpzm] [^111cL229].

---

For secondary prevention, **ezetimibe is the preferred first add-on** [^112SYNSK] to statin therapy when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin, as it reduces cardiovascular events [^113UCpzm] with favorable cost and tolerability [^116hypxj]. If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin plus ezetimibe, or if statin intolerance limits LDL-C lowering, **add a PCSK9 inhibitor** [^116uy3zW] to further reduce events [^115yiyoW]. Bempedoic acid or inclisiran are alternatives for statin-intolerant patients or when PCSK9 inhibitors are unavailable or contraindicated [^115GfDUL]. Combination therapy is guided by LDL-C targets and patient-specific factors, with shared decision-making to balance benefits, costs, and preferences [^112SYNSK].

## Evidence supporting ezetimibe as first-line add-on therapy

- **IMPROVE-IT trial**: Ezetimibe added to statin therapy in post-ACS patients reduced LDL-C by ~24 mg/dL and lowered the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 6.4% (HR 0.936, 95% CI 0.887–0.988) [^112BvZ71].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Ezetimibe is generic, oral, and substantially more cost-effective than PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention [^111cL229].

- **Guideline support**: ACC/AHA and AACE recommend ezetimibe as the first add-on when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin [^116uy3zW] [^112WPdDc].

---

## Evidence supporting PCSK9 inhibitors as second-line therapy

- **FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES**: PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab) added to statins reduced LDL-C by ~60% and significantly reduced cardiovascular events in very high-risk ASCVD patients [^113UCpzm] [^115yiyoW].

- **Guideline support**: ACC/AHA recommends adding a PCSK9 inhibitor when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite statin plus ezetimibe, or in statin-intolerant patients [^116uy3zW] [^112nizyu].

- **Limitations**: High cost and injection burden limit routine first-line use; shared decision-making is essential [^112SYNSK].

---

## Alternative therapies for statin-intolerant patients

- **Bempedoic acid**: Oral, well tolerated, and reduces LDL-C by ~18% [^113tPf4r]; consider when statins are not tolerated or as an alternative to PCSK9 inhibitors [^115GfDUL].

- **Inclisiran**: siRNA targeting PCSK9, administered every 6 months, with ~50% LDL-C reduction; suitable for statin-intolerant patients or when PCSK9 inhibitors are unavailable [^113tPf4r] [^115GfDUL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

| **Guideline** | **First-line add-on** | **Second-line add-on** | **Alternative therapies** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2018 | Ezetimibe | PCSK9 inhibitor | Bempedoic acid, inclisiran |
| AACE 2025 | Ezetimibe | PCSK9 inhibitor | Bempedoic acid, inclisiran |
| ESC 2019 | Ezetimibe | PCSK9 inhibitor | Bempedoic acid, inclisiran |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing therapy selection

- **LDL-C levels**: Guide intensity and need for combination therapy [^113geprU].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Very high-risk patients benefit most from aggressive LDL-C lowering [^113UCpzm].

- **Tolerance and adherence**: Influence choice and sequencing of therapies [^112SYNSK].

- **Cost and access**: Ezetimibe is preferred initially due to affordability and accessibility [^116hypxj].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line add-on**: Ezetimibe when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin [^116uy3zW].

- **Second-line add-on**: PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin plus ezetimibe, or in statin-intolerant patients [^112SYNSK].

- **Alternatives**: Bempedoic acid or inclisiran for statin-intolerant patients or when PCSK9 inhibitors are unavailable [^115GfDUL].

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential to balance benefits, costs, and patient preferences [^112SYNSK].

---

Ezetimibe is the **preferred first add-on** to statin therapy for secondary prevention, with PCSK9 inhibitors as the next step when needed; alternatives like bempedoic acid or inclisiran are considered for statin intolerance or access issues.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial [^115VRR2C]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n = 4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n = 4449).

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.

Results

During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.01; p = 0.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; p = 0.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98; p = 0.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91; P < .001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73–1.15; p = 0.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85–1.13; p = 0.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P < .001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00159835.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular diseases: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115tijRU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who have had established cardiovascular diseases remain at elevated risks of recurrent cardiovascular events, leading to an increased risk of death. Therefore, secondary preventions targeting the established risk factors for this group of patients represent a high priority. For decades, statins have been regarded as the first-line drugs for lowering cholesterol levels and prevention of potential cardiovascular events. But a considerable proportion of high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients do not achieve adequate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) despite of the intensive statin therapy. According to the latest US and European guidelines, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in combination with statin and ezetimibe therapy are recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.

PCSK9 accelerates degradation of LDL receptors, thereby inhibiting the removal of LDL from the circulation. Thereafter, by controlling the expression of LDL receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, modulators that inhibit PCSK9 could reduce LDL-C and subsequently major cardiovascular events. This therapy may be more effective in reducing LDL-C and other atherogenic lipids in high-risk patients treated with the maximum tolerated dose of statins, as well as those who are intolerant to statins. Although there are safety concerns such as the potential risk of new-onset diabetes, several meta-analyses have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors showed better effects in reducing LDL-C levels and improving clinical benefits than other lipid-lowering agents for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, due to the lack of direct comparisons between different medications, the optimal agent targeting PCSK9 to reduce the risk of death after cardiovascular events remains undetermined. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of different PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Coronary event secondary prevention with statins irrespective of LDL-cholesterol [^116TgwHy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for statin secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in patients with near-optimal or optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-October 2003) was conducted using the search terms HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, statins, coronary disease, post-myocardial infarction, and average cholesterol.

Data Synthesis

Secondary prevention trials enrolling subjects with near-optimal (< 130 mg/dL) or optimal (< 100 mg/dL) baseline LDL-C were included. Early statin secondary prevention studies suggested attenuated benefit, but more recent trials challenge this finding.

Conclusions

Statin secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in patients near goal LDL-C is controversial, but recent trial results show promise.

ACC nonstatin therapy — assumptions and target patient groups specify that algorithms begin with four management groups and statin use: "Adults aged ≥ 20 years with clinical ASCVD on statin therapy for secondary prevention"; "Adults aged ≥ 20 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (not due to secondary modifiable causes) on statin therapy for primary prevention"; "Adults aged 40–75 years without ASCVD, but with diabetes and LDL-C < 190 mg/dL, on statin therapy for primary prevention"; and "Adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes, with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD ≥ 7.5%, on statin therapy for primary prevention", and further that "the patient is currently taking the maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy or has attempted to take statin therapy" while clinician and patient decide "whether additional therapy is needed to further reduce ASCVD risk".

### Consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology on the management of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease algorithm-2020 executive summary [^111g27S2]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

### 2018 AHA / ACC / AACVPR / AAPA / ABC / ACPM / ADA / AGS / APhA / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114iwVRR]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^115scsbt]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

However, despite this well-established role of statin therapy in secondary prevention patients, statin use is also associated with AEs and residual risk. Statin-related AEs might impair the effectiveness of statin therapy. Most of the AEs are muscle-related; however, there are also other statin-associated AEs, such as sleep disorders, hair loss, gastroenterological disorders or cognitive disorders, but for many of them causality has still not been confirmed. It is relevant to note that patients with statin-related side effects at baseline were excluded from the trials and that knowledge is mainly based on observational cohort studies, which probably overestimate the number of patients with AEs after statin therapy. Statin intolerance is a real phenomenon, which can affect up to 15% of patients, and knowledge of the most common AEs associated with statin therapy is crucial to ensure effective treatment of lipid disorders by reducing the risk of discontinuing statin therapy and improving therapy adherence. However, with careful management (take your time approach) we might successfully treat over 90% of the patients previously reporting statin intolerance.

The issue of residual risk has been widely discussed for many years, each time with the occasion of new drug development for dyslipidaemic patients. According to available studies residual risk involves 50–70% of patients treated with statins, and recent data from the EUROASPIRE IV survey suggest that despite the fact that the majority (87%) of secondary prevention patients now receive a statin, only 21% of high-risk patients have LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l) and 58% below 100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l). Several factors can influence residual risk; this is associated with patients at very high risk with concomitant diseases and polypharmacy, and the problem of significant underuse of high doses of statins – in many European countries as well as in the United States atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg is used in < 5% of dyslipidaemic patients. Finally the question is whether we should expect that one drug (a statin) would completely reduce the overall risk? Probably the best answer to this question regarding the role of statins in secondary prevention is the fact that all available (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) and currently investigated (e.g. PCSK9 and CETP inhibitors) drugs are mainly considered for use 'on top of' statins.

### Dyslipidemia management for cardiovascular disease… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level.

There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality. The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent.

Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe. Diet One diet has clinical evidence of decreasing risk in primary and secondary prevention. A dietitian-led Mediterranean diet decreases rates of cardiovascular events, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been studied extensively but does not reduce cardiovascular risk. Fiber, ginger, green tea, garlic, and red yeast rice have been suggested for dyslipidemia, but evidence is insufficient for recommendation. For patients taking statins, monitoring response by measuring lipid levels is generally unnecessary because titration to a specific cholesterol level is of uncertain benefit. Cholesterol measurement for patients receiving secondary prevention should be limited to only those high-risk patients in whom icosapent ethyl or PCSK9 inhibitors are being considered.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Personalizing treatment: between primary and secondary prevention [^116MmVat]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called "intermediate risk" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are "between" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: cons [^116wHW7Y]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

While recent decades have seen substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart disease remains the number one cause of death both in the United States and globally. This has led many to advocate for prescribing statins even more widely, including to patients with low risk of cardiovascular disease, based on the hypothesis that any reduction in lipid levels will eventually translate to a reduction in the development of atherosclerosis and thus to subsequent mortality. However, empirical evidence to date has not substantiated the hoped for benefits of this strategy. When healthy patients without cardiovascular disease are prescribed statins they do not live longer, and they have only a marginal reduction in the risk of ischemic events. Furthermore, statins cause numerous side effects which substantially limit their net benefit. These tradeoffs are even more lopsided in elderly patients treated for primary prevention, in whom statin therapy does not lead to a reduction in mortality or ischemic events and has the potential for significant harms. Strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease should therefore avoid a focus on cholesterol levels and subsequent pharmacological therapy and should instead redouble efforts to improve the lifestyle factors that are far more consequential to the development of cardiovascular disease and overall good health.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia — secondary prevention high-risk subgroups and intensification evidence notes that higher risk subgroups include patients with (1) MI or ACS in past 12 months; (2) recurrent ACS, MI, or CVA; or (3) established CVD with additional risk factors, and these patients are more likely to benefit from intensified treatment (e.g., maximum dose statins, addition of ezetimibe, then addition of PCSK9 inhibitor) to reduce cardiovascular risk; in patients with DM, a meta-analysis comparing standard-dose versus intensive-dose statins for secondary prevention showed a statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events with the more intensive dose (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84–0.98) with sample sizes of placebo comparisons (n = 4,351) and intensive-dose comparisons (n = 4,805), and another meta-analysis compared more intensive lipid-lowering therapy (n = 76,678) to less intensive therapy and evaluated 19 clinical trials (n = 75,829).

4 PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES

4.1 General comments

For patients with ACS, the European guideline recommends the addition of nonstatin agents to high‐intensity maximal statin in a sequential approach (first ezetimibe, then PCSK9 inhibitors; both are class I recommendations) if the LDL‐C is above the target of > 55 mg/L (Table 1) at each step. Whereas, the American guideline recommends the addition of ezetimibe (class I) to high‐intensity statin (sequential approach not specified) if the addition of PCSK9 inhibitors is considered. This is not deemed mandatory, but instead considered reasonable if the LDL‐C is above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (class IIa).

4.2 American perspectives

In secondary prevention of patients at very high‐risk, the use of ezetimibe is recommended if the LDL levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin (class IIa). 8 However, the addition of ezetimibe is recommended to maximally tolerated statin therapy as the first step in lowering LDL‐C (class I) if a combination with PCSK9 inhibitor as a third agent is being considered. The strategy of ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended because generic ezetimibe is available, simple to administer (oral, once daily), and has proven safety and tolerability with long‐term data. 8 Adherence to changes in lifestyle and effects of LDL‐C‐lowering medication should be assessed 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter for adherence and safety. 1 If tolerated maximal LDL‐C lowering therapy, the LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non‐HDL‐C is ≥ 100 mg/dL, the addition of PCSK9 is considered reasonable (class IIa). 9, 15 The rationale regarding the recommendation for PCSK9 inhibitors in the US guidelines included cost considerations and a dedicated cost‐effectiveness analysis for the US population 1 in addition to the scientific evidence from the large clinical trials. 9, 10

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

Algorithm: Management of Dyslipidemia for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction — patients are assessed for heart failure with ejection fraction (EF) < 35%, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or life expectancy < 5 years; if present, the algorithm states to "Discuss lack of evidence demonstrating benefit and continue ongoing care". It directs "Recommend stepped intensification 1. Maximize statin or add ezetimibe 2. Consider PCSK9 inhibitor only after maximizing statin and adding ezetimibe". In patients with "CVD per Sidebar 1, DM, or LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL", with "10-year CVD risk > 12%", or with "10-year risk 6–12%" who prefer statin therapy, it says "Recommend moderate-dose statin (see Sidebar 3)"; otherwise, it advises "Recommend regular aerobic exercise† and smoking cessation (if applicable)". The algorithm also recommends "Recommend dietitian-led Mediterranean diet for risk > 12%". Follow-up guidance states under "Primary prevention, no statin:" to obtain "Lipids every 10 years, recommend non-fasting" and to "Repeat risk evaluation at Box 1" "Every 2 years if 6–12%" or "Every 5 years if < 6%" or "If risk factors change"; for "Secondary prevention: lipids as needed only if higher risk and willing to intensify" and "Once on optimal therapy, no need to recheck lipids routinely". A scope note adds, " There are no evidence-based recommendations for patients under age 40 because there is no evidence for the benefit of lipid screening and treatment within this age group".

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

Prescription versus adherence — statin use after diagnosis is low: only 33% were using statins within 3 months of incident diagnosis, increasing to 37% at 18 months; at 2 years' follow-up, half of patients are no longer taking statins, and among those continuing, studies have shown patients take fewer than 50% of the doses prescribed.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention — statin therapy recommendations: In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or who experience statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and who are on maximally tolerated LDL-C– lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non–HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician– patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy and are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes… [^1175d6Qs]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prior to the implementation of dual APT and PCI as the treatment of choice, vitamin K antagonists have been widely investigated with conflicting findings. 8, 9 Recently, direct oral anticoagulants in addition to APT have been shown to reduce the risk of ischemic events at the cost of a higher risk of bleeding. 10–18. The APPRAISE, APPRAISE-J, Rivaroxaban versus Placebo in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes, and Dose Finding Study for Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome clinical trials reported 6-month follow-up outcomes, 12, 13, 15, 18 while APPRAISE 2 and ATLAS-ACS 2 TIMI 51 reported 8-month and 13-month follow-up, respectively. 14, 16. Figure 2 summarizes risks of the primary efficacy and safety end points with DOAC in addition to APT as compared with APT alone in studies that reported outcomes that were stratified by type of ACS.

Among patients presenting with STEMI, DOAC in addition to APT resulted in a significantly lower risk of the primary efficacy end point as compared with patients who were treated with APT alone, with no evidence of heterogeneity. Several clinical trials have evaluated the effect of DOAC in ACS, mainly using them in addition to dual APT with aspirin and clopidogrel. A favorable effect was achieved only with low-dose regimens of rivaroxaban in the ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 trial. Specifically, rivaroxaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, in addition to dual APT was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as compared with a standard dual APT regimen, with a 2-fold increase in the risk of major bleeding. 16 To improve safety, the. Adding rivaroxaban to aspirin lowered the risk of major vascular events as well as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality but increased the risk of major bleeding as compared with aspirin alone.

The results of the COMPASS clinical trial suggest that low-intensity simultaneous inhibition of both coagulation and platelet activity could be more effective in terms of preventing ischemic events as compared with APT alone.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^112BucZM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The residual risk of incomplete control of non-HDL-C in the context of controlled LDL-C has been explored by 2 recent studies in Denmark. One study of 13,015 statin-treated patients from the general population found that a non-HDL-C above the sample median was associated with residual risk of mortality and MI even with LDL-C below median. In secondary prevention, a cohort study conducted in Denmark found that among persons with LDL-C at target (≤ 70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L]), a non-HDL-C ≥ 97 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) was associated with increased risk of MI, ASCVD, and death. To our knowledge, no studies have explored guideline-directed non-HDL-C thresholds after statin initiation and the association with incident CV events in primary prevention. Thus, our findings add to existing literature.

There remains debate around a treat-to-target approach vs simply initiating a moderate or high-intensity statin depending on CV risk. The Canadian Patients Experience Evidence Research (PEER) simplified lipid guidelinerecommends against repeat lipid testing and use of lipid targets/thresholds, and U.S. guidelines moved away from lipid targets in 2013 with more recent guidelines incorporating percent LDL-C lowering. In 2023, the U.S. National Lipid Association and American Society for Preventive Cardiology advocated for use of LDL-C targets. A treat-to-target approach is centered around analyses that show lower risk of CV events with lower achieved LDL-C levels in statin randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a lack of RCT evidence demonstrating whether targeting specific lipid levels is superior to simply initiating statins in primary prevention. Among patients with coronary artery disease, a 2023 RCTfound that a treat-to-target approach was noninferior to high-dose statins in reducing risk of adverse CV events. It is argued that a treat-to-target approach may allow for tailored therapy (eg, use of moderate dose statins to achieve lipid targets in patients at > 20% 10-year CVD risk). While our study cannot show which approach is best, we found that 20% to 30% of patients remain above guideline-directed thresholds for intensification with initial statin therapy and that there is an associated risk of adverse CV events associated with this. Given a small portion were on high-intensity statins, increasing statin doses could be considered without the need for a second agent.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117MxcDT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials [^113Lr7s1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lipid‐lowering therapy with statins is highly beneficial for prevention of secondary and high‐risk primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, some patients cannot tolerate recommended statin doses 1; a high proportion of patients do not achieve adequate reduction of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), despite high‐intensity statin therapy 2; and even patients who achieve guideline recommended reductions may have high residual ASCVD risk. 3 Consequently, alternative therapies designed to lower LDL‐C and improve outcomes are needed. Improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were observed recently with combination treatment with ezetimibe; however, these improvements were modest, and outcome data on monotherapy with ezetimibe are limited. 4 The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab have been associated with reduction of LDL‐C levels and recently with improved cardiovascular outcomes in the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial. 5 However, questions remain about the patients who are most likely to derive the greatest clinical benefits and the safety profile of this class of drugs. We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the cumulative evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors, with an emphasis on cardiovascular outcomes.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: a review [^111sXUHF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite important advances in the initial treatment and secondary prevention of ACS, ≈20% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months; 5‐year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. Knowledge of the current state of evidence‐based lipid management after ACS is of paramount importance to improve outcomes after ACS. Guidelines recommend obtaining a lipid profile soon after admission for ACS. A systematic evaluation of the efficacy of the lipid‐lowering therapy initiated following ACS should be performed early, with an LDL‐C reduction target of > 50% from baseline. Three agents with well‐documented safety and efficacy can be prescribed: statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitors provide a consistent reduction in ischemic events, as shown by multiple large‐scale clinical trials with lack of major safety concerns. The main barrier to the widespread prescription of these drugs relates to their considerable costs when compared with other lipid‐lowering agents. However, the progressive reduction in manufacturing costs observed with PCSK9 inhibitors may enhance their cost‐effectiveness in daily practice as well as potentially leading to a paradigm shift in the management of high‐risk patients, such as those with an ACS. Eventually, contemporary innovations in lipid‐lowering pharmacotherapies alongside continuous medical education will enable patients to achieve guideline‐directed LDL‐C targets, and will improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and cardiovascular outcomes [^115yiyoW]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Dyslipidemia, particularly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a key risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and lipid-lowering drugs are beneficial for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. While statins are clear first-line drugs, new drug developments such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes when added to statins. Evolocumab reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ASCVD when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy (± ezetimibe), and recent data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial indicate that alirocumab added to maximally tolerated statin therapy (± other lipid-lowering drugs) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. In this article the authors review the available data on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes. Areas covered: This article reviews the available data on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on CV outcomes. Relevant papers were identified from a search of PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Expert opinion: The authors conclude that PCSK9 inhibitors provide substantial and durable reductions in LDL-C levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Usefulness of ezetimibe versus evolocumab as add-on therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111cL229]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Evolocumab and ezetimibe, were both proven to significantly reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), in type 2 diabetes patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > 70 mg/dl despite statin therapy. Providing evolocumab for all such patients may be a significant burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, we analyzed the treatment cost of ezetimibe versus evolocumab to prevent 1 MACE. We extracted the number needed to treat (NNT) with evolocumab or with ezetimibe for avoiding MACE from the published FOURIER and IMPROVE-IT trials respectively. Drug costs were based on 2018 US prices. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to overcome variances in terms of population risk, efficacy of therapies, and costs. In FOURIER, the 1-year NNT for avoiding MACE with evolocumab was 104 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 66 to 235). In IMPROVE-IT, the 1-year NNT with ezetimibe was 124 (95% CI 73 to 288). The annual cost of evolocumab and ezetimibe is $6,540 and $88, respectively. Therefore, the cost to prevent 1 MACE in the FOURIER and IMPROVE-IT trials would have been $678,981 (95% CI $429,810 to $1,537,910,149) and $10,870 (95% CI $6,384 to $25,322), respectively. Ezetimibe was consistently a cost-saving strategy compared with evolocumab, in all analyses performed, except for the case where evolocumab price is significantly reduced and the branded ezetimibe is used. In conclusion, treatment with ezetimibe seems to be a major cost-saving strategy for preventing MACE in this patient population.

### Utilization of and adherence to guideline-recommended lipid-lowering therapy after acute coronary syndrome: opportunities for improvement [^116qfRLW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In addition to aggressive lifestyle and nonlipid risk factor modification, statin therapy improves cardiovascular disease outcomes following acute coronary syndromes. Despite established benefits of treatment, contemporary registries reveal substantial underutilization of and nonadherence to statin therapy for secondary prevention. In randomized controlled trials investigating statin therapy, including moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe therapy, rates of nonadherence are reported in up to 40% of subjects. Durable strategies to address gaps in lipid lowering for secondary prevention are essential to maximize reduction in cardiovascular disease risk.

### Recent clinical studies of the effects of lipid-modifying therapies [^116HAb7y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Results from multiple clinical trials, primarily with the class of lipid-lowering agents known as statins, have shown that reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease. Although LDL cholesterol is the primary target of cholesterol management strategies, increasing attention has focused on the role of inflammation, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We review major trials with lipid-modifying therapies published since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines. A pivotal trial was the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), which demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in healthy individuals without elevated LDL cholesterol but with high levels of the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Additional trials demonstrated the efficacy of intensive statin therapy in secondary prevention, whereas other agents, including fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, ezetimibe, and experimental cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have been evaluated for their ability to reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe with or without statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113UCpzm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the impact of ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in adults taking maximally tolerated statin therapy or who are statin intolerant.

Design

Network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to 31 December 2020.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors with ≥ 500 patients and follow-up of ≥ 6 months.

Main Outcome Measures

We performed frequentist fixed-effects network meta-analysis and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) to assess certainty of evidence. Results included relative risks (RR) and absolute risks per 1000 patients treated for five years for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. We estimated absolute risk differences assuming constant RR (estimated from network meta-analysis) across different baseline therapies and cardiovascular risk thresholds; the PREDICT risk calculator estimated cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. Patients were categorised at low to very high cardiovascular risk. A guideline panel and systematic review authors established the minimal important differences (MID) of 12 per 1000 for MI and 10 per 1000 for stroke.

Results

We identified 14 trials assessing ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors among 83660 adults using statins. Adding ezetimibe to statins reduced MI (RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.94)) and stroke (RR 0.82 (0.71 to 0.96)) but not all-cause mortality (RR 0.99 (0.92 to 1.06)) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.97 (0.87 to 1.09)). Similarly, adding PCSK9 inhibitor to statins reduced MI (0.81 (0.76 to 0.87)) and stroke (0.74 (0.64 to 0.85)) but not all-cause (0.95 (0.87 to 1.03)) or cardiovascular mortality (0.95 (0.87 to 1.03)). Among adults with very high cardiovascular risk, adding PCSK9 inhibitor was likely to reduce MI (16 per 1000) and stroke (21 per 1000) (moderate to high certainty); whereas adding ezetimibe was likely to reduce stroke (14 per 1000), but the reduction of MI (11 per 1000) (moderate certainty) did not reach MID. Adding ezetimibe to PCSK9 inhibitor and statin may reduce stroke (11 per 1000), but the reduction of MI (9 per 1000) (low certainty) did not reach MID. Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins and ezetimibe may reduce MI (14 per 1000) and stroke (17 per 1000) (low certainty). Among adults with high cardiovascular risk, adding PCSK9 inhibitor probably reduced MI (12 per 1000) and stroke (16 per 1000) (moderate certainty); adding ezetimibe probably reduced stroke (11 per 1000), but the reduction in MI did not achieve MID (8 per 1000) (moderate certainty). Adding ezetimibe to PCSK9 inhibitor and statins did not reduce outcomes beyond MID, while adding PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe and statins may reduce stroke (13 per 1000). These effects were consistent in statin-intolerant patients. Among moderate and low cardiovascular risk groups, adding PCSK9 inhibitor or ezetimibe to statins yielded little or no benefit for MI and stroke.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors may reduce non-fatal MI and stroke in adults at very high or high cardiovascular risk who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy or are statin-intolerant, but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk.

### Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and clinical outcomes of combining ezetimibe with statin therapy in IMPROVE-IT [^113f3qJV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018 U.S. cholesterol management guideline recommends additional lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe for secondary prevention in very high-risk patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline LDL-C above and below 70 mg/dL and the benefit of adding ezetimibe to statin in patients post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo/simvastatin in post-ACS patients followed for 6 years (median). A total of 17,999 patients were stratified by LDL-C at qualifying event into 3 groups (50- < 70, 70- < 100, and 100–125 mg/dL). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, major coronary events, or stroke.

Results

Absolute differences in median LDL-C achieved at 4 months between treatment arms were similar (17–20 mg/dL). The effect of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo/simvastatin on primary endpoint was consistent regardless of baseline LDL-C of 50- < 70 mg/dL (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.80–1.05]), 70- < 100 mg/dL (HR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.87–1.01]), or 100–125 mg/dL (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.86–1.03]; P interaction = 0.95). Normalized relative risk reductions per 1-mmol/L difference in achieved LDL-C at 4 months between treatment arms were 21% in patients with baseline LDL-C of 50- < 70 mg/dL, 16% in those with 70- < 100 mg/dL, and 13% in those with 100–125 mg/dL (P interaction = 0.91). No significant treatment interactions by baseline LDL-C were present for safety endpoints.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe to statin consistently reduced the risk for cardiovascular events in post-ACS patients irrespective of baseline LDL-C values, supporting the use of intensive lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe even in patients with baseline LDL-C < 70 mg/dL.

Outcomes and procedures

Our outcomes were the proportion of eligible individuals self-reporting use of statins for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. We defined these outcomes to align with the monitoring indicator recommended in the WHO non-communicable diseases Global Monitoring Framework and WHO HEARTS Technical Package for cardiovascular diseases management in primary health care: "Proportion of eligible persons receiving drug therapy… to prevent heart attacks and strokes". We defined statin use among respondents on the basis of the answer to the following question in STEPS surveys: "Are you currently taking statins regularly to prevent or treat heart disease?" We defined cardiovascular disease history on the basis of the answer to the following question in STEPS surveys: "Have you ever had a heart attack or chest pain from heart disease (angina) or a stroke (cerebrovascular accident or incident)?"

Eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention was defined among individuals without a history of self-reported cardiovascular disease and with either: (1) a history of diagnosed diabetes or (2) a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of more than 20% using the 2019 WHO laboratory-based risk equations. These equations use individual-level inputs of age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol. The measurement of biological variables across surveys is summarised in appendix 2 (pp 30–33). Eligibility for statin therapy for secondary prevention was defined among individuals with a history of self-reported cardiovascular disease.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

Add-on lipid-lowering therapy with statins — evidence context and panel consensus indicates that lowering atherogenic cholesterol to levels below 70 mg/dL is beneficial, yet major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of add-on therapy enrolled patients with already low LDL-C before intensification (AIM-HIGH mean LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL; HPS2-THRIVE approximately 64 mg/dL; ACCORD ∼100 mg/dL). The NLA Expert Panel consensus view was that, until RCT data better define benefits and risks in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol remains elevated on the highest tolerated statin dose, consideration may be given to use of combination therapy with agents that further lower non–HDL-C and LDL-C to achieve goal levels, and the recommendation also extends to use of nonstatin drug therapies, alone or in combination, for patients with contraindications or intolerance to statins.

### Association of primary care providers' beliefs of statins for primary prevention and statin prescription [^111CHprD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline included major shifts in recommended approaches to primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 The ACC/AHA guideline significantly expanded the population eligible for statin lipid‐lowering therapy for primary prevention, mainly by emphasizing recommendations based on estimated cardiovascular risk and abandoning low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. One study estimated that 12.8 million additional adults would be eligible for statin therapy compared with prior guidelines. 2 However, before initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, the ACC/AHA guideline emphasized a clinician‐patient risk discussion. Although guidance has been published 3 detailing elements of discussions, little is known about how such discussions are currently being implemented in clinical practice or whether specific practices are associated with statin prescription.

Although the ACC/AHA guideline expanded the population eligible for statin therapy and recommended potentially higher doses of statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention, evidence to date indicates modest adoption in clinical practice. 4, 5, 6, 7 One study evaluated statin use in 161 cardiology practices before and after the ACC/AHA guideline, finding no significant difference in trends of use of moderate‐ to high‐intensity statins for eligible subgroups, with postguideline primary prevention use of 55.2% for diabetic patients and 46.9% for patients with no clinical ASCVD but elevated ASCVD risk. 8 A study using a national database of pharmacy and medical claims found that the ACC/AHA guideline publication was associated with a decrease in statin initiation. 9

Given that the current ACC/AHA guideline represented a substantial change in the approach to cholesterol management while also promoting individualized decision making, it is likely that clinician and patient beliefs impact decision making. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the implementation of the ACC/AHA guideline from the perspective of primary care providers (PCPs), potentially helping to explain patterns of uptake as well as to identify potential barriers and solutions. We hypothesized that community PCPs hold varying beliefs of the risks and benefits of statin therapy and report varying approaches to statin risk discussions with patients. We further hypothesized that the following PCP survey responses, pertaining to recommended elements of informed discussions, would be associated with increased statin prescription for primary prevention: (1) greater reported statin efficacy; (2) fewer number of adverse effects believed to be caused by statins; (3) lower reported deviation from the guidelines because of other cardiovascular risk factors; and (4) lower reported discordance between PCP recommendations and patient preferences.

3.3 European perspectives

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, European guideline recommends intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve on LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of nonstatin agent is recommended in the US guideline only for those above the threshold ≥ 70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guideline, the European guideline supports even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a recurrent ASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

Ezetimibe add-on therapy after acute coronary syndromes — Ezetimibe has been shown to produce significant additional improvements in LDL-C levels and goal attainment when added to statin therapy, and in IMPROVE-IT (18,444 patients) 7-year event rates were 32.7% with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus 34.7% with simvastatin alone (hazard ratio, 0.936; confidence interval, 0.887–0.988). Median LDL-C levels at 1 year were 53.2 mg/dL with ezetimibe plus simvastatin vs 69.9 mg/dL with simvastatin alone. According to the reported relationship of a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction from statin therapies, the predicted reduction with combination therapy would be 9.5%, which is nearly identical to the reported reduction of 10.6%, and the number needed to treat for prevention of the primary end point was 50 using 7-year event rates.

### All we need to know about lipoprotein (a) [^114n1q2F]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a genetically determined macromolecular complex, is independently and causally associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic stenosis via proposed proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and proatherogenic mechanisms. While Lp(a) measurement standardization issues are being resolved, several guidelines now support testing Lp(a) at least once in each adult's lifetime for ASCVD risk prediction which can foster implementation of more aggressive primary or secondary prevention therapies. Currently, there are several emerging targeted Lp(a) lowering therapies in active clinical investigation for safety and cardiovascular benefit among both primary and secondary prevention populations. First degree relatives of patients with high Lp(a) should be encouraged to undergo cascade screening. Primary prevention patients with high Lp(a) should consider obtaining a coronary calcium score for further risk estimation and to guide further ASCVD risk factor management including consideration of low dose aspirin therapy. Secondary prevention patients with high Lp(a) levels should consider adding PCSK9 inhibition to statin therapy.

### Niacin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^1126MpBv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotinic acid (niacin) is known to decrease LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increase HDL-cholesterol levels. The evidence of benefits with niacin monotherapy or add-on to statin-based therapy is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of niacin therapy versus placebo, administered as monotherapy or add-on to statin-based therapy in people with or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in terms of mortality, CVD events, and side effects.

Search Methods

Two reviewers independently and in duplicate screened records and potentially eligible full texts identified through electronic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries, and reference lists of relevant articles (latest search in August 2016).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that either compared niacin monotherapy to placebo/usual care or niacin in combination with other component versus other component alone. We considered RCTs that administered niacin for at least six months, reported a clinical outcome, and included adults with or without established CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers used pre-piloted forms to independently and in duplicate extract trials characteristics, risk of bias items, and outcomes data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or third party arbitration. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses based on risk of bias and different assumptions for missing data, and used meta-regression analyses to investigate potential relationships between treatment effects and duration of treatment, proportion of participants with established coronary heart disease and proportion of participants receiving background statin therapy. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs that were published between 1968 and 2015 and included 39,195 participants in total. The mean age ranged from 33 to 71 years. The median duration of treatment was 11.5 months, and the median dose of niacin was 2 g/day. The proportion of participants with prior myocardial infarction ranged from 0% (4 trials) to 100% (2 trials, median proportion 48%); the proportion of participants taking statin ranged from 0% (4 trials) to 100% (12 trials, median proportion 100%). Using available cases, niacin did not reduce overall mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.12; participants = 35,543; studies = 12; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; participants = 32,966; studies = 5; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), non-cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.28; participants = 32,966; studies = 5; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence), the number of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; participants = 34,829; studies = 9; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), nor the number of fatal or non-fatal strokes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.22; participants = 33,661; studies = 7; I² = 42%; low-quality evidence). Participants randomised to niacin were more likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects than participants randomised to control group (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.77; participants = 33,539; studies = 17; I² = 77%; moderate-quality evidence). The results were robust to sensitivity analyses using different assumptions for missing data.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that niacin does not reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, the number of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions, nor the number of fatal or non-fatal strokes but is associated with side effects. Benefits from niacin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease events are unlikely.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Figure 2A — adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — outlines a stepwise algorithm: verify achievement of ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 85 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin therapy; if achieved, make a decision for no additional medication and monitor adherence to lifestyle modifications, medications, and LDL-C response to therapy, with referral to the 2021 ACC ECDP on Management of Hypertriglyceridemia if persistent hypertriglyceridemia. If not achieved, evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs, and increase to high-intensity statin therapy if not already taking, then reassess the same LDL-C threshold. If still not at goal, consider the following initial nonstatin agents and add others as needed to achieve desired reduction of LDL-C: consider ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 mAb; may consider bempedoic acid or inclisiran. If goals remain unmet after nonstatin therapy, referral to lipid specialist and referral to RD/RDN are directed, with continued monitoring thereafter.

### Machine learning approaches improve risk stratification for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in multiethnic patients [^113jt8C3]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), secondary prevention strategies aim to minimise recurrent CVD events including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and death. Despite the use of first-line therapies, patients with established CVD remain at elevated risk for recurrent CVD events. Identifying high-risk patients is crucial to guide treatment intensification and personalisation, including with add-on therapies such as advanced lipid-lowering agents or novel antidiabetic agents. However, our ability to risk-stratify patients is limited by a paucity of validated predictive algorithms for secondary prevention. The Pooled Cohort Equations (PCEs) are used widely to predict atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk and guide statin therapy for primary prevention, but are not recommended for those with established CVD or those on statin therapy. Previously proposed models such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2°P) were also developed and validated in clinical trial cohorts leading to unclear applicability to diverse real-world CVD populations.

Machine learning (ML) can help develop broadly applicable risk stratification models for real world settings by leveraging datasets such as electronic health records (EHRs) and identifying variables and relationships between variables that may not be identified by traditional models.ML models have demonstrated significant promise for risk stratification in medicine across various populations, including for cardiovascular risk. To address the risk stratification gap for secondary prevention, we aimed to develop and evaluate supervised EHR-trained ML models to stratify CVD event risk compared with TRS 2°P in a multiethnic secondary prevention cohort for CVD risk stratification.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^116jAhDC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention in adults — the algorithm emphasizes lifestyle counseling and risk‑based statin use. Primary prevention begins with counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and risk assessment, recognizes risk enhancers such as "Metabolic syndrome/ MASLD", "CKD, chronic inflammatory diseases", and "Persistent LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L)", and advises to "Consider moderate- to high-intensity statin"; if "If LDL-C above goal on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe". For secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD), it specifies "High-intensity statin", then "If LDL-C above goal or continues to have CV events, add ezetimibe", and to "Consider add-on therapy: bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy, or bile acid resins", with the caveat, "Not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk. Use shared decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of the individual therapies". The figure also states, "AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL" and that "Potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals".

### Effect of statins and non-statin LDL-lowering medications on cardiovascular outcomes in secondary prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111odpo2]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Current evidence on dyslipidaemia management has expanded to novel treatments and very low achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We sought to compare the clinical impact of more-intensive vs. less-intensive LDL-C lowering by means of statins and currently recommended non-statin medications in secondary prevention.

Methods and Results

We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials of statins, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, or bile acid sequestrants with > 500 patients followed for ≥ 1year. We employed random-effects models using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare outcomes. We included 19 trials (15 of statins, 3 of PCSK9 inhibitors, and 1 of ezetimibe) with 152507 patients randomly assigned to more-intensive (n = 76678) or less-intensive treatment (n = 75829). More-intensive treatment was associated with 19% relative risk reduction for the primary outcome, major vascular events (MVEs; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77–0.86). Risk reduction was greater across higher baseline levels and greater achieved reductions of LDL-C. The clinical benefit was significant across varying types of more-intensive treatment and was consistent for statins (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.86) and non-statin agents (PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94) as active (more-intensive) intervention (P-interaction = 0.38). Each 1.0mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was associated with 19% relative decrease in MVE. Death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization also favoured more-intensive treatment.

Conclusion

Reduction of MVE is proportional to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering across a broad spectrum of on-treatment levels in secondary prevention. Statin intensification and add-on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe are associated with significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in this very high-risk population.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113Qxnuf]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — adults older than 75 years: According to national mortality data, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were respectively the first and fourth leading causes of death in adults 65 years or older in 2018, yet trial data on benefits in persons older than 75 years are limited, and available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against initiating statins for primary prevention in this age group. Evidence on potential harms specifically in adults 76 years or older is limited, while trials in the general adult population show statins are not associated with an increased risk of myalgia, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, or cognitive harms.

### Statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116ugS9h]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely used in the evidence-based lowering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The use of these drugs for secondary prevention of CVD is well founded, but their expanding use in primary prevention — in individuals without documented CVD — has raised some concerns. Firstly, evidence suggests that, in primary prevention, statins substantially decrease CVD morbidity, but only moderately reduce CVD mortality. Secondly, long-term statin use might cause adverse effects, such as incident diabetes mellitus. Thirdly, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, and has to be balanced against the risk of 'overmedicating' the general population. Data clearly support the use of statins for primary prevention in high-risk individuals, in whom the strategy is cost-effective and the benefits exceed the risks. Whether primary prevention is beneficial in individuals at low or moderate risk is not certain. Therefore, the prescription of statins for primary prevention should be individualized on the basis of clinical judgment, particularly for low-risk individuals. In appropriately selected individuals, statins should also be used for primary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^114H9Pin]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Shared decision making (SDM) — definition and quality measurement rationale states that SDM incorporates 2 perspectives: 1) clinicians recommending treatment based on strong evidence in which benefit exceeds risk and 2) patients deliberating on how treatments fit with their preferences, values, and personal context; in this framing, the clinician is the expert on evidence-based medicine and guidelines and the patient is the expert on his or her preferences, values, and personal context; SDM mitigates the power differential and both perspectives contribute equal weight to decision making; among patients prescribed statins for secondary prevention, most initiate treatment, but up to half discontinue statins at 1 to 2 years' follow-up; therefore, a measure reflecting the proportion who participated in SDM would promote participation, potentially increasing adherence to guideline-recommended care and improving patient-centered outcomes.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke… [^1144phc5]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

eFigure. Study Population. AHA/ASA indicates American Heart Association and American Stroke Association; DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy; NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Recommendations for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in patients with acute ischemic stroke have evolved over time. Although long-term DAPT was not recommended because of excessive bleeding risk, the CHANCE trial1 and the POINT trial2 shifted the focus to short-term DAPT in patients with minor ischemic stroke and found that DAPT was effective in reducing the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.

The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association subsequently updated recommendations for DAPT from "risk ≥ benefit" for routine secondary prevention after ischemic stroke in 2011, to "benefit ≥ risk" for minor ischemic stroke in 2014, to "benefit > > risk" in 2018, and eventually to "benefit > > > risk" in 2019. 3–6. Increased adoption of DAPT for secondary prevention in ischemic stroke was observed after publication of 2 pivotal trials and serial AHA/ASA guideline updates. This increase was observed in both minor ischemic strokes, for which guidelines recommended DAPT use, and in nonminor ischemic strokes, for which the risk-benefit ratio of DAPT has not been fully established. However, even after the release of the class I, level of evidence A recommendation, 53. 0% of patients with minor ischemic strokes did not receive DAPT.

This study has limitations, including a lack of documented reasons for prescribing or not prescribing DAPT, the timing of the initiation, the duration of antiplatelet treatment, the generalizability to patients treated at nonregistry hospitals or in other countries, and the lack of information on prescribing trends after June 2020. Nonetheless, these study findings suggest an important opportunity to improve adherence to evidence-based antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: this statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111xMLZH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2022 ACC ECDP on the role of nonstatin therapies in ASCVD risk reduction includes a discussion of the newer agents (bempedoic acid, evinacumab, and inclisiran) approved for LDL‐C lowering since the publication of the latest guidelines. In patients with clinical ASCVD at very high risk, the addition of nonstatin therapy is recommended if LDL‐C levels remain ≥ 55 mg/dL, in view of the favorable net clinical benefit. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are not at very high risk, a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline and a threshold of LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL is considered a desirable response to lipid‐lowering therapy.

Estimating the Risk of RecurrentEvents

Patients with established ASCVD are at very high risk for future events; however, this population has substantial variation in the degree of risk. The Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease risk score was developed to predict the 10‐year risk of recurrent vascular events, identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment intensification and facilitating a personalized approach to secondary prevention. Originally developed from the Utrecht Cardiovascular–Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease cohort, the tool has recently been updated with regional incidence rates, broadening its applicability across European and non‐European populations.

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115ZRUgR]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The benefits and risks associated with intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering statin-based therapies to lessen the risk of recurrent stroke have not been established.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to evaluate the association of more intensive vs less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies with outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1970, to July 31, 2021.

Study Selection

This meta-analysis included randomized clinical trials that compared more intensive vs less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies and recorded the outcome of recurrent stroke among patients with stroke.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Relative risk (RR) with 95% CI was used as a measure of the association of more intensive vs less intensive LDL-C lowering with primary and secondary outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was recurrent stroke, and the secondary outcomes were major cardiovascular events and hemorrhagic stroke.

Results

The final analysis included 11 randomized clinical trials with 20 163 patients (13 518 men [67.0%]; mean [SD] age, 64.9 [3.7] years) with stroke. The mean follow-up was 4 years (range, 1–6.1 years). Pooled results showed that more intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies were associated with a reduced risk of recurrent stroke compared with less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies (absolute risk, 8.1% vs 9.3%; RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96) and that the benefit associated with these LDL-C-lowering therapies was not different among LDL-C-lowering strategies (statins vs no statins: RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.01; more statins or ezetimibe vs less statins or ezetimibe: RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.96; and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors plus statins vs placebo plus statins: RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71–1.15; p = 0.42 for interaction). More intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies were associated with a reduced risk of major cardiovascular events, but with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, compared with less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies. More intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies were associated with a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in trials with all patients having evidence of atherosclerosis (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–0.91), but not in trials with most patients not having evidence of atherosclerosis (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85–1.07; p = 0.04 for interaction), compared with less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that the benefits and risks of more intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies for recurrent stroke risk reduction might be more favorable than the benefits and risks of less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies, especially for patients with evidence of atherosclerosis.

### Approach to the patient with a suboptimal statin response: causes and algorithm for clinical management [^113bsqqV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Statins are the lipid-lowering therapy of choice for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) but their effectiveness in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can substantially differ between individuals. In this mini-review, we describe the different causes for a suboptimal statin response and an algorithm for the diagnosis and clinical management of these patients.

Evidence Acquisition

A PubMed search using the terms "statin resistance", "statin sensitivity", "statin pharmacokinetics", "cardiovascular disease", and "lipid-lowering therapies" was performed. Published papers in the past 10 years that were relevant to the topic were examined to provide content for this mini-review.

Evidence Synthesis

Suboptimal lowering of LDL-C by statins is a major problem in the clinical management of patients and limits the value of this therapeutic approach. There are multiple causes of statin hyporesponsiveness with compliance being the most common explanation. Other causes, such as analytical issues with LDL-C measurement and the presence of common lipid disorders (familial hypercholesterolemia, elevated lipoprotein[a] and secondary dyslipidemias) should be excluded before considering primary statin resistance from rare genetic variants in lipoprotein-related or drug-metabolism genes. A wide variety of nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs are now available and can be added to statins to achieve more effective LDL-C lowering.

Conclusions

The evaluation of statin hyporesponsiveness is a multistep process that can lead to the optimization of lipid-lowering therapy for the prevention of ASCVD. It may also lead to the identification of distinct types of dyslipidemias that require specific therapies and/or the genetic screening of family members.

Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

Secondary prevention (fibrate added to statin versus statin alone) — ACCORD study: In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial, 5,518 patients with diabetes mellitus receiving open-label simvastatin (80 mg) were randomized to fenofibrate or placebo for a mean of 4.7 years, and approximately 36% had a prior cardiovascular disease event; the primary composite outcome (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) was not different between groups, occurring in 2.2% with fenofibrate versus 2.4% with placebo (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.79–1.08, p = 0.32), with underpowered prespecified subgroup analyses showing possible harm in women and some decrease in cardiovascular events for men with high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Intentional and unintentional nonadherence — common reasons and effectiveness of adherence strategies are described, stating that it remains important that the clinician and patient have ongoing discussions about statin therapy and the reasons for less than optimal adherence if present; reasons for high discontinuation and missed doses include cost of medication, patient cannot afford the co-pay, unclear label instructions, patient forgetfulness, adverse effects from medication that patient is too embarrassed to discuss with doctor, patient does not like the idea of having to take medication, patient does not understand the importance of a given medication for a condition for which he or she has no symptoms, patient-practitioner relationship is suboptimal, and polypharmacy and complexity of regimen. Unintentional nonadherence is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. One of the most important aspects of long-term medication adherence is to review the medication list, ask about adverse effects, cost, and adherence, and discuss barriers to adherence at every office visit. Current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, and even with the most effective methods the magnitude of effect was quite small; strategies noted include the quality of the patient–care provider relationship, shared decision making, and avoidance of overly complex and expensive regimens, and much more research is needed to develop approaches that reduce stopping medications shown to benefit overall health.

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1148bky7]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

An elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including ischemic stroke. For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, an elevated LDL-C level is associated with an increased risk of subsequent major cardiovascular events. More intensive compared with less intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies are associated with reduced major cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, the results of LDL lowering with statins in secondary stroke prevention trials are inconsistent. An initial meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials showed that intensive LDL-C reduction with statins was associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke. A subsequent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials showed that statins were associated with a reduction in the risk of ischemic strokes and cardiovascular events, but the reduction of recurrent stroke did not reach statistical significance. In addition to their LDL-C–lowering effects, statins may exhibit cardiovascular protection via their pleiotropic effects. The antithrombotic effect of statins may provide additional reduction in ischemic events but may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with ischemic stroke.

Statins plus cholesterol absorption inhibitors (eg, ezetimibe) or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab) compared with statins alone were associated with reduced major cardiovascular events and strokes for patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in clinical trials. However, whether those medications (ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors) are beneficial as add-on therapy to statins for patients with prior stroke has not been definitively established, to our knowledge.

To properly elucidate the association of LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies with secondary stroke prevention, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the benefits and risks associated with more intensive vs less intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies for patients with ischemic stroke.

METHODS

Data Availability

Extracted data are available upon request to the corresponding author.

This systematic review followed a prespecified, published protocol and adhered to PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta‐analysis protocols) guidelines. Prospero registration: CRD42021253909.

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

The 2019 meta‐analysis of the CTTC (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration) served as our baseline study. We retrieved all eligible studies mentioned on the homepage until May 2021. To update the search, we searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central for large (≥ 1000 participants) lipid‐lowering RCTs published in English between January 1, 2015 and May 25, 2021 (Data S1). All trials with cardiovascular outcomes and a minimum 2‐year follow‐up were considered. We limited the search to the last 6 years (January 2015–May 25, 2021), because the CTTC updated their last meta‐analysison large statin trials until this date, with the latest included trial published in 2016. For nonstatin trials, the first published trial on cardiovascular outcomes was published in 2015. For ezetimibe, the landmark trial on cardiovascular outcomes is IMPROVE‐IT (The Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytroin Efficacy International Trial), published in 2015.

We defined lipid‐lowering trials as trials with drugs that are known to reduce cardiovascular risk (statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors). We restricted our review to randomized controlled trials with participants ≥ 18 years of age who received lipid‐lowering drugs for primary or secondary prevention of CVD, with CVD and/or mortality as primary outcomes. We included all RCTs that compared a statin, ezetimibe, a proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitor or a combination of these drugs with one of the following: placebo, usual care, no treatment, another lipid‐lowering medication, or different dose. We excluded trials that did not report a cardiovascular primary outcome, trials that included duplicate data (eg, substudies of an already included original article), secondary analysis of subgroups of trials, post‐trial follow‐up studies, and ongoing trials. The supplemental index contains a full list of search terms and our search strategy (Data S1).

Current Guideline Recommendations

Both the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline on the management of blood cholesterol and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias recommend obtaining a lipid profile after 4 weeks of admission for ACS. 20, 21 As LDL‐C levels vary minimally after normal food intake, a nonfasting sample can be used. 22 An overview of current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline recommendations for lipid‐lowering therapy applied to patients with ACS is shown in Figure 2. In brief, 3 agents with well‐documented safety and efficacy can be prescribed (statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe); the appropriate timing of initiation and/or escalation of these agents depends on (1) whether patients are already on maximally tolerated doses of statin and/or ezetimibe and (2) the LDL‐C level at the time of ACS. The foundation of LDL‐C–lowering therapy is the prompt initiation of high‐intensity statin, followed by the addition of either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to hopefully blunt the short‐term recurrent ischemic complication rate. Guidelines advocate adding ezetimibe first as this is a more cost‐effective strategy, but also allow for initiation of PSCK9 inhibitors without ezetimibe, as outlined in Figure 2. The rationale for considering initiation of a PSCK9 inhibitor without first starting ezetimibe is that only 3% and 5% of patients were on ezetimibe in the large phase 3 randomized FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trials, respectively, which demonstrated the clinical benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 23, 24 Moreover, the expected additional reduction in LDL‐C with PCSK9 inhibitors when added to statins is ≈60%, 23 whereas ezetimibe is only 24%. 25 The number needed to treat to prevent an ischemic end point in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial with alirocumab was ≈63 in just under 3 years of medical follow‐up and was 50 over 7 years with ezetimibe. 24

### Use of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in 41 low-income and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional study of nationally representative, individual-level data [^114ZZ9bH]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In a geographically and economically diverse sample of nationally representative surveys from 41 low-income and middle-income countries, we found that statins were used by approximately one in ten eligible people for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and one in five eligible people for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The WHO target that at least 50% of eligible individuals receive statin therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease was achieved by no region or income group and by just a single country (and only for secondary prevention) in this set of LMICs. At the country level, statin use was lower in countries with lower health spending. At the individual level, there was generally lower statin use among men (primary prevention only) and individuals who were younger, less educated, or lived in rural areas. These estimates provide the first nationally representative and most geographically expansive evidence about the patterns of statin use in many LMICs. Our findings can serve to evaluate progress towards global non-communicable disease targets and to guide health systems' responses to the large and rising cardiovascular disease burden in LMICs.

Statins are widely recommended in clinical practice guidelines and were added to the WHO Essential Medicine List in 2007. Nevertheless, we find that statin use for cardiovascular disease has remained very low. By contrast, in surveys done in the USA and other high-income countries, statin use is 60–70% for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, and approximately 50% for primary cardiovascular disease prevention in people with diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of at least 20%. – Statin use is much higher in the upper-middle-income countries than in the lower-middle-income or low-income countries included in our study. Previous work using pooled surveys from LMICs has demonstrated that about three quarters of people with diagnosed hypertension take antihypertensive medications, and 85% of people with diagnosed diabetes take glucose-lowering medications. Given the disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease in LMICs and the strong clinical evidence supporting statin therapy, our findings emphasise the urgent need to scale up statin use relative to other medicines to prevent and control non-communicable diseases.

### 2017 focused update of the 2016 ACC Expert consensus decision pathway on the role of non-statin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on expert consensus decision pathways [^115Da8wV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology published the first expert consensus decision pathway (ECDP) on the role of non-statin therapies for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Since the publication of that document, additional evidence and perspectives have emerged from randomized clinical trials and other sources, particularly considering the longer-term efficacy and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in secondary prevention of ASCVD. Most notably, the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial and SPIRE-1 and -2 (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events), assessing evolocumab and bococizumab, respectively, have published final results of cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with clinical ASCVD and in a smaller number of high-risk primary prevention patients. In addition, further evidence on the types of patients most likely to benefit from the use of ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome has been published. Based on results from these important analyses, the ECDP writing committee judged that it would be desirable to provide a focused update to help guide clinicians more clearly on decision making regarding the use of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities. In the following summary table, changes from the 2016 ECDP to the 2017 ECDP Focused Update are highlighted, and a brief rationale is provided. The content of the full document has been changed accordingly, with more extensive and detailed guidance regarding decision making provided both in the text and in the updated algorithms. Revised recommendations are provided for patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities on statin therapy for secondary prevention. The ECDP writing committee judged that these new data did not warrant changes to the decision pathways and algorithms regarding the use of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in primary prevention patients with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL with or without diabetes mellitus or patients without ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL not due to secondary causes. Based on feedback and further deliberation, the ECDP writing committee down-graded recommendations regarding bile acid sequestrant use, recommending bile acid sequestrants only as optional secondary agents for consideration in patients intolerant to ezetimibe. For clarification, the writing committee has also included new information on diagnostic categories of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, based on clinical criteria with and without genetic testing. Other changes to the original document were kept to a minimum to provide consistent guidance to clinicians, unless there was a compelling reason or new evidence, in which case justification is provided.

### Analysis of prescriptions for dual antiplatelet therapy after acute ischemic stroke… [^113EHTLT]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

After the publication of the CHANCE and POINT clinical trials, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association issued a new class 1, level of evidence A, recommendation for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in patients with minor ischemic stroke. Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended for routine secondary prevention after ischemic stroke. Although DAPT technically refers to a combination of any 2 antiplatelet agents, for the purposes of the current study, DAPT denoted the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel.

Ticlopidine is rarely used in current clinical practice owing to a higher risk of severe adverse effects, and prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with stroke. Antiplatelet therapy plays an important role in secondary prevention among patients with acute ischemic stroke. The most commonly used antiplatelet agents are aspirin, clopidogrel, and DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel. In 2004, the MATCH clinical trial12 examined the use of DAPT vs clopidogrel monotherapy in patients with recent stroke and found no significant benefit to treatment with DAPT and an increased risk of major bleeding complications.

Despite a pattern of lower event rates with the use of DAPT, neither the CLAIR clinical trial21 nor an underpowered subgroup analysis of the CHANCE clinical trial31 found a statistically significant difference between the use of DAPT vs aspirin alone in terms of preventing subsequent stroke. Notably, hospitals that were more likely to prescribe DAPT for secondary prevention in those with minor stroke were also more likely to prescribe DAPT for secondary prevention in those with nonminor stroke. Although specific recommendations for the use of DAPT exist, it appears that they were not closely followed in clinical practice, and physicians may use a one-size-fits-all approach to prescribing antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in diabetes — secondary prevention lipid management specifies targets and add-on options: High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all people with diabetes and ASCVD to obtain an LDL cholesterol reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL cholesterol goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L). The addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended if this goal is not achieved on maximum tolerated statin therapy. Figure 10.4 directs: Use lifestyle and high-intensity statin therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline to a goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L); add ezetimibe or a PCSK9-directed therapy with demonstrated benefit if LDL cholesterol goals are not met on maximally tolerated statin therapy; and use an alternative lipid-lowering treatment for those who are statin intolerant, including PCSK9 inhibitor with monoclonal antibody treatment, bempedoic acid, or PCSK9 inhibitor with siRNA inclisiran.

In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia [^111WBLSe]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes can be used for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins have the most convincing data for primary prevention, especially for higher risk patients. Therefore, risk stratification is essential. Statin therapy is also recommended for secondary prevention in all patients with known cardiovascular disease or the risk equivalent. High-dose statins should be initiated in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Omega-3 fatty acids may be a good alternative after myocardial infarction for patients who cannot tolerate statins. Fibrates and niacin have not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in secondary prevention, but may be useful adjuncts when statins alone cannot adequately control lipid levels. Other cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have not been shown to consistently improve patient-oriented outcomes. There is good evidence for using statins in the secondary prevention of stroke and peripheral arterial disease.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management were a major shift in the delineation of the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy and emphasized the use of higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

### Atherothrombotic risk stratification and ezetimibe for secondary prevention [^112am9ec]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ezetimibe improves cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) when added to statin therapy. After ACS, patients vary considerably in their risk for recurrent CV events.

Objectives

This study tested the hypothesis that atherothrombotic risk stratification may be useful to identify post-ACS patients who have the greatest potential for benefit from the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy.

Methods

The TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2°P) is a simple 9-point risk stratification tool, previously developed in a large population with atherothrombosis to predict CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic stroke (CV death/MI/ischemic cerebrovascular accident [iCVA]). The current study applied this tool prospectively to 17,717 post-ACS patients randomized either to ezetimibe and simvastatin or to placebo and simvastatin in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial). Treatment efficacy was assessed by baseline risk for CV death/MI/iCVA, the IMPROVE-IT composite endpoints (CE), and individual component endpoints at 7 years.

Results

All 9 clinical variables in the TRS 2°P were independent risk indicators for CV death/MI/iCVA (p < 0.001). The integer-based scheme showed a strong graded relationship with the rate of CV death/MI/iCVA, the trial CE, and the individual components (p trend < 0.0001 for each). High-risk patients (n = 4,393; 25%), defined by ≥ 3 risk indicators, had a 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 2.9% to 9.7%) absolute risk reduction in CV death/MI/iCVA at 7 years with ezetimibe/simvastatin, thus translating to a number-needed-to-treat of 16. Intermediate-risk patients (2 risk indicators; n = 5,292; 30%) had a 2.2% (95% confidence interval: -0.3% to 4.6%) absolute risk reduction. Low-risk patients (0 to 1 risk indicators; n = 8,032; 45%) did not appear to derive benefit from the addition of ezetimibe (p interaction = 0.010). Similar findings were observed for the IMPROVE-IT primary CE.

Conclusions

Atherothrombotic risk stratification using the TRS 2°P identifies high-risk patients who derive greatest benefit from the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy for secondary prevention after ACS. (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial [IMPROVE-IT]; NCT00202878).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Other medications, supplements, and nutraceuticals — primary and secondary prevention: we recommend against using niacin (i.e., supplements or prescriptions) and we suggest against adding fibrates to statins (both categorized Reviewed, New-replaced). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against using bempedoic acid with or without statins for either primary or secondary prevention. For isocapent ethyl, for primary prevention there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against use in patients on statin therapy with persistently elevated fasting triglycerides, whereas for secondary prevention we suggest offering isocapent ethyl in patients on statin therapy with persistently elevated fasting triglycerides > 150 mg/dL to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We suggest against the use of omega-3 fatty acids as a dietary supplement to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of fiber, garlic, ginger, green tea, and red yeast rice supplements to reduce cardiovascular risks.

### Statin therapy in the treatment of Alzheimer disease: what is the rationale? [^116U4Vc8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is manifested by cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and diffuse structural abnormalities in the brain. Its prevalence is predicted to rise 4-fold in the next 50 years. AD is characterized pathologically by deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Neuronal death and specific neurotransmitter deficits also are part of the pathologic picture. Strategies to delay symptom progression have focused on addressing the neurotransmitter deficits. Strategies to delay the onset or biologic progression of AD largely have targeted the plaques formed by the deposition of beta-amyloid. AD and cardiovascular disease share common risk factors, notably hypercholesterolemia, and occur together more often than expected by chance. Therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) is the first-line treatment option for hypercholesterolemia, and observational studies have suggested that the risk of AD is reduced in patients who receive statin therapy in midlife. This reduction in risk of AD observed with statin therapy may be due to statins reducing beta-amyloid formation and deposition or to their known anti-inflammatory effects. Two randomized double-blind statin trials in patients with AD to assess the potential for statins to slow disease progression are currently under way. If successful, statin AD primary prevention trials may be developed.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task Force on Clinical practice guidelines [^115c4Mvu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided statin decisions — in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk) adults or selected borderline-risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults in whom a CAC score is measured for the purpose of making a treatment decision, if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years so long as higher-risk conditions are absent; if the CAC score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the CAC score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Additionally, in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.
