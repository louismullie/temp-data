## Question

list of meds for urinary frequency urgency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a list of medications for urinary frequency and urgency consistent with overactive bladder, including treatment hierarchy, combinations, and key safety and monitoring considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the syndrome definition and scope. Then, I should verify the first-line pharmacologic classes and specific labeled agents. Next, I will check escalation strategies such as switching, dose/formulation adjustments, and combination therapy, followed by third-line options. After that, I need to ensure I cover safety, contraindications, and special populations. Finally, I will integrate nonpharmacologic foundations and produce a concise medications overview with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the condition we are treating. Urinary urgency with frequency and/or nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology, aligns with the internationally accepted definition of overactive bladder, so medications discussed here should be framed within OAB management and after excluding reversible causes.

> Now, I need to verify the recommended first-line pharmacologic classes. Guidelines consistently endorse offering an antimuscarinic or a beta-3 adrenergic agonist as initial pharmacotherapy to improve urgency, frequency, and/or urgency urinary incontinence, and if one agent is ineffective or poorly tolerated, switching to another in the same or different class is advised to optimize efficacy and tolerability [^112qdqSw] [^117TY3iy]. Hold on, I initially cited 47ed52o for this recommendation, but that was a typo; I should correct it to 47ed52e0 to accurately reflect the AUA/SUFU 2024 guideline identifier [^112qdqSw].

> Next, I will examine specific antimuscarinic options and labeling. Tolterodine and solifenacin are FDA-approved for OAB symptoms of urgency, urge urinary incontinence, and frequency, supported by randomized trials demonstrating reductions in micturitions and incontinence episodes with acceptable tolerability profiles, although anticholinergic adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation are common [^114PSYbQ] [^111qcbTf] [^114Hwjsr] [^114UPEno]. Let me also consider the broader antimuscarinic class evidence showing efficacy over placebo with characteristic side effects and discontinuation patterns, which supports inclusion of other agents such as oxybutynin, darifenacin, trospium, fesoterodine, and propiverine when guided by individual patient factors and availability [^113oFDdE] [^116EHawP] [^116Q7ApC] [^113cuMP6].

> I should now review the beta-3 agonist alternative. Mirabegron is guideline-endorsed as a first-line alternative to antimuscarinics, with EAU guidance specifically supporting its use in women when nocturia is prominent, and comparative evidence suggests similar efficacy to some antimuscarinics with lower rates of dry mouth, although clinicians should monitor blood pressure because hypertension risk has been described [^115mRFEv] [^111n8xkt] [^116heSEX] [^115VfpUx]. Wait, let me verify that the monitoring piece is also reflected in follow-up guidance; early review for efficacy and adverse effects after initiating anticholinergic or beta-3 therapy is explicitly recommended, aligning with practical BP monitoring during mirabegron use [^113zcERc] [^112U9XTG].

> Let me consider dose, formulation, and switching strategies before declaring nonresponse. Extended-release formulations of antimuscarinics should be preferred when possible to improve tolerability, and if benefit is inadequate, guidelines recommend dose escalation when appropriate, switching within the antimuscarinic class, or moving to a beta-3 agonist alone or in combination based on patient-specific factors and shared decision-making [^115Bgfyv] [^117AHSHa] [^111hBCo2]. I should double-check that AUA also supports switching within or across classes for tolerability and effectiveness, which it does, reinforcing a pragmatic, iterative approach to first-line pharmacotherapy [^117TY3iy].

> Next, I should review when combination therapy is appropriate. For patients with inadequate response to monotherapy, AUA/SUFU recommends combination therapy using agents from different classes, and evidence for solifenacin plus mirabegron shows statistically greater symptom reductions than monotherapy but with increased constipation and dry mouth, emphasizing patient preference and harm–benefit trade-offs in shared decisions [^113gt1ZW] [^116heSEX] [^115Sri8N]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about large clinical gains; pooled analyses suggest improvements are modest, so expectations should be tempered and aligned to patient goals and tolerability thresholds [^115Sri8N].

> I will now examine special considerations in men with concomitant bladder outlet symptoms. In men meeting criteria for both OAB and BPH/LUTS, combining an antimuscarinic (for storage symptoms) with an alpha-blocker such as tamsulosin can yield greater perceived benefit than either alone, with tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin supported by randomized controlled data and additional evidence supporting multimodal approaches that include behavioral strategies [^111UysJw] [^113ihofo]. I need to ensure careful selection and monitoring in men with significant obstruction risks, assessing postvoid residuals and tailoring therapy accordingly [^111UysJw].

> But wait, what if oral agents fail or are not tolerated. For refractory OAB, onabotulinumtoxinA 100 units administered as twenty 5-unit detrusor injections improves incontinence episodes, micturition frequency, and voided volumes versus placebo in high-quality trials and is an appropriate minimally invasive next step, after which successful responders can discontinue oral agents but should restart if efficacy wanes over time [^115f7NH6] [^1133KYDf]. Let me verify real-world support and broader context; observational data and reviews reinforce onabotulinumtoxinA's role in refractory cases, though guideline-based patient selection and counseling about retention risk and intermittent catheterization are essential [^115VfpUx] [^116La7xp].

> I need to check safety and cognitive considerations, especially in older adults. AUA/SUFU recommends discussing potential dementia and cognitive impairment risks with antimuscarinic therapy and exercising particular caution with long-term anticholinergics in elderly patients at risk for or with pre-existing cognitive dysfunction, favoring beta-3 agonists when feasible in this population [^114uj6Cg] [^114HNEYG] [^116sgcXs]. I should confirm key contraindications before prescribing antimuscarinics, including narrow-angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, and a history of urinary retention, and reiterate common anticholinergic adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation that often drive discontinuation [^114PSYbQ] [^116EHawP].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Guidelines advise early follow-up after initiating antimuscarinic or beta-3 therapy to evaluate efficacy and adverse effects, and ongoing assessments thereafter; clinicians should counsel patients on side effects of all oral options and use shared decision-making to align therapy with patient preferences and risk profiles [^113zcERc] [^112U9XTG] [^114NckBe] [^111hBCo2]. Hmm, wait a minute, the substantial placebo effect seen in OAB trials also means setting realistic expectations and reinforcing behavioral strategies can meaningfully augment outcomes even when pharmacologic gains are modest [^114iBZSJ].

> I should not overlook foundational nonpharmacologic care that should continue alongside medications. Bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training with confirmed contraction quality, and broader behavioral interventions including diet and fluid modification and urge suppression are guideline-recommended and should be integrated with pharmacotherapy and education about additive benefits from pelvic health rehabilitation [^113SiSEo] [^112JwcT6] [^1155KnAV] [^1179btng]. Hold on, I also need to address comorbidities and medication contributors, manage constipation, and review new or existing drugs that may worsen OAB symptoms as part of comprehensive care, since optimizing these factors can improve bladder symptoms and reduce fall risk in susceptible patients [^113oWZPX] [^115nWFe6] [^111X77xJ] [^115rkpBC].

> Let me now synthesize the medication landscape clearly. First-line oral options are antimuscarinics and the beta-3 agonist mirabegron; representative antimuscarinics include tolterodine and solifenacin with FDA labeling, and class evidence supports oxybutynin, darifenacin, trospium, fesoterodine, and propiverine where appropriate and available, with a preference for extended-release formulations to enhance tolerability and an early plan to switch within or across classes if needed [^112qdqSw] [^114PSYbQ] [^114Hwjsr] [^116Q7ApC] [^113cuMP6] [^115Bgfyv] [^117TY3iy]. For inadequate response, combination therapy across classes can be considered, recognizing modest incremental benefit and higher rates of constipation and dry mouth with solifenacin plus mirabegron, and in refractory cases, onabotulinumtoxinA 100 units delivered intradetrusor is an effective minimally invasive option after appropriate counseling and planning for monitoring and follow-up [^116heSEX] [^115Sri8N] [^115f7NH6].

---

For urinary frequency and urgency, the main medication classes are **antimuscarinics** and **beta-3 agonists** [^112qdqSw], with onabotulinumtoxinA reserved for refractory cases [^113RMZBc]. Antimuscarinics [^112qdqSw] (oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, trospium) reduce urgency and frequency but can cause dry mouth, constipation [^114Hwjsr] [^114PSYbQ], and **cognitive effects**, especially in older adults [^114uj6Cg]. Beta-3 agonists [^112qdqSw] (mirabegron, vibegron) are effective and have fewer cognitive effects but can **raise blood pressure** [^115VfpUx]. OnabotulinumtoxinA is used when oral therapy fails [^113RMZBc]; **urinary retention** is a key risk [^115f7NH6]. Treatment should be individualized [^111hBCo2] based on age, comorbidities, and side-effect profile [^114NckBe]; consider combination therapy [^113gt1ZW] [^116heSEX] or switching classes [^117TY3iy] if monotherapy is inadequate.

| **Medication class** | **Medications** | **Mechanism of action** | **Common side effects** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Antimuscarinics | - Oxybutynin <br/> - Tolterodine <br/> - Solifenacin <br/> - Darifenacin <br/> - Fesoterodine <br/> - Trospium | Block muscarinic receptors to reduce detrusor contractions | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Cognitive impairment | - Use caution in elderly [^114uj6Cg] <br/> - Avoid in narrow-angle glaucoma [^1115Uu3s] <br/> - Consider ER formulations for tolerability [^114Hwjsr] [^114PSYbQ] [^115Bgfyv] |
| Beta-3 agonists | Mirabegron and Vibegron | Stimulate β3 receptors to relax detrusor muscle | - Hypertension <br/> - Headache <br/> - Nasopharyngitis | Preferred in elderly or those at cognitive risk [^112qdqSw] [^111n8xkt] [^114HNEYG]; monitor BP [^115VfpUx] |
| OnabotulinumtoxinA | Botox | Inhibits acetylcholine release, reducing detrusor activity | Urinary retention and UTIs [^115f7NH6] | For refractory cases [^113RMZBc]; monitor post-void residual [^115f7NH6] |

---

The **key points** are that antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists are **first-line pharmacotherapy** [^112qdqSw], while onabotulinumtoxinA is for refractory cases [^113RMZBc]. Individualize **therapy** [^111hBCo2] based on patient factors and side-effect profiles, and consider combination therapy [^113gt1ZW] or class switching [^117TY3iy] if needed.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA is a well tolerated and effective treatment for refractory overactive bladder in real-world practice [^115VfpUx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterized by the International Continence Society as "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology". An estimated 546 million people worldwide are affected by symptoms consistent with OAB; approximately 423 million have urinary incontinence (UI).

UI as a result of OAB can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). Due to social embarrassment, many patients suffer from low self-esteem, resulting in avoidance and limited social behavior. Many aspects of daily life can be impacted by UI, including physical activity, travel, relationships, sexual activity, and quality of sleep. It is also associated with further medical problems such as falls and dermatitis. There is a substantial direct cost to the patient with UI, primarily from the use of absorbent products, as well as indirect sequelae costs.

First-line pharmacological treatments for OAB with UI include anticholinergic medications and beta-3 agonists. Anticholinergic medications are not always effective over time and can be associated with side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and an increased risk of dementia. Beta-3 agonists have been associated with side effects such as constipation, dry mouth, headaches, and an increased risk of hypertension.

OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 U is approved in many countries for the treatment of OAB with symptoms of urge UI, urgency, and frequency in adults.

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, 24-week clinical studies were conducted in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), presenting symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. These are referred to as Studies OAB-1 and OAB-2. Patients needed to exhibit at least three episodes of urinary urgency incontinence and a minimum of 24 micturitions over three days to qualify for participation.

A total of 1,105 patients, whose symptoms were inadequately managed with anticholinergic therapy (due to either inadequate response or intolerable side effects), were randomized to receive either 100 units of Botox (n = 557) or a placebo (n = 548). Each patient received 20 injections of the study drug (5 units of Botox or placebo) spaced approximately 1 cm apart into the detrusor muscle.

In both studies, significant improvements in the primary efficacy variable — change from baseline in the daily frequency of urinary incontinence episodes — were observed for Botox 100 units at the primary endpoint of week 12 compared to placebo. Significant improvements compared to placebo were also noted in secondary efficacy variables, including the daily frequency of micturition episodes and the volume voided per micturition. These primary and secondary variables are illustrated in tables and figures not provided in the text.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^114pesUo]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

While urodynamic studies were performed in a subset of patients (n = 178, 62.5%) to further characterize bladder function, detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing was not required for OAB diagnosis, consistent with international guidelines. Patients were categorized according to the likely underlying etiology of their OAB symptoms: idiopathic OAB (without identifiable cause), neurogenic OAB (associated with specific neurological conditions including diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury), or OAB secondary to bladder outlet obstruction.

Exclusion criteria included:

1. Incomplete medical records
2. Loss to follow-up before three months
3. Active urinary tract infection or stone disease
4. Significant pelvic organ prolapse (≥ stage 2)
5. Patients with predominant stress urinary incontinence without OAB symptoms
6. Urological surgical intervention within six months prior to treatment initiation

The data collection process encompassed demographic characteristics, underlying neurological conditions, baseline ultrasonographic bladder parameters, medication regimens, and early treatment response indicators.

Treatment failure was defined as meeting any of the following criteria within three months of treatment initiation: persistent symptoms with Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) symptom bother score > 40 (representing continued moderate-to-severe symptom burden despite treatment); deterioration in ultrasonographic bladder wall thickness (> 20% increase from baseline when measured under standardized conditions with bladder volume).

### The effects of antimuscarinic treatments in overactive bladder: an update of a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EHawP]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Antimuscarinic agents are currently the first-line pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. A systematic review published in 2005 was updated to include data on a newly licensed antimuscarinic, fesoterodine. The primary aim of this study was to systematically review evidence from randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of licensed antimuscarinic treatments for overactive bladder. Secondary aims were to review evidence on tolerability, safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

- **Evidence acquisition**: All relevant data sources from randomized controlled trials were searched. Two independent reviewers considered publications for inclusion and extracted relevant data. Meta-analysis was used to pool efficacy, tolerability, safety, and HRQL outcomes by treatment. Efficacy was measured by continent days, mean voided volume, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency. Tolerability and safety were measured by means of adverse event and withdrawal rates. HRQL was assessed using various instruments.

- **Evidence synthesis**: An additional 1,118 references were retrieved, with data on 83 studies extracted. Antimuscarinics were found to be more effective than placebo. Tolerability was good, with few antimuscarinics showing significantly higher withdrawal rates compared to placebo. No serious adverse event for any product was statistically significant compared to placebo. Dry mouth, occurring as mild, moderate, or severe, was the most commonly reported adverse event (29.6% on treatment vs. 7.9% on placebo), followed by pruritus (15.4% on treatment vs 7.9% on placebo).

### Pathophysiology: The varieties of bladder overactivity [^11464JhN]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common term currently used in clinical medicine to describe a complex of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with or without incontinence. The symptoms usually include urgency, frequency, nocturia, troublesome or incomplete emptying, and, occasionally, pain. Causes of bladder overactivity include neurologic illness or injury, bladder outlet obstruction, urethral weakness, detrusor hyperactivity and impaired contractility in elderly patients, emergence of new voiding reflexes, and so-called idiopathic bladder overactivity.

Most clinicians agree that effective treatment for OAB symptoms should be guided by a basic assessment of patients for these contributing factors. However, it is not at all certain that outcomes are significantly improved by diagnostic precision. This is in part because of the ubiquity of LUTS in the setting of the various common lower urinary tract disorders: stress incontinence, outlet obstruction, and neurologic illness or injury. The ubiquity of LUTS would imply that they are caused by common mechanisms and, theoretically at least, would be amenable to a single form of effective therapy. Conversely, the limited kinds and number of LUTS and the limited representation of lower urinary tract structures in the central nervous system may mean that several different causes produce similar symptoms, but these are not amenable to a single form of effective therapy.

Future research directions should keep each possible explanation in mind as new knowledge about lower urinary tract function and possible intervention continues.

### Undertreatment of overactive bladder among men with lower urinary tract symptoms in the United States: A retrospective observational study [^1163tzvx]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

The age-standardized prevalence estimate reported here (12.2%) falls within the range of other published estimates, which have varied from 3.5% to 19.0%. The variation in estimates may be attributed to several factors. Within studies conducted using administrative and claims data sets, variability in the specific definition of LUTS, study population, and inclusion criteria may result in different epidemiological estimates. Additionally, prevalence estimates of OAB and LUTS generated from database studies (which describe populations of patients exhibiting treatment-seeking behavior) have been historically lower than those from cross-sectional studies where LUTS are self-reported. There is evidence that a significant proportion of males with LUTS symptoms do not seek medical help; these individuals would be included in studies where the condition is defined based on self-reported symptoms, but not in studies relying on administrative data. Overall, the prevalence estimated here can be regarded as a more accurate representation of the prevalence of LUTS among commercially insured, treatment-seeking males in the United States.

An important limitation of the present study is that treatment persistence and adherence were not investigated, which restricted the ability to assess treatment switching. In this study, a substantially higher proportion of patients who received OAB therapy as their primary therapy subsequently switched to BPH therapy compared with patients who initially received BPH therapy and subsequently switched to OAB therapy. This is consistent with the observations…

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^116La7xp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

However, dose adjustment, the combination of two different antimuscarinic drugs, and replacement by another antimuscarinic or a beta-3 agonist are options to improve treatment success in individual patients with overactive bladder (OAB). The selection of the best-tolerated drug is of great importance to avoid unnecessary side effects. This is especially true for older patients where co-medication can have its own anticholinergic effects and/or compete in metabolism in the cytochrome P450 system. Impairment of cognitive function as a side effect and metabolic interactions can largely be avoided by choosing an appropriate antimuscarinic, such as the quaternary molecule trospium chloride, which does not seem to contribute to such effects and enables flexible dosing.

In patients for whom a critical reassessment of diagnosis leads to the exclusion of underlying causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction and who do not respond to intensive first-line therapy, including adjusted antimuscarinic treatment, the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, the intravesical administration of onabotulinumtoxinA injections, or augmentation cystoplasty may be further treatment options.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the overactive bladder [^116NR2YX]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a symptomatic diagnosis based on the presence of urgency, with or without urge incontinence, and usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, in the absence of obvious pathologic or metabolic disease. Initial management of OAB requires an integrated approach using behavioral and pharmacologic methods. Patients should be educated about the functioning of the lower urinary tract system, fluid and dietary management, timed or prophylactic voiding and bladder training regimens, the keeping of micturition charts or bladder diaries, and pelvic floor exercises.

Although the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists for the treatment of OAB has been shown, adverse effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision have somewhat limited their usefulness. Newer agents that are more bladder-selective have been and continue to be developed. The concept of clinical effectiveness — a combination of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance — can be used to evaluate not only how well a drug works, but also its side-effect profile, bothersomeness, and how likely patients are to continue treatment.

Patients who do not respond to antimuscarinic treatment of OAB may do so because of a variety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic reasons. Most cases of OAB are not cured, but rather the symptoms are reduced, with an associated improvement in the patients' quality of life. Patients who have failed behavioral and pharmacologic intervention may respond to neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Future approaches may include other types.

### Vesicare [^114UPEno]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Vesicare was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for ≥ 3 months duration. These studies involved 3,027 patients (1,811 on Vesicare and 1,216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies.

- **Dosage and study design**: Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Vesicare doses (Studies 1 and 2), and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years.

- **Primary and secondary endpoints**: The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in the number of micturitions per 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition.

The efficacy of Vesicare was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Vesicare 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and Vesicare 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4).

### Detrol [^111qcbTf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Detrol tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received Detrol 2 mg twice daily, and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency, and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well-balanced across treatment groups for the studies.

- **Efficacy endpoints for study 007**: The endpoints included the change from baseline for the number of incontinence episodes per week, the number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days), and the volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days) (see Table 3).

- **Efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010**: These studies had identical endpoints to study 007, with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was measured per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days) (see Table 4).

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115Sri8N]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Cumulative evidence showed small differences across all comparisons of pharmacotherapies used to treat overactive bladder (OAB), including combination therapy (solifenacin/mirabegron) versus monotherapy (< 0.8 episode per day). While some of these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance is unclear, and all treatment groups reported more than one incontinence episode and 2.5 urgency episodes per day at the study's end. For patients with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) at baseline, less than 65% reported no incontinence over three days at the end of treatment. Anticholinergic adverse effects remain a concern even with mirabegron. Considering that persistence with antimuscarinic drugs is already known to be low, it is unclear whether the added benefit of combining mirabegron with solifenacin outweighs the increased harm. A patient's preference for increased efficacy versus reduced harms and tolerance of specific adverse events should be considered when selecting treatment for OAB.

### Definition and epidemiology of overactive bladder [^115sH5HW]. Urology (2002). High credibility.

Overactive bladder is characterized by a sudden urge to urinate that is difficult to control. It can be associated with various conditions and factors, including urinary incontinence, bladder stones, constipation, urinary tract infections (UTIs), excessive consumption of caffeine, urinary frequency, certain medications, nocturia, and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying. It is also linked to medical conditions such as stroke, menopause, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, multiple sclerosis, involuntary bladder contractions, enlarged prostate, declining cognitive function due to aging, and cancer.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116rkbhj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We evaluated the results by examining the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies, exploring relationships in the data, and describing patterns across studies in the direction and magnitude of effects. Poor-quality studies were not synthesized with the rest of the evidence. The applicability of the evidence was described using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting) framework.

When outcomes were not reported as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio but provided sufficient data, we calculated these ratios. Meta-analysis was conducted when a sufficient number of studies investigated the same drug dose and were homogeneous enough to justify combining their results. We evaluated outcomes in terms of change from baseline rather than a comparison of endpoint scores, as was done in the prior review. We imputed variance data where necessary. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled effects using pairwise meta-analyses.

The I² statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity) was calculated to assess heterogeneity across studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined with subgroup analysis by factors such as study design, study quality, variations in interventions, and patient population characteristics. Meta-analyses were conducted using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Where eight or more studies of a given intervention comparison and outcome were available, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

### Patient-reported outcomes in overactive bladder: Importance for determining clinical effectiveness of treatment [^113KbtFS]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition defined by its symptoms — urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence, often accompanied by frequency and nocturia. Determining the efficacy of OAB treatments through objective measures, such as urodynamic testing, can be challenging. A more effective means of gauging treatment efficacy for symptom-based conditions is through the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). With PROs, clinicians can gain insight into how a treatment affects a patient's symptoms and whether improvement in symptoms has a positive effect from the patient's perspective. PROs are increasingly being included as endpoints in clinical trials, including those of antimuscarinic drugs for OAB. Consequently, clinicians should become familiar with the most commonly used instruments. We provide an overview of instruments used to assess symptoms, health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction in patients with OAB and discuss how PROs can be incorporated into clinical trial protocols.

### What is the best first choice oral drug therapy for OAB [^115AacvC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

The management of overactive bladder (OAB) involves lifestyle changes and conservative measures initially, with the use of liquid/dietary advice, weight loss, and bladder training. Thereafter, oral pharmacotherapy is instigated in symptomatic patients. Antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists form the main classes of drug therapy in this field. Views on the best first-line OAB treatment are changing based on recent evidence and adverse event profiles of these medications.

At the ICI-RS meeting 2023 in Bristol, UK, this topic was discussed and debated. The following article summarizes the concepts presented that day, as well as the interactive discussion that took place thereafter. OAB guidelines are moving towards either an antimuscarinic or beta-3 agonist approach based on patient factors. Several studies have raised concerns about the long-term impact of antimuscarinics in relation to cognition, dementia, cardiovascular events, and mortality, all related to antimuscarinic load. Neither antimuscarinics nor beta-3 agonists have good persistence and adherence rates in the medium to long term. Several barriers also exist to prescribing, including guidelines recommending utilizing drugs with the lowest acquisition cost and "step therapy". A newer approach to managing OAB is personalized therapy, considering the many possible etiological factors and phenotypes.

Oral pharmacotherapy in managing OAB is limited by adverse events, adherence, and persistence.

### Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults [^113HxV55]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder is a common, long-term symptom complex, which includes frequency of micturition, urgency with or without associated incontinence, and nocturia. Around 11% of the population have symptoms, with this figure increasing with age. Symptoms can be linked to social anxiety and adaptive behavioral change. The cost of treating overactive bladder is considerable, with treatments varying in effectiveness and being associated with side effects. Acupuncture has been suggested as an alternative treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults, and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialized Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (including In-Process, Epub Ahead of Print, Daily), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (searched 14 May 2022). We also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and bibliographic databases where knowledge of the Chinese language was necessary: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI); Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP); and WANFANG (China Online Journals), as well as the reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and crossover RCTs assessing the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four review authors formed pairs to assess the data collected.

### Prevalence of commonly prescribed medications potentially contributing to urinary symptoms in a cohort of older patients seeking care for incontinence [^116FAJHG]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, urinary incontinence, and voiding difficulties are highly prevalent and bothersome. These symptoms impair quality of life and are associated with falls in the elderly. The etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms may be singular or multifactorial, with potential contributors encompassing lifestyle habits, underlying bladder or pelvic floor dysfunction, associated co-morbidities, and/or functional factors.

Many commonly used medications have been proposed to inadvertently interfere with bladder and/or sphincter function or indirectly impair the ability to toilet. The use of oral estrogens, alpha-blocking agents, sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and calcium channel blockers has all been implicated to some degree in the onset or exacerbation of urinary symptoms.

- **Medication effects on urinary symptoms**: Stress urinary incontinence has been associated with the use of alpha-blocking agents, which reduce urethral sphincter tone, and with the consumption of ACE inhibitors in patients who experience treatment-related cough. Loop diuretics promote polyuria and can lead to urinary urgency and frequency, while NSAIDs and other medications known to cause edema may exacerbate nocturia due to nocturnal fluid redistribution.

Centrally active medication potentially exerts direct effects on the lower urinary tract system by causing relaxation of striated pelvic floor muscles and interfering with afferent sensory messages from the bladder.

### Optimizing nonsurgical treatments of overactive bladder in the United States [^115bnetJ]. Urology (2020). High credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is a prevalent condition impacting quality of life, activities of daily living, work productivity, physical and psychological health, sleep, and sexuality. Published guideline recommendations and effective behavioral, pharmacologic, and neuromodulatory therapies exist; however, adherence can be poor. Clinicians have important roles educating patients, setting treatment expectations, and providing follow-up. Determining patient goals, routinely assessing and adjusting therapy, and combining treatment strategies may improve outcomes. We review the benefits and challenges of overactive bladder treatments and propose approaches to improve patient management, with the goals of initiating therapy earlier and achieving better patient satisfaction, functioning, and quality of life.

### The placebo effect in overactive bladder syndrome [^114iBZSJ]. Nature Reviews Urology (2011). High credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a condition that involves urinary urgency, and affected individuals are usually treated with behavioral therapy and antimuscarinic agents as first-line therapies. Existing evidence from clinical trial data suggests that a positive placebo effect occurs in patients receiving treatment for OAB. In our systematic review of placebo-controlled, randomized trials in OAB, we show statistically significant improvements in three patient-reported outcomes: incontinence episodes per day, micturition episodes per day, and mean micturition volume from baseline after placebo in randomized studies for OAB. The findings could highlight the brain's role in the pathophysiology of OAB or the role of additional bladder training conducted as part of OAB clinical trials. More research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of the placebo effect in OAB.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^113cuMP6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Fesoterodine 8 mg, which is chemically related to tolterodine, showed greater improvement in incontinence, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency than tolterodine 4 mg. However, fesoterodine appeared to have a worse safety profile with significantly higher incidences of withdrawals due to adverse events, SAE, constipation, and dry mouth than tolterodine.

Based on one small trial using the OABSS, no difference was found between fesoterodine 4 mg and solifenacin 5 mg. Patients who received fesoterodine reported a higher incidence of adverse events of interest, but none reached statistical significance, likely due to the small sample size. Solifenacin 5 mg reduced incontinence and urgency episodes by one-half per day more than tolterodine 4 mg, a significant difference. Overall adverse event profiles are similar between solifenacin and tolterodine, except that solifenacin led to a significantly higher incidence of constipation than tolterodine. Both fesoterodine and solifenacin are more effective than tolterodine, but clinicians should consider solifenacin for its better safety profile than fesoterodine.

From the 2012 review, oxybutynin showed comparable improvement in incontinence and micturition frequency to solifenacin 5 mg and tolterodine. The 2012 review did not evaluate patients' assessment of symptoms, though it found no difference between oxybutynin and tolterodine in terms of condition-specific quality of life. Significantly more patients randomized to oxybutynin withdrew because of adverse events than with solifenacin or tolterodine.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115HbHH7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

In this systematic review update, we identified 20 new RCTs from 38 records and 3 new publications for trials identified in the previous systematic review, published since the 31 RCTs included in the 2012 review. For a detailed overview, refer to Fig. 1 for the PRISMA flow diagram and Table S2 for the list of included studies. We also included the full publication and data from an RCT comparing darifenacin vs. solifenacin, which was only published as an abstract at the time of the 2012 review. This study and five others, found in six records, were rated as poor quality due to unclear allocation concealment, blinding, and issues related to missing data, and thus were not discussed in this report.

Five RCTs were rated good quality, and ten were fair quality. Since mirabegron was approved after the 2012 review, all evidence involving mirabegron is new, comprising a total of fourteen RCTs. Two new comparisons have been added: fesoterodine vs. solifenacin and darifenacin vs. trospium. Excluded studies, along with reasons for exclusion, are listed in Table S3. Detailed study characteristics and quality assessments of included studies are available in Tables S4 and S5.

### The causes and consequences of overactive bladder [^115BkUas]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), usually manifesting with frequency and nocturia. OAB affects approximately 17% of women in the United States and Europe. The causes of OAB, as with many bladder disorders, are multifactorial and not completely understood.

The primary functions of the lower urinary tract, which includes the bladder and bladder outlet mechanism, are the storage and evacuation of urine. The bladder and the micturition cycle are under complex neural control involving both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Micturition may occur in response to the activation of receptors in the bladder muscle and the detection of chemical stimuli by receptors within the bladder lining. Neurogenic or myogenic bladder dysfunction can lead to the symptoms of urgency, frequency, and UUI that characterize OAB.

The consequences of this condition are far-reaching and include direct medical consequences and coping strategies that adversely affect quality of life. Although the prevalence of OAB increases with age, it is not a normal consequence of aging. Antimuscarinic agents (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium, solifenacin, and darifenacin) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of OAB symptoms in multiple clinical trials.

This review explores the physiological basis for OAB, the effects of OAB on health-related quality of life, and the pharmacotherapies that may provide relief to patients with this distressing condition.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^114HzmXX]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder management presents significant challenges, with treatment failures and medication non-adherence posing substantial barriers to patient outcomes. Early prediction of these challenges could enable timely interventions and treatment modifications.

- **Objectives**: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence-based prediction model for early identification of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder patients, with specific focus on different pathological subgroups including diabetic neuropathy.

- **Methods**: In this single-center retrospective study (January 2018–April 2025), data from 285 patients with overactive bladder were analyzed. Artificial intelligence models were developed and validated using comprehensive clinical parameters, including ultrasonography findings, uroflowmetry results, standardized voiding diaries, and disease-specific questionnaire outcomes. Primary outcome measures were treatment failure and medication non-adherence at three months.

- **Results**: The gradient boosting model achieved an accuracy of 87.3% (95% CI: 84.1–90.5%) for predicting treatment failure and 85.1% (95% CI: 81.8–88.4%) for predicting medication non-adherence. Key predictive factors included early changes in bladder wall thickness (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.14–6.81), diabetes duration > 7 years (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.58–4.72), and urgency improvement < 25% (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.76–4.92). Treatment failure rates varied significantly among pathological subgroups, with the highest rates in diabetic neuropathy (42.8%) and lowest in idiopathic overactive bladder (28.6%).

### Overactive bladder medication access [^112DmAT9]. Urogynecology (2024). Low credibility.

The price range, insurance coverage, and side effect burden of overactive bladder medications is broad and varied. An internal quality improvement project was undertaken to improve patient ability to access and ultimately adhere to preferred medication therapy for treatment of overactive bladder. Our objective was to increase the percentage of patients per month at an academic urogynecology practice who receive their preferred overactive bladder medication from a baseline of 39.5% to 45%.

Data were extracted via Epic report. Manual chart review and calls to patients and/or pharmacy were completed to obtain the status of medication access and reasons why medications were not taken. A targeted intervention was implemented with the creation of a written document to help guide patients with options to decrease prescription costs. After this document was embedded into Epic after-visit summary documentation, a repeat analysis was performed.

The most common barrier to medication access was cost; specifically, the medication was not covered, and a prior authorization was not initiated. Before the intervention, more than 60% of patients did not persist with their initially prescribed overactive bladder medication at a 6-month follow-up interval from the office visit. Following the implementation of a cost-navigation guide, persistence increased to 45.5% at a 3-month follow-up interval.

A targeted intervention on cost navigation of prescriptions can have a positive effect on patient access and persistence in using overactive bladder medication.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116mVciz]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Table 1 shows characteristics of newly included studies. Considering fair- and good-quality RCTs identified in this update, trial sample sizes of included populations ranged from 60 to 3080. Trial durations ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with a median of 12 weeks. Of the 12 trials that reported funding sources, all but one were funded by industry. The mean age of patients was 57.4 years (SD 13.4) with a mean BMI of 28.4. Similar to RCTs included in the 2012 review, patients were predominantly female (77.7%) and White (89.7%). UUI was the most common form of OAB (58.6%), followed by mixed incontinence (22.2%) and then OAB without incontinence (19.4%). Patients experienced a mean duration of 67.4 months of OAB symptoms, and 59.2% had previous pharmacotherapy for OAB. At baseline, patients reported means of 3 incontinence episodes, 6.1 urgency episodes, and 2.5 UUI episodes per day. As with previously included RCTs, there was a wide range of baseline incontinence episodes per day (ranging from 1.9 to 8.9 episodes per day, median 2.78). Baseline numbers of urgency and UUI episodes were more consistent, with a range of 4.2 to 8.2 urgency episodes and 1.7 to 3.9 UUI episodes per day.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^111q3o1q]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The incidence of refractory OAB seems to be overestimated. An unsatisfactory improvement of symptoms in the first-line treatment option of patients with OAB may depend on various factors. Realistic estimation of treatment outcomes and side effects by the patient and/or the physician, individual patient guidance to improve the patient's motivation to adhere to treatment, review of the OAB diagnosis, and exclusion of other underlying causes as well as individual antimuscarinic dose adjustment are procedures which can improve the success of OAB therapy in daily medical practice. The authors suggest using the term refractory OAB only in such cases when the aforementioned steps have confirmed the patient's nonresponse to first-line treatment including antimuscarinic therapy.

### Developments in the pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder [^112HxCeb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is a common and distressing condition that significantly impacts the quality of life for many people worldwide. Although anticholinergics remain the first line in pharmacotherapy, their use is often hindered by adverse effects and limited efficacy. This highlights the need for more effective treatments. Recently, there has been a trend towards targeting novel pathways implicated in bladder overactivity. This review aims to provide insight into recent developments in the pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder.

Recent advances in our understanding of the basic science of the overactive bladder reveal that bladder function control is more complex than previously believed. Peripherally, a prominent role has emerged for the urothelium and the underlying suburothelium in mechanosensory control. The role of afferent pathways in pathophysiology is increasingly recognized.

Recent research has highlighted several potential targets for treating the overactive bladder, particularly within the mechanosensory pathways. However, with the exception of botulinum toxin, few new therapies have emerged showing clinical benefits. A clearer understanding of bladder pathophysiology may hopefully lead to more effective and better-tolerated treatments.

### Effectiveness of combined behavioral and drug therapy for overactive bladder symptoms in men: A randomized clinical trial [^113ihofo]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

First-line behavioral and drug therapies for overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in men are effective but not usually curative. The objective is to determine whether combining behavioral and drug therapies improves outcomes compared with each therapy alone for OAB in men and to compare three sequences for implementing combined therapy.

In this three-site, two-stage, three-arm randomized clinical trial, participants were randomized to six weeks of behavioral therapy alone, drug therapy alone, or combined therapy, followed by step-up to six weeks of combined therapy for all groups. Participants were recruited from three outpatient clinics and included community-dwelling men aged 40 years or older with urinary urgency and nine or more voids per 24 hours. Data were collected from July 2010 to July 2015 and analyzed from April 2016 to September 2019.

- **Interventions**: Behavioral therapy consisted of pelvic floor muscle training with urge suppression strategies and delayed voiding. Drug therapy included an antimuscarinic (sustained-release tolterodine, 4 mg) plus an α-blocker (tamsulosin, 0.4 mg).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Seven-day bladder diaries completed before and after each six-week treatment stage were used to calculate reduction in frequency of urination (primary outcome) and other symptoms (i.e. urgency, urgency incontinence, and nocturia). Other secondary outcomes included validated patient global ratings of improvement and satisfaction, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score, and the International Prostate Symptom Score.

Results indicated that of the 204 included men, 133 (65.2%) completed the study.

### Factors influencing treatment strategy for overactive bladder in the National Institute of Health All of Us Research Program [^114bUH8b]. Urogynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence, affecting up to 43% of women. While treatment disparities are well-documented, this study sheds light on broader systemic barriers and the need for equitable approaches to improve diagnosis and management.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to examine the types of OAB treatments (no treatment, pharmacotherapy, advanced therapy) received by patients in the United States, stratified by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors, using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

- **Study design**: Data were collected from 20,941 female patients diagnosed with OAB in the All of Us Research Hub. Patients were categorized into 3 treatment groups: (1) no treatment, (2) pharmacotherapy, or (3) advanced therapy. Demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, age, income, and health status were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to determine the influence on treatment type.

- **Results**: Of the participants, 71% received no treatment, 27% were treated with pharmacotherapy, and 2% underwent advanced therapy. On multivariate analysis, Asian and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive pharmacotherapy compared to White patients (odds ratio (95% CI), 0.47 (0.31–0.72) and 0.84 (0.74–0.95) respectively). Additionally, factors such as increasing age, unemployment, and lower income were associated with greater odds of receiving pharmacotherapy.

- **Conclusions**: Significant differences exist in the treatment of OAB, particularly among Asian and Hispanic patients.

### Tolterodine and tamsulosin for treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms and overactive bladder: a randomized controlled trial [^111UysJw]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Men with overactive bladder and other lower urinary tract symptoms may not respond to monotherapy with antimuscarinic agents or alpha-receptor antagonists.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tolterodine extended-release (ER), tamsulosin, or both in men who met research criteria for both overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 95 urology clinics in the United States. It involved men 40 years or older who had a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 12 or higher, an International Prostate Symptom Score quality-of-life (QOL) item score of 3 or higher, a self-rated bladder condition of at least moderate bother, and a bladder diary documenting micturition frequency (≥ 8 micturitions per 24 hours) and urgency (≥ 3 episodes per 24 hours), with or without urgency urinary incontinence. Patients were recruited between November 2004 and February 2006, and the study was completed in May 2006.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 222), 4 mg of tolterodine ER (n = 217), 0.4 mg of tamsulosin (n = 215), or both tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin (n = 225) for 12 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patient perception of treatment benefit, bladder diary variables, International Prostate Symptom Scores, and safety and tolerability were assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 172 men (80%) receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin reported treatment benefit by week 12 compared with 132 patients (62%) receiving placebo (p < 0.001).

### Tolterodine: A safe and effective treatment for older patients with overactive bladder [^114PSKTh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of two dosages of tolterodine in older patients with symptoms attributable to an overactive bladder, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational, phase III study was conducted. The setting included incontinence, older care, urological, and urogynecological clinics in the United Kingdom, France, and the Republic of Ireland.

One hundred and seventy-seven older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with symptoms of urinary urgency, increased frequency of micturition (≥ 8 micturitions/24 hours), and/or urge incontinence (≥ 1 episode/24 hours) participated in the study. The intervention comprised tolterodine 1 mg or 2 mg taken twice daily (bid), or a placebo, for 4 weeks.

- **Safety and tolerability**: Evaluated through spontaneously reported adverse events, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure measurements.
- **Efficacy**: Assessed using micturition diary variables, particularly the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition and number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.

The results indicated that the mean age of the patient population was 75 years, with over 87% of patients completing the study. Neither dosage of tolterodine was associated with serious drug-related adverse events during the study. No cardiac arrhythmogenic events were noted. Dry mouth (of mild to moderate intensity) was the most common adverse event in both the placebo and tolterodine treatment groups. Three percent of patients in the tolterodine 2 mg bid group discontinued treatment due to dry mouth, compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients. Compared with placebo, statistics showed no significant differences.

### Symptom assessment tool for overactive bladder syndrome — overactive bladder symptom score [^113M79R7]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common symptom syndrome characterized by urgency, urinary frequency, and urgency incontinence. To collectively express OAB symptoms, we developed the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS).

- **Methods**: Four symptoms — daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence — were scored. The weighing score was based on a secondary analysis of an epidemiologic database. Psychometric properties were examined in five patient groups: OAB (n = 83), asymptomatic controls (n = 34), stress incontinence (n = 29), benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 28), and other diseases with urinary symptoms (n = 26).

- **Results**: The maximal score was defined as 2, 3, 5, and 5 for daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence, respectively. The sum score (OABSS 0 to 15) was significantly greater in the patients with OAB (8.36) than in the other patient groups (1.82 to 5.14). The distribution of the OABSS showed a clear separation between those with OAB and asymptomatic controls. The OABSS correlated positively with the individual scores (Spearman's r = 0.10 to 0.78) and quality-of-life scores assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire (Spearman's r = 0.20 to 0.49). The weighted kappa coefficients were 0.804 to 1.0 for each symptom score and 0.861 for OABSS. The posttreatment reduction in the OABSS was consistent with the global impression of patients regarding therapeutic efficacy.

The OABSS, the sum score of four symptoms (daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence), has been developed to assess symptom severity in patients with OAB.

### Overactive bladder: A better understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^115ECyJw]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed information regarding the updated definitions, prevalence, etiologies, disease burden, and management of overactive bladder (OAB) from various perspectives, including professional impact and patient quality of life.

Published literature and treatment concepts were reviewed concerning the understanding and management of OAB. OAB is a symptom syndrome that includes urinary urgency, with or without urinary incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia. Approximately 17% of the adult population experiences OAB. There are evolving theories regarding its pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of the most commonly prescribed pharmacological therapy, antimuscarinic agents. Treatment primarily revolves around improving the quality of life.

Behavioral therapy combined with pharmacological therapy often brings about acceptable outcomes for patients with OAB. Modalities such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, and various surgical interventions also show encouraging results in more refractory patients.

### Health-related quality of life among adults with symptoms of overactive bladder: Results from a U.S. community-based survey [^1149ueh9]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of symptoms of overactive bladder, such as urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence, on the quality of life in a U.S. community-based sample, a survey was conducted. A telephone survey targeted an age and sex-stratified sample of 4,896 noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 and older in the United States. From the telephone survey responses, 483 individuals with symptoms of overactive bladder and 191 controls completed a mailed follow-up questionnaire to evaluate their quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 20.

After adjusting for age, sex, and use of medical care, the most significant differences in quality-of-life scores between patients with incontinent overactive bladders and controls were in health perception (17.6 points; P < 0.001) and role functioning (13.0 points; P < 0.001) scales. Individuals with symptoms of frequency or urgency, or both, without incontinence also showed significantly lower scores than controls in mental health (P = 0.026), health perception (P = 0.01), and bodily pain (P = 0.016).

These data indicate that individuals with an overactive bladder experience decrements in their quality of life compared to community controls. An important finding from this study is that even individuals with an overactive bladder, without demonstrable urine loss, also have a poorer quality of life than controls.

### Do patient characteristics predict responsiveness to treatment of overactive bladder with antimuscarinic agents [^1157KMxw]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine clinical and demographic characteristics associated with antimuscarinic treatment response, a regression model was used. Adults with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for more than three months and at least one urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) episode, along with eight or more micturitions per 24 hours at baseline, were randomized to receive fesoterodine (8 mg), tolterodine extended-release (4 mg), or placebo in two 12-week, double-blind, head-to-head studies. Fesoterodine-treated patients received 4 mg/d during the first week and 8 mg/d thereafter.

Patients completed three-day bladder diaries and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire at baseline and week 12. Pooled data for changes from baseline to week 12 in winsorized UUI episodes, micturitions, urgency episodes per 24 hours, and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Bother and health-related quality of life scores were analyzed post hoc. A regression model was employed that selects outcome predictors from baseline values and patient characteristics while retaining baseline values and treatment, with stepwise inclusion of significant covariates and assessment of treatment interactions. Logistic regression was used for analysis of diary-dry rates.

Results indicated that younger age, lack of previous antimuscarinic treatment, shorter duration of OAB diagnosis, and female gender were common predictors of larger changes in outcomes from baseline to week 12. Baseline measures often interacted with treatment, such that poorer baseline outcomes were predictive of larger treatment differences. Longer duration since OAB diagnosis predicted greater treatment difference.

### What are the chances of improvement or cure from overactive bladder? A pooled responder analysis of efficacy and treatment emergent adverse events following treatment with fesoterodine [^1126Z6VR]. Neurourology and urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Age stratification**: The sample consisted of 4340 patients aged 75 years. For all three treatment groups combined, at Week 4, a 50% response in urge urinary incontinence (UUI) was reported by 19.9% of patients aged 75 years. At Week 8, this response was reported by 9.0% of 75-year-olds and at Week 12, by 30.9%, 28.7%, and 25.4%, respectively. For a 50% response in UUI, the proportions at Week 4 were 63.3%, 62.9%, and 57.6%; at Week 8, 59.4%, 62.4%, and 43.2%. By Week 12, a 50% response in UUI was reported in 74.1% of patients aged 75 years. The proportions of patients experiencing a 100% response to each variable are shown in Table 2.

	**Table 2: 100% responders by time point and age group (all treatment groups combined)**

- **Sex**: For all three treatment groups combined, at Week 4, 20.4% of 5080 women and 15.0% of 1154 men reported a 50% response in UUI per hour. At Week 8, these proportions were 8.5% of 1265 women and 9.2% of 338 men. By Week 12, 30.9% of women and 25.4% of men reported a 50% response. For a 50% response in UUI per 24 hours, these proportions were, at Week 4, 62.5% of 4841 women and 63.6% of 1037 men; at Week 8, 56.6% of 1048 women and 67.6% of 225 men, and at Week 12, 72.7% of 4906 women and 77.3% of 1049 men. The proportions experiencing a 100% response to each variable are shown in Table 3.

### Muscarinic receptor antagonists for overactive bladder treatment: does one fit all [^116Q7ApC]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To review the evidence and regulatory dosing recommendations for muscarinic receptor antagonists used in the treatment of overactive bladder symptom complex (darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium) in special patient populations, growing evidence demonstrates effects of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, genetics, and/or comedications on the pharmacokinetics of muscarinic antagonists. They may cause greater exposure in the respective population, which may translate into greater risks for side effects. These possible risks lead to drug-specific regulatory dosing recommendations or even contraindications in certain patient populations.

Physicians should be aware of pharmacokinetic alterations in special patient populations and possible associated risks. The evidence-based choice of a muscarinic antagonist in such patients should be guided by its specific pharmacokinetic profile.

### Bother related to bladder control and health care seeking behavior in adults in the United States [^111SYKhh]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We measured patient-reported bother due to overactive bladder syndrome, patterns of physician consultations, and prescription medication use for overactive bladder symptoms in adults in the United States.

- **Materials and methods**: A survey sample was derived from a consumer panel of 600,000 American households, developed to match the United States Census of 260,000 adults. The survey included the Overactive Bladder-Validated 8 awareness tool, consisting of 8 questions that measure the degree of bother due to specific bladder symptoms. A score of 8 or greater indicates probable overactive bladder. Additional questions probed treatment patterns, health care consultation, overactive bladder diagnosis, treatment type, and prescription treatment use. A nonrespondent telephone survey of 1,004 participants was conducted to evaluate differences between mail survey respondents and nonrespondents.

- **Results**: The response rate was 63% (162,906 respondents). Women represented 55.1% of the sample, and 21.8% of respondents were 65 years old or older. Symptom bother, as determined by an Overactive Bladder-Validated 8 score of 8 or greater, was reported by 26.6% of the total sample, including 23.7% of men and 28.9% of women. The percentage of men and women reporting bother increased with age. Of respondents with probable overactive bladder, only 45.7% had discussed the symptoms with a medical provider, 22.5% had previously used prescription medication for overactive bladder, 13.5% had used overactive bladder medication in the last 12 months, and 8.1% were currently undergoing treatment.

### Evaluating patients' symptoms of overactive bladder by questionnaire: The role of urgency in urinary frequency [^1119NnEV]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To explain the role of urinary urgency on urinary frequency in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), we prospectively enrolled 102 patients with OAB over a 6-week period. Patients were assessed with the OAB-q and a pilot questionnaire to identify which urinary symptoms were most bothersome and what underlying cause subjects attributed urinary frequency to. Associations between epidemiologic characteristics, OAB-q scores, and subject responses to the pilot questionnaire were examined for statistical significance using the Pearson chi-square test.

The study population comprised 85% women and 15% men, with a mean age of 67.4 years and a mean OAB-q score of 54. Subjects reported their most bothersome symptoms as follows: frequency 24.5%, urgency or urgency incontinence 48.0%, and nocturia 27.5%. Of the patients most bothered by frequency, 64% identified the International Continence Society definition of urgency or "fear of leakage" as the underlying reason for their frequency. Overall, 82.4% and 48.0% of patients reported urgency or urgency incontinence as a symptom and the most bothersome symptom, respectively. However, when patients were specifically asked what drives their urinary frequency, these percentages increased to 89.2% and 63.7%.

This pilot study confirms that urgency is a significant factor underlying the drive to void frequently in OAB, even when patients do not admit to urgency as the most bothersome symptom.

### Outcome reporting in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the pharmacological management of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) in women; a systematic review for the development of core outcome sets (COS) [^112nKm3j]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). High credibility.

A comprehensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ICTRP. Inclusion criteria included the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms: 'overactive bladder', 'idiopathic', 'randomised controlled trial', 'randomized controlled trial', 'urgency', 'urge incontinence', 'urgency incontinence', 'anticholinergic', 'antimuscarinic', 'mirabegron', 'solifenacin', 'tolterodine', 'oxybutynin', 'trospium', and 'female'. The search was refined to include articles from the inception to January 2020, written in the English language and carried out only on humans and on adult women. Duplicates were removed. The initial search yielded 1402 results. The Cochrane Central Register was also used to identify any systematic reviews relevant to the pharmacological management of OAB to aid with snowballing.

Snowballing is a methodological technique used to identify additional studies that may be eligible based on the inclusion criteria. This can be achieved by searching the reference lists of systematic reviews as well as primary studies.

Title screening was followed by abstract screening and full-text screening. Articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded in a standardized and staged approach. The search was narrowed to 530 studies after title screening and subsequently to 38 studies after abstract and full-text screening. Any studies that were observational or non-randomized were excluded.

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113RMZBc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to general principles, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering a combination of one or more of the following when symptoms of overactive bladder do not adequately respond to monotherapy:

- **Behavioral therapy**: This includes interventions such as bladder training and pelvic floor muscle exercises.
- **Noninvasive therapy**: Techniques like biofeedback and electrical stimulation can be helpful.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Medications such as antimuscarinics and beta-3 adrenergic agonists are options.
- **Minimally invasive therapies**: Consider botulinum toxin injections and neuromodulation.

### Use of third line therapy for overactive bladder in a practice with multiple subspecialty providers-are we doing enough [^115oukiN]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder impacts more than 15% of the adult population. Compliance with medical treatment is low due to inadequate symptom control or intolerable side effects. Although third line therapies have improved the treatment of overactive bladder, many patients do not receive optimal treatment. We hypothesized that third line treatment use is higher among female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery urologists, and we examined its use at our tertiary referral center.

- **Materials and methods**: The electronic medical record was queried for patients with overactive bladder seen in 1 year. The number of visits associated with an overactive bladder prescription and the number of patients who received third line therapy were determined and subcategorized by department. Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers were considered separately.

- **Results**: A total of 5,445 patients (8,994 visits) were seen for overactive bladder. Of all patients seen for overactive bladder, 3.5% received third line therapy compared with 10.0% and 14.1% of those seen by urology providers and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The use of third line therapy was reported to be less than 5%. This rate is higher at our institution, which is likely due to multiple female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers. We also apply an algorithm that facilitates patient education on available options should first and second line treatments fail. Given the limited compliance with medical treatment for overactive bladder, we are continuing to monitor and improve patient outcomes.

### Overactive bladder: Clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^116cma3r]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a condition that involves urinary urgency, usually accompanied by increased daytime frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. This condition is multifactorial, and several theories exist that explain the pathophysiological process underlying the condition. Because the prevalence of the condition is high among women across all age groups, obstetrician-gynecologists will encounter women with OAB syndrome and should be able to evaluate and treat this condition. The appropriate management often is based on the degree of bother and severity of symptoms in an individual patient. This monograph will delineate the general characteristics of OAB syndrome from its epidemiology to potential causes and provide a detailed discussion of the evaluation of the patient with various diagnostic modalities and the range of available treatment options.

### Oral anticholinergic drugs versus placebo or no treatment for managing overactive bladder syndrome in adults [^113oFDdE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Around 16% of adults exhibit symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), which includes urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence; prevalence increases with age. Anticholinergic drugs are commonly used to treat this condition. This research updates a Cochrane Review initially published in 2002 and last revised in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of anticholinergic drugs compared with placebo or no treatment for treating overactive bladder syndrome in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialized Register, which contains trials identified from various sources including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched on 14 January 2020). An updated search was conducted on 3 May 2022, though these results have not yet been fully integrated.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria consisted of randomized or quasi-randomized trials in adults with overactive bladder syndrome, which compared an anticholinergic drug alone with placebo treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data from the included studies, also evaluating the risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach, processing data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

- **Main results**: We included 104 studies, 71 of which were new or updated for this version of the review. Although…

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116heSEX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition, increasing with age and affecting quality of life. While numerous OAB drugs are available, persistence is low. We evaluated evidence published since 2012 to determine if newer drugs provided better efficacy and harm profiles.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from 2012 to September 2018 using terms for included drugs and requested information from manufacturers of included drugs. We performed dual review of all systematic review processes, evaluated study quality, and conducted meta-analyses using random effects models.

- **Results**: In addition to 31 older studies, we included 20 trials published since 2012 (N = 16,478; 4 good, 11 fair, and 5 poor quality). Where statistical differences were found, they were clinically small (reductions of < 0.5 episodes/day). Solifenacin plus mirabegron improved efficacy outcomes over monotherapy with either drug, but significantly increased constipation compared with solifenacin and dry mouth compared with mirabegron. Solifenacin reduced incontinence over mirabegron and tolterodine and urgency episodes over tolterodine. Mirabegron did not differ from tolterodine in efficacy but had significantly lower incidence of dry mouth than solifenacin or tolterodine. Fesoterodine showed significant improvements but also anticholinergic effects vs. tolterodine. Oxybutynin, solifenacin, and tolterodine had similar efficacy, but dry mouth led to greater discontinuation with oxybutynin. Blurred vision, cardiac arrhythmia, and dizziness were uncommon.

Conclusion: New evidence…

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^111AfeaN]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Despite there being several efficacious treatments for OAB, treatment persistence remains extremely low due to the side effects, risks, and inconvenience of the available options. There is a compelling need for a patient-friendly treatment that is effective, economical, and adaptable to a patient's lifestyle. To determine the feasibility of such an approach, this study evaluated the comfort and tolerability of noninvasive neuromodulation on patients with OAB, as well as their interest in this method.

### Characteristics of providers who prescribed only anticholinergic medications for overactive bladder in 2020 [^116sgcXs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy for overactive bladder typically includes either an anticholinergic or a beta-3 agonist. Based on research that has demonstrated increased risks of cognitive impairment and dementia associated with anticholinergic use, guidelines support the use of beta-3 agonists rather than anticholinergics in older patients.

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of providers prescribing only anticholinergics to treat overactive bladder in patients aged ≥ 65 years. The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes data on medications dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries. Data include the National Provider Identifier of the prescriber and the number of pills prescribed and dispensed for any given medication for beneficiaries aged ≥ 65 years. We obtained each provider's National Provider Identifier, gender, degree, and primary specialty. National Provider Identifiers were linked to an additional Medicare database that includes graduation year. We included providers who prescribed pharmacologic therapy for overactive bladder in 2020 for patients aged ≥ 65 years. We calculated the percentage of providers who prescribed only anticholinergics (and did not prescribe beta-3 agonists) for overactive bladder and stratified by provider characteristics. Data are reported as adjusted risk ratios.

In 2020, 131,605 providers prescribed overactive bladder medications. Of those identified, 110,874 (84.2%) had complete demographic information available.
