## Question

Duration of liquid use in preventing preventing a fib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how long anticoagulation (liquid use) should be continued to prevent atrial fibrillation (AF), especially in relation to the duration of AF episodes, the timing around cardioversion, and in cases of device-detected AF, as well as what the evidence-based thresholds and guideline recommendations are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context and why duration matters mechanistically. Then, I should verify the key thresholds that change practice, especially the 48-hour mark and the 24-hour concept in device-detected AF. Next, I will review guideline-based peri-cardioversion anticoagulation rules and alternatives like TEE. After that, I should examine device-detected AF and the evolving evidence on episode duration and stroke risk. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note exceptions and uncertainties, ensuring I anchor each point to high-quality guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why duration matters. AF promotes stasis and endothelial dysfunction in the left atrial appendage, fostering thrombus formation. The risk rises with sustained AF, and remodeling that stabilizes thrombogenic milieu can occur within 24–48 hours, which is why duration thresholds guide anticoagulation decisions around cardioversion and in device-detected AF [^113GvZcV] [^114a2Nao].

> I need to check the primary threshold that changes peri-cardioversion management. The most consistently cited cutoff is 48 hours: if AF is documented as ≥ 48 hours or of unknown duration, guidelines recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before elective cardioversion and continuation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion, with a TEE-guided strategy as an alternative when pre-cardioversion anticoagulation cannot be completed [^114a2Nao] [^1114beyh] [^115ATHHg] [^115L62nX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about shorter episodes. For AF clearly documented as ≤ 48 hours, many guidelines allow cardioversion without prolonged pre-procedural anticoagulation, but I should confirm that this is nuanced by stroke risk and that post-cardioversion anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks is still advised in many cases. Observational and guideline data support individualized decisions, and some contemporary guidance still recommends at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion even when AF is short, particularly if stroke risk is not low [^115L62nX] [^116Dvx1X] [^114JeqJh].

> Wait, let me verify the TEE shortcut. If AF duration is ≥ 48 hours or unknown and there is a need to proceed without waiting 3 weeks, a TEE to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus allows immediate cardioversion with heparin bridging and subsequent oral anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after restoration of sinus rhythm. This approach is supported by multiple guidelines and reduces thromboembolic risk when properly executed [^114a2Nao] [^116AHvM2] [^116FP8bv].

> Next, I should review device-detected AF (atrial high-rate episodes, AHRE), where duration thresholds are more controversial. Let me consider the evidence: episodes ≥ 24 hours are associated with increased stroke risk and may justify anticoagulation when stroke risk is elevated, whereas very short episodes (< 5–6 minutes) are not associated with increased events. Intermediate durations show a dose–response relationship, but net clinical benefit of anticoagulation must be weighed against bleeding risk and is not established for all patients with brief AHRE [^113gb2ze] [^114bDNPB] [^113ywY4T].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the pivotal trials proved anticoagulation benefit for all device-detected AF above 6 minutes. Hold on, I should verify that. The NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA programs show a small absolute stroke risk in device-detected AF and only modest incremental benefit of anticoagulation over aspirin or no therapy, with increased bleeding, so routine anticoagulation for all with short AHRE is not supported; decisions should be individualized to longer episodes and higher CHA2DS2-VASc risk, acknowledging the evidence gap and ongoing debate [^113ywY4T] [^113gb2ze] [^1167Mb6w].

> I will now examine peri-ablation anticoagulation, since duration of AF often influences procedural planning. Guidelines recommend uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation before, during, and for at least 2–3 months after catheter ablation in all patients, with longer continuation dictated by underlying stroke risk rather than rhythm outcome; this strategy mitigates the early post-ablation thromboembolic risk from endothelial injury and tissue factor release [^1136KyqC] [^113hxTwH] [^111ZWpB9].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations by duration. For AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration: 3 weeks of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation before elective cardioversion and at least 4 weeks after, or TEE-guided cardioversion with appropriate heparin bridging and 4 weeks of anticoagulation after. For AF ≤ 48 hours: cardioversion without prolonged pre-anticoagulation may be reasonable, but many guidelines still advise at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion, especially if stroke risk is not low. For device-detected AF: consider anticoagulation when episodes are ≥ 24 hours and stroke risk is elevated, recognizing limited net benefit for very short episodes and the need for shared decision-making [^114a2Nao] [^114JeqJh] [^113gb2ze].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for bleeding or has fluctuating stroke risk over time? I should double-check that guidelines emphasize periodic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk, with anticoagulation decisions based on CHA2DS2-VASc regardless of AF pattern, and attention to modifiable bleeding risks; this means duration thresholds guide cardioversion strategy, whereas long-term anticoagulation should follow risk-based principles and be revisited at least annually or with clinical change [^111113pp] [^113zvGVi] [^116oV7Wb].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note uncertainties and exceptions. Very brief device-detected AF (< 5–6 minutes) should not trigger anticoagulation solely based on duration. Urgent cardioversion for hemodynamic instability should not be delayed for anticoagulation, though post-cardioversion anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks is advised when feasible. And emerging data may refine thresholds, so clinicians should integrate evolving evidence and patient preferences into decisions [^113gb2ze] [^1156hLWW] [^1167Mb6w].

The duration of anticoagulation around cardioversion depends on **AF duration and stroke risk** [^116AHvM2]. For AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration, **anticoagulate for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after** [^1148EaB2] cardioversion, or use a TEE-guided strategy if time-sensitive [^1148EaB2]. For AF < 48 hours, **anticoagulate for 4 weeks after** [^115L62nX] if stroke risk is elevated (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) [^113zvGVi]; if stroke risk is low, anticoagulation may be omitted [^116AHvM2]. After catheter ablation, continue anticoagulation for at least 2–3 months [^113hxTwH], then tailor to stroke risk [^1136KyqC].

## Anticoagulation duration based on AF duration

### AF duration ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration

For AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration, **pre-cardioversion anticoagulation** should be given for at least 3 weeks [^115ATHHg] with therapeutic INR (2.0–3.0) for VKAs or uninterrupted DOACs [^115ATHHg], or via a TEE-guided strategy if time-sensitive [^1148EaB2]. Post-cardioversion anticoagulation should continue for at least 4 weeks [^114JeqJh] regardless of baseline stroke risk [^116vKSco].

---

### AF duration < 48 hours

For AF < 48 hours, **post-cardioversion anticoagulation** is recommended for at least 4 weeks [^114JeqJh] if stroke risk is elevated (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) [^113zvGVi]. If stroke risk is low (CHA2DS2-VASc 0–1), anticoagulation may be omitted [^116AHvM2].

---

## Anticoagulation duration after catheter ablation

After catheter ablation, continue **anticoagulation for at least 2–3 months** [^113hxTwH] in all patients, regardless of rhythm outcome or CHA2DS2-VASc score [^113hxTwH]. Beyond 2–3 months, continue anticoagulation based on stroke risk factors and CHA2DS2-VASc score [^1136KyqC].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hemodynamic instability**: If urgent cardioversion is required, initiate therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation before cardioversion if possible, but do not delay emergency intervention. Continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion [^1156hLWW].

- **Postoperative AF**: Reassess the need for ongoing anticoagulation 6–12 weeks after initiating therapy for postoperative AF [^111uSV7o].

- **Device-detected AF**: For AHREs, anticoagulation decisions should consider episode duration and CHA2DS2-VASc score; episodes ≥ 24 hours are associated with significant stroke risk and may warrant anticoagulation [^113gb2ze].

## Anticoagulation duration based on AF duration and clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Pre-cardioversion anticoagulation** | **Post-cardioversion anticoagulation** |
|-|-|-|
| AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration | ≥ 3 weeks (TEE-guided strategy optional) | ≥ 4 weeks |
| AF < 48 hours, high stroke risk | Not required | ≥ 4 weeks |
| AF < 48 hours, low stroke risk | Not required | Optional |
| Catheter ablation | ≥ 3 weeks | ≥ 2–3 months, then risk-based |
| Hemodynamic instability | Immediate if possible | ≥ 4 weeks |

The duration of anticoagulation around cardioversion is **guided by AF duration and stroke risk** [^1114beyh] [^114JeqJh] [^111T9kPc] [^1136KyqC] [^113CNcGg]: ≥ 3 weeks before and ≥ 4 weeks after for AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration, and at least 4 weeks after for AF < 48 hours if stroke risk is elevated. After ablation, continue anticoagulation for at least 2–3 months, then tailor to stroke risk.

### Duration of diabetes mellitus and risk of thromboembolism and bleeding in atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^116nBaVf]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Guidelines advocate anticoagulant treatment to all patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant diabetes mellitus. The potential refinement to thromboembolic risk stratification that may spring from subdividing diabetes mellitus is unexplored. The purpose was to investigate duration of diabetes mellitus as a predictor of thromboembolism and anticoagulant-related bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

Using nationwide Danish registries, we identified all patients discharged from hospital with an incident diagnosis of atrial fibrillation from 2000 to 2011. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for thromboembolism and bleeding according to years of diabetes mellitus duration in categories (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, and ≥ 15) and as a continuous variable using cubic splines were calculated by Cox regression.

Results

The study population comprised 137 222 patients with atrial fibrillation, of which 12.4% had diabetes mellitus. Compared with patients without diabetes mellitus and after adjustment for anticoagulant treatment and CHA2DS2-VASc components (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, previous stroke, vascular disease, and sex), the risk of thromboembolism was lowest in the 0 to 4 years duration category (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.20), and highest in the longest duration category of ≥ 15 years (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.70). When analyzed as a continuous variable, duration of diabetes mellitus was associated with risk of thromboembolism in a dose-response-dependent manner, but not with a higher risk of bleeding during anticoagulant treatment.

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation, longer duration of diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism, but not with a higher risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding. Considering the critical balance between preventing thromboembolism and avoiding bleeding, longer duration of diabetes mellitus may favor initiation of anticoagulant therapy.

### Dual (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet) vs triple (anticoagulant plus dual antiplatelet) antithrombotic therapy-"Real world" experience [^116zCquk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that increases in prevalence with advancing age and in patients with coronary artery disease, revascularization, particularly with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is also common. Both disease states have thrombosis as a core pathophysiologic process which requires treatment - low sheer stress thrombi in AF and intracoronary high sheer stress thrombi in PCI. For the 10–20% of patients who have both AF and undergo PCI, preventing thrombotic complications will require inhibition of both processes requiring simultaneous use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There is a broad experience of combining oral anticoagulation therapy, used to prevent stroke and systemic embolization, in AF with dual antiplatelet therapy, used to prevent stent thrombosis and thrombotic coronary events. This "triple antithrombotic therapy" (TT) has been evaluated through many observation studies, both small and large. TT has more frequently been associated with a significant increase in bleeding events with non-significant reduction in thrombotic events. Current guidelines recommend shorter duration of TT, especially in patients with high risk of bleeding.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114wq8C6]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — For patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack] score of 0), we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy, and for patients choosing antithrombotic therapy, we suggest aspirin rather than oral anticoagulation or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For intermediate risk (eg, CHADS2 score of 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, and we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For high risk (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest dabigatran 150 mg bid rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### Quantifying time in atrial fibrillation and the need for anticoagulation [^116RJ3M9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the major cardiovascular diseases, and the number of patients with AF is predicted to increase markedly in the coming years. Despite recent advance in management of patients with AF, AF remains one of the main causes of stroke or systemic embolism. Application of simple stroke risk-stratification schemes, such as the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score has been introduced to identify patients who mostly benefit from oral anticoagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention. Current medical devices allow the detection of short and asymptomatic episodes of AF, termed atrial high rate episodes (AHREs), which are also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. Early diagnosis of AF has clinical importance for a timely initiation of OAC, while strokes often occur without AHRE detected within 30days before the event. Consequently, it is unclear whether any AHRE imply the same therapeutic requirements as clinical AF. The exact estimation of AF burden and correct risk stratification in patients with asymptomatic AF and AHRE remains a challenge in clinical practice.

### Quality indicators for the care and outcomes of adults with atrial fibrillation [^114srX7J]. Europace (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation outcome measurement — annual assessment of crude and risk-adjusted rates of all-cause mortality is recommended, and risk adjustment should, as a minimum, consider age, sex, and comorbidities; given that ischaemic stroke is a major complication of AF and that most AF patients (CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 1 in men and ≥ 2 in women) will be eligible for stroke prevention, the overall and risk-adjusted annual incidence of stroke and, separately, transient ischaemic attack should be recorded, with numerators defined as AF patients who died during the measurement duration or had documented ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and denominators defined as the number of patients with AF.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^112pFnHx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related ischaemic stroke is diagnosed through a combination of clinical history, neuroimaging, angiography, and cardiac evaluations.

The classic characteristic of a sudden onset of severe neurological deficits.
Neuroimaging typically reveals cortical infarct lesions, involving multiple cerebral arterial territories.
Brain computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrating the abrupt interruption of vessels responsible for the infarct, without evident atherosclerotic narrowing upstream, aids in diagnosing atrial fibrillation‐related ischaemic stroke; cervical CTA is essential for excluding ischaemic stroke caused by carotid artery stenosis.
Cardiac assessment involves detecting atrial fibrillation rhythm using an electrocardiogram, 24‐hour Holter monitoring, or prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring.

Stroke due to non‐valvular atrial fibrillation tends to exhibit more severe symptoms, higher recurrence rates, and a poorer prognosis than stroke not due to cardiac embolism. It hugely increases the economic burden on society and has served as a major contributor to healthcare costs. Anticoagulation is the first‐line treatment for secondary stroke prevention in non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke, and can significantly reduce the recurrence of stroke and systemic embolism, enhance survival rates, and alleviate the economic burden.

The risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke is highest in the first few days after stroke onset, with an estimated daily risk of recurrence within the initial two‐week period after a non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke ranging from 0.5 to 1.3%. Therefore, it is important to initiate early anticoagulation therapy to prevent the recurrence of stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. However, early anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage transformation, thereby negating the benefits of secondary stroke prevention. These highlight the importance of identifying the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulation after stroke with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation, to achieve a balance where the potential benefits of secondary stroke prevention outweigh the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage.

### Anticoagulation in device-detected atrial fibrillation with or without vascular disease: a combined analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials [^113ywY4T]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Device-detected atrial fibrillation (DDAF) is found in 20%–30% of older adults with cardiovascular disease, often in patients without electrocardiogram (ECG)-documented atrial fibrillation (AF). Device-detected atrial fibrillation refers to episodic atrial arrhythmias that resemble AF but are typically short and rare. Expert consensus and analogies between DDAF and ECG-documented AF led clinicians to prescribe anticoagulation to patients with DDAF. Two recent trials compared anticoagulation with no anticoagulation in patients with DDAF and stroke risk factors, but without ECG-documented AF. The NOAH-AFNET 6 (Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial High Rate Episodes) trial randomized patients with DDAF lasting 6 min or longer to anticoagulation with edoxaban or no anticoagulation. Patients with vascular disease and an indication for acetylsalicylic acid randomized to no anticoagulation received aspirin 100 mg once daily with the study medication; the others received placebo (double dummy design). The trial was stopped prematurely due to an expected increase in bleeding combined with a trend towards futility for efficacy. The ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients with Device Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation) trial randomized patients with DDAF lasting 6 min to 23:59 h to anticoagulation with apixaban or aspirin 81 mg once dailyand found a small stroke risk-reducing effect of anticoagulation compared with aspirin. Both trials consistently found a low rate of stroke without anticoagulation (1.1%–1.2% per patient-years), the expected increase in bleeding with anticoagulation, and a small further reduction in stroke with anticoagulation.

Many patients with DDAF (56% in NOAH-AFNET 6, 46% in ARTESiA) have concomitant vascular disease that creates an indication for antiplatelet therapy, usually aspirin, to prevent thromboembolic events including ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and systemic arterial embolism (SE). Aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding compared with no therapy. This may alter the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy. We therefore performed subgroup analyses of NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA in patients with and without vascular disease.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^113y1CQm]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

### Treatment of atrial fibrillation [^114rAuLL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that affects more than 2.5 million people in the United States and causes substantial morbidity and mortality, especially regarding the increased risk of stroke.

Objective

To summarize atrial fibrillation treatment exclusive of stroke prevention.

Evidence Review

An Ovid MEDLINE comprehensive literature search was performed on atrial fibrillation therapy excluding anticoagulation and emphasizing studies published within the last 5 years through April 2015 (N = 5044 references). The 2014 atrial fibrillation guideline from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society also was reviewed.

Findings

Reversible causes of atrial fibrillation should be identified. Risk factor modification, including weight loss and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea can reduce atrial fibrillation episodes. Appropriate anticoagulation is necessary for patients at substantial stroke risk regardless of rate or rhythm treatment strategy. Sinus rhythm is often needed to control symptoms; however, an alternative strategy for atrial fibrillation is appropriate rate control. Rate control is safe in older patients (those who are about age ≥ 65 years) followed up for a few years, but no such safety data exist for patients younger than 60 years or for those followed up for longer periods. Thus, selection of therapy is individualized, taking into account present and future medical problems for the patient. Choice of an antiarrhythmic drug is based on safety first vs efficacy. Catheter ablation is an effective nonpharmacological alternative that is often, but not always, the second-line treatment. Reduction of the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation episodes that result in a significant improvement in quality of life is a good marker of drug treatment success and complete elimination of atrial fibrillation is not required in many patients. Rate control is usually achieved with a β-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is important to assess adequate rate control during both rest and activity. If the ventricular rate goes uncontrolled for a prolonged period, tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy can occur.

Conclusions and Relevance

Therapy for atrial fibrillation includes prevention and modification of inciting causes and appropriate anticoagulation. Rate control is necessary for all patients. Maintenance of sinus rhythm with drugs or catheter ablation should be considered based on the individual needs of each patient.

Investigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis

We will assess clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity in the included studies.

We will describe the clinical diversity and methodological variability of the evidence narratively and in tables. Tables will include data on study characteristics such as design features, participants' characteristics, intervention details, and outcomes measured. If there is excessive clinical heterogeneity, we will not conduct a meta‐analysis. To assess statistical heterogeneity, we will visually inspect forest plots and describe the direction and magnitude of effects and the degree of overlap between CIs. We will use the I 2 statistic to quantify inconsistencies between the trials in each analysis to assess possible heterogeneity. We will grade the degree of heterogeneity according to the rough thresholds provided in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions:

0% to 40% might not represent important heterogeneity;
30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity;
50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity;
75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity.

Atrial fibrillation — prevention of thromboembolism before elective cardioversion (8.2.1): COR 1, LOE B-R — In patients with AF duration of ≥ 48 hours, a 3-week duration of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation or imaging evaluation to exclude intracardiac thrombus is recommended before elective cardioversion.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Dvx1X]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation cardioversion (documented duration 48 h or less) — elective cardioversion: we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C), and decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class I) states that antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with AF, except those with low risk or contraindications (Level of Evidence: A), and the selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient (Level of Evidence: A). For patients without mechanical heart valves at high risk of stroke, chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended in a dose adjusted to achieve the target intensity of an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, unless contraindicated, and factors associated with high risk include prior thromboembolism and rheumatic mitral stenosis (Level of Evidence: A). Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than 1 moderate risk factor, including age 75 y or greater, hypertension, HF, impaired LV systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of therapy and monthly when anticoagulation is stable (Level of Evidence: A). Aspirin, 81–325 mg daily, is recommended as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in low-risk patients or in those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, the target intensity of anticoagulation should be based on the type of prosthesis, maintaining an INR of at least 2.5 (Level of Evidence: B). Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF (Level of Evidence: C).

### Secondary stroke prevention in people with atrial fibrillation: treatments and trials [^112M92vA]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias and is a major cause of ischaemic stroke. Recent findings indicate the importance of atrial fibrillation burden (device-detected, subclinical, or paroxysmal and persistent or permanent) and whether atrial fibrillation was known before stroke onset or diagnosed after stroke for the risk of recurrence. Secondary prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and stroke aims to reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke. Findings from randomised controlled trials assessing the optimal timing to introduce direct oral anticoagulant therapy after a stroke show that early start (ie, within 48 h for minor to moderate strokes and within 4–5 days for large strokes) seems safe and could reduce the risk of early recurrence. Other promising developments regarding early rhythm control, left atrial appendage occlusion, and novel factor XI inhibitor oral anticoagulants suggest that these therapies have the potential to further reduce the risk of stroke. Secondary prevention strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a stroke despite oral anticoagulation therapy is an unmet medical need. Research advances suggest a heterogeneous spectrum of causes, and ongoing trials are investigating new approaches for secondary prevention in this vulnerable patient group. In patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, the latest data from randomised controlled trials on stroke prevention shows that oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke but more data are needed to define the safety profile.

Table 1.
Comparison of CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc Risk Stratification Schemes

In patients appropriate for oral anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in AF, the mainstay of treatment for decades has been a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Compared with placebo or no treatment, adjusted‐dose warfarin was found in the early AF trials to reduce stroke by about 64% (95% CI 49% to 74%) without a significant increase in major bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy was also effective, but to a lesser extent, with a relative risk reduction of 22% compared with placebo (95% CI 2% to 39%). Although these early AF trials concluded a favorable safety profile for warfarin, there are some notable limitations that challenge extrapolation of bleeding risk from trial to general populations. The early trials assessing efficacy and safety of adjusted‐dose warfarin (ie, Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin and Anticoagulant Therapy Study [AFASAK], Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation [SPAF], Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial for Atrial Fibrillation [BAATAF], Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation [CAFA], Stroke Prevention in Nonrheumatic Atrial Fibrillation [SPINAF], and European Atrial Fibrillation Trial [EAFT]) had relatively small study populations composed of participants with few risk factors for bleeding compared with the "real world" AF populations on anticoagulant therapy.

### Optimal delay time to initiate anticoagulation after ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation: a pragmatic, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial [^117GwQLv]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Clinical practice guidelines recommend initiation of anticoagulation within 2 weeks after stroke with atrial fibrillation. It is unknown whether there is an optimal starting day within the 14-day period that balances the risks of recurrent embolic events against serious hemorrhagic events.

Objective

To determine if there is an optimal delay time to initiate treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation-related stroke that minimizes the risk of a composite outcome of ischemic or hemorrhagic events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 2, pragmatic, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial was conducted between June 2017 and June 2023 at acute care hospitals in Texas and included patients who had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke (minimum lesion diameter of 1.5 cm) with atrial fibrillation and were prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant within 2 weeks from stroke onset.

Intervention

Within 3 to 4 days after atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke, patients were randomized to a group for treatment start date (group 1 was day 3 or 4 after stoke onset; group 2 was day 6; group 3 was day 10; and group 4 was day 14) with a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The composite primary outcome was an ischemic (stroke or systemic embolism) or hemorrhagic (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or major systemic hemorrhage) event observed within 30 days from the index stroke time of onset. Posterior probabilities were used to estimate which timing groups were optimal for treatment initiation and were recalculated at predefined intervals. The randomization allocations were adjusted to favor the groups with higher probabilities.

Results

The trial enrolled and randomized 200 patients (50% were female; the median age was 75 years [IQR, 65–81 years]; 17.5% were Asian, Black, or > 1 race; 16.5% were Hispanic; the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 6.5 [IQR, 4–14]; and the median lesion diameter was 3.1 cm [IQR, 2.0–4.4 cm]). No ischemic events were observed for group 1, 3 events were observed for group 2, 2 events were observed for group 3, and 2 events were observed for group 4. One hemorrhagic event was observed for group 1, 1 event was observed for group 2, 1 event was observed for group 3, and 0 events were observed for group 4. Group 1 had a posterior probability of 0.41 for being the optimal day for treatment initiation and it was 0.26 for group 2, 0.17 for group 3, and 0.15 for group 4. The use of response-adaptive randomization was feasible and favored groups with earlier initiation times for use of a direct oral anticoagulant.

Conclusions and Relevance

A clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was not identified, but the evidence suggests that initiating use of a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than at later times within the first 2 weeks after stroke onset.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^113oP1Yu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Oral anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are recommended for stroke prevention in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. Anticoagulants exert their action on the clotting cascade to reduce fibrin polymerisation and prevent the formation of blood clots, thereby reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. VKAs, such as warfarin, inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K‐dependent clotting factors, including factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S, to inhibit blood clot formation. Warfarin is administered orally, and doses are adjusted based on the International Normalised Ratio (INR) to maintain the optimal therapeutic range. Achieving an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 with adjusted‐dose warfarin treatment can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of warfarin include its effectiveness, affordability, and widespread availability. In cases of bleeding or overdose, warfarin's adverse effects can be reversed through the administration of vitamin K or an infusion of fresh frozen plasma. However, warfarin has drawbacks such as being prone to interactions with multiple foods and drugs, having a narrow therapeutic window, having a high risk of bleeding, and requiring complex management.

NOACs directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or indirectly inhibit activated factor X (Xa) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) to prevent blood clot formation. Dabigatran, the first approved NOAC, exerts its anticoagulant effect by strongly, reversibly, and selectively inhibiting thrombin activity, with the intensity of its effects dependent on drug concentration. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit various states of factor Xa to reduce thrombin generation without interfering with existing thrombi, while having minimal impact on normal physiological haemostasis and non‐coagulation functions. Multiple guidelines recommend the use of NOACs for secondary prevention of non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of NOACs include minimal interactions with food and drugs, stable pharmacokinetics, no need for dose adjustments, no requirement for regular INR monitoring, rapid onset of action, good tolerability, and fewer side effects compared to warfarin. Compared to warfarin, NOACs have a lower incidence of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage, making them generally safer and more convenient. Reversal agents for NOACs, such as idarucizumab and exanetalfa, have been developed for the treatment of life‐threatening bleeding or in situations requiring urgent surgery. Some disadvantages of using NOACs, as opposed to vitamin K antagonists, include higher costs and the need for dose adjustments in individuals with renal impairment or extreme body weight.

Why it is important to do this review

The optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulant therapy in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate about early versus late initiation. Current guidelines lack consistency and clear recommendations on when to initiate anticoagulant therapy, primarily relying on expert consensus and limited evidence. For example, the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guideline suggests using the "1‐3‐6‐12" rule based on stroke severity to determine the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends initiating oral anticoagulant therapy between 4 and 14 days after symptom onset. Due to the inconsistent recommendations among various guidelines, physicians encounter challenges in determining the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy for people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related strokes. A survey conducted among stroke physicians in the UK revealed a lack of consensus on this matter, with 95% of respondents expressing uncertainty about the appropriate time to begin oral anticoagulation. Therefore, a systematic review of the optimal timing for starting oral anticoagulation therapy after acute ischaemic stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation is highly warranted.

### New versus traditional approaches to oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112CQfdy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For clinicians, atrial fibrillation (AFib) is not a disease that will probably be "cured" at some point during their professional lifetime. (online video available at: http://education.amjmed.com/video.php?event_id = 445&stage_id = 5&vcs = 1). AFib is a condition that occurs in association with aging, affecting as many as 1 in 10 patients by the time they reach age 85, and therefore all physicians who read The American Journal of Medicine should be aware of AFib-its etiology, how to recognize it, and with some idea of how it is treated. Perhaps the most important aspect of AFib, however, is as a risk factor for systemic embolism and stroke, which means that almost all patients with AFib will need to receive anticoagulation therapy, probably for the rest of their lives. For the past several decades the only oral anticoagulant agent has been warfarin. Warfarin is an effective anticoagulant, but for many reasons (patient adherence, physician reluctance, warfarin's narrow therapeutic efficacy), less than half of the patients who should be anticoagulated are prescribed warfarin (dropping to less than a third in older patients), and of those who are prescribed and apparently adherent, less than a third maintain serum warfarin levels in the narrow therapeutic range of INR 2–3. Thus, it is clear that the traditional prescription of warfarin for patients with AFib has failed to meet an important need for reducing risk of systemic embolism and stroke. Fortunately, however, within the last couple of years a new generation of novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) agents has proven successful in randomized clinical trials and has been passing through the regulatory approval process. For physicians this represents both a challenge-to learn and understand the evidence base for these new anticoagulant therapies-and the opportunity now to treat their aging patients who are increasingly likely to present with cerebrovascular disease risks and who are depending on their physicians to treat them with the best evidence-based care available today. To address this need this program reviews: the epidemiology and demographics of AFib; risk reduction for the general patient population with AFib; the new oral anticoagulant agents that may offer alternatives to warfarin; risk reduction for the special patient populations (age, gender, triple-therapy patients).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Post-procedural management after PCI in patients requiring AC therapy includes reinitiation timing and regimen selection: AC therapy should be reinitiated post-PCI after careful evaluation of bleeding risk and post-procedure complications, with particular emphasis on access site hemostasis and consideration of recent bleeding, body habitus, platelet abnormalities, and coagulation studies. Irrespective of the pre-PCI AC, we recommend using a DOAC post-PCI; if not feasible, a VKA should be resumed/started. For VKA-treated patients post-PCI, only a small subset should be considered for bridging until the INR is therapeutic; if not bridging, one should consider continuing low-dose aspirin with a P2Y12i until the INR is at goal, after which aspirin can be stopped, and one may consider aspirin (81 mg/day) for up to 30 days in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. In most patients, AC therapy can be resumed within 24 hours after PCI, and in some as early as the evening of the procedure day. For a VKA, resume the dose associated with prior therapeutic INR, while for DOACs and LMWH, the dose may need adjustment based on post-PCI renal function.

### Efficacy and safety of short intravenous hydration for preventing nephrotoxicity from high-dose cisplatin: a randomized, open-label, phase II trial | JCO global oncology… [^115ridVX]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

The SH protocol is feasible and safe, with a remarkably reduced duration of administration. Thus, SH can be an alternative to CH in the prevention of cisplatin-related nephrotoxicity. 4A systematic review reported several strategies to prevent cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity, such as different volumes or durations of hydration, magnesium supplementation, and forced diuresis with hydration. 5Conventional hydration protocols, which include a total of 5–6 L of fluid delivered overnight or on a multiple-day inpatient basis, have been recommended for decades to prevent cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. 3, 6–8However, these protocols require prolonged hospital stays and cannot be followed on an outpatient basis. In recent years, a short hydration protocol together with cisplatin infusion has been developed to minimize hydration duration while effectively preventing renal toxicity.

We hypothesized that SH is a safe and effective alternative to CH for preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Procedures All patients in both study arms were informed about the cisplatin-related toxicities and underwent the CH or SH protocol according to their random assignment. The CH protocol consisted of prechemotherapy intravenous hydration with 1, 000 mL of isotonic normal saline over 8 hours, followed by chemotherapy agents over 1–3 hours, then 2, 000 mL of postchemotherapy NSS infused over 16 hours, yielding a total volume of 3, 000 mL over 24 hours. The SH protocol included prechemotherapy intravenous hydration with 500 mL of NSS over 1 hour, followed by chemotherapy agents over 1–3 hours, then postchemotherapy hydration with 1, 000 mL of NSS infused over 3 hours, yielding a total volume of 1, 500 mL over 4 hours. This phase II randomized study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the SH protocol in conjunction with high-dose cisplatin therapy (> 60 mg/m.

12may not be ideal for comparing the outcomes between the two treatment arms. For direct comparisons between SH and CH, a phase III randomized controlled trial may be warranted. To conclude, this phase II study demonstrated that short-term intravenous hydration is a feasible approach for the prevention of nephrotoxicity from high-dose cisplatin without increasing the incidence of AKI and other AEs. Additionally, being an outpatient procedure, the SH protocol could reduce the duration of hospital stay.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability — urgent cardioversion anticoagulation: For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest that therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation be started before cardioversion, if possible (Grade 2C), but that initiation of anticoagulation must not delay any emergency intervention (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C), and decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy.

Atrial fibrillation — elective cardioversion with documented duration of 48 h or less: For patients with AF of documented duration of 48 h or less undergoing elective cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 1B). Decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Aspirin-free strategy for percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with oral anticoagulation: prespecified subgroup analysis from the STOPDAPT-3 trial [^113GcazH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) was superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for prevention of thrombotic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, triple therapy with OAC on top of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been given just after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, triple therapy with DAPT plus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) as compared with dual therapy with clopidogrel plus VKA was associated with higher risk of bleeding events without reducing thrombotic events in the WOEST (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Stenting) trial. In the meta‐analysis, VKA‐based triple therapy was associated with higher risk of bleeding, including major and intracranial hemorrhages, as compared with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) based dual therapy. However, the lower risk of bleeding events in DOAC‐based dual therapy compared with triple therapy was counterbalanced by a higher risk of stent thrombosis even with triple therapy within a few days or up to 2 weeks at the longest in the dual therapy group. In the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 1 week of triple therapy followed by DOAC plus single antiplatelet therapy was recommended as the default strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation. Triple therapy for longer than 1 week and up to 1 month was recommended (Class IIa) in patients with high ischemic risk. Therefore, optimal duration of triple therapy within 1 month after PCI is still a matter of debate.

Recently, the STOPDAPT‐3 (Short and Optimal Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy‐3) trial has demonstrated that an aspirin‐free strategy compared with the standard DAPT strategy failed to reduce major bleeding at 1 month after PCI, with a signal suggesting increased coronary events such as definite or probable subacute stent thrombosis and any unplanned coronary revascularization. In this study, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis based on the use of OAC within 7 days before PCI in the STOPDAPT‐3 trial to elucidate the safety and efficacy of an aspirin‐free strategy relative to the DAPT strategy within 1 month after PCI in patients treated with OAC.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111113pp]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation — synopsis and supportive text — states that prevention "is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL", and therapy selection "should be guided by the patient's risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and individual preferences". Decisions "should" be based on stroke risk "regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent)" and "should be periodically reassessed since a patient's risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time". Supportive text adds that although risk is higher with more persistent AF, therapy "should be based on the risk of stroke and not the pattern of AF", and that "Treatment effects with oral anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns". Ongoing follow-up is emphasized: "Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently" with clinical changes such as "reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors".

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a north American perspective: 2021 update [^115gjKty]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation also have atrial fibrillation. This poses challenges for their optimal antithrombotic management because patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI require oral anticoagulation for the prevention of cardiac thromboembolism and dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of coronary thrombotic complications. The combination of oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy substantially increases the risk of bleeding. Over the last decade, a series of North American Consensus Statements on the Management of Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention have been reported. Since the last update in 2018, several pivotal clinical trials in the field have been published. This document provides a focused updated of the 2018 recommendations. The group recommends that in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant is the oral anticoagulation of choice. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor should be given to all patients during the peri-PCI period (during inpatient stay, until time of discharge, up to 1 week after PCI, at the discretion of the treating physician), after which the default strategy is to stop aspirin and continue treatment with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, preferably clopidogrel, in combination with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, double therapy). In patients at increased thrombotic risk who have an acceptable risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to continue aspirin (ie, triple therapy) for up to 1 month. Double therapy should be given for 6 to 12 months with the actual duration depending on the ischemic and bleeding risk profile of the patient, after which patients should discontinue antiplatelet therapy and receive oral anticoagulation alone.

### Stability of high-quality warfarin anticoagulation in a community-based atrial fibrillation cohort: the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation (ATRIA) study [^116dSdfR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent significant cardiac arrhythmia and the strongest common risk factor for ischemic stroke. 1 It increases stroke risk 5‐fold and accounts for ≈15% of all strokes in the United States. 2, 3 Moreover, strokes caused by AF are more likely to prove fatal or severely disabling. 4, 5 High‐quality anticoagulant therapy can largely prevent AF‐associated thromboembolic events while minimizing bleeding risk. 6 AF patients taking warfarin are at the lowest risk for both thromboembolism and intracranial hemorrhage at International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels of 1.8 to 3.5, a range that includes the guideline‐recommended range of 2.0 to 3.0. 7, 8 Frequent INR monitoring with dose adjustment is generally needed to maintain INR levels in this target range of 2.0 to 3.0. 9 Recently developed novel anticoagulants (ie, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) now compete with warfarin as the primary stroke‐preventive therapy for AF patients. These agents offer fixed oral doses without the need for frequent INR monitoring and with a reduced risk of intracranial hemorrhage compared with average to poor warfarin anticoagulation control. 10 These novel agents appear to be particularly attractive for AF patients starting anticoagulant therapy. What remains unclear is whether AF patients who are well anticoagulated on warfarin should switch to a novel agent.

Time in the therapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2.0 to 3.0 is the standard means of assessing quality of warfarin therapy. 11 Secondary analyses of randomized trials indicate that warfarin at TTR ≥ 70% has efficacy and safety comparable to novel anticoagulants, suggesting that patients with TTR ≥ 70% would gain little clinical benefit from switching to a novel anticoagulant. 12, 13, 14 This assumes, however, that such a high TTR is stable over time. Limited analyses have examined the stability of TTR in AF patients taking warfarin over a prolonged period. 15, 16, 17 Our study aimed to address this knowledge gap by assessing the stability of high‐quality anticoagulation over 12 months among patients initiating warfarin. Specifically, we used a large, real‐world cohort of AF patients newly taking warfarin to determine the percentage of patients with an initial 6‐month TTR (TTR 1) ≥ 70% whose TTR persisted at ≥ 70% in the subsequent 6‐month period (TTR 2). We then assessed patient features potentially predicting continued high‐quality TTR. Addressing these aims can provide guidance to patients and their providers when making the decision to continue warfarin or to switch to a novel agent.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, pericardioversion, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to continue oral anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks in all patients after cardioversion and long-term in patients with thromboembolic risk factors, irrespective of whether sinus rhythm is achieved, to prevent thromboembolism.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class IIa) specifies that for primary prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular AF who have just 1 validated risk factor, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable, based upon an assessment of bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences, listing age greater than or equal to 75 y, hypertension, HF, impaired LV function, or diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF who have 1 or more less well-validated risk factors, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable for prevention of thromboembolism, including age 65 to 74 y, female gender, or CAD, and the choice of agent should be based upon bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to select antithrombotic therapy using the same criteria irrespective of the pattern (i.e., paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) of AF (Level of Evidence: B). In patients with AF who do not have mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is reasonable to interrupt anticoagulation for up to 1 wk without substituting heparin for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C).

### Atrial fibrillation detection and load: knowledge gaps related to stroke prevention [^116JM8Yh]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Technological advances now support prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring using either surface electrodes or insertable cardiac monitors. Four major randomized controlled trials show that prolonged cardiac monitoring detects subclinical paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 9% to 16% of patients with ischemic stroke, including in patients with potential alternative causes such as large artery disease or small vessel occlusion; however, the optimal monitoring strategy, including the target patient population and the monitoring device (whether to use an event monitor, insertable cardiac monitor, or stepped approach) has not been well defined. Furthermore, the clinical significance of very short duration paroxysmal atrial fibrillation remains controversial. The relevance of the duration of monitoring, burden of device-detected atrial fibrillation, and its proximity to the acute ischemic stroke will require more research to define the most effective methods for stroke prevention in this patient population.

Pharmacological versus electrical cardioversion — effectiveness, timing, and anticoagulation considerations: Cardioversion may be achieved by means of drugs or electrical shocks, and although drug use has increased, disadvantages include the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes; pharmacological cardioversion is less effective than direct-current cardioversion when biphasic shocks are used, while electrical cardioversion requires conscious sedation or anesthesia. There is no evidence that the risk of thromboembolism or stroke differs between pharmacological and electrical methods, and recommendations for anticoagulation are therefore the same for both methods. Pharmacological cardioversion seems most effective when initiated within 7 d after the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation; a large proportion of patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24 to 48 h, whereas spontaneous conversion is less frequent with longer than 7-d duration and efficacy of drug cardioversion is markedly reduced. Pharmacological therapy may accelerate restoration of sinus rhythm but the advantage over placebo is modest after 24 to 48 h and is much less effective in persistent atrial fibrillation, and some drugs have a delayed onset with conversion not occurring for several days after initiation. Antiarrhythmic drugs can interact with vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants when added or withdrawn, and when anticoagulation is initiated for elective cardioversion, adding an antiarrhythmic may perturb the intensity of anticoagulation beyond the intended therapeutic range, raising the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

### Stroke and thromboembolism prevention in atrial fibrillation [^112WcSrs]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism remains the cornerstone for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter. Multiple risk assessment models for stroke and systemic thromboembolism are currently available. The score, with its known limitations, remains as the recommended risk stratification tool in most major guidelines. Once at-risk patients are identified, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and, more recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the primary medical therapy for stroke prevention. In those with contraindication for long-term anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occluding devices are developing as a possible alternative therapy. Some controversy exists regarding anticoagulation management for cardioversion of acute AF (< 48 hours); however, systemic anticoagulation precardioversion and postcardioversion is recommended for those with longer duration of AF. Anticoagulation management peri-AF ablation is also evolving. Uninterrupted VKA and DOAC therapy has been shown to reduce perioperative thromboembolic risk with no significant escalation in major bleeding. Currently, under investigation is a minimally interrupted approach to anticoagulation with DOACs periablation. Questions remain, especially regarding the delivery of anticoagulation care and integration of wearable rhythm monitors in AF management.

### Interrupted versus uninterrupted anticoagulation therapy for catheter ablation in adults with arrhythmias [^114cQRzH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of anticoagulation therapy around the time of catheter ablation (CA) procedure for adults with arrhythmia is critical and yet is variable in clinical practice. The ideal approach for safe and effective perioperative management should balance the risk of bleeding during uninterrupted anticoagulation while minimising the risk of thromboembolic events with interrupted therapy.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and harms of interrupted versus uninterrupted anticoagulation therapy for catheter ablation (CA) in adults with arrhythmias.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and SCI-Expanded on the Web of Science for randomised controlled trials on 5 January 2021. We also searched three registers on 29 May 2021 to identify ongoing or unpublished trials. We performed backward and forward searches on reference lists of included trials and other systematic reviews and contacted experts in the field. We applied no restrictions on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing uninterrupted anticoagulation with any modality of interruption with or without heparin bridging for CA in adults aged 18 years or older with arrhythmia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted independent screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. A third review author resolved disagreements. We extracted data on study population, interruption strategy, ablation procedure, thromboembolic events (stroke or systemic embolism), major and minor bleeding, asymptomatic thromboembolic events, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, quality of life (QoL), length of hospital stay, cost, and source of funding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 studies (4714 participants) that compared uninterrupted periprocedural anticoagulation with interrupted anticoagulation. Studies performed an interruption strategy by either a complete interruption (one study) or by a minimal interruption (11 studies), of which a single-dose skipped strategy was used (nine studies) or two-dose skipped strategy (two studies), with or without heparin bridging. Studies included participants with a mean age of 65 years or greater, with only two studies conducted in relatively younger individuals (mean age less than 60 years). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was the primary type of AF in all studies, and seven studies included other types of AF (persistent and long-standing persistent). Most participants had CHADS2 or CHADS2-VASc demonstrating a low-moderate risk of stroke, with almost all participants having normal or mildly reduced renal function. Ablation source using radiofrequency energy was the most common (seven studies). Ten studies (2835 participants) were conducted in East Asian countries (Japan, China, and South Korea), while the remaining two studies were conducted in the USA. Eight studies were conducted in a single centre. Postablation follow-up was variable among studies at less than 30 days (three studies), 30 days (six studies), and more than 30 days postablation (three studies). Overall, the meta-analysis showed high uncertainty of the effect between the interrupted strategy compared to uninterrupted strategy on the primary outcomes of thromboembolic events (risk ratio (RR) 1.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 9.46; I² = 59%; 6 studies, 3468 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, subgroup analysis showed that uninterrupted vitamin A antagonist (VKA) is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of bleeding. There is also uncertainty on the outcome of major bleeding events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.05; I² = 6%; 10 studies, 4584 participants; low-certainty evidence). The uncertainty was also evident for the secondary outcomes of minor bleeding (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.22; I² = 87%; 9 studies, 3843 participants; very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.21; 442 participants; low-certainty evidence) and asymptomatic thromboembolic events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.47; I² = 56%; 6 studies, 1268 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was a lower risk of the composite endpoint of thromboembolic events (stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality) in the interrupted compared to uninterrupted arm (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81; 1 study, 442 participants; low-certainty evidence). In general, the low event rates, different comparator anticoagulants, and use of different ablation procedures may be the cause of imprecision and heterogeneity observed.

Authors' Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed that the evidence is uncertain to inform the decision to either interrupt or continue anticoagulation therapy around CA procedure in adults with arrhythmia on outcomes of thromboembolic events, major and minor bleeding, all-cause mortality, asymptomatic thromboembolic events, and a composite endpoint of thromboembolic events (stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality). Most studies in the review adopted a minimal interruption strategy which has the advantage of reducing the risk of bleeding while maintaining a lower level of anticoagulation to prevent periprocedural thromboembolism, hence low event rates on the primary outcomes of thromboembolism and bleeding. The one study that adopted a complete interruption of VKA showed that uninterrupted VKA reduces the risk of thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding. Hence, future trials with larger samples, tailored to a more generalisable population and using homogeneous periprocedural anticoagulant therapy and ablation source are required to address the safety and efficacy of the optimal management of anticoagulant therapy prior to ablation.

### Overtreatment and undertreatment with anticoagulation in relation to cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (the RHYTHM-AF study) [^112xEd2J]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is central to the management of atrial fibrillation. This analysis from the RHYTHM-atrial fibrillation (RHYTHM-AF) registry explored the appropriateness of antithrombotic therapy in relation to stroke risk and atrial fibrillation duration in patients with atrial fibrillation. RHYTHM-AF, a prospective multinational registry, enrolled consecutive adult patients with atrial fibrillation considered for cardioversion. We compared the type of antithrombotic therapy administered at the time of cardioversion and at discharge with stroke risk ("high stroke risk" defined by CHA2DS2-VASc > 1) and duration of atrial fibrillation (≤ 48 vs > 48 hours or unknown duration). Of 2,972 patients who were cardioverted (34.5% through pharmacologic cardioversion [PCV] and 65.5% through electrical cardioversion [ECV]), 65% were at high risk of stroke and 30% presented with atrial fibrillation of > 48-hour or unknown duration. At the time of PCV and ECV, 36% (n = 242) and 84% (n = 1,075) of high-risk patients, respectively, were taking vitamin K antagonists or heparin. At discharge, these rates increased to 62% (n = 414) and 93% (n = 1,191), respectively. Of all low-stroke risk patients with short-duration atrial fibrillation undergoing PCV (n = 260) and ECV (n = 111), 7% (n = 17) and 30% (n = 33), respectively, were taking vitamin K antagonists or heparin at the time of cardioversion. At discharge, these rates increased to 19% (n = 50) and 40% (n = 44), respectively. In conclusion, ECV was frequently performed under appropriate antithrombotic therapy for most high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas PCV was frequently performed without appropriate antithrombotic therapy. To enhance pericardioversion stroke prevention, cardioversion algorithms should focus less on the type of conversion and more on stroke risk factors and atrial fibrillation duration.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — interruption of anticoagulation for procedures is addressed as follows: In patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is generally appropriate to substitute unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thromboembolism; in patients with AF without mechanical valves, anticoagulation may be interrupted for a period of up to 1 wk for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding without substituting heparin, with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin administered intravenously or subcutaneously in high-risk patients or when longer interruption is required. Low-molecular-weight heparins have pharmacological advantages including more predictable bioavailability (greater than 90% after subcutaneous injection).

### AFib treatment: general population [^116GYuow]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

When primary care physicians are presented with a patient with atrial fibrillation (AFib), there are two concerns. (online video available at: http://education.amjmed.com/video.php?event_id = 445&stage_id = 5&vcs = 1). One is the choice of strategy to treat the AFib, ie, whether to use rate control or a rhythm control strategy (to keep patients in sinus rhythm). The second concern is preventing the principal risk associated with AFib: stroke and systemic embolism. The focus of this review is stroke prevention, concentrating on risk assessment and traditional versus the new oral anticoagulation agents. For the past several decades, oral anticoagulation therapy has meant warfarin, which has the benefit of > 50 years of clinical experience: it is inexpensive, it has generic availability, and it has a wide range of clinical use indications beyond merely stroke prophylaxis in patients with AFib. On the other hand, only about half of the patients who should be receiving warfarin are prescribed it (and even fewer older patients are prescribed it), and only 30% of patients maintain time in therapeutic range (TTR) for serum warfarin levels at or above INR 2–3. According to a recent survey, almost a quarter of physicians employ rhythm control to treat AFib, and many of these believe that rhythm control decreases stroke and mortality risk sufficiently that anticoagulation therapy is not necessary. In addition, many physicians believe that when AFib is paroxysmal as opposed to permanent, then risk of stroke is low enough that long-term anticoagulation is not necessary. As discussed in this review, however, neither of these beliefs is true. Regarding bleeding risk, the same survey found that physicians perceive the risks of anticoagulation to be far greater than the benefits. Again, the evidence reveals that the patients at highest risk of bleeding are also at highest risk of stroke, and the benefits of preventing stroke with anticoagulation therapy almost always outweigh the risk of bleeding. This is discussed in the context of the new NOACs (discussed in the next review), including addressing what physicians should do if patients move from warfarin to one of the NOACs or vice versa. A final challenge for physicians treating patients with AFib has been the often mistaken belief that patients are at a low-risk status, and this review concludes with an overview of the use of the CHADS2 versus the CHA2DS2-VASc risk scoring systems, including why CHA2DS2-VASc provides a better assessment of which patients are or are not at low risk.

Discussion

Historically, paroxysmal AF has been pragmatically but arbitrarily defined as "attacks of arrhythmia lasting from 2 minutes to 7 days". However, more recent evidence suggests that this classification may not reflect the pathophysiologic process underlying AF or the complications associated with AF. Important changes in AF-related electrical and structural remodeling occur during periods as short as 24 hours, achieving a steady state as early as 48 hours after the onset of an AF episode. This parallels the clinical observation that the efficacy of acute pharmacologic conversion of AF decreases substantially after 24 to 48 continuous hours of AF. Likewise, the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism has been observed to increase substantially only among those with subclinical AF episodes of longer than 24 hours, leading some groups to propose more than 24 hours of continuous AF as a highly relevant threshold for oral anticoagulation initiation.,

The current study adds to this body of evidence by demonstrating that patients with AF episode durations longer than 24 hours had a significantly greater recurrence of AF after ablation and a significantly higher postablation AF burden compared with patients with shorter-duration AF. These observations are consistent with the idea that intervention early in the natural history of AF, before the onset of the progressive pathophysiologic and anatomic changes associated with the arrhythmia, may improve clinical outcomes.

Moreover, our findings reemphasize the arbitrary nature of the present classification of AF. While the current definitions of AF clearly have some meaning, they are not based on detailed analyses of pathophysiologic processes or on clinically relevant outcomes. In our study, we found no significant difference in arrhythmia outcomes in patients with AF episodes limited to 24 to 48 hours and 2 to 7 days compared with those lasting more than 7 days. Given the significantly better postablation outcomes among the subset of patients with AF episodes limited to less than 24 continuous hours, consideration should be given to 24 hours of continuous AF as a threshold for defining AF persistence.

Limitations

This study has limitations. It is a subanalysis of a prospective randomized clinical trial. Groups were defined based on the longest AF episode duration observed on continuous monitoring before ablation. While attempts were made to account for baseline differences, it is possible that residual confounders may have influenced the results. In addition, most patients were actively receiving antiarrhythmic drugs during the preablation monitoring period, which may have influenced episode duration. Furthermore, while the relative differences in postablation AF burden were significant, the differences in absolute postablation AF burden were small. As such, the clinical effect is uncertain given that most cases had a low burden of AF after ablation.

### Improving outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation: rationale and design of the early treatment of atrial fibrillation for stroke prevention trial [^1156uM1d]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Even on optimal therapy including anticoagulation and rate control, major cardiovascular complications (stroke, cardiovascular death, and acute heart failure) are common in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Conceptually, maintenance of sinus rhythm could prevent adverse outcomes related to AF. Rhythm control therapy has been only moderately effective in published trials, and its potential benefit was offset by side effects of repeated interventions.

Rationale

Rhythm control therapy applied early after the first diagnosis of AF could preserve atrial structure and function and maintain sinus rhythm more effectively than the current practice of delayed rhythm control (when symptoms persist after otherwise effective rate control). Furthermore, catheter ablation and new antiarrhythmic drugs have enhanced the potential effectiveness and safety of rhythm control therapy. The EAST will test whether an early, modern rhythm control therapy can reduce cardiovascular complications in AF.

Design

The EAST (Early treatment of Atrial fibrillation for Stroke prevention Trial) will randomize approximately 3,000 patients with recent onset AF at risk for stroke (CHA₂DS₂VASc score ≥ 2) to either guideline-mandated usual care or to usual care plus early rhythm control therapy in a prospective, randomized, open, blinded outcome assessment trial. All patients will be followed up until the end of the trial for the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, worsening of heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Nights spent in hospital will be counted as a coprimary outcome. Usual care will consist of anticoagulation, therapy of underlying heart disease, and rate control as an initial approach. Early rhythm control therapy will consist of usual care plus rhythm control therapy by antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and a patient-operated electrocardiographic device to monitor the ongoing rhythm. Key secondary outcomes include cognitive function and quality of life.

Conclusion

EAST will determine whether rhythm control therapy, when applied early after the initial diagnosis of AF, can prevent cardiovascular complications associated with AF.

Atrial fibrillation — classification framework: The previous classification of AF was based only on arrhythmia duration and tended to emphasize AF once diagnosed with a focus on therapeutic interventions, whereas a new proposed classification using stages recognizes AF as a progressive disease requiring different strategies at different stages from prevention to screening to rate and rhythm control therapies. The stages highlight addressing AF at the earliest stages, especially emphasizing prevention, risk factor management, and timing for screening in those at highest risk, and the stages are not mutually exclusive. AF is described as the most common arrhythmia in the world and accounting for significant morbidity and mortality.

### Safety and efficacy of dual vs. triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation following percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1131NPHj]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major global health problem affecting 33.5 million individuals worldwide. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is the mainstay for prevention of thrombo-embolic events in this population. Approximately 5–10% of these patients also undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). This overlap poses significant challenges since prior data from randomized trials have shown superiority of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor over aspirin and VKA for prevention of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients post-PCI. Consequently, most patients with AF following PCI are subjected to treatment with a combination of both these therapies (DAPT plus OAC), the so-called 'triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT)' approach.

While this approach is reasonable and endorsed by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines, as well as expert consensusfor varying durations, the evidence supporting the same is sparse. A major limitation of TAT is bleeding. One proposed approach is to curtail the TAT to a minimum duration with a goal to reduce bleeding events. However, this strategy has been challenged by data from the What is the Optimal AntiplatElet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary StenTing (WOEST) as well as Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen: Testing of a Six-Week vs. a Six-Month Clopidogrel Treatment Regimen In Patients With Concomitant Aspirin and OraL Anticoagulant Therapy Following Drug-Eluting Stenting (ISAR-TRIPLE) trials which demonstrated that many of the bleeding events occur in the first few weeks after the initiation of TAT.

Post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) anticoagulation when oral therapy is not feasible and management of bleeding — for patients unable to tolerate or take oral medications for a prolonged period post-PCI, the use of a parenteral anticoagulant (AC), such as unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), can be considered within 24 hours of PCI (for those at low bleeding risk) or within 48 to 72 hours of PCI (for those at high bleeding risk), and alternatively, crushed tablets can be considered; for patients who develop major bleeding, appropriate measures should be initiated to control bleeding, and in certain situations, it may be necessary to use appropriate reversal agents to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient.

### Device-detected atrial fibrillation and risk for stroke: an analysis of > 10, 000 patients from the SOS AF project (stroke preventiOn strategies based on atrial fibrillation information from implanted devices) [^111JjM7w]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF)-associated ischaemic stroke can be devastating and a major contributor to healthcare spending. Fortunately, it is largely preventable by anticoagulant therapy. Current guidelines recommend risk-based use of anticoagulant therapy in patients with AF. Such guidelines apply to patients with paroxysmal as well as persistent AF. However, among patients with paroxysmal AF, the frequency and length of episodes of AF are highly variable. Further, many episodes of AF are clinically 'silent', being detected incidentally through routine physical examinations, pre-operative assessments, diagnostic logs of implanted devices, or population surveys. Current guidelines do not specifically address anticoagulation use in cases of 'silent' AF. Indeed, in some cases, asymptomatic AF is revealed only after complications such as ischaemic stroke or congestive heart failure have occurred.

The relationship between the duration and frequency of AF and stroke risk is uncertain and an area of active investigation. Moreover, the definition of a clinically useful measure that accurately reflects an individual risk from an intermittent and progressive disease is a challenge. – Modern implanted devices such as defibrillators, pacemakers, or implantable loop recorders now allow precise, continuous long-term monitoring of heart rhythms, such as AF. Implanted devices with an atrial lead can measure the total time spent in AF each day, i.e. the daily atrial tachycardia/AF burden or 'daily AF burden'.

We pooled data from three studies of patients with a broad spectrum of such devices to assess the association between the maximum daily AF burden and the risk of ischaemic stroke in order to provide a large patient population to be evaluated for this scope.

Most randomized trials "mandated oral anticoagulation for a minimum of 2 months after ablation to reduce the risk of stroke, regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc score". "Greater burden or time in AF is associated with higher rates of stroke", and observational data include a Danish analysis of "4 050 patients" with CHA2DS2-VASc " ≥ 2" showing comparable stroke risk in those who did "(0.93/100 patient years)" versus did not "(0.97/100 patient years)" discontinue anticoagulation " > 3 months after ablation".

### Lessons from the stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation trials [^1111b4jE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation predisposes to left atrial thrombus formation and carries a sixfold increased risk for stroke. Antithrombotic therapies are the mainstay for stroke prevention. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-sponsored Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) studies assessed the value of warfarin, aspirin, and their combination for preventing stroke in six multicenter trials involving 3950 participants. This review presents the major results and implications, which offer unique perspectives on antithrombotic therapies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Warfarin and aspirin reduce stroke. Anticoagulation substantially benefits high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, while many younger patients with atrial fibrillation have a low stroke rate when given aspirin. Pathogenetic and transesophageal echocardiographic correlations shed light on mechanisms by which antithrombotic agents prevent stroke. Warfarin inhibits formation of atrial appendage thrombi and markedly reduces cardioembolic strokes, while aspirin primarily prevents smaller, noncardioembolic strokes. The SPAF III stroke risk stratification scheme has been validated for identifying patients with high versus moderate versus low risk for stroke. Women with atrial fibrillation benefit from anticoagulation significantly more than men do. Many elderly patients with recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation have high rates of stroke. Antithrombotic prophylaxis should be individualized on the basis of the estimated risk for stroke during aspirin therapy and the risk for bleeding during anticoagulation. Overall, nearly one third of patients with atrial fibrillation are low risk and should be treated with aspirin, and about one third are high risk and should receive warfarin if it can be given safely. For patients at moderate risk for stroke, patient preferences and access to reliable anticoagulation monitoring are particularly relevant.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: how much atrial fibrillation is enough to cause a stroke? [^113isjr2]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The association between atrial fibrillation and stroke is firmly established, and anticoagulation reduces stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the role of anticoagulation in very brief durations of atrial fibrillation (subclinical atrial fibrillation) is an area of controversy.

Recent Findings

Stroke risk increases alongside burden of atrial fibrillation. Ongoing trials will clarify if 24h or less of atrial fibrillation on extended monitoring necessitates lifelong anticoagulation. Trials examining empiric anticoagulation for individuals with ESUS did not demonstrate benefit over antiplatelet agents. However, hypothesis-generating sub-analyses suggest that certain at-risk groups may benefit. Atrial cardiopathy is associated with subclinical atrial fibrillation and research examining anticoagulation after ESUS in this population is underway.

Summary

Stroke risk increases alongside burden of ectopic atrial activity. However, this risk may in part be because of prothrombotic dysfunction associated with atrial cardiopathy in addition to the arrhythmia itself. The minimal amount of subclinical atrial fibrillation to warrant anticoagulation for stroke prevention, and how this may be modified by the total duration of monitoring, will be clarified by the results of ongoing clinical trials. Currently research will also help identify whether a select group of ESUS patients who have structural and electrophysiological markers of atrial cardiopathy warrant anticoagulation for secondary prevention.

### Use of oral anticoagulation in a real-world population with device detected atrial fibrillation [^111nTirW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US guidelines strongly support the use of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors, without regard of AF duration or burden. 1 Device‐detected AF of various durations, often referred to as subclinical AF, has been shown to be associated with increased stroke risk, though at a rate less than that of clinically detected AF. 2, 3, 4 Anticoagulation recommendations for clinical AF are based on studies of stroke risk in the clinical AF population. 1 While patients may have both clinical and subclinical AF, the increasing use of implantable and consumer‐grade technologies capable of detecting AF will likely increase the latter population significantly. There is, however, considerable clinical equipoise about the management of these episodes of subclinical AF, particularly those that are paroxysmal and of short duration. Even the 2019 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines noted that it is not yet clear what the optimal management strategy is in these patients with regards to anticoagulation. 1 There are trials currently being conducted to answer this question, but in the meantime, clinicians are presented with such clinical scenarios daily. 5, 6

A recent statement from the American Heart Association noted the considerable evidence gap in answering this clinical question. 7 Given the uncertainty of anticoagulation management in device‐detected AF and the absence of randomized trial results for guidance, it is of interest to determine the practice patterns of anticoagulation use in patients with device‐detected AF among US physicians.

### Novel anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: a primer for the primary physician [^112FgEox]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. The prevalence increases with age. A devastating complication of atrial fibrillation is cardioembolic stroke with central nervous system sequelae. Based on stroke risk scores (CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc) and bleeding risk (HAS-BLED), the optimal use of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation is feasible. Warfarin is a proven medication for this specific indication but requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustments, and it has multiple food, drug, and disease-state interactions. In addition, management of anticoagulation during the perioperative period may be challenging. In this regard, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have shown promise in the shift toward the "ideal" anticoagulant therapy, in that fixed dosing is the norm, drug interactions are few, food interactions are absent, onset is fairly immediate and offset predictable, and, in the majority of patients, therapeutic monitoring is not required. This article provides a review of recent published trials of the use of NOACs in atrial fibrillation. Practical points on indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, interactions, and perioperative management tips are discussed with a view toward the safe and effective use of these new medications. When patients are transitioned between different anticoagulant medications, the risks of thrombosis and bleeding need to be considered. When switching from warfarin to a NOAC, the NOAC can be started once the international normalized ratio is ≤ 2.0.

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

- age greater than or equal to 80 years

- body weight less than or equal to 60 kg

- serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

- In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.

- In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Missed Dose

If a dose of apixaban tablets is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

2.3 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

Apixaban tablets should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Apixaban tablets should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping apixaban tablets and prior to the intervention is not generally required. Apixaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

Atrial high-rate episodes (AHRE) detected by cardiovascular implantable electronic devices — risk characterization and clinical considerations: AHREs are associated with a stroke risk lower than that of clinical atrial fibrillation (AF) and vary by episode duration and CHA2DS2-VASc score; clinician confirmation of the duration and nature of the longest episode is recommended. Episodes lasting ≥ 24 hours are associated with a significant risk of stroke or systemic embolism that may be reduced with oral anticoagulation, whereas short episodes defined as < 5 minutes are not associated with clinical events; patients with intermediate-duration episodes and elevated stroke risk may benefit from oral anticoagulation. There is an interaction between AHRE duration and CHA2DS2-VASc score that may be used to guide oral anticoagulation candidacy, and the threshold for anticoagulation is higher in device-detected AF; the risk of stroke may be lower than in clinical AF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Prevention of thromboembolism during cardioversion in atrial fibrillation — For atrial fibrillation (AF) of 48-h duration or longer or unknown duration, anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion. For AF of more than 48-h duration with hemodynamic instability requiring immediate cardioversion, heparin should be administered concurrently by an initial intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2 times the reference control value; thereafter, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) should be provided for at least 4 wk, and limited data support subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in this indication. For AF of less than 48-h duration associated with hemodynamic instability, cardioversion should be performed immediately without delay for prior initiation of anticoagulation. During the first 48 h after onset of AF, the need for anticoagulation before and after cardioversion may be based on the patient's risk of thromboembolism. As an alternative to preprocedural anticoagulation, it is reasonable to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to search for thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA); if no thrombus is identified, cardioversion is reasonable immediately after unfractionated heparin with activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2 times the control value until a vitamin K antagonist achieves an INR equal to or greater than 2.0, followed by oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) for at least 4 wk. For patients with thrombus identified by TEE, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is reasonable for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after restoration of sinus rhythm.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^115CksCs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We will include studies comparing early versus late initiation of oral anticoagulation for people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related ischaemic stroke. Different types of anticoagulant agents used could contribute to heterogeneity. For example, warfarin typically takes two to four days to reach therapeutic INR levels, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation can be achieved as early as the first day of initiating NOAC therapy. So we will report studies using VKAs and NOACs separately.

We will include all oral anticoagulants recommended for stroke prevention in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related strokes, which can be categorised into:

VKAs (warfarin)
NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, betrixaban, rivaroxaban)

The definitions of early and late initiation of anticoagulants vary, and there are no evidence‐based recommendations regarding the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation after acute ischaemic stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation. We will utilise the following definitions in our primary analysis.

Early anticoagulation: initiation of anticoagulation within four days after stroke onset
Late anticoagulation: initiation of anticoagulation exceeding four days after stroke onset.

We selected this cut‐off time as it is most commonly used in the literature that we are aware of. We will analyse studies using a cut‐off time other than four days separately and provide a narrative summary of findings.

Participants in both groups should receive anticoagulant and stroke care according to local standards. There will be no restriction on dose, frequency, duration of intervention, or geographical location of the intervention in the main analyses.

Our comparators will be as follows.

Early initiation of VKAs (within four days after stroke onset) versus late initiation of VKAs (exceeding four days after stroke onset).
Early initiation of NOACs (within four days after stroke onset) versus late initiation of NOACs (exceeding four days after stroke onset).

Outcome measures

Outcome measures will include all those used in the relevant trials. We will report whether studies follow an intention‐to‐treat design and include the longest available follow‐up data. Reporting one or more of the outcomes listed below will not be an inclusion criterion in the review. In cases where none of these outcomes are reported, we will contact the authors to ascertain whether the outcomes were measured but not reported. Clinical event outcomes will be defined according to the definition set out by the individual trials.

We will present the outcomes at the following time points after randomisation if data are available.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease with prior antiplatelet therapy (APT) and new atrial fibrillation — among patients appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) and currently receiving APT, the pathway separates three categories. For prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from the perspective of hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days following an acute event, and an OAC can typically be initiated immediately when TIA is the diagnosis without infarct or hemorrhage on imaging. For recent carotid endarterectomy, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from risk of post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an OAC (DOAC preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after carotid stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped.

As the choices for oral anticoagulants increase, with many oral anticoagulant drugs currently in the pipeline awaiting completion of clinical trials, the guidelines for venous thromboembolism prevention, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and treatment of acute arterial and venous thrombi will also shift from the current standards to new standards set by these clinical trials for optimal dosing and duration of treatment. However, it must be reinforced that these new oral anticoagulants are distinct pharmacological compounds with specific targets and will also have distinct clinical indications for use.

Atrial fibrillation — elective cardioversion with AF of greater than 48 h or unknown duration: For patients with AF of greater than 48 h or unknown duration undergoing elective electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation (adjusted-dose VKA therapy, target INR range 2.0–3.0, low-molecular-weight heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses, or dabigatran) for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion rather than no anticoagulation (Grade 1B). We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B). Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Dilemmas in secondary stroke prevention [^117Qip22]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention encompasses many approaches, including antithrombotic therapy, risk factor management, and a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations are typically based on the results of randomized clinical trials that provide evidence of benefit. However, in some situations, clinicians extrapolate the results of clinical trials into everyday practice, or trials have not provided sufficient information to make treatment decisions. This review will discuss 4 scenarios: dual-antiplatelet therapy, the perils of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulation, indications for statin therapy, and therapeutic considerations for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### Early versus delayed non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant therapy after acute ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation (TIMING): a registry-based randomized controlled noninferiority study [^112ZKFqu]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

The sample size calculation in TIMING was based on findings from the observational Pre-TIMING study. The proportion of events of the primary composite variable at 90 days was assumed to be 12% in both treatment regimens. The absolute noninferiority margin was set to 3%. The selection of noninferiority margin was based on magnitudes of commonly observed and clinically meaningful relative and absolute risk reductions in a wide range of secondary stroke preventive trials. On the basis of these assumptions, a sample size of 1451 patients per group was considered to be sufficient to test the primary hypothesis (noninferiority) with a power of 80% using a significance level of 5%. Although there is no loss to follow-up in the National Board of Health registers, we conservatively set the sample size to 3000 patients.

The primary outcome analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, consisting of all randomized patients, and in the per-protocol population, which excluded those deviating from inclusion criteria or who did not start NOAC treatment according to the assigned study group (Figure 1). Safety analyses were performed in the safety population, that is, all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of NOAC during the first 14 days after randomization.

### Individualized approaches to thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation [^117Si81W]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The prevalence of AF in persons older than 55 years is at least 33.5 million globally and is predicted to more than double in the next half-century. Anticoagulation, heart rate control, and heart rhythm control comprise the 3 main treatment strategies in AF. Anticoagulation is aimed at preventing debilitating stroke, systemic embolism, and associated mortality. Historically, anticoagulation in AF was achieved with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, which is supported by evidence demonstrating reduced incident stroke and all-cause mortality. However, warfarin has unpredictable pharmacokinetics with many drug-drug interactions that require regular monitoring to ensure patients remain in the therapeutic anticoagulant range. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban provide a possible solution to these issues with their more predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, and greater specificity. Results from large randomized, controlled trials indicate that these agents are at least noninferior to warfarin in prevention of stroke. These trials also demonstrate a consistently lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, almost always all life-threatening bleeds, and many forms of major bleeds with the possible exception of gastrointestinal and some other forms of mucosal bleeding, compared with warfarin. Patients with AF are a heterogeneous population with diverse risk of stroke and bleeding, and different subgroups respond differently to anticoagulation. Important clinical questions have arisen regarding optimal anticoagulation drug selection in distinct populations such as those with renal impairment, older age, coronary artery disease, and heart failure as well as those at particularly high risk for bleeding or thromboembolism. In this review, treatment strategies in AF management are discussed in the context of different individual subgroups of patients.

### Atrial high-rate episode duration thresholds and thromboembolic risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114bDNPB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The meta‐regression graphically suggested a linear association between AHRE threshold and stroke risk, although the statistical result was not significant. Although this result may be limited by the potential overlap of the various duration thresholds, it suggests a potential dose‐dependent relation between AHRE duration and thromboembolic risk and generates the hypothesis that AHRE may need to be considered as a continuous variable.

Traditionally, when it comes to treatment decisions on stroke prevention, AF is considered in a binary manner (ie, present or absent), without taking into consideration the burden of AF. In specific, the pattern of AF (ie, paroxysmal or permanent) is not taken into consideration to guide decisions about antithrombotic treatment, as it is believed that it does not add significantly to the assessment of risk based on patient characteristics (ie, the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score). Despite the evidence that AHRE of short duration increases the thromboembolic risk, it is still unclear whether this risk is high enough to allow for a potential beneficial effect of oral anticoagulation that would exceed the associated bleeding risk. Although in some of the included studies patients were treated with anticoagulants, there is still no evidence to prove the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF, and this is investigated in the ongoing (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients With Device‐Detected Sub‐Clinical Atrial Fibrillation) and NOAH‐AFNET (the Non–vitamin K antagonist Oral anticoagulants in patients with Atrial High rate episodes‐Atrial Fibrillation NETwork) trials. Currently, the assessment of the thromboembolic risk in patients with subclinical AF is based on the individualized thromboembolic risk (ie, the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score), and anticoagulation may only be considered in specific patients with longer AHREs (≥ 24 hours). The initiation of anticoagulation after a cumulative AF > 24 hours was recently associated with reduced stroke risk, although this was only significant when AF lasted at least 6 minutes. Also, we are dealing with a heterogeneous and dynamic arrhythmia, and what is 30‐seconds duration at one monitoring period may be 30 hours at the next monitoring period.
