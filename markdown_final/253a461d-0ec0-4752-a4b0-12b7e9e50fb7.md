## Question

Nadolol to treat toxic epidermal necrolysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of nadolol to treat toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about nadolol's approved indications and pharmacology to see if there is any plausible mechanism for TEN. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and evidence-based management of TEN. Next, I will review high-level evidence and guidelines to check for any mention of nadolol. After that, I need to assess potential risks of beta-blockade in critically ill TEN patients. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and double-check for any counterexamples or off-label reports before concluding [^113ee1iV] [^113p6EgY] [^114zR6cL].

> Let me first confirm nadolol's scope. Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist approved for hypertension and angina; there is no indication or mention of SJS/TEN treatment or any immunomodulatory effect in the FDA labeling, and the safety sections list dermatologic adverse events such as rash without implying therapeutic use in immune-mediated epidermal necrolysis; I should double-check the different SPL entries to be sure I'm not missing an obscure note, but I don't see TEN anywhere in labeled or off-label sections [^113ee1iV] [^112H9g46] [^111ZtJMa] [^117CDAc7].

> Next, I should review TEN biology to see if there's any mechanistic bridge to beta-blockade. TEN is typically a severe drug-induced, T-cell–mediated cytotoxic process with keratinocyte death via Fas/FasL, perforin/granzyme, TNF-α–related pathways, and necroptosis, producing widespread epidermal detachment and high mortality that scales with SCORTEN; importantly, the dominant targets are immune and cell-death pathways rather than adrenergic signaling, which makes me doubt any role for nadolol here [^114zR6cL] [^116TWZH2]. Let me verify the TNF-α/HMGB1 axis as a contemporary mechanistic thread; ex vivo and in vitro work shows TNF-α can drive keratinocyte injury and HMGB1 release, with partial attenuation by TNF-α blockade, reinforcing that cytokine modulation — not beta-blockade — is relevant to pathogenesis and potential therapy [^114Y6cgi] [^1121KwSe].

> Now, I will examine the evidence base for TEN treatment and see if nadolol appears anywhere. Hold on, let me verify the Cochrane synthesis and network meta-analyses: across RCTs and prospective comparative studies, supportive care in specialized burn/ICU settings is foundational, and among systemic options, no therapy consistently outperforms supportive care for crude mortality, though corticosteroid plus IVIG combinations show a standardized mortality ratio benefit in some analyses, with cyclosporine and etanercept considered promising; thalidomide increases mortality and should be avoided [^113p6EgY] [^117VpnJL] [^112FHi7V]. Wait, I should not jump to conclusions about etanercept's classification — some texts call it a monoclonal antibody, but I need to correct myself: etanercept is a soluble TNF receptor fusion protein, and while case series and mechanistic data suggest benefit, high-quality randomized evidence remains limited, so it is not definitive standard of care everywhere yet [^11564cAA] [^114Y6cgi] [^113d9aJP]. I should also confirm practical recommendations from guidelines emphasizing early drug withdrawal, transfer to experienced centers, and meticulous supportive care, none of which mention nadolol as a therapeutic option [^111uX21e] [^11332XwY].

> I will now examine whether nadolol has any plausible mechanistic rationale in TEN. Let me think this through: nadolol blocks β1 and β2 receptors, reducing heart rate and contractility and modulating adrenergic tone, but it does not target cytotoxic T-cell activity, Fas/FasL signaling, TNF-α, granulysin, or necroptotic pathways central to TEN; there is no signal for anti-inflammatory or anti-apoptotic activity relevant to epidermal necrolysis in its pharmacology or labeling, so the pathophysiologic bridge is essentially absent [^113ee1iV] [^116TWZH2] [^114zR6cL].

> Next, I should review potential risks of nadolol in the acute TEN setting. TEN patients are often hemodynamically labile with fluid shifts, mucosal involvement, and a high risk for infection and procedures; beta-blockade can blunt compensatory tachycardia, precipitate or worsen hypotension, exacerbate bronchospasm in susceptible patients, worsen peripheral perfusion, and complicate peri-anesthetic management — risks that are particularly undesirable in a critical-care burn-unit context; I need to ensure I'm citing the specific warnings on bronchospasm, heart failure, and perioperative considerations, which are present in the SPL [^112hBSAh] [^112H9g46] [^116s3Qqo]. Hold on, I should verify if there is any scenario where nadolol would be helpful symptomatically — masking tachycardia from pain or sepsis is not therapeutic and could delay recognition of deterioration, which supports avoidance here [^112hBSAh].

> But wait, what if someone argues that beta-blockers have roles in dermatologic conditions like infantile hemangioma; could this be extrapolated to TEN? I should double-check that this is not a false analogy: the efficacy of nadolol in hemangioma relates to vasoconstriction, anti-angiogenic effects, and apoptosis within proliferating vascular tissue — mechanisms orthogonal to the immune cytotoxic keratinocyte death that defines TEN — so this does not support use in epidermal necrolysis, and extrapolation would be inappropriate [^111JUgGo] [^114zR6cL]. Let me also confirm again across Cochrane and major reviews: there is no mention of nadolol as a TEN therapy, which reinforces that there is neither evidentiary support nor a mechanistic rationale for its use in this indication [^113p6EgY] [^114zR6cL].

> I should double-check for any contrary reports or case series before finalizing. I have scanned the labeling documents for nadolol and the systematic reviews and guidelines on SJS/TEN, and there are zero signals for nadolol as therapy; conversely, the literature consistently emphasizes immediate withdrawal of the culprit drug, specialized supportive care, and consideration of immunomodulation with agents like corticosteroids plus IVIG, cyclosporine, or TNF-α pathway blockade in selected patients, none of which intersects with beta-blocker pharmacology [^113ee1iV] [^113p6EgY] [^117VpnJL] [^111uX21e].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Nadolol has no role in the treatment of TEN and should not be used for this indication; there is no supportive clinical evidence or mechanistic plausibility, and the hemodynamic and respiratory risks of nonselective beta-blockade may be harmful in critically ill TEN patients; management should adhere to established protocols — immediate cessation of the offending agent, transfer to a burn/ICU center for specialized supportive care, and consideration of systemic immunomodulation where appropriate, with avoidance of agents known to increase mortality such as thalidomide; I need to emphasize again that multiple high-level sources and the FDA labeling do not support nadolol here [^113p6EgY] [^114zR6cL] [^117VpnJL] [^112FHi7V] [^113ee1iV].

---

No, nadolol is **not indicated** for toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and there is **no evidence of benefit** [^113d9aJP]. TEN management centers on **supportive care** [^114zR6cL] and immunomodulatory therapies such as corticosteroids, IVIG, cyclosporine, or etanercept [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol, a non-selective beta-blocker used for cardiovascular indications, is not recommended for TEN [^113ee1iV]. Its use may cause bradycardia, hypotension, or bronchospasm, which can complicate the management of TEN [^112hBSAh]. There are **no clinical trials or guidelines** supporting nadolol for TEN, and it should not be used for this indication [^111uX21e].

---

## Pharmacological properties of nadolol

Nadolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist that blocks beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, thereby reducing heart rate, myocardial contractility, and blood pressure [^113ee1iV]. It is primarily used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, angina pectoris, and arrhythmias. Nadolol is **not indicated for dermatological conditions**, including TEN [^113ee1iV].

---

## Pathophysiology of toxic epidermal necrolysis

TEN is a **severe immune-mediated reaction** characterized by widespread keratinocyte apoptosis and epidermal detachment [^116TWZH2]. The pathogenesis involves cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells releasing mediators such as Fas ligand, perforin, granzyme, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and granulysin [^114Y6cgi]. These mediators induce extensive epidermal necrosis, leading to widespread skin and mucosal damage.

---

## Current standard treatments for TEN

The management of TEN primarily involves **supportive care**, including [^111uX21e]:

- **Immediate discontinuation** of the causative drug.
- **Supportive care** in specialized burn or intensive care units [^116TWZH2].
- **Fluid and electrolyte management**.
- **Wound care** and infection prevention [^115zNdGq].
- **Pain management**.

Pharmacological interventions commonly used include [^113p6EgY]:

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation and immune response.
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: To neutralize circulating antibodies and immune complexes [^117VpnJL].
- **Cyclosporine**: An immunosuppressant that inhibits T-cell activation [^113d9aJP].
- **Etanercept**: A TNF-alpha inhibitor that reduces inflammation and keratinocyte apoptosis [^11564cAA].

These treatments aim to halt disease progression, **reduce mortality**, and promote re-epithelialization [^114zR6cL].

---

## Evidence regarding nadolol in TEN

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals **no evidence supporting the use of nadolol** in the treatment of TEN. Nadolol's pharmacological profile does not align with TEN's immune-mediated mechanisms and lacks immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory properties relevant to management. Furthermore, no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines recommend nadolol for TEN [^111uX21e]. The absence of evidence and lack of mechanistic rationale indicate that nadolol is **not an appropriate treatment** for TEN.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of nadolol in TEN patients

Nadolol administration in TEN patients may pose significant risks, including:

- **Bradycardia and hypotension**: Nadolol can cause significant cardiovascular depression, which may complicate the management of critically ill TEN patients [^112H9g46] [^117CDAc7].
- **Bronchospasm**: As a non-selective beta-blocker, nadolol can induce bronchospasm, particularly in patients with underlying respiratory conditions [^112hBSAh].
- **Masking of hypoglycemia**: Nadolol can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, complicating metabolic management in critically ill patients.
- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Nadolol may exacerbate psoriasis, a dermatological condition, raising concerns about its use in patients with severe skin reactions [^112hBSAh].

Given these risks, nadolol is **not recommended** for TEN.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **do not support the use of nadolol** in TEN management [^111uX21e]. The recommended pharmacological interventions include systemic corticosteroids, IVIG, cyclosporine, and etanercept [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol is not mentioned in guidelines or expert consensus statements on TEN.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, there is **no evidence supporting the use of nadolol** for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol's pharmacological properties do not align with TEN pathophysiology, and its use may pose significant risks to patients [^113ee1iV]. Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations do not endorse its use in TEN [^111uX21e]. Therefore, **nadolol should not be used** for TEN. Clinicians should adhere to established treatment protocols, including supportive care and immunomodulatory therapies such as systemic corticosteroids, IVIG, cyclosporine, and etanercept [^114zR6cL].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of nadolol PO (also known as Corgard):

- **Exacerbation of angina**: Use caution in vasospastic angina, as β-blockers without alpha1-blocking activity can cause unopposed coronary vasoconstriction, worsening symptoms.

- **Exacerbation of bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with bronchospastic diseases, as nadolol may impair bronchodilation by blocking beta2 receptors; its use is generally discouraged.

- **Exacerbation of HF**: Use caution in patients with compensated heart failure. Monitor closely for signs of decompensation, and discontinue gradually if heart failure develops.

- **Exacerbation of muscle weakness, double vision**: Use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Use caution in patients with psoriasis.

- **Exacerbation of Raynaud's phenomenon, peripheral vascular disease**: Use caution in patients with peripheral circulatory disorders, including Raynaud's disease or syndrome and peripheral occlusive vascular disease.

- **Hypertension**: Use extreme caution in patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Ensure adequate α-blockade is achieved before initiating nadolol to prevent a paradoxical increase in blood pressure.

- **Major surgery**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as β-blockers should not be routinely withdrawn before major surgery, but their effect on adrenergic response may increase anesthesia and surgical risks.

- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of β-blocker therapy to prevent symptom exacerbation or the precipitation of a thyroid storm.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and SJS/TEN overlap syndrome are rare and severe cutaneous adverse reactions usually triggered by medications. In addition to tertiary-level supportive care, various systemic therapies have been used, including glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), cyclosporin, N-acetylcysteine, thalidomide, infliximab, etanercept, and plasmapheresis. There is an unmet need to understand the efficacy of these interventions.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic therapies (medicines delivered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously) for the treatment of SJS, TEN, and SJS/TEN overlap syndrome.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to March 2021: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched five clinical trial registers, the reference lists of all included studies and key review articles, and a number of drug manufacturer websites. We searched for errata or retractions of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational comparative studies of participants of any age with a clinical diagnosis of SJS, TEN, or SJS/TEN overlap syndrome. We included all systemic therapies studied at the time of writing and permitted comparisons between each therapy, as well as between therapy and placebo.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as specified by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were SJS/TEN-specific mortality and adverse effects leading to discontinuation.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: diagnosis and management [^114zR6cL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the most severe cutaneous adverse reactions, typically drug-induced in adults, with high morbidity and mortality rates. These conditions present clinical challenges for physicians due to their rarity and rapid progression, which result in severe cutaneous, mucosal, and systemic manifestations. Although numerous cases of SJS/TEN have been documented in the literature, there remains a lack of consensus on diagnostic criteria and treatment.

Significant advancements have been made in understanding the genetic predisposition and pathogenesis of these conditions. This review aims to provide physicians with a comprehensive yet practical roadmap for diagnosing and managing SJS/TEN. We examine data on their pathogenesis, reported precipitating factors, presentation, diagnosis, and management, with a particular focus on developments over the last five years.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN): The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital wound management algorithm [^115zNdGq]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome (TEN) is a potentially catastrophic exfoliative muco-cutaneous disorder first described by Lyell in 1956. It represents the most extensive form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. TEN is defined varyingly around the globe, but in the United Kingdom, the consensus opinion describes the process as involving more than 30% of the total body surface area. It can rapidly become more extensive and threatens life. The estimated annual incidence is approximately 1–2 cases per million population. The risk of mortality increases with surface area involved, and meta-analysis of the literature shows this risk to be between 16% and 55%.

Over a six-month period, the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Burns Service treated five consecutive patients with more than 80% total body surface area involvement or a more than 80% mortality risk, using the severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN). All patients were treated according to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital wound management algorithm with excellent outcomes and no mortalities. The aim of this paper is to propose a generic TEN wound management algorithm according to the severity of skin lesions, using a simple wound grading system.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^114Y6cgi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a rare, immune‐mediated, cutaneous blistering condition, most often caused by drugs and characterized by widespread keratinocyte death and epidermal detachment. Although much is known about the immunopathogenesis of SJS/TEN, gaps in our knowledge of how cell death and epidermal detachment occur still exist.

Previous work demonstrated that epidermal expression of high‐mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is able to discriminate between severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (SJS/TEN) and maculopapular exanthema. HMGB1 is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein which, in its unacetylated form, acts as a marker of both sterile toxicity and, in its acetylated form, as a marker of innate immune response.

Etanercept is an antitumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) monoclonal antibody used for treating auto‐inflammatory conditions including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. A number of case studies have also suggested that it is an effective treatment for SJS/TEN and reduces mortality versus standard of care (high‐dose prednisolone). Despite reports of rapid re‐epithelialization in response to etanercept, there is currently limited understanding of the specific mechanism of action of etanercept in SJS/TEN treatment. Studies suggest that T‐cell derived TNF‐α contributes to keratinocyte cell death via Fas ligand. However, necroptosis is the key cell death mechanism responsible for the significant keratinocyte death seen in SJS/TEN, but its modulation by TNF‐α is yet to be established.

### Treating toxic epidermal necrolysis with systemic immunomodulating therapies: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117VpnJL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Various systemic immunomodulating therapies have been used to treat toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), but their efficacy remains unclear.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluating the effects of systemic immunomodulating therapies on mortality for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/TEN overlap and TEN.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in online databases (from inception to October 31, 2019). Outcomes were mortality rates and Score of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SCORTEN)-based standardized mortality ratio (SMR). A frequentist random-effects model was adopted.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven studies involving 2079 patients were included. An NMA of 10 treatments showed that none was superior to supportive care in reducing mortality rates and that thalidomide was associated with a significantly higher mortality rate (odds ratio, 11.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.42–95.96). For SMR, an NMA of 11 treatment arms showed that corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin combination therapy was the only treatment with significant survival benefits (SMR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31–0.93).

- **Limitations**: Heterogeneity and a paucity of eligible randomized controlled trials.

- **Conclusions**: Combination therapy with corticosteroids and IVIg may reduce mortality risks in patients with SJS/TEN overlap and TEN. Cyclosporine and etanercept are promising therapies, but more studies are required to provide clearer evidence.

### Etanercept therapy for toxic epidermal necrolysis [^11564cAA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe and potentially lethal drug reaction for which no standard treatment is available.

- **Objective**: To describe a case series of patients with TEN treated with a single dose of etanercept.

- **Methods**: We observed 10 consecutive patients with TEN. For each patient, we recorded the presence of comorbidities and all the drugs recently started (i.e. in the last month). In all cases, 50 mg of etanercept was administered in a single subcutaneous injection. The clinical severity of disease was computed using the SCORTEN (SCORe of Toxic Epidermal Necrosis) scale. Using the probabilities of death linked to each level of SCORTEN score, we calculated the expected probability of death in our patients. Healing was defined as complete reepithelialization, and a time to healing curve was then obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.

- **Results**: All patients promptly responded to treatment, reaching complete reepithelialization without complications or side effects. The median time to healing was 8.5 days.

- **Limitations**: This is a small, uncontrolled case series.

- **Conclusion**: These preliminary results suggest the possibility that tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an effective target for control of TEN, a dangerous skin condition for which no effective cure has yet been found.

### Diagnosis and management of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [^116TWZH2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a rare, immunologically mediated cutaneous adverse reaction characterized by mucous membrane and epidermal detachment, with a mortality ranging from 15% to 25%. Risk factors for the development of SJS/TEN include immune dysregulation, active malignancy, and genetic predisposition. Medications are the most common cause, particularly antimicrobials, antiepileptics, allopurinol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Drug-specific CD8 T-cells and natural killer cells are thought to be the major inducers of keratinocyte apoptosis via release of soluble cytotoxic mediators, including Fas ligand, perforin/granzyme, tumor necrosis factor, and granulysin.

When SJS/TEN is suspected clinically, appropriate therapy should be instituted without delay. All patients should be managed initially in an intensive care unit or burn unit under a multidisciplinary team of physicians experienced in the care of patients with SJS/TEN. Available data support the use of various pharmacologic agents to halt disease progression and improve outcomes, but no single drug has been found to be superior or beneficial for all patients. Future research should focus on developing a better understanding of the genetic susceptibility and immunopathophysiology of the disease, as well as novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.

### Antishear therapy for toxic epidermal necrolysis: An alternative treatment approach [^115GF9gR]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome is a devastating disease, with mortality rates ranging between 20% and 60%. This study evaluated an alternative treatment approach using antishear wound care and compared outcomes using the Severity of Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome (SCORTEN) system.

- **Methods**: Records of 48 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome treated with burn-equivalent critical care and antishear wound care from September 1985 to April 2004 were reviewed. Observed mortality data were compared with those expected using the SCORTEN, and the standardized mortality ratio was calculated.

- **Results**: The overall mortality rate was 27%. Factors affecting mortality included advancing age, time to burn unit admission, multisystem organ failure, and presence of comorbidities (p = 0.02, p = 0.02, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively). Chronic renal insufficiency and malignancy were two independent risk factors for non-survival (p = 0.04 and p = 0.004, respectively). Patients with a SCORTEN score of 2 or less had no mortality rate in this series. Observed and predicted mortality rates were comparable for patients with SCORTEN scores of 3 or greater. Patients with combined scores of 3 or less had a standardized mortality ratio score of 0.58 (42% mortality reduction). Overall, the standardized mortality ratio was 0.89 (11% mortality reduction).

- **Conclusions**: Transfer to a burn intensive care unit and initiation of critical care and wound protocols similar to those used for burn patients is crucial.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^115h3WKt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Decreased epidermal high‐mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression is an early marker of epidermal injury in Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Etanercept, an anti‐tumor necrosis factor therapeutic, is effective in the treatment of SJS/TEN. The objective was to characterize antitumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α)‐mediated HMGB1 keratinocyte/epidermal release and etanercept modulation. HMGB1 release from TNF‐α treated (± etanercept), or doxycycline‐inducible RIPK3 or Bak‐expressing human keratinocyte cells (HaCaTs) was determined by western blot/ELISA. Healthy skin explants were treated with TNF‐α or serum (1:10 dilution) from immune checkpoint inhibitor‐tolerant, lichenoid dermatitis, or SJS/TEN patients ± etanercept. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of HMGB1 was undertaken.

TNF‐α induced HMGB1 release in vitro via both necroptosis and apoptosis. Exposure of skin explants to TNF‐α or SJS/TEN serum resulted in significant epidermal toxicity/detachment with substantial HMGB1 release, which was attenuated by etanercept. Whole-slide image analysis of biopsies demonstrated significantly lower epidermal HMGB1 in pre‐blistered SJS/TEN versus control (P < 0.05). Keratinocyte HMGB1 release, predominantly caused by necroptosis, can be attenuated by etanercept. Although TNF‐α is a key mediator of epidermal HMGB1 release, other cytokines/cytotoxic proteins also contribute. Skin explant models represent a potential model of SJS/TEN that could be utilized for further mechanistic studies and targeted therapy screening.

### Cancidas [^116iA4YN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Warnings and precautions**: Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm, have been reported with the use of Cancidas. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with fatal outcomes, have also been reported. Discontinue Cancidas at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment. Cancidas can cause abnormalities in liver enzymes and isolated cases of hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure have been reported. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes for evidence of worsening hepatic function, and evaluate the risk/benefit of continuing Cancidas. Elevated liver enzymes may occur during concomitant use with Cyclosporine; limit the use of Cancidas to patients for whom the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) during concurrent use with Cancidas.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis: 10 years experience of a burns centre in Hong Kong [^11332XwY]. Burns (2001). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome is characterized by an extensive skin rash, accompanied by blisters and exfoliation, similar to major burns. Evidence suggests that toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome is most likely due to a cell-mediated immune response triggered by certain drugs. Recognition of the clinical situation, which is similar to a major burn, has resulted in a general agreement that these patients are best treated in a burns unit, where critical support and meticulous wound care can be provided by experienced personnel. This represents a major step forward in the management of this condition. The 10-year experience of managing seven patients with severe toxic epidermal necrolysis in a tertiary burns centre in Hong Kong is presented, and the controversies over classification and management of the disease are also discussed.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^115fZ9Ms]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

RIPK3 expression in the basal layer was not significantly higher in TNF‐α-treated explants compared to controls. However, there was a noticeable reduction in RIPK3 expression in explants (control and TNF‐α-treated) co-administered etanercept. No significant expression of cleaved caspase 3 was observed in any of the treatment groups.

- **Expression and supernatant release in healthy skin explants exposed to/patient serum**: Having established the effect of TNF‐α on epidermal toxicity and HMGB1 release, the ex vivo work was expanded to look at the effect of exposing healthy skin to sera from healthy control, lichenoid dermatitis, and SJS/TEN patients (acute phase). TNF‐α concentrations of the three sera were determined by ELISA as healthy control 2.92 pg/mL (0.29 pg/mL final concentration), lichenoid dermatitis 9.17 pg/mL (0.92 pg/mL final concentration), and SJS/TEN 12.25 pg/mL (1.22 pg/mL final concentration). As previously described, exposure of explants to ICI-induced SJS/TEN patient serum induced grade III pathology with intra-epidermal damage and necrosis in both duplicates. The addition of etanercept reduced the pathology to grade II in both instances. The addition of serum from a patient with ICI-induced lichenoid dermatitis resulted in grade II pathology in both replicates, with etanercept co-administration having little effect. Exposure to serum from an ICI-tolerant patient resulted in no significant difference in pathology (grade I) compared to media-only control.

This randomized, prospective study demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) ointment was effective in treating epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor-induced skin toxicities (ERSEs). EGF ointment showed a better effect at a higher dose. Topical EGF was also associated with a significant improvement in the quality of life (QoL). Further research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic use and the effect of combination therapy to obtain additional evidence regarding the use of EGF ointment for treating ERSEs.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening dermatological disease characterized by extensive destruction of the epidermis, and it is associated with a 25–60% mortality rate in adults. We presented one patient with TEN, with 86% skin slough, treated successfully using Aquacel Ag exclusively. All of the wounds were healed completely 8 days after the onset of TEN. Aquacel Ag is an efficient and cost-effective adjunct in the treatment of TEN.

### Treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a pediatric patient with a nanocrystalline silver dressing [^1165wT1L]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

This study reports a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) involving 90% body surface area, successfully treated with a nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat, Smith & Nephew, Largo, FL).

- **Methods**: A review of the hospital and acute wound center patient records, as well as the recent English medical literature regarding TEN and nanocrystalline silver dressing, was conducted.

- **Results**: Only one report of TEN treated with a nanocrystalline silver dressing was found. The dressing was both effective in preventing wound infection and convenient for treating the patient with TEN.

- **Conclusion**: The use of a nanocrystalline silver dressing should be considered for the treatment of TEN.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^116wadjf]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

We have shown that the exposure of healthy skin explants to both TNF‐α and serum from an SJS/TEN patient was able to evoke a skin phenotype akin to SJS/TEN in both morphology and HMGB1 expression. We have also demonstrated that etanercept was able to attenuate toxicity and, at least for TNF‐α, reverse HMGB1 cellular release in the epidermis. The lack of effect of etanercept in SJS/TEN serum‐treated explants is likely due to the multitude of other molecules present, which exert cytotoxic effects independently of TNF‐α. This aligns with the fact that the pathogenesis of SJS/TEN is multifaceted and complex. However, this physiologically relevant skin explant model has the potential to be used for assessing the pathogenic role and mechanism of other immune-derived cytotoxic mediators implicated in SJS/TEN, such as granulysin, perforin, granzyme B, and LL37.

Furthermore, by inducing an SJS/TEN‐like event in healthy skin explants with TNF‐α and inhibiting it with etanercept, we have devised a valid model system with the potential to be used for screening targeted therapies for potential treatment in SJS/TEN. The results presented here should be interpreted with caution. Given the small sample size, it is not possible to determine interindividual variability in response, both between skin donors and between serum samples. This will be the focus of future work.

To conclude, we have demonstrated that keratinocyte-derived HMGB1 release is a useful biomarker for keratinocyte injury in early SJS/TEN. The skin explant model described may be a useful tool to identify not only other proteins involved but also serves as a potential screening method for new therapies.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis in a child after carbamazepine dosage increment [^112rjk9s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening skin reaction frequently induced by drugs. The mucocutaneous reaction is characterized by bullous detachment of the epidermis and mucous membranes. We report a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a child receiving carbamazepine for 3 weeks; 60% of his body surface area was affected, with mucosal involvement of the oropharynx, eyes, gastrointestinal system, and genitalia. His skin signs appeared 1 day after the last dosage increment. He was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and appropriate infection and wound management. The key to a successful outcome includes early recognition, transfer to an intensive care center, prompt withdrawal of the causative agent, appropriate fluid resuscitation, and infection monitoring.

### Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions: who should treat, where and how? Facts and controversies [^113XjVgC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are uncommon but extremely serious and often life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions characterized by extensive epithelial sloughing and systemic symptoms. There is no effective evidence-based treatment for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) to drugs and no consensus on how to treat these patients. This contribution presents some of the controversies concerning the treatment of SCAR patients, including where and by whom, as well as the issue of the value of treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. Investigators agree that more studies are needed and that there are insufficient data to draw definite conclusions. The spectrum of disagreement is wide, and the debate is ongoing. At the end, the important question is, should we wait with our decisions until all these controversies are settled and we have more or full evidence? This question, as well as all others, is open for debate, evidently a "toxic" debate on toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Vectibix [^112RRiKC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Vectibix can cause dermatologic toxicity, which may be severe. Clinical manifestations include, but are not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritis, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.

Among 229 patients who received Vectibix as monotherapy, dermatologic toxicity occurred in 90%, with 15% experiencing Grade 3 toxicity. Among 585 patients who received Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX, dermatologic toxicity occurred in 96%, with occurrences of Grade 4 in 1% and Grade 3 in 32% of cases. In 126 patients receiving Vectibix in combination with sotorasib across clinical studies, dermatologic toxicities were observed in 94%, with 16% of patients experiencing Grade 3 toxicity.

Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications, including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease, presenting with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing, has also been observed. It remains unclear whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions are directly related to EGFR inhibition or idiosyncratic immune-related effects such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Vectibix should be withheld or discontinued if dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity is associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications.

### Amniotic membrane in the surgical management of acute toxic epidermal necrolysis [^1133L2mX]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

To report a new surgical technique to manage severe acute toxic epidermal necrolysis, two interventional case reports were conducted.

- **Participants**: Two patients were involved in the case reports. Case 1 detailed a 6-year-old boy who developed severe toxic epidermal necrolysis after treatment with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for chronic otitis media. His condition affected both eyes and eyelids. Bilateral lysis of symblepharon and all adhesions was performed, as well as bilateral amniotic membrane transplantation to the entire ocular surface except the cornea. Due to the loss of eyelid skin, amniotic membrane transplantation was applied to all four eyelids and at the eyelid margins. Case 2 involved an 8-year-old girl with severe toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with mycoplasma pneumonia. She suffered from bilateral, diffuse keratoconjunctivitis, corneal epithelial defects, and bilateral symblepharon. Bilateral amniotic membrane transplantation was performed, incorporating a symblepharon ring in the left eye.

- **Intervention**: Amniotic membrane transplantation was the intervention applied.

- **Main outcome measures**: The measures focused on the preservation of normal ocular and eyelid surfaces and the prevention of blindness.

- **Results**: In Case 1, thirty-six months post bilateral ocular surgery, there was no occurrence of symblepharon, with good ocular surface wetting and an uncorrected bilateral vision of 20/20. In Case 2, amniotic membrane transplantation successfully protected both ocular surfaces, preventing conjunctival contracture without adhesion of the eyelids to the ocular surface. The central vision was preserved, with minimal peripheral corneal vascularization and mild conjunctival scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Diagnosis and management [^1178kc4X]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

SJS/TEN has a reported incidence of 1–5 cases per 1,000,000 individuals annually and has a higher incidence in adults than in pediatric patients, likely due to increased exposure to potential triggers. However, because SJS shares International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes with erythema multiforme, incidence may be overestimated. Furthermore, 36–72% of patients initially diagnosed with SJS/TEN end up having their diagnosis reclassified into a different disease, also contributing to an overestimation of SJS/TEN incidence. The incidence of SJS/TEN also varies by country, partly due to (1) differences in genetic background and (2) differing prescribing patterns. For example, the Han Chinese have a high carrier rate of HLA-B✱15:02, an allele strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN. This association is one explanation for why carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has a higher incidence in Southeast Asia than in Europe. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) endemic locales, like several countries in Africa, often have higher rates of SJS/TEN owing to increased use of anti-HIV and anti-TB medications that are high risk for SJS/TEN.

Because it causes widespread detachment of skin and mucosal surfaces, SJS/TEN can cause severe complications, including superimposed infection, sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death. Reported mortality rates are as high as 34–50%.

### Interventions for toxic epidermal necrolysis [^112FHi7V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare condition characterized by skin loss induced by a drug reaction, resembling extensive burns. This condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and there is no clear consensus on effective treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of all interventions for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (March 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001), EMBASE (1980 to December 2001), DARE (4th Quarter 2001), and CINAHL (1982 to October 2001).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of therapeutic and supportive interventions that included participants clinically diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent reviewers conducted study selection and assessed methodological quality.

- **Main results**: Only one randomized controlled trial of treatment was identified. This trial compared the effectiveness of thalidomide with placebo and included 22 patients; 12 in the treatment group and 10 in the placebo group. Patients in the treatment arm received thalidomide 200 mg twice daily for 5 days. The main endpoint was the measurement of the progression of skin detachment after 7 days. Other endpoints were overall mortality and severity of the disease, evaluated with the simplified acute physiology score. The study was terminated as the mortality on the treatment arm was 83% compared to 30% on the control arm (relative risk 2.78, 95% confidence interval).

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis successfully treated with etanercept [^111c4qnn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare and severe adverse reaction to drugs, characterized by massive apoptosis and widespread epidermal and mucosal detachment. Although no gold standard therapy exists, human intravenous immunoglobulins have recently been described as an effective treatment for this disease. We report a case of phenobarbital-induced TEN in a 59-year-old white woman, where the epidermal detachment stopped 48 hours after beginning etanercept treatment, with complete healing after 20 days. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of TEN successfully treated with etanercept.

### The psychological impact of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis on patients' lives: A critically appraised topic [^11396uV6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe immune-mediated mucocutaneous reactions, often resulting from medications. Many medications have been identified as causes, including allopurinol, sulfonamide antibiotics, anticonvulsant agents, oxicam, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlormezanone, corticosteroids, and nevirapine. Some over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen, metamizole, and ibuprofen, have also been linked to the conditions. However, Roujeau et al. highlight that the link between medications like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and secretolytics in causing SJS and TEN may be due to protopathic bias. Infections such as HIV, herpes virus, and mycoplasma pneumonia can also be related to these conditions. Additionally, a rare genetic predisposition, specifically the genotype HLA-B✱1502, which occurs only in people of Chinese and Southeast Asian descent, is linked to these conditions when reacting with an environmental trigger, such as the absorption of carbamazepine.

SJS and TEN are characterized in their acute phases by a febrile illness followed by cutaneous erythema with blister formation, skin, and mucous membrane necrosis and detachment. Individuals become critically ill within a short period and require immediate medical attention. The U.K. guidelines and French national care protocols for managing SJS and TEN emphasize that if patients are not referred to a specialist area, such as an intensive care unit (ICU) or burns center, the mortality outcome for the patients is significantly affected.

Most adverse effects of nadolol have been mild and transient, rarely requiring withdrawal of therapy.

- **Cardiovascular**: Bradycardia characterized by heart rates of less than 60 beats per minute occurs commonly. Heart rates below 40 beats per minute and/or symptomatic bradycardia were observed in about 2 of 100 patients. Symptoms of peripheral vascular insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type, occurred in approximately 2 of 100 patients. Cardiac failure, hypotension, and rhythm/conduction disturbances have each occurred in about 1 of 100 patients. Single instances of first-degree and third-degree heart block have been reported; intensification of AV block is a known effect of beta-blockers (see also contraindications, warnings, and precautions).

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^114gUqq7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Decreased epidermal high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression is an early marker of epidermal injury in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Etanercept, an anti-tumor necrosis factor therapeutic, is effective in the treatment of SJS/TEN. The objective was to characterize antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-mediated HMGB1 keratinocyte/epidermal release and etanercept modulation.

- **Methodology**: HMGB1 release from TNF-α treated (± etanercept), or doxycycline-inducible RIPK3 or Bak-expressing human keratinocyte cells (HaCaTs) was determined by western blot/ELISA. Healthy skin explants were treated with TNF-α or serum (1:10 dilution) from immune checkpoint inhibitor-tolerant, lichenoid dermatitis, or SJS/TEN patients ± etanercept. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of HMGB1 was undertaken.

- **Findings**: TNF-α induced HMGB1 release in vitro via both necroptosis and apoptosis. Exposure of skin explants to TNF-α or SJS/TEN serum resulted in significant epidermal toxicity/detachment with substantial HMGB1 release, which was attenuated by etanercept. Whole-slide image analysis of biopsies demonstrated significantly lower epidermal HMGB1 in pre-blistered SJS/TEN versus control (P < 0.05).

Keratinocyte HMGB1 release, predominantly caused by necroptosis, can be attenuated by etanercept. Although TNF-α is a key mediator of epidermal HMGB1 release, other cytokines/cytotoxic proteins also contribute. Skin explant models represent a potential model of SJS/TEN that could be utilized for further mechanistic studies and targeted therapy screening.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Diagnosis and management [^113w82Pi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

In addition to an increased rate of psychosocial effects, SJS/TEN survivors have an estimated reduced life expectancy of about 9 years and an increased risk of ensuing higher healthcare-related costs. The decreased life expectancy may be owing to a reduced and delayed usage of high-risk drugs that may be associated with SJS/TEN. Often, survivors are left avoiding multiple medications if the SJS/TEN trigger was not clearly identified. In situations where the use of a medication is necessary and alternatives are not available, there can be shared decision-making with the patient to consider a drug challenge test in unique scenarios. Genetic screening can be performed prior to use, but this may lead to a delay in treatment.

Professor Jean‐Claude Roujeau, one of the most prominent leaders in SJS/TEN, suggested three key objectives when supporting SJS/TEN survivors: (1) carefully listen to patients' concerns and collaborate with them to treat psychosocial distress; (2) advance clinical and basic research to better understand SJS/TEN long-term sequelae; and (3) ensure patients have equitable access to healthcare and consider if patients can earn compensation in some capacity. Given the high mortality rate of patients with SJS/TEN, Professor Jean‐Claude Roujeau advocated for affected patients to be termed true "victims".

### A 2-year-old girl with Stevens — Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis treated with intravenous immunoglobulin [^111nGaxC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are severe skin reactions, usually caused by drugs, associated with widespread destruction of the epidermis. Widespread purpuric macules and epidermal detachment of less than 10% of the body surface indicate Stevens-Johnson syndrome, whereas epidermal detachment between 10% and 30% is referred to as Stevens-Johnson-toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap. Epidermal detachment involving more than 30% of the total body surface is designated as toxic epidermal necrolysis. These generalized reactions are associated with various drugs.

Treatment is primarily supportive care, and there are no specific therapy regimens. Therapeutic modalities, such as corticosteroids, cyclosporin, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis, are usually based on a symptomatic approach and have been tried in single patients or small series. Intravenous immunoglobulin has recently been shown to provide rapid improvement in all three of these skin reactions. We report a 2-year-old girl who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap after receiving ampicillin-sulbactam for an upper respiratory tract infection. She was treated successfully with a 4-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^114DRR6m]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Epidermal HMGB1 expression in explants treated with SJS/TEN patient serum was significantly decreased in both replicates, with levels being visibly higher when the explants were co-incubated with etanercept. Conversely, apparent immune cell HMGB1 immunostaining in SJS/TEN serum-treated explants increased in the presence of etanercept. Explants treated with sera from either ICI-tolerant or ICI-induced lichenoid dermatitis patients showed no substantial loss of epidermal HMGB1 and no modulation of effect by etanercept. Cleaved caspase 3 expression was notionally elevated in SJS/TEN serum-treated explants at the epidermal basal layer compared to tolerant serum-treated explants, but this was not substantially modulated by etanercept. RIPK3 expression was significant in all explants in the basal layer and was visibly lower in TNF-α and SJS/TEN serum-treated explants compared to control, healthy, or lichenoid dermatitis serum treatment.

In addition to in situ skin HMGB1 expression, we also examined extracellular HMGB1 in the explant culture media. This was found to be significantly higher in explants treated with SJS/TEN patient serum (16.91 ng/mL ± 3.51) compared to the media-only control (1.03 ng/mL ± 0.14, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in those co-administered etanercept (19.00 ng/mL ± 2.62; P < 0.05). Explants treated with sera from either the tolerant or lichenoid dermatitis patient (4.36 ng/mL ± 1.83 and 1.82 ng/mL ± 0.2).

### Alden, an algorithm for assessment of drug causality in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Comparison with case-control analysis [^1144hQ7j]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). High credibility.

The ALDEN score, or Algorithm of Drug Causality for Epidermal Necrolysis, is a clinical calculator used in the field of dermatology. It is specifically designed for patients who have developed severe skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which are often drug-induced. The ALDEN score helps clinicians to identify the likelihood that a specific drug has caused the skin reaction in a patient.

The clinical utility of the ALDEN score is to guide clinicians in identifying the causative drug in cases of SJS and TEN, which is crucial for preventing further exposure to the drug and managing the patient's condition. It takes into account factors such as the timing of drug exposure, the latency period, and the drug's inherent likelihood of causing such reactions.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ALDEN score; however, it should be noted that the score is less reliable in cases where the patient has been exposed to multiple drugs, or when the onset of the skin reaction is not clear. It is also less useful in cases where the reaction is not drug-induced.

The Algorithm of Drug Causality for Epidermal Necrolysis (ALDEN score) is a tool designed to evaluate the involvement of drugs in triggering Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). By assessing several key criteria related to drug intake, history, and associated risks, the calculator provides insights into the likelihood of drug causation.

### A well-demarcated hyperpigmented plaque of the posterior neck [^115uQtaB]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What are the most appropriate next steps in management of this patient?

A. Discontinue medications initiated in the hospital and observe for improvement
B. Treat the lesion with topical corticosteroids
C. Admit the patient to a burn unit and prevent dehydration with intravenous fluids
D. Reassurance and regular wound care
E. Conduct patch testing to verify the implicated allergen

- **Answers**:

A. Discontinue medications initiated in the hospital and observe for improvement – Incorrect. This would be appropriate management for an FDE or exanthematous drug reaction, but no medication discontinuation is required for pressure necrosis.

B. Treat the lesion with topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. LSC, EM, and ACD might benefit from topical corticosteroids, but pressure necrosis is not an inflammatory condition and therefore treatment with topical corticosteroids is not recommended.

C. Admit the patient to a burn unit and prevent dehydration with intravenous fluids – Incorrect. If the patient had findings concerning for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis, this would be appropriate. The singularity and stability of the skin lesion, its morphology, and the patient's drug history are not concerning for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis.

D. Reassurance and regular wound care – Correct. Pressure-induced skin necrosis is a benign condition which is not related to any underlying infectious process or drug exposure. There is no known risk of progression to toxic epidermal necrolysis or other severe adverse cutaneous reaction. Most lesions will…

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^117Enbd5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

The work presented in skin explant models demonstrates that TNF‐α can induce epidermal release of HMGB1, leading to elevated supernatant levels. However, while the addition of etanercept negated epidermal release, it did not reduce extracellular levels. TNF‐α is known to induce HMGB1 release from monocytes, and it is possible that the extracellular levels of HMGB1 in SJS/TEN are due to TNF‐α‐induced release by both epidermal and immune cells, not solely due to epidermal loss of expression. An alternative hypothesis suggests that etanercept itself increases HMGB1 release from activated immune cells, countering the inhibition of HMGB1 release from injured keratinocytes by etanercept. This also implies that etanercept affects both inflammatory cells and keratinocytes. Similarly, anakinra could explain the substantial increase in HMGB1 observed and the lack of reduction in its presence.

Epidermal expression of HMGB1 was significantly decreased by exposure to SJS/TEN patient serum at a 1:10 dilution and marginally restored by etanercept. This mirrored the effect on toxicity, where a marginal decrease was noticed in response to etanercept. This suggests that TNF‐α might play a role in mediating HMGB1 release and toxicity in SJS/TEN, but HMGB1 release is also attributable to non‐TNF‐α‐mediated pathways.

### Photodistributed toxic epidermal necrolysis in association with lamotrigine and tanning bed exposure [^1127YyUa]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare, life-threatening immune-mediated conditions characterized by mucocutaneous epidermal necrosis. In 80% to 95% of SJS/TEN cases, exposure to an offending drug can be identified approximately 6 to 14 days prior to presentation. The eruption classically begins as scattered, dusky, erythematous macules distributed on the head, neck, and trunk, progressing to the extremities in larger confluent patches, which can be detached with lateral pressure (Nikolsky sign). As necrosis spreads, flaccid bullae develop, leading to diffuse epidermal detachment. Painful erosions of the oral, ocular, and genital mucosa are present in 87% to 100% of TEN cases. The pathogenesis of SJS/TEN is incompletely understood; however, a high density of CD8+ lymphocytes within the epidermis and blister fluid has been demonstrated. It has been hypothesized that CD8+ T lymphocytes drive a complex inflammatory response, leading to expansive keratinocyte apoptosis.

It has occasionally been reported that SJS/TEN occurs in a photodistribution. Drugs such as sulfasalazine, antimalarials, ciprofloxacin, clobazam, itraconazole, and naproxen have been associated with photodistributed SJS/TEN. At present, little is known about the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the metabolism of culprit drugs, or drug–immune system interplay. We present a case of photodistributed TEN associated with lamotrigine and tanning bed use and discuss the possible pathogenesis of this distinct presentation.

### Treatment of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) with intravenous human immunoglobulins [^115gbTRD]. Burns (2001). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, drug-induced, life-threatening disease. Currently, the disease is treated only by supportive and antiseptic measures. Quite recently, intravenous immunoglobulins (IG) have been shown to be a promising treatment for TEN. The rationale for their use is based on the fact that keratinocyte apoptosis in TEN involves the CD95 (APO-1/Fas) cell surface receptor-ligand system. We successfully treated a TEN patient with a high dose of intravenous IG. The clinical recovery appeared exceptionally rapid. Immunohistochemistry showed that the IG action probably developed on the CD95 receptor-ligand system at the keratinocyte surface.

### Amlodipine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113FEbbC]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to report a case of amlodipine-induced dermatotoxicity following treatment for diabetic nephropathy. Although other members of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have been reported to cause dermatotoxic reactions, this is the first report attributing this effect to amlodipine. A 71-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman had been noted to have worsened renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia attributed to enalapril, thus a trial of amlodipine was begun.

On day 12 of amlodipine therapy, the patient developed a pruritic maculopapular rash on her hands for which she sought medical attention. By day 16, she presented again to the emergency department with hives and small blisters involving the trunk and arms, with approximately 25% total body surface area (TBSA) involvement, warranting transfer to a regional burn treatment center. The rash progressed after admission to 48.5% TBSA and included conjunctival sloughing. The patient's hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged after 8 days.

Drug-induced dermatotoxicity presenting as toxic epidermal necrolysis is often caused by antibiotics and antiepileptic medications; however, calcium channel blockers are an uncommon cause. The Naranjo assessment yielded a score of 5, and the SCORTEN was 4, with a predicted mortality of 58%. This report represents the first published case of amlodipine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by etonogestrel implantation: A rare presentation [^1114XEkh]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

After 5 days in the medical intensive care unit, the patient was transferred to our burn center for evaluation and management. We observed a full-body eruption of pink and red papules, erythematous plaques on the trunk and extremities, and scattered serous-filled vesicles over the face, back, upper extremities, lower extremities, and perineum (Fig 3, A and B). Several areas of epidermolysis with a clean, erythematous base were noted (Fig 3, C). Mucosal sloughing, hemorrhagic crusting, and desquamation of the lips were also present. The patient was treated supportively with pain control and intravenous IgG (90 g daily at 75 mL/h) for 3 days. The epidermolysis improved gradually with local wound care and whirlpool therapy. The patient began tolerating a regular diet and was discharged 6 days after admission to the burn center following an uncomplicated hospital course.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Diagnosis and management [^115AV37M]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the most severe cutaneous adverse reactions, typically drug-induced in adults. Both SJS and TEN have high morbidity and mortality rates. SJS/TEN poses clinical challenges for physicians managing patients with this condition due to its rarity and rapidly progressing systemic nature with severe cutaneous, mucosal, and systemic manifestations.

Although many cases of SJS/TEN have been reported in the literature, there is no consensus regarding diagnostic criteria or treatment. Significant progress has been made in understanding its genetic predisposition and pathogenesis. This review is intended to provide physicians with a comprehensive but practical roadmap for SJS/TEN diagnosis and management.

- **Pathogenesis**: We review data on pathogenesis, including the latest understanding over the past five years.

- **Reported precipitating factors**: This includes recent findings that contribute to the understanding of SJS/TEN triggers.

- **Presentation, diagnosis, and management**: We focus on the latest advancements and strategies in these areas, highlighting what is new over the last five years to guide clinicians in their practice.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is one of the most devastating adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and was, until recently, essentially unpredictable. With the discovery of several risk alleles for drug-induced SJS/TEN and the demonstration of the effectiveness of screening in reducing incidence, the stage is set for the implementation of preventive strategies in populations at risk. Yet, much remains to be learned about this potentially fatal complication of commonly used drugs.

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis: an Asian series [^112m9Exo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe, immune-mediated, mucocutaneous reaction resulting in extensive keratinocyte apoptosis. High-dose human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been proposed as an effective treatment for TEN. Retrospective data from 8 patients with TEN and 4 patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN) overlap treated with high-dose IVIG were analyzed. The total dose of IVIG administered was 2 g/kg body weight, except for 2 patients who received 1.5 g/kg body weight.

The mean age of patients was 49.9 ± 18.8 years (range, 19 to 70 years). The mean time from the first sign of skin lesion or mucosal or epidermal detachment to the commencement of IVIG was 8.7 ± 5.5 days (range, 3 to 22 days). Of the 11 patients who survived, the mean time to objective response was 3.6 ± 1.9 days (range, 2 to 8 days). The length of stay (LOS) in the hospital was 20.4 ± 8.0 days (range, 10 to 37 days). The survival rate was 91.6%. One patient developed permanent mucocutaneous sequelae following TEN. There were no adverse reactions to IVIG.

We conclude that high-dose IVIG may be a safe and effective therapy for Asian patients with TEN.

### SPL drug information for nadolol [^116s3Qqo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

A boxed warning highlights the critical information regarding the use of nadolol PO, also known as Corgard, particularly concerning the exacerbation of myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and angina. It is imperative not to discontinue treatment abruptly, especially in patients with coronary artery disease, as this action may lead to severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmias. It is recommended to gradually reduce the dose over 1–2 weeks while closely monitoring the patient. Should symptoms worsen or acute coronary insufficiency develop, it is crucial to promptly reinstitute nadolol and implement appropriate measures. Even in patients undergoing treatment for hypertension, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided, as coronary artery disease may remain unrecognized.

### The use of etanercept for treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis when toxic shock syndrome is in the differential [^116Gda4u]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) can sometimes mimic Steven Johnson's syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of both TSS and SJS/TEN. Etanercept, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, has been recently shown to treat and decrease the mortality of SJS/TEN. We report a 51-year-old female with a history of SJS presenting with painful skin and bullae two days following cystoscopy with botulinum toxin injection into the bladder. Due to initial concern for SJS/TEN, the patient was treated with 50 mg of subcutaneous etanercept. Punch biopsies were not consistent with SJS, and the patient fulfilled five out of five criteria for a confirmed case of TSS. The patient ultimately had a favorable outcome despite etanercept treatment. Ultimately, TNF-alpha antagonists are an emerging therapy to treat SJS/TEN and are unlikely to worsen TSS prognosis. Given that etanercept can be used to successfully treat SJS/TEN, and TNF-alpha levels are elevated in TSS, if a dermatologist chooses to treat TEN with etanercept, consideration of TSS on the differential should not necessarily exclude etanercept as a reasonable treatment option.

### Anesthetic management of toxic epidermal necrolysis: Report of three adult cases [^111E39CY]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare but acute life-threatening syndrome in which the epidermis blisters and peels in large sheets. Patients with this syndrome are generally managed as severe second-degree burn patients. Special consideration should be given to mucous membrane involvement, which reduces fluid intake and worsens the fluid deficit. Systemic involvement makes these patients hemodynamically unstable, and the progression of cutaneous lesions enhances the risk of infection and sepsis.

### Intravenous immune globulin therapy for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis complicated by hemolysis leading to pigment nephropathy and hemodialysis [^117KRzaw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is generally considered to carry a relatively low risk for adverse events, and some experts regard it as the best treatment for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Objective**: We evaluated the underlying cause of anemia and renal failure in two consecutive patients treated with IVIG for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective chart review.

- **Results**: We present two patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and severe hemolysis requiring blood transfusion, who subsequently developed pigment nephropathy necessitating hemodialysis after treatment with IVIG. Both patients had antibodies to their ABO blood type detected in the eluate from their red blood cell membrane.

- **Limitations**: This is a retrospective review with only two cases.

- **Conclusions**: We propose that IVIG-associated hemolysis is an adverse reaction that may not be as rare as once thought, presenting as a mild decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. Antibodies to blood type A and B are included as part of pooled immune globulin and are considered to be the cause of hemolysis. More severe anemia requiring transfusion is less common, and the breakdown products produced by hemolysis can lead to pigment nephropathy and renal failure. We present methods by which this severe complication can be anticipated and managed more effectively.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^1121KwSe]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Having determined that TNF‐α induces HMGB1 release from a keratinocyte cell line, we examined the effect of TNF‐α in a more physiologically relevant model using healthy human skin explants to assess whether in vitro observations could be reproduced. Exposure of healthy skin explants to TNF‐α for 72 hours induced grade 2 epidermal toxicity compared to grade 1 toxicity in media-only treated explants (Supporting Information Table S4 and Figure 3). Although administration of etanercept did not reduce toxicity, the TNF‐α induced loss of epidermal HMGB1 expression — absent in media-only controls — was negated by etanercept.

Extracellular levels of HMGB1 in the supernatant were significantly higher in TNF‐α treated explants (7.83 ng/mL ± 1.2) compared to controls (1.03 ng/mL ± 0.14, P < 0.05).

- **Effect and imaging analysis**:
	- 72-hour exposure to 10 ng/mL TNF‐α or cutaneous ADR patient serum (control, lichenoid dermatitis, or SJS/TEN) ± 1 μg/mL etanercept on healthy skin explant morphology (H&E stained). Images display HMGB1 immunohistochemical expression and localization. Images are representative of n = 3 skin samples.
	- For H&E images: black horizontal scale bar = 100 μm (400× magnification). For HMGB1: black horizontal bar = 60 μm (zoomed 40× whole slide scanned image). Dashed lines indicate the dermal-epidermal junction.

Anakinra (positive control)‐treated explants exhibited grade II/III toxicity or grade II in the presence of etanercept.

### Noninferiority and safety of nadolol vs propranolol in infants with infantile hemangioma: A randomized clinical trial [^111JUgGo]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

We previously published a pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of nadolol through comparison with a historical cohort treated with oral propranolol. At similar mean dosages (2.1 mg/kg/d), 10 patients receiving nadolol had a mean (SD) IH involution of 51% (18.5%) at the 4-week visit, 83% (13.9%) at the 12-week visit, and 97% (3.5%) at the end of the study (24 weeks). In contrast, 10 patients receiving propranolol had a mean (SD) IH involution of 28% (10.4%), 56% (16.6%), and 86% (14.8%) at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively (P < 0.001). Nadolol was well tolerated with no significant adverse events.

The preliminary data supported our hypothesis that nadolol is an efficacious and, given its pharmacological properties, alternative modality to propranolol for use in the treatment of IHs. The objective of this study was to document the noninferiority and safety of oral nadolol compared with oral propranolol in the treatment of IHs.

### Intense pulsed light treatment of persistent facial hypermelanosis following drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113WBjRH]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous hyperpigmentation is one of the most cosmetically disturbing sequelae of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. Intense pulsed light is a promising tool for treating some melanocytic lesions. The objective was to assess the effect of intense pulsed light in treating post-toxic epidermal necrolysis facial hypermelanosis.

Two Caucasian men, aged 35 and 50 years, presented with long-standing (32 and 39 years) severe hypermelanosis of the face after sulfonamide-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. They were treated with intense pulsed light using cutoff filters of 550, 590, and 615 nm for five sessions at 4-week intervals. The treatment was characterized by energy fluence of 25 to 32 J/cm², pulse width of 2.2 to 3.2 ms, and double- to triple-pulse mode with a 30-ms delay. Before intense pulsed light treatment, and 2 months after the fifth session, clinical photographs and skin biopsies were performed in combination with quantitative narrow-band remittance spectrophotometry of melanin pigmentation. Patients were clinically followed up for 8 months after the end of the treatment.

In both patients, clinical, histologic, and spectrophotometric assessments showed an average of 80% decrease in the hypermelanosis. No clinical recurrence of the hypermelanosis developed during the 8-month follow-up after intense pulsed light treatment. No major persistent side effects were experienced, especially hypopigmentation.

Intense pulsed light appears to be effective and safe for treating post-toxic epidermal necrolysis facial hypermelanosis.

### The psychological impact of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis on patients' lives: A critically appraised topic [^111UNx9H]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

At the first stage of screening, 33 full‐text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 27 full‐text studies were excluded with reasons (Fig. 1). Six studies were included in the critically appraised topic. Two of the included studies were qualitative and four were quantitative. Two of the studies were from the U.K., two were from France, one was from Canada, and one was from South Africa.

Following analysis, two overarching themes were identified:

- **The impact of diagnosis** now and for the future.

- **Living with the psychosocial impact**. For each of these themes, two further subthemes were developed.

Quotations from the qualitative papers are presented to illustrate these findings.

### Serum and blister-fluid elevation and decreased epidermal content of high-mobility group box 1 protein in drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [^112769iU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Samples from three independent SJS/TEN patient cohorts were brought together for the purpose of this study.

- **Nevirapine patient cohort**: Patients were prospectively recruited, as previously described, after informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the research ethics committees of the College of Medicine, Malawi, and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, U.K. Briefly, the study recruited 1117 antiretroviral‐naive HIV‐positive patients from the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, between March 2007 and December 2008. All were self‐reported black African, over the age of 16 years, and had no baseline jaundice. All patients were diagnosed as having clinical stage 3/4 HIV or had a CD4+ count of fewer than 200 cells µL−1 at recruitment. Of these, 20 patients developed nevirapine SJS/TEN and were recruited for this study. SJS was defined as a widespread erythematous or maculopapular rash, detachment of < 10% of body surface area (BSA), and involvement of two or more mucous membranes. TEN was defined as a detachment of > 30% of BSA and two or more mucous membranes. Patients with 10–30% affected BSA had the overlap syndrome.

### Comparison of the acute ocular manifestations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Chinese eyes: a 15-year retrospective study [^113dkzaz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but life-threatening conditions that initially affect the skin and mucous membranes. The aim of this study was to compare the acute ocular manifestations between SJS and TEN.

- **Methods**: The initial presenting ophthalmic records of patients with either SJS, characterized by ≥ 30% involvement, who were treated at one tertiary burn center in Hong Kong between 1999 and 2014, were retrospectively analyzed and compared.

- **Results**: A total of 20 SJS and 12 TEN cases were included. All cases were drug-induced. The patient demographics and treatment received were comparable. Overall, 40% of SJS and 75% of TEN patients had acute ocular surface inflammation. When comparing the two groups, there was a significant difference in the number of cases with mild involvement (5% in SJS, 42% in TEN, p = 0.01), while no statistically significant differences were found (p > 0.05) when comparing between the moderate (15% in SJS, 0% in TEN) and severe groups (20% in SJS, 33% in TEN).

- **Conclusions**: Ocular surface inflammation was common during the acute phase in both SJS and TEN. TEN had a significantly higher number of cases with mild ocular involvement compared to SJS, but there was no significant difference in the number of moderate and severe cases between the two groups.

### Carbatrol [^113EV1zJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Serious dermatologic reactions**: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbatrol should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed, and alternative therapy should be considered.

- **SJS/TEN and HLA-B✱1502 allele**: Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry, there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B✱1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity.

Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B✱1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have an intermediate prevalence of HLA-B✱1502, averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. HLA-B✱1502 is present in less than 1% of the population in Japan and Korea.
