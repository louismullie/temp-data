## Question

what are some common management techniques for pcp's for acute bronchitis in immunocompetent patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about common management techniques for acute bronchitis in immunocompetent patients that primary care providers can use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about ruling out serious pathology like pneumonia. Then, I should verify what testing, if any, is appropriate in the outpatient setting. Next, I will evaluate when antibiotics are not indicated versus the few situations when they might be. After that, I need to consider evidence-based symptomatic management. Finally, I will address patient education, follow-up triggers, and special scenarios like suspected pertussis and high-risk patients.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic objective: in immunocompetent adults with acute cough, my primary task is to exclude pneumonia and other serious disease rather than to prove "acute bronchitis". Normal vital signs and a normal chest exam (no rales, egophony, or tactile fremitus) make CAP very unlikely in healthy, non-elderly adults, so I should avoid overdiagnosis of pneumonia in this group [^113ptkgp] [^112Nmytv].

> Wait, let me verify the role of routine testing. Chest radiography should not be ordered routinely; I should reserve CXR for those with abnormal vitals or focal lung findings, severe illness, high clinical suspicion for CAP, older patients with concerning features, or persistent/worsening symptoms beyond about three weeks. Laboratory testing (sputum culture, viral PCR, CRP, procalcitonin) should not be ordered routinely in immunocompetent outpatients, and spirometry is not indicated in the initial evaluation unless new airflow obstruction is suspected. I should also remember that CBC is of limited value because leukocytosis can occur without pneumonia [^112Ybv6k] [^116cXFqi] [^112WRnjT] [^116cXFqi] [^116zSTZN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — differential diagnosis still matters. I need to consider and exclude pneumonia, asthma or COPD exacerbation, heart failure, influenza, COVID-19, and pertussis based on history, exam, and epidemiology. If I suspect pertussis due to prolonged paroxysmal cough or exposure, I should test and then treat to reduce transmission; for suspected influenza during circulation, I should consider antiviral therapy per IDSA guidance [^117PueHE] [^113ptkgp] [^113n46vt].

> I should confirm the core stewardship principle: routine antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adults because benefit is minimal and risks outweigh it. High-quality evidence shows no meaningful difference in overall clinical improvement versus placebo, with only a marginal reduction in cough duration at the expense of adverse effects and resistance. This holds true across settings, including an equivalence trial in Kenya showing amoxicillin was no better than placebo. I need to ensure I communicate this clearly to patients [^1128x35v] [^111FGJZY] [^114W1WAi] [^1179Kpu9] [^114E7k7E].

> But wait, what if antibiotics might be warranted? I should double-check the exceptions: confirmed or strongly suspected pertussis (test first, then treat), situations where CAP cannot be reasonably excluded, and select high-risk patients (for example, older adults with significant comorbid cardiopulmonary disease) based on clinical judgment. One more nuance: the ACP best-practice advice suggests if I judge there are bacterial features — classically increased sputum purulence with increased dyspnea and/or sputum volume — then if I do prescribe, I should keep it short, about five days. Hold on, I should verify that these "three features" are historically derived from COPD exacerbation literature; in non-COPD acute bronchitis, this criterion has limited specificity. So I will use it cautiously and emphasize that most immunocompetent adults still do not benefit from antibiotics [^11575PLC] [^113ptkgp] [^1179Kpu9].

> Next, I should review stewardship strategies to reduce unnecessary use. Delayed prescribing, describing the illness as a "chest cold", and providing targeted education consistently reduce antibiotic demand and improve satisfaction. Systems-level approaches like decision support and feedback also lower prescribing rates over time. I need to ensure my language and tools align with these strategies during visits [^115uFvJ7] [^111sWHNv] [^117248WE].

> Let me consider supportive care, as that is the mainstay. I should advise rest, adequate hydration, humidified air or steam, and nasal saline irrigation. Crucially, I must set expectations: cough typically lasts 2–3 weeks and can extend to around 10–14 days of "frequent cough" in trial cohorts, so reassurance is key. I should confirm there is no evidence to support routine use of diagnostic testing solely to label "bronchitis" when the clinical picture is otherwise uncomplicated [^1123gz4m] [^115uFvJ7] [^117Trb6b].

> I need to check pharmacologic symptomatic options carefully. Antitussives may be considered short-term if cough is severe and disrupts sleep, but evidence is mixed, and AAFP advises against routine OTC cough medications given limited benefit. Beta-agonists should not be used routinely; consider them only with wheeze, known asthma/COPD, or demonstrable airflow limitation. I should avoid antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral NSAIDs, and inhaled or oral corticosteroids for routine acute bronchitis symptom control because evidence does not support their effectiveness in this context. If a patient asks about herbal options, I can note that pelargonium has limited evidence and is not a standard recommendation [^114BiT1W] [^114XJ6Bx] [^113jtq4u] [^113ggfTC] [^117PueHE] [^114E7k7E].

> I should double-check the communication elements that change outcomes. I will explain that antibiotics do not meaningfully shorten illness, carry risks (GI upset, allergies, C. difficile), and drive resistance, while high-quality communication itself is what drives satisfaction. Using "chest cold" instead of "bronchitis", providing a handout on expected symptom course, and offering a safety-net plan often meet patient needs without antibiotics [^113ptkgp] [^115uFvJ7].

> Now, I will examine follow-up and reassessment triggers. If cough persists beyond about three weeks, worsens, or new red flags develop (fever, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, systemic decline), I should reconsider the diagnosis and pursue targeted evaluation — this may include CXR to reassess for CAP or alternative pathology, and testing for pertussis, influenza, or COVID-19 as indicated. If the cough extends beyond eight weeks, I should consider postinfectious cough and other chronic cough etiologies using guideline-based approaches [^113iPdig] [^112Ybv6k] [^112BptYu] [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about older adults? I initially thought I should obtain a CXR in all older adults with cough, but that overuses imaging. Let me reconsider: I should base imaging on abnormal vitals, focal lung findings, severity, and clinical suspicion for CAP, recognizing that age may lower thresholds but does not mandate routine imaging when exam and vitals are normal [^116zSTZN] [^112Nmytv].

> Hold on, I should verify scope and exceptions regarding host status. These recommendations apply to immunocompetent adults; if a patient is immunocompromised, the threshold for diagnostic testing and empiric therapy changes, and antimicrobial stewardship principles must be adapted to the higher-risk context with multidisciplinary input. For immunocompromised hosts, institutional protocols and ID/ASP consultation are prudent to balance timely therapy with stewardship [^113PvUjZ] [^111sLzFk].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure my approach remains consistent: exclude pneumonia using vitals and exam, avoid routine testing, do not prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated cases, prioritize supportive care, communicate the 2–3 week natural history, use delayed scripts or decision supports if needed, and reassess if symptoms persist or worsen. This aligns with AAFP and CHEST evidence syntheses and ACP stewardship guidance for acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adults [^112BptYu] [^1179Kpu9] [^1128x35v] [^112Ybv6k].

Primary care management of acute bronchitis in immunocompetent patients centers on **clinical diagnosis** [^114VGSCJ] and **supportive care** [^1123gz4m], with antibiotics avoided unless pneumonia or pertussis is suspected [^1128x35v] [^113ptkgp]. Routine testing is **unnecessary** [^116cXFqi]; reserve chest X-ray for abnormal vitals or lung exam [^112Ybv6k], and avoid CBC, sputum cultures, or viral PCR [^113aeKUe]. Provide patient education on the typical 2–3 week cough duration [^115uFvJ7], advise rest, hydration, and humidified air [^1123gz4m], and use antitussives [^114BiT1W] or beta-agonists only if wheezing or airflow limitation is present [^113jtq4u] [^113ggfTC]. Reassess if symptoms persist beyond **3–4 weeks** or worsen [^112BptYu] [^113iPdig], and use **delayed prescribing** or shared decision-making to reduce unnecessary antibiotics [^111sWHNv] [^117PueHE].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Acute bronchitis is defined by cough (with or without sputum) lasting ≤ 3 weeks [^114VGSCJ], without clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, common cold, acute asthma, or COPD exacerbation.

- **Rule out pneumonia**: Evaluate for pneumonia if abnormal vital signs (HR > 100, RR > 24, T > 38°C) [^112Nmytv] or abnormal lung exam (rales, egophony, fremitus) are present.

- **Avoid routine testing**: Do not routinely obtain CBC [^113aeKUe], sputum cultures, or viral PCR [^116cXFqi]; these rarely change management.

- **Chest radiography**: Not routine [^112Ybv6k]; consider only if severe symptoms, abnormal vitals, abnormal lung exam, or high suspicion for pneumonia [^116zSTZN].

---

## Symptomatic management

- **Patient education**: Explain the typical 2–3 week cough duration [^115uFvJ7] to set expectations and reduce antibiotic requests.

- **Supportive care**: Recommend rest, hydration, humidified air, and nasal saline irrigation for symptom relief [^1123gz4m].

- **Antitussives**: Consider short-term use for bothersome cough [^114BiT1W]; avoid routine use of OTC cough medications due to limited evidence [^114XJ6Bx].

- **Beta-agonists**: Do not use routinely [^113ggfTC]; consider only if wheezing or airflow limitation is present [^113jtq4u].

- **Avoid corticosteroids**: Do not use inhaled or oral corticosteroids routinely [^114XJ6Bx].

---

## Antibiotic stewardship

- **Avoid routine antibiotics**: Do not prescribe antibiotics [^1179Kpu9] unless pneumonia or pertussis is suspected [^1128x35v].

- **Delayed prescribing**: Use delayed prescriptions or shared decision-making to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

- **Short-course antibiotics**: If bacterial infection is suspected, limit antibiotic duration to 5 days [^11575PLC].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

During follow-up, **reassessment** is warranted if symptoms persist beyond 3–4 weeks [^112BptYu] or worsen [^113iPdig], and alternative diagnoses should be considered [^114iQQJf]. To improve **patient satisfaction**, emphasize communication and education [^1152zHys] to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use [^113ptkgp].

---

Primary care management of acute bronchitis in immunocompetent patients emphasizes **clinical diagnosis** [^114VGSCJ], supportive care, and antibiotic stewardship [^1128x35v], with reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen [^112BptYu].

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.

1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with a cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.

2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of the duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.

3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Acute bronchitis: Rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19.

Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. The BAAP study protocol [^114yaam3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We will accept a null hypothesis if the number of days of frequent cough in the anti-inflammatory arm is the same or ± 2 days as that observed in the other two treatment arms (placebo and antibiotic treatment). Based on the literature, the standard deviation of the duration of frequent cough is 5.5 days in patients with chronic bronchitis and purulent sputum. For an α: 0.05 and a β: 0.2, and accepting possible losses of 15%, we calculate that the sample size should be 140 patients per group, totaling 420 patients.

- **Intention-to-treat statistical analyses**: Intention-to-treat statistical analyses will be performed. To analyze the time until the cure of the different symptoms and for the main result variable (days from the onset of the picture until the patient scores a maximum of 1 in the box related to cough in the symptom diary), survival analysis will be carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between the three survival curves will be undertaken using the log-rank test.

- **Additional analyses**: In addition, bivariate analysis will be performed with the comparison of proportions using the chi-square test to evaluate secondary variables of the study and variance analysis to assess the relationship between quantitative variables for both independent and paired data.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: Randomised placebo controlled trial [^117Trb6b]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was the mean duration of cough, which was 14.6 days (SD 6). Figure 2 shows the time with frequent cough using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The median number of days until the last day patients scored ≥ 1 in both daytime and nighttime cough after the baseline visit was 10 days (95% confidence interval 9 to 11 days). The days with frequent cough were slightly lower among patients assigned to ibuprofen (9 days, 8 to 10 days) than those receiving amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (11 days, 10 to 12 days) or placebo (11 days, 8 to 14 days). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the study groups (log rank test = 0.25).

- **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis**: Days with frequent cough — that is, time (days) with cough from baseline visit until patient last scored ≥ 1 for both daytime and nighttime cough.

- **Summary of clinical efficacy results**: Median values (95% confidence interval) unless stated otherwise.

Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were carried out on patients who returned a diary (390 and 345, respectively).

Neither amoxicillin-clavulanic acid nor ibuprofen was associated with an increased likelihood of cough resolution compared with placebo (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.35 and 1.23, 0.93 to 1.61, respectively). To investigate the hazard ratio for the probability of cough resolution adjusting for potential confounders, we calculated three models: model 1 (crude model), model 2 (including treatment group, C-reactive protein ≥ 8 mg/L, and temperature).

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zUR3b]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Wet or productive cough is common in children with chronic cough. We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long, and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations?

- **Methods**: We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made.

- **Results**: Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution. Further investigations (e.g. flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (e.g. digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic en.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

The evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

- **Methods**: Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

- **Results**: No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in the number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

- **Conclusions**: The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by a cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of the cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for more than 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

- **Results**: Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of chronic cough due to acute bronchitis were not addressed adequately.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated.

If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute bronchitis [^114E7k7E]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common symptom bringing patients to the primary care physician's office, and acute bronchitis is usually the diagnosis in these cases. Acute bronchitis should be differentiated from other common diagnoses, such as pneumonia and asthma, because these conditions may require specific therapies not indicated for bronchitis. Symptoms of bronchitis typically last about three weeks. The presence or absence of colored (e.g. green) sputum does not reliably differentiate between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections. Viruses are responsible for more than 90 percent of acute bronchitis infections.

Antibiotics are generally not indicated for bronchitis and should be used only if pertussis is suspected to reduce transmission or if the patient is at increased risk of developing pneumonia (e.g. patients 65 years or older). The typical therapies for managing acute bronchitis symptoms have been shown to be ineffective, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends against using cough and cold preparations in children younger than six years. The supplement pelargonium may help reduce symptom severity in adults. As patient expectations for antibiotics and therapies for symptom management differ from evidence-based recommendations, effective communication strategies are necessary to provide the safest therapies available while maintaining patient satisfaction.

### Acute bronchitis: Rapid evidence review [^116zSTZN]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute bronchitis, particularly in relation to chest X-ray (CXR), the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend considering a CXR in patients with severe symptoms. This includes cases where there is a combination of typical symptoms, such as the absence of coryza, presence of dyspnea, rales, or abnormal vital signs. Additionally, in older patients, a CXR should be considered when there is a high clinical suspicion for community-acquired pneumonia.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable…

### Antimicrobial stewardship in immunocompromised hosts [^113PvUjZ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The global spread of antimicrobial resistance has limited the availability of antimicrobial agents to treat infections that affect immunocompromised hosts. Efforts to optimize the selection, dosing, and duration of antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes and minimize selective pressure on antimicrobial resistance are relevant to immunocompromised patients. Collaborative efforts between health care providers with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with various degrees of immunosuppression are pivotal for the success of antimicrobial stewardship programs in immunocompromised patients.

### Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112KUf4y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are serious conditions that predispose patients to viral and bacterial infections, resulting in potentially fatal acute exacerbations. COPD is defined as a lung disease characterized by obstruction to lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing. Antibiotic therapy has not been particularly useful in eradicating bacteria such as non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) because they are part of the natural flora of the upper respiratory tract in many people. However, these bacteria can cause opportunistic infections. An oral NTHi vaccine has been developed to protect against reinfective acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of an oral, whole-cell NTHi vaccine in protecting against episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD in adults. Additionally, to assess the effectiveness of the NTHi vaccine in reducing NTHi colonization of the respiratory tract during episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2017), Embase (1974 to January 2017), CINAHL (1981 to January 2017), LILACS (1985 to January 2017), and Web of Science (1955 to January 2017). We also searched trial registries and contacted authors of trials requesting unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of an oral monobacterial vaccine.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: New developments concerning microbiology and pathophysiology — impact on approaches to risk stratification and therapy [^117LQcha]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a characteristic feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and contribute significantly to associated morbidity and mortality. Renewed interest in this common clinical problem and research using new investigative tools has substantially enhanced the understanding of the pathogenesis of exacerbations. Results of recent clinical trials and observational studies have allowed refinements in the treatment of exacerbations that should improve patient outcomes. This article discusses a rational, stratified approach to the use of antibiotics for this condition based on these recent studies.

### Beta2-agonists for acute cough or a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis [^113ggfTC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is typically made on clinical grounds, and various clinical definitions have been used. There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough associated with acute bronchitis. Beta2-agonists are often prescribed, possibly because clinicians suspect that many patients may also have reversible airflow restriction, as seen in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which contributes to the symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether beta2-agonists improve acute bronchitis symptoms in people with no underlying pulmonary disease, such as asthma, COPD, or pulmonary fibrosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2015, Issue 5, MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (1974 to May 2015), Web of Science (2011 to May 2015), and LILACS (1982 to May 2015).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which allocated people (adults or children over two years of age) with acute bronchitis or acute cough and without known pulmonary disease to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently selected outcomes and extracted data while blinded to study results. Two review authors independently assessed each trial for risk of bias. We analysed trials in children and adults separately.

- **Main results**: Two trials of moderate quality in children (n = 134) with no evidence of airflow restriction did not find any benefits from oral beta2-agonists. Five trials in adults (n = 418) had mixed results with overall summaries.

### Bacterial prevalence and antimicrobial prescribing trends for acute respiratory tract infections [^111YrUsv]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials are frequently prescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), although many are viral. We aimed to determine bacterial prevalence rates for five common childhood ARTI — acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis — and to compare these rates to nationally representative antimicrobial prescription rates for these ARTI.

- **Methods**: We performed (1) a meta-analysis of English-language pediatric studies published between 2000 and 2011 in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to determine ARTI bacterial prevalence rates; and (2) a retrospective cohort analysis of children aged under 18 years, evaluated in ambulatory clinics sampled by the 2000–2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), to determine estimated US ARTI antimicrobial prescribing rates.

- **Results**: From the meta-analysis, the AOM bacterial prevalence was 64.7% (95% confidence interval, 50.5%-77.7%); Streptococcus pyogenes prevalence during pharyngitis was 20.2% (95% CI, 15.9%-25.2%). No URI or bronchitis studies met inclusion criteria, and one sinusitis study met inclusion criteria, identifying bacteria in 78% of subjects. Based on these condition-specific bacterial prevalence rates, the expected antimicrobial prescribing rate for ARTI overall was 27.4% (95% CI, 26.5%-28.3%). However, antimicrobial agents were prescribed in NAMCS during 56.9% (95% CI, 50.8%-63.1%) of ARTI encounters, representing an estimated 11.4 million potentially preventable antimicrobial prescriptions annually.

- **Conclusions**: An estimated analysis suggests a potential for reducing unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions by aligning prescribing practices with bacterial prevalence data.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^112idXny]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis affects over 40 out of 1000 adults annually in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of the individuals have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing individuals to acute bronchitis is unclear. One-third of people may experience longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in individuals without chronic respiratory disease? We searched several databases including Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library up to March 2010. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We also included harms alerts from relevant organizations, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [co-trimoxazole]), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^111wvbPt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold. For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis, for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients.

Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians. These physicians represented disciplines such as internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases. The panel developed a series titled "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background, specific aims, and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it.

### Protracted bacterial bronchitis: The last decade and the road ahead [^115vjqBg]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Cough is the single most common reason for primary care physician visits and, when chronic, a frequent indication for specialist referrals. In children, a chronic cough (> 4 weeks) is associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. One common cause of childhood chronic cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), especially in children aged under 6 years. PBB is characterized by a chronic wet or productive cough without signs of an alternative cause and responds to 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Most children with PBB are unable to expectorate sputum. When bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are performed, evidence of bronchitis and purulent endobronchial secretions is observed. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens typically reveal marked neutrophil infiltration and culture large numbers of respiratory bacterial pathogens, especially Haemophilus influenzae. Although regarded as having a good prognosis, recurrences are common. If these recurrences are frequent or do not respond to antibiotic treatments of up to 4-weeks duration, the child should be investigated for other causes of chronic wet cough, such as bronchiectasis.

The contribution of airway malacia and the pathobiologic mechanisms of PBB remain uncertain. Other than reduced alveolar phagocytosis, evidence of systemic or local immune deficiency is lacking. Instead, pulmonary defenses show activated innate immunity and increased gene expression of the interleukin-1β signalling pathway. Whether these changes in local inflammatory responses are cause or effect remains to be determined.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^114KF1a7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Low credibility.

When should antibiotics be considered for patients during respiratory viral pandemics and epidemics?

- **Recommendations**: It is important for healthcare providers (HCP) to identify patients who require empiric antibiotic treatment, despite low rates of coinfection on admission for COVID-19 and prior respiratory viral pandemics. If treated at the time of hospital admission, HCP should prescribe antibiotics recommended in guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for patients presenting from the community with coinfection. Antibiotics for pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, seen more typically in healthcare-associated infections, are not recommended.

	- HCP may consider coinfection with other viruses, such as influenza. If influenza is diagnosed, the addition of therapy, such as oseltamivir, may be indicated. HCP may consider antibiotics, including broad-spectrum coverage, for patients hospitalized for more than 48 hours who are at greater risk for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) when there are new clinical signs that are consistent with healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection.

### Antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections and acute bronchitis: A longitudinal analysis of general practitioner trainees [^117248WE]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Most antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and acute bronchitis is inappropriate; substantive and sustained reductions in prescribing are needed to reduce antibiotic resistance. Prescribing habits develop early in clinicians' careers; hence, general practice (GP) trainees are an important group to target.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to establish temporal trends in antibiotic prescribing for URTIs and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis by Australian GP trainees (registrars).

- **Methods**: A longitudinal analysis, conducted from 2010 to 2019, of the Registrars Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) dataset. In ReCEnT, registrars record clinical and educational content of 60 consecutive consultations on three occasions, every six months. Analyses were conducted on new diagnoses of URTI and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis, with the outcome variable being the prescription of a systemic antibiotic. The independent variable of interest was the year of prescribing, modeled as a continuous variable.

- **Results**: A total of 28,372 diagnoses of URTI and 5,289 diagnoses of acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis were recorded by 2,839 registrars. Antibiotic prescribing for URTI decreased from 24% in 2010 to 12% in 2019, while prescribing for acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis decreased from 84% to 72%. The year was significantly negatively associated with antibiotic prescribing for both URTI (odds ratio [OR] 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88–0.93) and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis (OR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88–0.96) in multivariable analysis, representing the mean annual change.

- **Conclusions**: GP registrars' prescribing habits showed a significant decline in antibiotic prescriptions over the study period, indicating the effectiveness of targeted interventions.

### Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116raUXq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are serious conditions predisposing patients to viral and bacterial infections, resulting in potentially fatal acute exacerbations. COPD is defined as a lung disease characterized by obstruction to lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing. Antibiotic therapy has not been particularly useful in eradicating bacteria such as non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) because they are naturally occurring flora of the upper respiratory tract in many people. However, they can cause opportunistic infection. An oral NTHi vaccine has been developed to protect against reinfective acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of an oral, whole-cell, non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) vaccine in protecting against episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD in adults. Additionally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the NTHi vaccine in reducing NTHi colonization of the respiratory tract during episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), CINAHL (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1982 to July 2014), and Web of Science (1955 to July 2014). We also searched trials registries and contacted authors of trials requesting unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of an oral monobacterial NTHi vaccine in adults with recurrent acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD.

### Placebo found equivalent to amoxicillin for treatment of acute bronchitis in Nairobi, Kenya: a triple blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^114W1WAi]. Thorax (2008). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment is not recommended for acute bronchitis in immunocompetent patients in industrialized countries. Whether these recommendations are relevant to the developing world and to immunocompromised patients is unknown.

- **Design, setting and participants**: Randomised, triple blind, placebo-controlled equivalence trial of amoxicillin compared with placebo in 660 adults presenting to two outpatient clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, with acute bronchitis but without evidence of chronic lung disease.

- **Main outcome measure**: The primary study endpoint was clinical cure, as defined by a ≥ 75% reduction in a validated Acute Bronchitis Severity Score by 14 days; analysis was by intention to treat with equivalence defined as ≤ 8% difference between study arms.

- **Results**: Clinical cure rates in the amoxicillin and placebo arms were 81.7% and 84.0%, respectively (difference 2.3%, 95% CI -8.6% to 4.0%). Of 131 HIV-infected subjects (19.8%), cure rates for those randomized to amoxicillin (77.2%) and placebo (83.8%) differed by 6.6% (95% CI -21.7% to 8.6%). Among HIV-uninfected subjects, the difference in cure rates was 1.6% (95% CI -8.5% to 5.3%). Potential drug side effects were similar in the two arms. No subjects required hospitalization or died.

- **Conclusion**: Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis is unhelpful, even in populations with a high prevalence of HIV infection.

### Beta2-agonists for acute bronchitis [^1174NTFh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough of acute bronchitis, and beta2-agonists are often prescribed, perhaps because clinicians suspect many patients also have reversible airflow restriction contributing to the symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether beta2-agonists improve symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Trials in which patients (adults or children over two years of age) who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough (without known pulmonary disease and without other cause) were randomized to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment or alternative treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results; they then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately.

- **Main results**: Two trials in children (n = 109) with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Combined data did not show a significant difference in daily cough scores between patients given oral beta2-agonists and those in the control groups. Five trials in adults (n = 418) with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results, but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor i.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^111Ha4ku]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Most of these infections are self-limiting, and several studies have suggested that the benefit of antimicrobial treatment is marginal. However, most patients with acute bronchitis receive antibiotics, even in countries with low rates of antibiotic prescribing. This over-prescription constitutes a global problem and is an important factor in increasing the levels of antibiotic resistance.

Several approaches for controlling acute cough have included narcotic cough suppressants, expectorants, antihistamines, decongestants, herbal remedies, and β2 agonists. Even though all these drugs are widely prescribed in patients with acute bronchitis, evidence is scant that their use may be helpful for adults with cough. A Cochrane review of the use of antitussives in patients with acute cough showed no clear benefit for the duration of the cough. Some studies did report the beneficial effects of expectorants, but these studies were small and had methodological flaws.

Another Cochrane review of β2 agonists showed little evidence for their efficacy in adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow obstruction. However, their potential benefit in patients without chronic airway disease is not well supported by the data available and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use.

There is therefore an urgent need to identify novel treatment measures to deal with this common infectious disease, particularly in light of growing patient expectations and increasing antibiotic resistance.

### Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113t7aCp]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years, excluding other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (e.g. cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (e.g. genetic and respiratory infections) that result in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathological changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, it is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, provided conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis and to make recommendations useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "chronic bronchitis", and "COPD".

This document is an update of guidelines published in 2005 and now includes scientific publications up to May 2010. It provides evidence-based recommendations for the most common management questions occurring in routine clinical practice in the management of adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Topics include management outside the hospital, management inside the hospital (including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis), and prevention. Background sections and graded evidence tables are also included. The target audience for the guideline is all those whose routine practice includes the management of adult LRTI.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than eight weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Changing the antibiotic prescribing of Australian general practice registrars' for acute respiratory tract infections: A non-randomized controlled trial [^1178oZgM]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription rates for acute bronchitis. There were 3,351 diagnoses of acute bronchitis pre-intervention and 721 post-intervention. Overall, 69.7% of acute bronchitis diagnoses were treated with antibiotics. Characteristics associated with antibiotic prescribing for acute bronchitis, including patient numbers and percentages by treatment and time, are detailed in Table 3. The proportions of antibiotics prescribed for bronchitis by registrars in the control group compared with the intervention group over time are displayed in Figure 1. Pre-intervention, 72.4% of the control and 69.8% of the intervention group bronchitis presentations were treated with antibiotics.

- **Characteristics associated with antibiotic prescribing for acute bronchitis**: The relevant numbers and percentages are provided in Table 3.

- **Proportions of antibiotics prescribed**: Figure 1 illustrates unadjusted (A) and adjusted (B) proportions of antibiotics prescribed for acute bronchitis by intervention over time (main analysis).

Post-intervention, prescribing in the control group increased by 2.1%; however, prescribing in the intervention group decreased by 7.8% (Figure 1A). After adjustment for confounding variables (refer to Table 1), the proportions of bronchitis consultations for which antibiotics were prescribed reduced by 0.6% in the control group and by 7.5% in the intervention group, representing an absolute reduction of 6.9% in the intervention group compared with the control group (Figure 1B). This difference was not statistically significant.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^111FGJZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017); MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017); Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

- **Main results**: We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome needed).

### Feasibility and applicability of antimicrobial stewardship in immunocompromised patients [^111sLzFk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship is the primary intervention in the battle against antimicrobial resistance. However, clinicians often hesitate to apply key antimicrobial stewardship principles to patients with significant immune defects due to a lack of data and fear of adverse outcomes. This review examines evidence regarding the application of stewardship principles to immunocompromised patients, focusing on solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

Recent findings indicate that antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) targeting immunocompromised populations, such as oncology and transplant patients, are gaining traction. Emerging literature suggests that several stewardship interventions can be adapted for immunocompromised hosts to improve antimicrobial utilization, but data supporting improved outcomes remain limited.

The application of antimicrobial stewardship principles to immunocompromised patients is feasible, necessary, and urgent. As stewardship programs gain momentum in diverse healthcare settings, more immunocompromised patients will benefit from their guidance. It is imperative that centers implementing these principles share their experiences and establish collaborative research efforts to advance the knowledge base of antimicrobial stewardship initiatives in immunocompromised host populations, focusing on both programmatic success and patient outcomes.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^115YyrHM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) proposed joint guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in the United States. These guidelines focused on triaging disease severity, using a white blood cell count (WBC) greater than 15,000 × 10⁹/L and a creatinine level more than 1.5 times the baseline value as two thresholds to define severe disease. This approach differed from European guidelines as it offered more definitive criteria for severity triage.

- **Table 3: IDSA and SHEA joint guidelines**: The IDSA/SHEA followed the findings of Zar et al. regarding the treatment of initial infection, recommending oral metronidazole for "mild or moderate" CDI and vancomycin for severe disease. They defined 'severe, complicated' as patients with hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon, and prescribed a higher dose of vancomycin 500 mg by mouth (PO) four times a day (QID) along with intravenous metronidazole 500 mg three times a day (TID). For those with an ileus or unable to take oral intake, rectal instillation of vancomycin was recommended. Additionally, their recommendations for the first recurrence, and for two or more recurrences, were consistent with European guidelines from 2009.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: Review of recent statements and position papers [^114Zrbnc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^116AouQL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015. Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview.

- **Results**: At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we categorized the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, beta2 agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections and acute bronchitis: A longitudinal analysis of general practitioner trainees [^115s7pnr]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Most antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and acute bronchitis is inappropriate. Substantive and sustained reductions in prescribing are needed to reduce antibiotic resistance. Prescribing habits develop early in clinicians' careers; hence, general practice (GP) trainees are an important group to target.

The objective of this study was to establish temporal trends in antibiotic prescribing for URTIs and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis by Australian GP trainees (registrars). A longitudinal analysis was conducted from 2010 to 2019 using the Registrars Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) dataset. In ReCEnT, registrars record clinical and educational content of 60 consecutive consultations on three occasions, six months apart. Analyses focused on new diagnoses of URTI and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis, with the outcome variable being the prescription of systemic antibiotics. The independent variable of interest was the year of prescribing, modeled as a continuous variable.

A total of 28,372 diagnoses of URTI and 5,289 diagnoses of acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis were recorded by 2,839 registrars. Antibiotic prescribing for URTI decreased from 24% in 2010 to 12% in 2019. Prescribing for acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis decreased from 84% to 72%. The year was significantly and negatively associated with antibiotic prescribing for both URTI (odds ratio [OR] 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88–0.93) and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis (OR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88–0.96) on multivariable analysis, with estimates representing the mean annual change.

### Bronchiolitis: From practice guideline to clinical practice [^113gwduM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' clinical practice guideline in bronchiolitis was last updated in 2014 with recommendations to improve care for pediatric patients with bronchiolitis. As most treatments of bronchiolitis are supportive, the guideline minimizes the breadth of treatments previously used and cautions the use of tests and therapies that have a limited evidence base. Emergency physicians must be familiar with the guidelines in order to apply best practices appropriately.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics despite expert recommendations against this practice.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

- **Search strategy**: In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also contacted study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE had previously been searched from 1974 to 2000.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease were selected.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

- **Main results**: Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65, including smokers and non-smokers, were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials varied. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than those receiving a placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: Randomised placebo controlled trial [^113wvMtz]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterised by a cough without pneumonia. It is a prevalent disease and one of the most common reasons for visits in primary care. Patients often return to their doctor or seek other medical help as symptoms may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be bothersome for some patients and could last for up to four weeks or more.

Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsy samples have never shown bacterial invasion. It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response of the epithelium of the bronchi to infections. Microscopic examination shows a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These findings are consistent with proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography.

### Quality and strength of evidence of the Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines [^112vEAXU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

To describe the distribution and temporal trends of the quality and strength of evidence supporting recommendations in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines, guidelines either issued or endorsed by IDSA from March 1994 to July 2009 were evaluated using the IDSA-US Public Health Service Grading System. In this system, the letters A-E signify the strength of the recommendation, and numerals I-III indicate the quality of evidence supporting these recommendations. The distribution of the guideline recommendations among strength of recommendation and quality of evidence classes was quantified, and temporal changes between the first and most recent guideline version were evaluated.

Approximately one-half (median, 50.0%; interquartile range [IQR], 38.1%-58.6%) of the recommendations in the guidelines are supported by level III evidence (derived from expert opinion). Evidence from observational studies (level II) supports 31% of recommendations (median, 30.9%; IQR, 23.3%-43.2%), whereas evidence based on ≥ 1 randomized clinical trial (level I) constitutes 16% of the recommendations (median, 15.8%; IQR, 5.8%-28.3%). The strength of recommendation was mainly distributed among classes A (median, 41.5%; IQR, 28.7%-55.6%) and B (median, 40.3%; IQR, 27.1%-47.9%).

Among guidelines with ≥ 1 revised version, the recommendations moved proportionately toward more level I evidence (+12.4%). Consequently, there was a proportional increase in class A recommendations (+11.1%) with a decrease in class C recommendations (-23.5%).

### What is antimicrobial stewardship [^116ez1RU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Use of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship' has grown exponentially in recent years, typically referring to programmes and interventions that aim to optimize antimicrobial use. Although antimicrobial stewardship originated within human healthcare, it is increasingly applied in broader contexts, including animal health and One Health. As the use of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship' becomes more common, it is important to consider what antimicrobial stewardship is, as well as what it is not.

- **Aims**: To review the emergence and evolution of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship'.
- **Sources**: We searched and reviewed existing literature and official documents, which mostly focused on antibiotics. We contacted the authors of the first publications that mentioned antimicrobial stewardship.

- **Content**: We describe the historical background behind how antimicrobial stewardship came into use in clinical settings. We discuss challenges emerging from the varied descriptions of antimicrobial stewardship in the literature, including an over-emphasis on individual prescriptions, an under-emphasis on the societal implications of antimicrobial use, and language translation problems.

- **Implications**: To help address these challenges, we suggest viewing antimicrobial stewardship as a strategy, a coherent set of actions that promote using antimicrobials responsibly. We stress the continuous need for 'responsible use' to be defined and translated into context-specific and time-specific actions. Furthermore, we present examples of actions that can be undertaken within antimicrobial stewardship.

### Are antibiotics effective in the treatment of acute bronchitis [^111A45hc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In patients without underlying lung disease, antibiotics in acute bronchitis appear to decrease cough, but the clinical significance of this decrease is uncertain. Their use should be weighed against the cost and potential adverse effects for the treatment of a self-limiting disease.

### Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute bronchitis in children and impact on subsequent episodes of care and treatment [^1176odwA]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Low credibility.

This study examines whether inappropriate antibiotic treatment for an initial bout of acute bronchitis in childhood affects patterns of future healthcare utilization and antibiotic prescribing.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with at least one acute bronchitis episode. This episode is defined as the 14-day period following an acute bronchitis visit. The cohort included children born in 2008 and followed through 2015 in a nationally representative commercial claims database. We predicted the likelihood of returning for a subsequent acute bronchitis episode and being prescribed an antibiotic as part of that episode, based on whether or not the child was initially prescribed an antibiotic. The analysis controlled for patient, provider, and practice characteristics.

- **Results**: Children prescribed an antibiotic during their initial acute bronchitis episode were more likely to experience a subsequent acute bronchitis episode (hazard ratio = 1.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.17–1.30) and to receive an antibiotic during the second episode (hazard ratio = 2.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.99–2.28) compared with those not initially prescribed an antibiotic. Children diagnosed with asthma were more likely to return for another acute bronchitis visit but were less likely to receive an antibiotic in the subsequent episode.

- **Conclusions**: Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing during a child's initial acute bronchitis episode predicts the likelihood of subsequent episodes and antibiotic prescriptions. Providers should consider…

### Acute bronchitis: a review of diagnosis and evidence-based management [^111Ltura]. Primary Care Update for Ob/Gyns (2002). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bronchitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bronchitis is a transient inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree in response to infection without a history of chronic pulmonary disease or evidence of pneumonia or sinusitis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common cause of acute bronchitis is viruses (90%), including adenovirus, influenza, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and HSV. Nonviral (10%) causes include bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae) and inhaled lung irritants.

- **Disease course**: Inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree results in acute bronchitis, which causes clinical manifestations of cough (dry or productive), chest tightness, burning with or without wheezing, headache, low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and myalgia.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute bronchitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^112hWrZf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top ten conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians display considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary for its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics, which have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to the prescription of an antibiotic.

### Changes in antimicrobial utilization during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after implementation of a multispecialty clinical guidance team [^112BJo3p]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic may worsen existing antimicrobial resistance through unnecessary antimicrobial use, yet current data on antimicrobial use during COVID-19 are scarce. The potential collateral damage from unnecessary antimicrobial use and the promotion of antimicrobial resistance requires investigation and the development of antimicrobial stewardship interventions to optimize patient outcomes and mitigate downstream effects.

Here, we describe a brief initial increase in antimicrobial use among teams caring for COVID-19 patients compared to those teams' antimicrobial use prior to COVID-19. This was followed by a significant reduction in antimicrobial use over time after implementing facility guidelines reinforced by a multispecialty COVID-19 clinical guidance team that included infectious diseases and antimicrobial stewardship expertise.

Clinical uncertainty arose from the overlap between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia symptoms, as well as limited COVID-19 diagnostics availability, which likely contributed to antimicrobial overuse. The paucity of data on secondary bacterial infection risk and reliance on prior influenza pandemic data further complicated antibiotic management. The implementation of a scheduled, multispecialty, daily COVID-19 huddle with evidence-based facility guidelines allowed for the streamlining of resources and knowledge to support frontline physicians and optimize COVID-19 patient clinical care, including safely de-escalating and stopping antibiotics.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

- **Respiratory viruses**: They appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

- **Pertussis infection**: Present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from non-pertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.

- **Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness**: This appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.

- **Ruling out pneumonia**: This is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.

- **Antibiotic treatment**: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

- **Inhaled albuterol**: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

- **Intervention studies**: These suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education.

### A cluster randomized trial of decision support strategies for reducing antibiotic use in acute bronchitis [^111sWHNv]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

National quality indicators show little change in the overuse of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis. We compared the effect of two decision support strategies on antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 3-arm cluster randomized trial among 33 primary care practices belonging to an integrated healthcare system in central Pennsylvania. The printed decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support for acute cough illness through a print-based strategy. The computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support through an electronic medical record-based strategy. The control sites (11 practices) served as a control arm. Both intervention sites also received clinician education and feedback on prescribing practices, as well as patient education brochures at check-in. Antibiotic prescription rates for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in the winter period (October 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010) following the introduction of the intervention were compared with the previous three winter periods in an intent-to-treat analysis.

- **Results**: Compared with the baseline period, the percentage of adolescents and adults prescribed antibiotics during the intervention period decreased at the printed decision support intervention sites (from 80.0% to 68.3%) and at the computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (from 74.0% to 60.7%) but increased slightly at the control sites (from 72.5% to 74.3%).

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: A consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily through the standardization of initial empirical therapy. However, society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

- **Research question**: There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

- **Study design and methods**: This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

- **Results**: The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

- **Interpretation**: This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.
