## Question

What is the recommended duration of Solu-Medrol for a COPD exacerbation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended duration of Solu‑Medrol (methylprednisolone) for an acute COPD exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the current major guidelines (especially GOLD 2025) say about systemic steroid duration in AECOPD. Then, I should verify the randomized trial evidence (notably REDUCE) that informs a shorter course. Next, I will examine oral versus IV route considerations, including FDA labeling for IV methylprednisolone. After that, I need to check whether tapering is necessary for short courses. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical recommendation with caveats for severe or atypical cases, anchoring to GOLD and REDUCE for consistency and safety [^115pVBZR] [^116yypFs].

> Let me first confirm the overarching principles. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for moderate-to-severe AECOPD because they improve lung function, shorten recovery time, and reduce treatment failure, with guidelines emphasizing short courses and a preference for oral therapy when gastrointestinal function is intact; I need to ensure I anchor this to both GOLD and ATS/ERS statements to avoid route bias [^115pVBZR] [^116heFe3] [^117PBi3B].

> I should now verify the duration recommended by the most current guideline. GOLD 2025 explicitly advises that the typical duration of systemic corticosteroid treatment for COPD exacerbations should not exceed five days; this is the clearest, contemporary duration signal and should guide total course length unless there is a compelling individualized reason to deviate [^115pVBZR].

> Next, I will examine the core RCT supporting a short course. The REDUCE trial demonstrated that 5 days of prednisone 40 mg daily was noninferior to 14 days for preventing relapse, with no signal that tapering was needed after the short course; this supports the ≤ 5-day approach and minimizes corticosteroid exposure and adverse effects, which is clinically meaningful in COPD [^116yypFs] [^113xqzFL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about historical guidance. I initially thought the ATS/ERS 2017 recommendation for "short course (≤ 14 days)" predated the REDUCE trial, implying REDUCE later shifted practice; that would suggest ATS/ERS 2017 could not have incorporated the 5‑day evidence base, which seemed logical at first glance [^115mkeDk].

> Wait, let me verify the timeline and correct myself. The REDUCE trial was published in 2013, so it actually preceded the 2017 ATS/ERS guideline; ATS/ERS still framed a "short course (≤ 14 days)" for ambulatory patients and recommended oral over IV when possible, but subsequent updates in GOLD have crystallized the ≤ 5‑day duration as standard, aligning practice more tightly with REDUCE's evidence base and contemporary stewardship priorities [^116heFe3] [^115pVBZR].

> I will now examine route considerations because the question is framed around IV Solu‑Medrol. I need to check whether IV confers additional benefit over oral; the Cochrane review and ATS/ERS guidance indicate oral and parenteral corticosteroids have comparable efficacy, and oral is preferred when feasible, so IV methylprednisolone should be reserved for patients who cannot take oral agents, with early transition to oral once stable [^117PBi3B] [^116heFe3].

> But wait, what about IV-specific duration limits while the patient is unstable? The FDA labeling for methylprednisolone states that high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient stabilizes, usually not beyond 48–72 hours; this supports a brief IV phase followed by conversion to oral to complete a total course within the ≤ 5‑day window, consistent with GOLD and REDUCE principles [^113fD9UZ] [^115pVBZR] [^116yypFs].

> Let me think about tapering because it often creates confusion. For short systemic courses (≤ 5–7 days), tapering is not required; REDUCE used a 5‑day fixed course without taper and achieved noninferior outcomes, and GOLD's emphasis on abbreviated courses further supports a no‑taper approach in this context, barring special circumstances such as prolonged prior steroid use or adrenal suppression concerns [^116yypFs] [^115pVBZR].

> I should confirm safety trade-offs and the rationale for keeping courses short. Systemic steroids reduce treatment failure but increase adverse events such as hyperglycemia; minimizing exposure via a 5‑day course meaningfully reduces cumulative risk, aligning with both trial data and guideline direction away from prolonged or maintenance oral steroids in COPD [^117PBi3B] [^113Ui3fR].

> Let me reconsider whether any newer dosing frameworks challenge the fixed-dose approach. A recent trial exploring personalized dosing regimens for 5 days in hospitalized AECOPD suggested lower treatment failure versus a fixed-dose equivalent; while interesting, it is not yet practice‑standard and does not undermine the core principle of a short total duration with early oral transition when possible [^111YdfrY].

> Next, I should review and explicitly set aside outdated duration practices. Older or implementation-focused sources that referenced 10–14 day courses reflected earlier eras and have been superseded by REDUCE and the current GOLD guidance; I need to ensure we do not anchor to those longer durations absent a strong individualized indication to do so [^111Erv3q] [^115pVBZR] [^116yypFs].

> Pulling this together into a practical recommendation, I should be precise. For an AECOPD requiring systemic steroids, target a total corticosteroid course of no more than 5 days; if IV Solu‑Medrol is needed initially due to inability to take oral medication, use the IV route briefly, reassessing frequently, and transition to oral as soon as clinically stable — ideally within 48–72 hours — then complete the 5‑day total without taper, consistent with REDUCE and GOLD and with the IV stabilization limit indicated by the FDA label [^115pVBZR] [^116yypFs] [^113fD9UZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure appropriate caveats. In life‑threatening or highly complex exacerbations, dosing and duration can be individualized by a pulmonologist or critical care team, but prolonged systemic steroids should remain the exception; avoid maintenance oral steroids in COPD outside of acute indications, and monitor for adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, fluid retention, and infection risk throughout the short course [^113Ui3fR] [^117PBi3B] [^115pVBZR].

---

The standard duration for Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) in COPD exacerbations is **5 days**, as supported by GOLD 2025 [^115pVBZR] and the REDUCE trial [^116yypFs]. This short course improves FEV1, oxygenation, and recovery [^117PBi3B] while minimizing adverse effects; longer courses are not superior [^116yypFs] and increase harm [^111HgcMr] [^112ajs61]. If therapy is **≤ 5 days**, tapering is unnecessary [^113fD9UZ], and IV therapy should be switched to oral [^116heFe3] as soon as feasible [^114NDCjw].

---

## Recommended duration of solumedrol therapy

- **GOLD 2025 guidelines**: Systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations should be given for **no more than 5 days** [^115pVBZR] to improve FEV1, oxygenation, and recovery [^117PBi3B], and to shorten hospitalization.

- **REDUCE trial**: A 5-day course of 40 mg prednisone daily was noninferior to 14 days [^116yypFs] for re-exacerbation, with fewer steroid-related adverse effects.

- **ERS/ATS 2017 guidelines**: Recommend a short course (≤ 14 days) [^115mkeDk] of oral corticosteroids for ambulatory exacerbations [^116heFe3], with 5 days now standard.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting short-duration therapy

Clinical evidence supporting short-duration therapy includes the **REDUCE trial** [^116yypFs], which found that 5 days of prednisone was comparable to 14 days for time to next exacerbation, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality, while causing fewer adverse effects [^113xqzFL]. According to **meta-analyses**, shorter courses (5–7 days) are as effective as longer courses (10–14 days) for treatment failure, lung function, and symptoms, and are associated with fewer adverse effects [^112ajs61].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged corticosteroid therapy

Prolonged systemic corticosteroids increase:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Higher risk with longer courses [^113jdbvi].

- **Infections**: Greater risk of secondary infections [^111HgcMr] [^112ajs61].

- **Psychiatric effects**: More frequent with extended use [^113jdbvi].

- **Osteoporosis**: Higher fracture risk with chronic exposure.

---

## Clinical factors influencing duration of therapy

Severity of exacerbation may warrant closer monitoring, but a **5-day course remains standard** [^115pVBZR]. Duration is guided by **patient response** — rapid improvement supports 5 days, whereas a slower response may prompt reassessment [^116heFe3]. Comorbidities such as diabetes, osteoporosis, and heightened infection risk favor shorter courses [^113jdbvi]. Patients with frequent prior exacerbations may require individualized plans, though 5 days is typical [^112gGHR2].

---

## Current clinical practice guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommended duration** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| GOLD 2025 | 5 days [^115pVBZR] | Oral preferred [^116heFe3]; IV if oral not feasible |
| ERS/ATS 2017 | ≤ 14 days (typically 5 days) [^115mkeDk] | Oral preferred [^116heFe3]; IV if oral not feasible |
| FDA labeling | 48–72 hours for high-dose IV therapy [^113fD9UZ] | IV or IM |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 5 days of systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations [^116yypFs].

- **Route of administration**: Use oral corticosteroids when feasible [^116heFe3]; switch from IV to oral promptly [^114NDCjw].

- **Tapering**: Not required for courses ≤ 5 days [^113fD9UZ].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for hyperglycemia, infections, and psychiatric effects, especially with longer courses [^113jdbvi].

---

For COPD exacerbations, the standard is **5 days** [^116yypFs] of systemic corticosteroids, balancing efficacy and safety; longer courses do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects [^111HgcMr].

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter [^112ajs61]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

- **Recent findings**: Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for the prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD, and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD, and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115pVBZR]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

The management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes specific strategies for handling acute exacerbations. The GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend considering the administration of systemic corticosteroids for patients experiencing an acute exacerbation. The typical duration for corticosteroid treatment should not exceed five days. This approach aims to improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), enhance oxygenation, and reduce recovery time and the duration of hospitalization.

### Deciding what type of evidence and outcomes to include in guidelines: Article 5 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS/ERS workshop report [^111fiaS5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that healthcare recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the fifth of a series of 14 articles prepared by an international panel to advise guideline developers in respiratory and other diseases on approaches for guideline development. The article focuses on determining what type of evidence and outcomes to include in guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this review, we addressed the following topics and questions:
	1. What methods should be used to select important outcomes?
	2. What types of outcomes should be considered?
	3. What sources of evidence should be considered?
	4. How should the importance of outcomes be ranked?
	5. How to deal with surrogate outcomes.
	6. What issues related to outcomes should be considered in the evidence review?
	7. What quality of evidence should be used?
	8. How to interpret the effect on outcomes.
	9. How to incorporate outcomes related to harm.

	- We based our responses on a PubMed literature review, prior reviews, relevant methodological research, and workshop discussions.

- **Results and discussion**: Guideline panels should use transparent and systematic methods to select both the evidence and important outcomes, with input from groups that represent a wide range of expertise and constituencies. Outcomes should address both benefits and downsides, considering the definitions, severity, and time course of the outcomes.

### Inhaled drugs to reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A network meta-analysis [^113xphgu]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receive inhaled long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Conventional meta-analyses have established that these drugs reduce COPD exacerbations when separately compared with placebo. However, there are relatively few head-to-head comparisons, and conventional meta-analyses focus on single comparisons rather than on a simultaneous analysis of competing drug regimens that would allow for rank ordering of their effectiveness. Therefore, we assessed, using a network meta-analytic technique, the relative effectiveness of the common inhaled drug regimens used to reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and searched existing systematic reviews and electronic databases for randomized trials of ≥ 4 weeks' duration that assessed the effectiveness of inhaled drug regimens on exacerbations in patients with stable COPD. We extracted participant and intervention characteristics from included trials and assessed their methodological quality. For each treatment group, we registered the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation during follow-up. We used treatment-arm based logistic regression analysis to estimate the absolute and relative effects of inhaled drug treatments while preserving randomization within trials.

- **Results**: We identified 35 trials enrolling 26,786 patients with COPD of whom 27% had ≥ 1 exacerbation. All regimens significantly reduced exacerbations compared with placebo, with odds ratios ranging from 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]).

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of single inhaler triple therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: New user cohort study [^117CmkWc]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

The primary outcomes were the first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (effectiveness) and the first admission to hospital with pneumonia (safety). Moderate exacerbations were defined by the fills of prednisone prescribed for 5–14 days (positive predictive value 0.73), and severe COPD exacerbations by admission to hospital with a COPD diagnosis code in the primary position (positive predictive value 0.86 based on ICD-9-CM codes; conversion to ICD-10-CM codes was performed based on clinical review). If a patient met the criteria for both a moderate and severe COPD exacerbation within 14 days of each other, the exacerbation was considered to be severe, starting on the day when the criteria for the exacerbation were first met. This categorization of COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (moderate) versus those requiring admission to hospital (severe) is used in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines and has been widely used in randomized controlled trials and other observational studies.

Admission to hospital with pneumonia was defined based on ICD-10-CM codes (J.09.X1, J10.xx-J18.x, A01.03, A02.22, A37.01, A37.11, A37.81, A37.91, A54.84, B01.2, B05.2, B06.81, B77.81, J85.1, J22) in any position (positive predictive value 0.88 based on ICD-9-CM codes; conversion to ICD-10-CM codes was performed based on clinical review). Patients were followed up for up to one year, the end of data, or until they had an outcome of interest or discontinued treatment (with a grace period of 60 days permitted).

### Inhaled corticosteroid withdrawal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Can IMPACT help [^112zhS1y]? American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The pharmacological strategy to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), is to initiate treatment with long-acting bronchodilators, namely long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), alone or in combination. For patients with frequent COPD exacerbations and significant dyspnea despite these bronchodilators, treatment is intensified to triple therapy by adding inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). These recommendations have remained quite stable over time, although the 2019 recommendations introduce the use of blood eosinophil levels in the decision to add ICSs.

A global phenomenon, however, is the large gap between these recommendations and clinical practice, particularly in respect to the overuse of ICSs. In the United States, the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study) found that 50% of patients were treated with nonindicated ICS-containing regimens. The POPE (Phenotypes of COPD in Central and Eastern Europe) study found that over 50% of nonexacerbators were using ICSs, including 37% on triple therapy. Apart from the absence of effectiveness, a major concern around such nonindicated ICS overuse is the increased risk of pneumonia and of other adverse events associated with ICS.

### Should you recommend inhaled corticosteroids for this patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^113anPoX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures may also contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. At the time of writing, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia.

Here, two experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114Ri8jT]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways, largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke, punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and particularly during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: A state of the art review [^117DMbKt]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are significant events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease, and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: A comprehensive care framework [^11179NH3]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of the disease, reduction of risk factors, management of stable COPD, and prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and healthcare professionals.

Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD.

Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at the prevention and management of exacerbations.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and significant effects due to high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, important controversies in COPD management persist. Traditionally, COPD has been defined using spirometric criteria, but there is a need for more relevant diagnostic methods that can describe COPD severity and comorbidity accurately.

The initiation of interventions earlier in the disease's natural history to slow progression remains debatable. There are ongoing controversies regarding the role of inhaled corticosteroids in managing COPD, and there has been renewed interest in long-term antibiotics for preventing exacerbations. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimal management of acute COPD exacerbations. COPD is complex and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that will, in the future, guide its management.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116gCu8E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition, primarily related to smoking. Acute exacerbations of COPD, usually associated with superimposed infections, are frequent, and systemic corticosteroids are extensively used in their management. They are often combined with other treatments such as antibiotics, oxygen supplementation, and bronchodilators.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcomes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

- **Search strategy**: Searches were conducted using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register, with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomized controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomized controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. The last search was conducted in August 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo control were included. Other interventions, such as bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardized. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data measured but not reported were sought from authors of included studies. Trials were combined using Review Manager for analyses.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies (n = 1081) met the inclusion criteria, and data from 10 studies (n = 1051) were used for analyses. There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.50; 95% confidence.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^112amFJu]. Thorax (2020). Low credibility.

Precision medicine in the prevention of exacerbations is a crucial therapeutic aim in stable COPD. Most available treatments address this to some extent, as demonstrated by RCTs of unselected patients with COPD and frequent exacerbations, as summarized in the ERS/ATS guideline on the prevention of COPD exacerbations and the GOLD document.

More personalized preventive approaches have not been tested yet. However, there is emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for such interventions. Characteristically, a recent report from the AERIS longitudinal cohort suggested that patients tend to experience either bacterial or eosinophilic exacerbations. This group of patients might benefit from different preventive strategies. Consistently, in the Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity in COPD (SUMMIT) trial, the addition of an ICS (fluticasone furoate) led to a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations that were treated with systemic corticosteroids alone or with both antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids, with treatment being decided by the responsible clinician. On the other hand, fluticasone led to a 12% increase in the frequency of exacerbations treated by antibiotics alone, compared with placebo. Data from the Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyrronium vs. Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD exacerbations (FLAME) trial showed that the combination of a long-acting beta-agonist (indacaterol) with a long-acting antimuscarinic (glycopyrronium), compared with the combination of a long-acting beta-agonist (salmeterol) and an ICS resulted in improved outcomes.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114vPCBP]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in the management of acute exacerbations, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend administering inhaled short-acting β-agonists, with or without short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs), as the initial bronchodilators for the treatment of acute exacerbations.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117PBi3B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality, contributing to a long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity, and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment typically includes antibiotics, bronchodilators, and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

- **Search methods**: Searches were conducted using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). References of included studies and trials registries were also checked. The last search was conducted in May 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD were included. Other interventions, such as bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardized for both groups. Clinical studies concerning acute asthma were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration were used.

- **Main results**: Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met the inclusion criteria for the comparison of systemic corticosteroid versus placebo, and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met the inclusion criteria for comparing oral versus parenteral corticosteroids.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the 2020 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend not using maintenance oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD who have a history of severe and frequent exacerbations, despite otherwise optimal therapy.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by a progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services, and society, which is likely to increase in the future. Therefore, it is important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible.

In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and the cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are several barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget), and failure to include the perspective of patients.

- **Guideline implementation**: The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice, and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts.

### Personalized variable vs fixed-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of COPD: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial [^111YdfrY]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD exacerbations decrease treatment failure and shorten the length of hospitalization, yet the optimal dose remains unclear.

- **Research question**: Is personalized-dose corticosteroid administration, according to a dosing scale, more effective than fixed-dose corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbations?

- **Study design and methods**: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial involving in-hospital patients with COPD exacerbations, randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to either the fixed-dose group (receiving the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisolone) or the personalized-dose group for 5 days. The primary endpoint was a composite measure of treatment failure, encompassing both in-hospital treatment failure and medium-term (postdischarge) failure. Secondary endpoints included length of stay and cost.

- **Results**: A total of 248 patients were randomly assigned to the fixed-dose group (n = 124) or personalized-dose group (n = 124). One patient in each group was excluded from the intention-to-treat population due to incorrect initial COPD diagnosis. Therapy failure occurred in 27.6% of the personalized-dose group, compared to 48.8% of the fixed-dose group (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24–0.68; p = 0.001). The in-hospital therapy failure was significantly lower in the personalized-dose group (10.6% vs 24.4%; p = 0.005), whereas the medium-term failure rate, adverse event rate, hospital length of stay, and costs were similar between the two groups.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. The 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113sUdWW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids have raised caution due to their widespread use in patients with COVID-19. Observational studies involving SARS and MERS patients reported no association between systemic corticosteroids (often at high doses) and improved survival. However, these studies suggested corticosteroids induced side effects, including osteonecrosis, and reduced viral clearance. The World Health Organization initially recommended against the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 infections at the beginning of the pandemic, except in two clinical settings: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COPD exacerbations, where specific indications for systemic corticosteroids were recognized.

A large, randomized trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment at 6 mg/day for up to 10 days reduced mortality in patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or oxygen alone. A small observational study also reported that methylprednisolone use was associated with improved survival in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. Further studies indicated the benefits of systemic glucocorticoids in reducing 28-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially those not on IMV or pressor support.

Systemic steroids should be used in COPD exacerbations according to usual indications whether or not there is evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, as there is no evidence that this approach modifies susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or worsens outcomes.

### Meeting the gold standard: COPD treatment in the UK today [^114cEMPx]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Helpful as these recommendations are, they have limitations. Patients recruited in randomized controlled trials may not be 'typical' of those seen in primary care, and stopping existing treatments to permit study entry might affect the trial outcome. The advent of large comprehensive clinical databases allows us to understand what treatment is given to what type of patient and how effective that therapy is in a 'real-world' setting. At the time of writing, the consensus is that patients seen in primary care are (unsurprisingly) less severe than those in secondary care and are over-treated relative to guideline recommendations. However, until now, we have lacked primary care data about the characteristics of COPD patients when a new treatment is initiated and how they subsequently progress compared to patients already receiving therapy.

This deficiency has been remedied by Halpin and colleagues, who report an elegantly conducted and robust analysis of the UK-based Optimum Patient Care Research Database, which contains clinical and prescribing information from 5.8 million socio-economically and geographically diverse patients. Using an index date of January 2014, they identified two groups of COPD patients: 11,409 (cohort 1) with established disease on treatment and 699 (cohort 2) who started a new therapy after the index date. The groups were very similar in terms of their baseline characteristics and level of co-morbidities, with approximately 45% falling into GOLD grade A, 25% grade B, and 15% in the remaining two groups. These data emphasize the differences in the distribution of GOLD grades.

### How do COPD patients respond to exacerbations [^112jU3B6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We analyzed 979 symptomatic days, which were not part of an exacerbation and were preceded by at least three consecutive stable days. A total of 926 (95%) symptomatic days showed an increase in one or more minor symptoms, with the majority, 874 (89%), not accompanied by an increase in major symptoms. On 86 (9%) symptomatic days, there was an increase in one major symptom; on 14 (1.4%) days, an increase in two major symptoms; and on 1 (0.1%) day, an increase in three major symptoms. No data on action measures were available on 4 (0.4%) days.

- **Actions taken by patients**: Figure 2 illustrates the incidence and cumulative incidence, as well as the timing of actions initiated from three days before to ten days after exacerbation onset. The majority of patients experiencing an exacerbation performed type-A (70.7%) and type-B actions (62.7%), while only 17.3% followed with type-C actions. Type-A actions were predominantly taken in the days prior to onset (median -3, IQR -3 to 0), whereas type-B actions were taken at the onset (median 0, IQR -1 to 1). The timing of the 17.3% of patients taking type-C actions did not reveal a clear pattern (median 4, IQR 0.5 to 5.5) in relation to exacerbation onset.

### Association of corticosteroid dose and route of administration with risk of treatment failure in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114NDCjw]. JAMA (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are beneficial for patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their optimal dose and route of administration are uncertain.

- **Objective**: To compare the outcomes of patients treated with low doses of steroids administered orally to those treated with higher doses administered intravenously.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A pharmacoepidemiological cohort study was conducted at 414 US hospitals involving patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD in 2006 and 2007 to a non-intensive care setting and who received systemic corticosteroids during the first 2 hospital days.

- **Main outcome measures**: A composite measure of treatment failure was defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 days of discharge; length of stay and hospital costs were also examined.

Of the 79,985 patients, 73,765 (92%) were initially treated with intravenous steroids, whereas 6,220 (8%) received oral treatment. We found that 1.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.3%-1.5%) of the intravenously and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-1.2%) of the orally treated patients died during hospitalization. Additionally, 10.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.1%) of the intravenously and 10.3% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.0%) of the orally treated patients experienced the composite outcome. After multivariable adjustment, including the propensity for oral treatment, the risk of treatment failure among patients treated orally was not worse than for those treated intravenously.

### Inhaled drugs to reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^113P3L9V]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receive inhaled long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Conventional meta-analyses have established that these drugs reduce COPD exacerbations when separately compared with a placebo. However, there are relatively few head-to-head comparisons, and conventional meta-analyses focus on single comparisons rather than on a simultaneous analysis of competing drug regimens that would allow rank ordering of their effectiveness. Therefore, we assessed, using a network meta-analytic technique, the relative effectiveness of the common inhaled drug regimens used to reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and searched existing systematic reviews and electronic databases for randomized trials of ≥ 4 weeks' duration that assessed the effectiveness of inhaled drug regimens on exacerbations in patients with stable COPD. We extracted participant and intervention characteristics from included trials and assessed their methodological quality. For each treatment group, we registered the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation during follow-up. We used treatment-arm-based logistic regression analysis to estimate the absolute and relative effects of inhaled drug treatments while preserving randomization within trials.

- **Results**: We identified 35 trials enrolling 26,786 patients with COPD, of whom 27% had ≥ 1 exacerbation. All regimens reduced exacerbations statistically significantly compared with placebo (odds ratios ranging from 0.71 (95% confidence interval.

### New developments in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115TduAZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which were previously a poorly defined and understood entity. The application of better study designs and new research methodologies has significantly contributed to the understanding of the pathogenesis of this common clinical syndrome.

Recent findings suggest that inflammation is a significant component of the pathogenesis of COPD, with exacerbations likely representing acute increases in airway inflammation triggered by one or more etiological agents. Epidemiological studies have linked environmental particulates and gaseous pollutants to increased respiratory symptoms and mortality in COPD. Bacterial, viral, and atypical pathogens, either alone or in combination, are responsible for inducing the majority of acute exacerbations.

A bacterial cause for a substantial proportion of exacerbations is now firmly established through studies involving bronchoscopy, molecular epidemiology, immunology, and airway inflammation. Future research should focus on the pathogenic mechanisms and host defense against microbial pathogens associated with acute exacerbations of COPD, with the aim of developing better treatment and prevention strategies.

### Inhaled corticosteroid withdrawal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Can IMPACT help [^115SQa5w]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Another potentially strategic marker is the occurrence of an early exacerbation. Indeed, we previously showed that the difference in the occurrence of the first exacerbation between LAMA–LABA and triple therapy is only observed in the first month of follow-up, with equal occurrence in the subsequent 11 months. This suggests that there is a subset of patients who are harmed early by ICS withdrawal, whereas the remaining patients are equally safe when stepped down to LAMA–LABA therapy. Figure E1 of Han and colleagues shows that early exacerbators (in the first month) represent approximately 20% of the 1,481 patients randomly allocated to LAMA–LABA, whereas for the remaining 80%, the effectiveness is similar between LAMA–LABA and triple therapy. The analysis of Han and colleagues that excludes early exacerbations, rather than early exacerbators (likely the frequent exacerbators), falls short of addressing this issue.

In all, this analysis of the IMPACT trial by Han and colleagues provides some useful information on the potential effects of ICS withdrawal on the risk of exacerbations in COPD. However, the skewed patient population resulted in greatly different results from trials specifically aimed at studying ICS withdrawal. Moreover, by pooling rather than splitting, this analysis fails to identify the key patient groups who could benefit from ICS withdrawal or from continuation. Indeed, stratified analyses by characteristics such as a history of asthma, GOLD grade severity of airway obstruction, exacerbation frequency, and the degree of eosinophilia, as well as a study of the results…

### Diagnosis and management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society [^111n1mZL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This guideline is an official statement of the American College of Physicians (ACP), American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS). It represents an update of the 2007 ACP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is intended for clinicians who manage patients with COPD. This guideline addresses the value of history and physical examination for predicting airflow obstruction; the value of spirometry for screening or diagnosis of COPD; and COPD management strategies. Specifically, it evaluates various inhaled therapies, including anticholinergics, long-acting β-agonists, and corticosteroids, as well as pulmonary rehabilitation programs and supplemental oxygen therapy.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a targeted literature update from March 2007 to December 2009 to evaluate the evidence and update the 2007 ACP clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and management of stable COPD.

	- **Recommendation 1**: ACP, ACCP, ATS, and ERS recommend that spirometry should be obtained to diagnose airflow obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Spirometry should not be used to screen for airflow obstruction in individuals without respiratory symptoms (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

	- **Recommendation 2**: For stable COPD patients with respiratory symptoms and FEV(1) between 60% and 80% predicted, ACP, ACCP, ATS, and ERS suggest treatment with inhaled bronchodilators.

### Effect of corticosteroids on exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116YxUPz]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Periodic exacerbations of disease severity, which may lead to hospitalization, are characteristic of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and become more prevalent as disease severity increases. Oral corticosteroids increase the rate of resolution of these episodes in both diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective at conventional doses and are not recommended as primary treatment for exacerbations of either disease. Maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduces the chance that further exacerbations will occur in asthma.

Increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids are generally more effective than placebo therapy in preventing exacerbations, at least until patients become persistently symptomatic and regular users of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Thereafter, the gains from doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy are modest and generally inferior to those resulting from adding other anti-inflammatory or bronchodilator agents to the treatment regime. The reduction in the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled corticosteroids, compared with placebo, ranges from 15 to 20% in COPD versus almost 50% in severe asthma. However, given the impact of exacerbations on overall quality of life in COPD, even this modest reduction is likely to be clinically important.

### Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^1111sq6d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Patients whose pharmacological treatment is modified should be closely monitored. Treatment escalation has not been systematically tested, and trials of de-escalation are limited to withdrawing ICS. As indicated in Figure 4, ICS de-escalation can be considered if pneumonia or other considerable side effects develop. In case of a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/μl, ICS de-escalation is more likely to be associated with the development of exacerbations. Finally, if a patient with COPD and no features of asthma has already been treated — for whatever reason — with LABA + ICS and is well-controlled in terms of symptoms and exacerbations, then LABA + ICS could be continued. However, if they remain dyspneic, switching to LABA + LAMA should be considered, and if they have further exacerbations, treatment should be escalated to LABA + LAMA + ICS.

- **Other therapeutic considerations**: The eosinophil as a useful clinical biomarker. As in previous GOLD reports, the main factors to consider in deciding whether to initiate ICS treatment are the patient's previous exacerbation history and the blood eosinophil count (Figure 5). Adding ICS has little or no effect at a blood eosinophil count of < 100 cells/μl, whereas blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μl identify patients with a strong likelihood of treatment benefit. There is a continuous gradation of the preventive effect of ICSs in patients with eosinophil counts between 100 and 300 cells/μl, so some patients are likely to benefit from adding ICSs. Treatment decisions can be based on historical eosinophil counts, as the repeatability of blood eosinophil counts is well-documented.

### Once-daily long-acting beta₂-agonists/inhaled corticosteroids combined inhalers versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117S2z39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Three classes of inhaler medication are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). To encourage patient adherence, two classes of medication are often combined in a single medication device. It appears that once-daily dosing offers the greatest convenience to patients and may significantly influence adherence.

- **Objectives**: To compare a once-daily combination of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta₂-agonist inhalers (ICS/LABA) versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists alone (LAMA) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Search methods**: We performed an electronic search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group (14 May 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (14 May 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (20 September 2017), followed by a search of other resources, including reference lists of included studies and manufacturers' trial registers (10 October 2017). Two pairs of review authors screened and scrutinized selected articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily administered ICS/LABA and LAMA in adults with COPD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in each study. We analysed dichotomous data as random-effects odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), both with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), using Review Manager software.

### Improving adherence for management of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111Erv3q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend administering 40–60 mg of prednisone equivalent for 10–14 days to patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the amount of corticosteroid prescribed varies widely in clinical practice. We utilized the electronic health record to implement an evidence-based order set, aiming to standardize the treatment of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.

- **Methods**: This is a pre- and post-intervention study on patients hospitalized between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2012, with a primary discharge diagnosis of COPD (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code: 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496), who received at least one dose of corticosteroid at our tertiary care hospital. Data on baseline demographics and corticosteroid dose in prednisone equivalent administered during the first 48 hours and the entire hospitalization were collected from the electronic health record. Evidence-based guidelines were used to build and implement acute exacerbation of COPD management electronic order sets in our electronic health record, Epic (Verona, WI). The study was divided into two periods: pre-intervention (January 1, 2009, through February 28, 2011; n = 203) and post-intervention (March 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012; n = 217). The primary outcome measure was corticosteroid dose administered in the first 48 hours. Secondary outcome measures included corticosteroid dosage during the entire hospitalization, length of stay, hospital follow-up rates, and 30-day readmission rates.

### Similarities and differences in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^113mAc9H]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

There is no generally accepted definition of an exacerbation for either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A lack of consistency exists among the symptomatic or functional criteria used in different studies. The most consistent criterion is the introduction of systemic corticosteroids for the acute worsening of the disease. The time course of an exacerbation does not seem to differ much between asthma and COPD. However, the decrease in peak flow rate is more pronounced in asthma than in COPD.

The frequency of exacerbations is linked to disease severity in both asthma and COPD. Common causes include viral infections and increased environmental air pollution, whereas allergen exposure and bacterial infections are more specific to asthma and COPD exacerbations, respectively. Few data are available about the airway pathology of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Eosinophilia and/or neutrophilia have been associated with exacerbations in both diseases.

- **Avoidance of the causal factors**: Decreases exacerbation rate in both diseases.
- **Pharmacologic prevention in asthma**: Shown effective for inhaled corticosteroids, combination therapy with long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, and monoclonal anti-IgE.
- **Pharmacologic prevention in COPD**: Inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists, combination therapy with both, and the long-acting inhaled anticholinergic tiotropium decrease the exacerbation rate.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111gEY5L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The studies available at the time of writing used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks (and different responses to pharmacotherapy) for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk, patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk, and patients with two or more exacerbations per year or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking with regard to the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies, such as pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions, with larger sample sizes, should be conducted in real-life situations involving patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, smokers, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

- **Question**: In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), should the ICS be withdrawn?

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113jdbvi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included, but was not limited to, hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or the initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low" and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad confidence intervals around the point estimates.

### Steroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Are nebulized and systemic forms comparable [^111B8w7L]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are strongly recommended in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As COPD patients are usually elderly and relatively immobile, the side effects of systemic corticosteroids frequently outweigh their beneficial effects. Conversely, nebulized corticosteroid solutions have a negligible systemic side-effect profile. This review summarizes the role of nebulized corticosteroids as an alternative during exacerbation periods of COPD.

- **Recent findings**: The number of trials in the literature is increasing. High dose nebulized budesonide has been found as effective as systemic corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD. Specifically, the side-effect profile, particularly concerning blood glucose levels, is better for nebulized budesonide.

- **Summary**: Findings from recent studies provide a positive impression of the role of high dose nebulized budesonide in exacerbations of COPD. However, larger and statistically high-powered trials testing different types of nebulized corticosteroid solutions with varying dosages are still lacking. Before recommending the routine use of nebulized corticosteroids in exacerbations, present findings need to be confirmed with further high-quality studies.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: The evidence base [^115hpsKm]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of these drugs would seem intuitive; however, there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by these drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement, such as dyspnea reduction, is certainly a strong reason to use these agents.

- **Evidence for stable COPD management**: The two most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations.

- **Management of acute exacerbations**: In the case of acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the extensive literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

### Systemic corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews [^111eUZgB]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by symptoms of cough, sputum, and breathlessness, which become worse during acute exacerbations. The airway inflammation associated with COPD has led to trials assessing the effect of systemic corticosteroids in COPD, as reviewed in two Cochrane systematic reviews.

In stable COPD, oral corticosteroid treatment, compared with placebo, increased mean FEV(1) by 53 mL and mean 12-minute walking distance by 29 meters, but it also raised the risk of any drug-related adverse event (OR 7.8). In cases of acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroids decreased the likelihood of treatment failure (OR 0.48), improved mean FEV(1) at 72 hours by 140 ml, and enhanced arterial blood gases, though they increased the risk of drug-related adverse events (OR 2.3).

Thus, the treatment of both stable COPD and acute exacerbations with systemic corticosteroids results in statistically significant average benefits but at an increased risk of adverse events. In stable COPD, there is little support for the use of systemic corticosteroid treatment since data on long-term outcomes are lacking. For acute exacerbations, the evidence supporting the use of systemic corticosteroids is stronger; however, further research is needed to define the optimal dose, route, and duration.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

This study aims to investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases exposure to steroids. The REDUCE (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD) trial is a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial held in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals. It enrolled 314 patients, all past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Patients were treated with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

The main outcome measured was the time to the next exacerbation within 180 days. Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) were admitted to the hospital; 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; p = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to [data truncated].

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: A need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing significantly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations.

This review offers practical information on the definition of exacerbations in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. It is therefore important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting.

Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practices for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116VjHs8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically concerning the management of acute exacerbations, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend the administration of antibiotics for an acute exacerbation of COPD. This is advised for patients with increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Antibiotic selection should be based on local resistance patterns. Empiric options include amoxicillin/clavulanate, macrolides, tetracyclines, or, in selected cases, quinolones.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112gGHR2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who experience dyspnea or exercise intolerance, it is recommended to use a combination therapy of long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) over LABA or LAMA monotherapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

For patients with COPD who experience dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, it is suggested to use triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA. This is particularly for patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

For patients with COPD on triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), it is suggested that ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

No specific recommendation is made for, or against the use of ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization. For these patients, ICS as an additive therapy is suggested (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

For patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy is advised against (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

### International differences in the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations reported in three clinical trials [^112gRi75]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based treatment. It is now customary to conduct large, complex studies to identify therapies that reduce the incidence of clinically important but infrequent events like death, hospitalization, or symptomatic deterioration. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations are important because they drive clinical and physiological deterioration as well as healthcare costs. However, the interpretation of exacerbation data in clinical trials has proven to be very complex. Exacerbations are not normally distributed over time, and their occurrence can lead to behavioral changes such as leaving the trial. Further, the operational identification of an exacerbation's presence and severity relies on the post hoc determination of a new therapeutic intervention. The determinants of this therapeutic decision have not been studied in detail, and physicians in different countries might choose to manage the same event differently. Moreover, exacerbations may be under or overreported when determined only by patient-reported symptom variability and the specific treatment initiated.

Although some studies have relied on complex statistical models that address the problem of the patient's individual propensity to exacerbate, other studies have focused on identifying differences in the time to first exacerbation. Even when using these approaches, large numbers of patients are needed to provide sufficient statistical power for a proper test of the null hypothesis when exacerbation is an outcome.

### Exacerbation-like events in the 12 months prior to identification of chronic respiratory conditions in a primary care population [^113x9mAx]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Initial chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) pharmacotherapy is based on symptom burden and exacerbation history. The inclusion of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended only for those with a history of exacerbations. This brief report highlights that among individuals with previously unrecognized COPD, about 1 in 5 have one or more exacerbation-like events, and about 1 in 10 have two or more events in the prior 12 months, whether or not they self-report concomitant asthma. Closer attention to prior exacerbation-like event history might lead to more guideline-concordant care.

In addition, there are two other groups that have impaired but non-obstructive spirometry, some of whom with significant respiratory symptom burden have frequencies of exacerbation-like events similar to those meeting COPD spirometry criteria. At the time of writing, we have little guidance for the treatment of these individuals.

### Role of corticosteroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115jaowF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has become increasingly commonplace over the past two decades. This practice was controversial because a number of small clinical trials provided inconclusive evidence about efficacy. Experience from recent trials indicates that systemic corticosteroids are modestly effective in this setting.

- **Effectiveness**: Systemic corticosteroids administered to hospitalized patients reduce the absolute treatment rate by about 10%, increase the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by about 100 mL, and shorten the hospital stay by 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not extend longer than 2 weeks. The optimal starting dose is not known.

- **Complications**: Hyperglycemia and possibly an increased rate of secondary infections are expected complications of treatment.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^111ZMHsZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort by a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers, along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the expert panel. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

- **Results**: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations:
	1. A strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance.
	2. A conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year.
	3. A conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year.
	4. No recommendation for, or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting therapies.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113BMexK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically concerning pharmacological agents, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend not using statins for the prevention of exacerbations in patients with COPD who are at increased risk of exacerbation and have no indications for statin therapy. The guidelines recognize that statins may have positive effects on some outcomes in patients with COPD who are receiving statins for cardiovascular and metabolic indications.

### Pharmacologic therapies in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^111HgcMr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by frequent exacerbations. This review aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events (AEs) of pharmacologic interventions for adults experiencing an exacerbation of COPD.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches were conducted across several bibliographic sources, covering from database inception to 2 January 2019.

- **Study selection**: The analysis included 68 randomized controlled trials that enrolled adults with COPD exacerbations treated in out- or inpatient settings, excluding intensive care. The studies compared pharmacologic therapies against placebos, "usual care", or other pharmacologic interventions.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality and strength of evidence (SOE).

- **Data synthesis**:
	- Compared with a placebo or management without antibiotics, antibiotics administered for 3 to 14 days were linked to increased resolution of exacerbations by the end of the intervention (odds ratio [OR], 2.03 [95% CI, 1.47 to 2.80]; moderate SOE) and reduced treatment failure (OR, 0.54 [CI, 0.34 to 0.86]; moderate SOE), independent of exacerbation severity in outpatients and inpatients.
	- Systemic corticosteroids, given for 9 to 56 days in outpatients and inpatients when compared to placebo, were associated with reduced treatment failure by the end of the intervention (OR, 0.01 [CI, 0.00 to 0.13]; low SOE), but also resulted in a higher occurrence of total and endocrine-related AEs.
	- Compared with placebo or usual care in inpatients, other pharmacologic interventions (aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, anti-inflammatory agents) were evaluated.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: A state of the art review [^112xFViT]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms and often associated with deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. These exacerbations are primarily caused by insults that increase airway inflammation, mainly episodes of bronchial infection, pollutants, or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although exacerbations generally become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are significant differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients. Patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype, prone to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality. They are, therefore, a particularly important group to target with the exacerbation prevention strategies described below. Emerging evidence suggests that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may also be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events that can range from minor increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, although some may last considerably longer, and a proportion of patients might never completely return to their baseline.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^114EwRAi]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. An exacerbation of COPD — characterized by periodic escalations of symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and sputum production — is a major contributor to worsening lung function, impaired quality of life, and increased necessity for urgent care or hospitalization, as well as an escalated cost of care in COPD. Research conducted over the past decade has enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of COPD. Additionally, there is an accumulating body of literature concerning the prevention of acute exacerbations.

- **Methods**: In recognition of the importance of preventing exacerbations in patients with COPD, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) developed a joint evidence-based guideline, known as the AECOPD Guideline. This guideline serves as a practical, clinically useful document describing the current state of knowledge regarding prevention of acute exacerbations, categorized by major types of prevention therapies. Three key clinical questions were developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format to address prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD through nonpharmacologic therapies, inhaled therapies, and oral therapies. Recognized document evaluation tools were used to assess and select the most appropriate studies, extract meaningful data, and grade the level of evidence supporting recommendations in each PICO question in a balanced and unbiased manner.

### Outpatient oral prednisone after emergency treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115cHPWe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effectiveness of prednisone in reducing the risk of relapse after outpatient exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was studied.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 147 patients who were being discharged from the emergency department after an exacerbation of COPD and randomly assigned them to 10 days of treatment with 40 mg of oral prednisone once daily or an identical-appearing placebo. All patients received oral antibiotics for 10 days, plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary endpoint was relapse, defined as an unscheduled visit to a physician's office or a return to the emergency department because of worsening dyspnea, within 30 days after randomization.

- **Results**: The overall rate of relapse at 30 days was lower in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (27 percent vs. 43 percent, P = 0.05), and the time to relapse was prolonged in those taking prednisone (P = 0.04). After 10 days of therapy, patients in the prednisone group had greater improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second than did patients in the placebo group (mean [± SD] increase from baseline, 34 ± 42 percent vs. 15 ± 31 percent; P = 0.007). Patients in the prednisone group also had significant improvements in dyspnea, as measured by the transitional dyspnea index (P = 0.04) and by the dyspnea domain of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Index Questionnaire (P = 0.02), but not in health-related quality of life (P = 0.14).

- **Conclusions**: Outpatient treatment with oral prednisone offers a small advantage over placebo in treating patients with COPD exacerbations.

### International differences in the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations reported in three clinical trials [^1142cP1X]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are an important endpoint in multinational clinical treatment trials, but the observed event rate is often lower than anticipated and appears to vary between countries. We investigated whether systematic differences in national exacerbation rates might explain this observed variation.

- **Methods**: We reviewed data from three large multicenter international randomized trials conducted over an 18-year period with different designs and clinical severities of COPD. These trials compared bronchodilator and/or inhaled corticosteroids with bronchodilators alone and/or placebo. Exacerbations were defined by antibiotic and/or oral corticosteroid use (moderate) or need for hospitalization (severe). We calculated crude exacerbation rates in the 30 countries contributing 30 or more patients to at least two trials and grouped data by exacerbation rate based on their first study contribution.

- **Measurements and main results**: For the 29,756 patients in 41 countries analyzed, the mean exacerbation rate was two- to threefold different between the highest and lowest tertiles of the recruiting nations. These differences were not explained by demographic features, study protocol, or reported exacerbation history at enrollment. Of the 18 countries contributing to all trials, half of those in the highest and half in the lowest tertiles of exacerbation history remained in these groups across trials. Severe exacerbations showed a different rank order internationally. Countries contributing to COPD trials differ consistently in their exacerbation rates.

### Solu-medrol [^113fD9UZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized, usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.

For other indications, the initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.

Situations that may necessitate dosage adjustments include changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If, after long-term therapy, the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.
