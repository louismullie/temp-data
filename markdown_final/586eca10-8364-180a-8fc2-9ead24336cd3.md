## Question

Can dehydration be a cause of low blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dehydration can cause low blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking dehydration to blood pressure. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence across populations and settings. Next, I will distinguish dehydration from related concepts like volume depletion and orthostatic hypotension. After that, I should review counterexamples where dehydration coexists with normal or high blood pressure. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and management implications.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis. Dehydration reduces total body water, which lowers plasma volume and decreases preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output. According to the Frank-Starling relationship, reduced cardiac output lowers arterial pressure unless compensated by increased systemic vascular resistance, which explains why dehydration can precipitate hypotension, especially when compensatory mechanisms are impaired or overwhelmed.

> Wait, let me verify the clinical magnitude and contexts. Multiple authoritative sources explicitly list dehydration as a cause of low blood pressure: FDA labeling for common antihypertensives warns that dehydration from vomiting or diarrhea increases the risk of hypotension. Occupational heat-safety guidance notes hypotension among signs of dehydration. And syncope guidelines identify dehydration as a leading cause of orthostatic hypotension and recommend fluid resuscitation for dehydration-related syncope, underscoring causality in real-world settings [^115KkHZg] [^115TdL4q] [^114JYz2i] [^113JyHxP] [^1154R6FD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should distinguish dehydration from related entities. Dehydration is a water deficit that can be hypertonic or isotonic, whereas volume depletion refers to extracellular fluid loss that reduces intravascular volume. Both can lower blood pressure, but the hemodynamic patterns and treatment differ, and clinicians often conflate them, which can mislead management if not clarified at the bedside [^112sEDU7] [^117WmH9m].

> I need to check special populations and edge cases. In older adults, dehydration is common and clinically consequential, contributing to orthostatic hypotension, falls, and acute kidney injury. Guidelines for geriatric orthostatic hypotension emphasize hydration strategies and salt intake to expand plasma volume and mitigate postural drops, reinforcing dehydration's causal role in low blood pressure in this group [^112sPbZh] [^113oZczM] [^115wrvSZ].

> But wait, what if dehydration coexists with normal or high blood pressure? I should double-check counterexamples. In severe pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis, many children are profoundly dehydrated yet present with hypertension, likely due to catecholamine surge and osmotic shifts. Similarly, cold-induced dehydration has been associated with increased blood pressure in some studies, illustrating that dehydration's net effect on blood pressure depends on concurrent neurohormonal drivers and vascular tone [^114ADh3g] [^1149EFq5] [^112uiifc].

> Let me consider compensatory physiology to reconcile this. Mild to moderate dehydration triggers vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which promote vasoconstriction and sodium retention to defend blood pressure. Thus, dehydration may not always manifest as overt hypotension unless the deficit is severe, the patient is vulnerable (elderly, autonomic failure, on vasodilators), or there is an orthostatic challenge that outpaces compensation [^112iAKT3] [^115Ehyge] [^114X6VdR].

> I should confirm practical clinical implications. In patients with syncope, dizziness, or falls, especially older adults or those on blood pressure–lowering drugs, dehydration should be treated as a reversible contributor to low blood pressure. Acute water ingestion can acutely raise systolic blood pressure by about 30–35 mmHg via an osmopressor effect, and structured salt and fluid strategies improve orthostatic tolerance, while fluid resuscitation is recommended for dehydration-related syncope, with sodium-containing fluids restoring volume more efficiently than water alone [^113bgAtd] [^113JyHxP] [^1154R6FD] [^1166gS91].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: Yes, dehydration can cause low blood pressure, primarily by reducing plasma volume and cardiac output, with risk modulated by severity, comorbidities, medications, and posture. Clinically significant hypotension is more likely in vulnerable populations and when dehydration is moderate to severe or provoked orthostatically, whereas mild dehydration may be compensated and not overtly hypotensive, and in select states like pediatric DKA or cold exposure, dehydration may coexist with hypertension due to countervailing neurohormonal mechanisms [^112iAKT3] [^114Jn3rE] [^114JYz2i] [^114ADh3g] [^112uiifc].

Dehydration causes low blood pressure by reducing **plasma volume** [^112iAKT3], which lowers cardiac output and triggers **compensatory vasodilation** [^notfound]; when these fail, hypotension results [^115KkHZg]. This is especially risky in older adults [^112sPbZh], patients with autonomic dysfunction [^112Be1tQ], or those on diuretics or vasodilators [^114Jn3rE]. Management centers on **prompt rehydration** [^113JyHxP] and correcting the cause; **oral rehydration** is first-line when feasible, with **IV isotonic fluids** for severe cases or when oral intake is not possible [^1154R6FD].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking dehydration to low blood pressure

Dehydration reduces **total body water**, lowering plasma volume and cardiac output; this activates baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction and the RAAS to maintain BP [^112iAKT3]. If volume loss exceeds compensatory capacity, **hypotension** occurs [^115KkHZg].

---

### Reduction in plasma volume

Loss of extracellular fluid decreases **plasma volume**, lowering preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output, which reduces arterial pressure unless compensated by increased systemic vascular resistance [^112iAKT3].

---

### Compensatory mechanisms

- **Baroreflex activation**: Detects reduced stretch and increases sympathetic tone, causing vasoconstriction and tachycardia to maintain BP [^113REeYF].
- **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**: Sodium and water retention restore volume but may be inadequate in severe dehydration [^115Ehyge].
- **Vasopressin secretion**: Promotes water retention and vasoconstriction, helping preserve volume and BP [^115SgcDN].

---

### Failure of compensatory mechanisms

When dehydration is severe or prolonged, compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to **hypotension**, orthostatic intolerance, and shock [^115KkHZg].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the relationship between dehydration and low blood pressure

Multiple studies and guidelines confirm dehydration as a **cause of hypotension**:

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Dehydration is a common cause of orthostatic hypotension, especially in older adults and those on diuretics or vasodilators [^115KkHZg] [^114DPCJ5].
- **Syncope**: Dehydration-related syncope is well recognized, and fluid resuscitation is recommended for acute dehydration [^113JyHxP] [^1154R6FD].
- **Critical illness**: Dehydration contributes to hypotension in sepsis, trauma, and burns, requiring careful fluid management [^116DR42o] [^114P8Wsu].

---

## Populations at increased risk

Certain groups are at **higher risk** of dehydration-induced hypotension:

| **Population** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Older adults | - Impaired thirst <br/> - Reduced renal function <br/> - Comorbidities <br/> - Polypharmacy [^112sPbZh] [^115VQSyi] |
| Patients with autonomic dysfunction | - Impaired baroreflex <br/> - Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^112Be1tQ] [^115KkHZg] |
| Patients on diuretics or vasodilators | - Exacerbated volume depletion <br/> - Hypotension [^114Jn3rE] [^115TdL4q] |
| Athletes and outdoor workers | - Excessive sweating <br/> - Inadequate fluid intake [^116iMWBU] [^114JYz2i] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing dehydration as a cause of hypotension guides **management**:

- **Assessment**: Evaluate volume status with history, exam, and orthostatic vitals; consider serum electrolytes and renal function [^114sYtpa] [^1166KbeX].
- **Fluid replacement**: Oral rehydration is first-line; use IV isotonic fluids for severe cases or when oral intake is not possible [^1154R6FD] [^1166gS91].
- **Address underlying causes**: Treat vomiting, diarrhea, or medication-induced fluid loss [^115u1rDk].
- **Monitor response**: Track BP, heart rate, urine output, and electrolytes to guide ongoing therapy [^111b4Ryv].

---

## Conclusion

Dehydration causes low blood pressure primarily by **reducing plasma volume** and overwhelming compensatory mechanisms. This is especially consequential in vulnerable populations and when volume loss is severe. Prompt recognition and **targeted rehydration** — oral when feasible, IV when needed — are essential to restore volume and prevent complications [^113JyHxP] [^1154R6FD].

### Renin: friend or foe? [^115Ehyge]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Renin maintains blood pressure through vasoconstriction when there is inadequate salt to maintain volume. In populations where blood pressure is more often high than low, and vascular death more common than haemorrhage or dehydration, therapeutic reductions in renin secretion or response are valuable. Whether long-term benefits are due entirely to blood pressure reduction remains unproved. The pathway can be blocked at its rate-limiting step (beta blockade or direct renin inhibition), the synthesis of the active product, angiotensin II, or at the receptor for angiotensin. Because renin and sodium are the two main factors in blood pressure control, and renin levels vary inversely with sodium load, blood pressure control requires a combination of natriuresis and blocking the consequential increase in renin activity. Being a large and stable molecule, renin is among the easiest and cheapest of hormone measurements. Understanding the simple biochemistry and physiology of renin permits optimal use of the drugs acting to raise or suppress this hormone.

From a pragmatic standpoint, the impact of hypotension must be assessed according to the vintage of treatment introduction: if hypotension occurs a few days after increasing the treatment dose, it is likely that treatment is the cause of hypotension. In contrast, when doses have been stable over a long period, other causes of hypotension should always be investigated (fever, diarrhoea, other new drugs, dehydration, etc.) rather than systematically and permanently decreasing treatment dose.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^114P8Wsu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

### Food as medicine for hypertension: microbiota as mediators [^112iAKT3]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Water

Water intake plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation. Adequate hydration sustains optimal blood volume, which directly affects blood pressure. Dehydration may result in decreased blood volume, potentially leading to hypotension. Inadequate water intake triggers vasopressin release, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. In addition, dehydration activates renin angiotensin aldosterone system, enhancing sodium retention and vasoconstriction. On the contrary, a randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted over 12 weeks by Nakamura et aldemonstrated that increasing water intake by 2.0 L/d lowered systolic blood pressure in normotensive individuals. Water intake influences gut microbiota composition and function through its effects on intestinal environment, mucus integrity, and microbial metabolism. Adequate hydration maintains the gut's protective mucus layer, which supports commensal bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin degrader, and inhibits pathogen adhesion. Water has also been reported to facilitate the transport of fermentable substrates such as fiber to colonic bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Roseburia, boosting production of SCFAs. In addition, it regulates colonic pH, favoring lactic acid bacteria (eg, Lactobacillus) over alkaliphilic pathogens. A 2023 randomized controlled trial revealed that adults drinking > 3 liters of water per day exhibited 15% elevated fecal Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium compared with low-intake groups (≤ 1.5 liters per day).

### Guanfacine (guanfacine extended-release) [^117Qdw3M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking guanfacine extended-release tablets?

Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how guanfacine extended-release tablets affect you. Guanfacine extended-release tablets can slow your thinking and motor skills.
Do not drink alcohol or take other medicines that make you sleepy or dizzy while taking guanfacine extended-release tablets until you talk with your doctor. Guanfacine extended-release tablets taken with alcohol or medicines that cause sleepiness or dizziness may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse.
Do not become dehydrated or overheated. This may increase your chance of having low blood pressure or fainting while taking guanfacine extended-release tablets.
Do not suddenly stop guanfacine extended-release tablets. Tell your healthcare provider if you have been vomiting and cannot take guanfacine extended-release tablets, you may be at risk for rebound hypertension.

What are the possible side effects of guanfacine extended-release tablets?

Guanfacine extended-release tablets may cause serious side effects including:

low blood pressure
low heart rate
fainting
sleepiness
increased blood pressure and heart rate after suddenly stopping guanfacine extended-release tablets (rebound hypertension). Suddenly stopping guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause increased blood pressure and heart rate and other withdrawal symptoms such as headache, confusion, nervousness, agitation, and tremors. If these symptoms continue to get worse and are left untreated, it could lead to a very serious condition including very high blood pressure, feeling very sleepy or tired, severe headache, vomiting, vision problems, seizures.

### Childhood socio-economic conditions and risk of cardiovascular disease: results from a pooled sample of 14 011 adults from India [^115WCJdK]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms

In this population, blood pressure was the only major cardiovascular risk factor associated with socio-economic conditions in childhood. Exposure to undernutrition during foetal development and early infancy has been linked to increased blood pressure in adulthood, for which a range of biological mechanisms have been proposed. However, evidence for this is inconclusive. In high-income countries, the link between early-life undernutrition and blood pressure has been largely inferred from studies of low birth weight, despite maternal undernutrition being rare and thus a less important cause of low birth weight. Subsequent observational studies and a community trial in South Asia have failed to confirm the association with blood pressure. Dehydration in infancy and early childhood caused by frequent diarrhoeal disease has been hypothesised to increase blood pressure in adulthood, although epidemiological evidence has been inconsistent. Emerging evidence suggests that frequent infection with malaria during childhood may also increase adult blood pressure, although confirmatory studies are needed. Other setting-specific environmental factors linked to poor socio-economic conditions, such as household use of biomass fuel, may play a role. However, evidence of the long-term effects of this and other putative local risk factors is lacking. Poor socio-economic conditions in childhood have also been linked to increased levels of risk behaviours (eg, smoking and alcohol consumption) and psychosocial adversity (eg, stress and depression) in adulthood, which are associated with increased blood pressure. However, the majority of evidence comes from high-income countries; further research is needed to understand the relevance of these mechanisms in South Asia.

### Detecting low-intake dehydration using bioelectrical impedance analysis in older adults in acute care settings: a systematic review [^112sPbZh]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dehydration is a highly prevalent and burdensome problem that disproportionately affects older hospitalised patients due to their age and comorbidity risk of excess fluid loss and insufficient fluid intake, which results in a net fluid deficit. In physiological terms, dehydration can be defined as a relative reduction in total body water (TBW) volume to less than an individual's usual volume, leading to impaired renal and haemodynamic functions involved in the regulation of blood pressure and systemic organ perfusion. The prevalence of dehydration among the older population varies by geographic region and patient setting and has been reported to be as high as 39% among nursing home residents and approximately 25% among hospitalised patients. The increased risk of dehydration among older adults has been attributed to the age-related decline in renal function, also known as renal senescence, with glomerular filtration rate decreasing by more than 50% over the ages of 30–80 years.

In most cases, dehydration can be avoided through adequate fluid intake, although chronic comorbidities, such as diabetes, renal disease, cognitive impairment, mental health problems, and polypharmacy, increase the risk and are commonly observed among those with recurrent hydration problems. Common causes of excess morbidity and mortality include hypovolaemia, hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac arrhythmias, delirium, seizures, renal failure, and hypovolaemic shock. In a landmark study based on 10 million hospital records of patients admitted to hospitals in the United States, older adults with diagnosed dehydration observed 30-day mortality of 17% and one-year mortality of 48%, highlighting that dehydration is a significant issue affecting the vulnerable older population.

The recent European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines for hydration in the field of geriatrics state that dehydration in older adults is due to either low fluid intake (due to a lack of drinking), excess fluid loss, or a combination of both; practice guidance remains the mainstay for hydration care in this population group worldwide. The ESPEN guidelines specifically define low-intake dehydration as a shortage of body water that leads to reductions in intracellular and extracellular fluid and, subsequently, increased osmolality across both cellular compartments.

### Early life diarrhoea and later blood pressure in a developing country: the 1982 pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort study [^112vXq88]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2009). Low credibility.

It has recently been suggested that dehydration in infancy, most likely resulting from an episode of diarrhoea, will subsequently lead to a permanent elevation in blood pressure in humans. This hypothesis is based on the proposition that dehydration could "programme" increased water, and hence salt, retention in a biological attempt to protect against the threat of future life-challenging dehydration. While this may have positive implications for survival in the short term, given that salt retention gives rise to elevated blood pressure, this would be disadvantageous in the longer term owing to an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, most obviously in low- and middle-income countries where diarrhoea is prevalent.

The few empirical tests of this hypothesis have been inconclusive. UK children who had a hospital record of dehydration in the first 6 months of life had raised diastolic but not systolic blood pressure. Further, in a study that utilised climate data as an instrumental variable for infant dehydration, infants who were exposed to conditions that were more likely to precipitate episodes of diarrhoea (summers with higher temperature and lower rainfall) had increased levels of systolic blood pressure in older age. However, three similarly designed UK birth cohort studies – revealed concordant findings: the blood pressure and/or coronary heart disease risk of middle- to older-aged people did not differ between those with and those without a nurse-recorded early life episode of diarrhoea.

Several of these studies are characterised by a low number of cases of dehydration or diarrhoea, which hampers data interpretation. The Pelotas study, which, usually, has repeat measurement of blood pressure across the life course, is based in southern Brazil in an environment where episodes of diarrhoea among the young are somewhat more common than in northern Europe, and therefore does not have this limitation.

### Detecting low-intake dehydration using bioelectrical impedance analysis in older adults in acute care settings: a systematic review [^1166KbeX]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Accurate detection of impending dehydration is key to preventing complications, excess morbidity and mortality among predominantly older adults who represent an already at-risk group for poor outcomes during and following hospitalisation. There is no reliable objective method to assess dehydration in clinical practice to both diagnose and confirm the resolution of dehydration. The diagnosis of dehydration has traditionally depended on clinical symptoms and signs such as moisture of mucous membranes and physiological responses to hypovolaemia, including tachycardia and reductions in blood pressure from baseline values in those who are severely dehydrated. In patients with early or minor dehydration, clinical assessment methods are markedly insensitive, and are associated with delays in initiating hydration therapy and increased risk of complications. More objective measures such as urea, creatinine, and plasma osmolality, and the assessment of urine colour, output, and osmolality, as well as body weight are available not not used routinely in practice due to insufficient sensitivity and reliability, inhibiting early diagnosis and treatment.

### Management of low blood pressure in ambulatory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients [^115u1rDk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Step II: Identify hypotensive factors unrelated to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and stop/reduce non‐heart failure with reduced ejection fraction blood pressure‐lowering therapies

Non‐drug related causes of hypotensive episodes should be investigated, such as diarrhoea, fever, dehydration, etc. In such cases, the cause of hypotension should be corrected, and chronic HF treatment should not be changed over the long term. However, transient discontinuation of HF therapies may be considered (especially for diuretics when dehydration is observed) until resolution of the acute event. Early re‐introduction should be attempted whenever possible.

In the absence of the aforementioned causes of hypotension, BP‐lowering treatments without evidence of morbidity‐mortality reduction in HFrEF patients should be decreased or stopped. Cardiovascular treatments not indicated in HFrEF, such as calcium channel blockers, centrally‐acting antihypertensive drugs or alpha‐blockers, should be reduced or discontinued, regardless of the form of administration. It is also critical to identify 'hidden' hypotensive drugs (such as alpha‐blockers in the context of prostate disease or intraocular beta‐blockers in case of glaucoma) and replace the latter with another drug class (Figure 2).

### Mild dehydration, vasopressin and the kidney: animal and human studies [^115SgcDN]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Water balance depends essentially on fluid intake and urine excretion. Mild dehydration and the consequent hypertonicity of the extracellular fluid induce an increase in vasopressin secretion, thus stimulating urine concentrating processes and the feeling of thirst. The osmotic threshold for the release of vasopressin is lower than that for thirst and also shows appreciable individual variation. Sustained high levels of vasopressin and low hydration induce morphological and functional changes in the kidney. However, they could also be risk factors in several renal disorders, such as chronic renal failure, diabetic nephropathy and salt-sensitive hypertension.

### Guanfacine (Intuniv) [^116nZiXU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking INTUNIV?

Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how INTUNIV affects you. INTUNIV can slow your thinking and motor skills.
Do not drink alcohol or take other medicines that make you sleepy or dizzy while taking INTUNIV until you talk with your doctor. INTUNIV taken with alcohol or medicines that cause sleepiness or dizziness may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse.
Do not become dehydrated or overheated. This may increase your chance of having low blood pressure or fainting while taking INTUNIV.
Do not suddenly stop INTUNIV. Tell your healthcare provider if you have been vomiting and cannot take INTUNIV, you may be at risk for rebound hypertension.

What are the possible side effects of INTUNIV?

INTUNIV may cause serious side effects including:

low blood pressure
low heart rate
fainting
sleepiness
increased blood pressure and heart rate after suddenly stopping INTUNIV (rebound hypertension). Suddenly stopping INTUNIV can cause increased blood pressure and heart rate and other withdrawal symptoms such as headache, confusion, nervousness, agitation, and tremors. If these symptoms continue to get worse and are left untreated, it could lead to a very serious condition including very high blood pressure, feeling very sleepy or tired, severe headache, vomiting, vision problems, seizures.

### Early life diarrhoea and later blood pressure in a developing country: the 1982 pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort study [^115eBgK5]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the present dataset we found little support for any link between diarrhoea in the first 12 or 20 months of life and later blood pressure. The very few results that attained statistical significance at conventional levels are likely to be chance findings given the large number of tests necessarily conducted in the course of these analyses. These findings accord with those from pooled analyses of cohorts from Hertfordshire (UK) where no relation was seen for nurse-recorded diarrhoea up to 5 years of age and blood pressure in old age. In that study, we also found no association of childhood diarrhoea with either non-fatalor fatalcoronary heart disease in older age, a condition for which raised blood pressure is an important risk factor. The Pelotas study offers more statistical power than these analyses: the prevalence of diarrhoea in the first 12 months of life in the 1920s/1930s in Hertfordshire was low (3.4%)but generally higher herein (range 2.8–6.5%).

In the present study, hospital admissions for diarrhoea may be due to dehydration but also persistent diarrhoea and dysentery. It is not possible to know what proportion of study members were admitted for the former, which is of particular relevance to our programming hypothesis. Further investigation of its association, if any, with blood pressure is therefore required. As outlined elsewhere, this includes, in humans, replication of the present study design using cases of hospitalisation for dehydration as utilised in one of the few positive studies, randomised trials of improved hygiene practices that reduce diarrhoea among infants (for instance, in low- and middle-income countries) and, in animals, trials of severe dehydration in early life on later blood pressure.

In conclusion, in the most comprehensive examination to date of the association between childhood diarrhoea and later blood pressure, we found no support for a relationship.

Diarrhoeal illness is a major public health problem for children worldwide, particularly among developing countries, and is a proxy condition for severe dehydration. It has been hypothesized that severe dehydration in the first 6 months of life could be associated with increased blood pressure later in life. This study aimed to explore whether frequency of diarrhoea is associated with elevated blood pressure in children in a setting with a high incidence of diarrhoeal disease.

Methods

The present study is a cross-sectional study of blood pressure among children from a longitudinal child diarrhoeal disease cohort in Lima, Peru. From 2001 to 2006, daily diarrhoeal surveillance was made. Children were revisited in 2006 and blood pressure was measured. Diarrhoeal exposures were evaluated in terms of total number of diarrhoea days, number of episodes of diarrhoea, persistent diarrhoeal episodes and by the quartiles of daily incidence and episode incidence of diarrhoea.

Results

The overall incidence of diarrhoeal episodes at age under 1 year was 4.35 (95% confidence interval: 3.79–4.98) and under 5 years was 2.80 (95% confidence interval: 2.69–2.92). No association was observed between the total number of diarrhoeal days, diarrhoeal episodes or diarrhoeal incidence rates with childhood blood pressure. There was weak evidence that hospital admission due to severe dehydration in the first year of life showed a gradient towards an increase in both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusion

In the first study to date to examine the association in a setting with a high incidence of diarrhoeal disease, diarrhoeal frequency did not show an association with increased blood pressure. Our observations of elevated levels of blood pressure among those admitted into hospitals in the first year of life are in line with the original hypothesis of dehydration in early infancy and high blood pressure. However, the effect of episodes of severe dehydration on later blood pressure remains uncertain.

### Long-term health outcomes associated with hydration status [^114X6VdR]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Body water balance is determined by fundamental homeostatic mechanisms that maintain stable volume, osmolality and the composition of extracellular and intracellular fluids. Water balance is maintained by multiple mechanisms that continuously match water losses through urine, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract and respiration with water gains achieved through drinking, eating and metabolic water production. Hydration status is determined by the state of the water balance. Underhydration occurs when a decrease in body water availability, due to high losses or low gains, stimulates adaptive responses within the water balance network that are aimed at decreasing losses and increasing gains. This stimulation is also accompanied by cardiovascular adjustments. Epidemiological and experimental studies have linked markers of low fluid intake and underhydration - such as increased plasma concentration of vasopressin and sodium, as well as elevated urine osmolality - with an increased risk of new-onset chronic diseases, accelerated aging and premature mortality, suggesting that persistent activation of adaptive responses may be detrimental to long-term health outcomes. The causative nature of these associations is currently being tested in interventional trials. Understanding of the physiological responses to underhydration may help to identify possible mechanisms that underlie potential adverse, long-term effects of underhydration and inform future research to develop preventative and treatment approaches to the optimization of hydration status.

### The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis: revisited [^111v6ceP]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Malaria etiologies with pathophysiological similarities to hypertension currently constitute a major subject of research. The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis is strongly supported by observations of the increasing incidence of hypertension in malaria-endemic, low- and middle-income countries with poor socioeconomic conditions, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. Malnutrition and low birth weight with persistent symptomatic malaria presentations in pregnancy correlate strongly with the development of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and subsequent hypertension in adult life. Evidence suggest that the link between malaria infection and high blood pressure involves interactions between malaria parasites and erythrocytes, the inflammatory process, effects of the infection during pregnancy; effects on renal and vascular functions as well as effects in sickle cell disease. Possible mechanisms which provide justification for the malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis include the following: endothelial dysfunction (reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels), impaired release of local neurotransmitters and cytokines, decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell viability and/or alterations in cellular calcium signaling leading to enhanced vascular reactivity, remodeling, and cardiomyopathies, deranged homeostasis through dehydration, elevated intracellular mediators and proinflammatory cytokine responses, possible genetic regulations, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system mechanisms and renal derangements, severe anemia and hemolysis, renal failure, and end organ damage. Two key mediators of the malaria-high blood pressure association are: endothelial dysfunction (reduced NO) and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme activity/angiotensin II levels. Sickle cell disease is associated with protection against malaria infection and reduced blood pressure. In this review, we present the state of knowledge about the malaria-blood pressure hypothesis and suggest insights for future studies.

### Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and associated factors among older people with hypertension in Northern Ethiopia [^114DPCJ5]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease, with a global prevalence of approximately 1.3 billion, with the vast majority of these people(82%) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hypertension is a common problem in older adults, reaching a prevalence of 70 to 80% in high- income countries (HICs). Orthostatic hypotension (OH) commonly occurs in patients taking antihypertensive medications. OH has been defined as a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg, when assuming a standing position or during a head-up tilt test of at least 60 o. OH occurs when either cardiac output is reduced, the vasoconstrictor response is insufficient, or both. Causes of OH can be classified as neurogenic or non-neurogenic, with patients exhibiting either symptomatic or asymptomatic presentations. Common symptoms include lightheadedness, weakness, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, pre-syncope, syncope, falls, and headache.

Several risk factors have been identified for the development of OH. Medications such as antihypertensive drugs, antidepressants, any potential cause of dehydration or hypovolemia, and relevant comorbidities such as Parkinson disease, and diabetes mellitus are all factors that can be associated with OH. Aging itself, even in a relatively healthy person is associated with a significant increased risk of OH with prevalence rates in older population ranging from 6 to 35% in high income countries. OH in this population can result from any or combination of normal age-related changes, comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, renal, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as medications used to treat these conditions.

OH has been associated with all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, transient ischemic attack, and stroke. OH can significantly reduce quality of life and increase the risk of fall and subsequent fractures. There is not always an effective treatment for OH, but managing factors like medications, dehydration, patient education, early recognition, fall prevention, avoiding triggers, and increasing salt and water intake can often help.

### Fluid therapy for severe malaria [^113MhZCS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Fluid therapy is an important supportive measure for patients with severe malaria. Patients with severe malaria usually have normal cardiac index, vascular resistance, and blood pressure and a small degree of hypovolaemia due to dehydration. Cell hypoxia, reduced kidney function, and acidosis result from microcirculatory compromise and malarial anaemia, which reduce tissue oxygenation, not hypovolaemia. Hence, aggressive fluid loading does not correct acid-base status, enhance kidney function, or improve patient outcomes, and it risks complications such as pulmonary oedema. Individualised conservative fluid management is recommended in patients with severe malaria. Physical examination and physiological indices have limited reliability in guiding fluid therapy. Invasive measures can be more accurate than physical examination and physiological indices but are often unavailable in endemic areas, and non-invasive measures, such as ultrasound, are mostly unexplored. Research into reliable methods applicable in low-resource settings to measure fluid status and response is a priority. In this Review, we outline the current knowledge on fluid management in severe malaria and highlight research needed to optimise fluid therapy and improve survival in severe malaria.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^112zK2mp]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydration is a fundamental but confusing area of practice for clinicians working with older people. There is little doubt that addressing dehydration can prevent and treat common disorders such as urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury, orthostatic hypotension, constipation and delirium. However, the assessment of dehydration can be rather subjective, non-evidence based and affected by multiple factors. Once identified, reversing dehydration can be challenging as it often involves behavioural change and overcoming barriers such engrained habits and fear of incontinence.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^116iMWBU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydration principles

Healthy humans are generally well hydratedwith a day-to-day variation in total body water of 0.2%–0.7% of body mass. However, the rise in sweat rate when exercising in the heat can dramatically change this fluid balance. A reduction in total body water is associated with a decrease in plasma volume and an increase in plasma osmolalitythat will increase the core temperature threshold for vasodilation and sweating, reduces the sweat rate for any given core temperatureand decreases cardiac filling and challenges blood pressure regulation. Dehydration will therefore exacerbate the rate of heat storage and cardiovascular strain imposed by exercising in the heat, thus reducing exercise heat tolerance. Given the potential limit in accessing and ingesting fluid during the competition (see further), the general principle of hydration should be to avoid hypohydration (less than 2% body mass) during the periods of training in the heat, especially immediately before and during intense training and competition exercise in the heat. Any increase in fluid consumption should be progressive and not limited to competition day as an acute increase in fluid absorption may first increase the urine production. The fluid needs for an athlete training in the heat are highly individual but consistent within the individual when influencing variables are consistent. Fluid needs should be adapted based on changes in body mass and/or plasma osmolality and/or urine specific gravity. Hydration measures should be obtained in the morning to avoid confounding effects of recent diet and exercise. The following examples can also be used as a general guide at first before individualised data are ascertained: 6 mL of fluid per kg of body mass every 2–3 hour, or 2 L per day plus 1–2 L per hour of exercise plus 1 L for each 5°C increase in ambient temperature above 21.5°C.

Recommendations

Hydration capacity during exercise itself is limited; therefore, athletes should ascertain sufficient fluid intake "out of exercise", from the days before and throughout the period of training/competing in the heat.
A simple way to monitor hydration status during a period of training/competing in the heat is to follow the weight–urine–thirst principle with daily monitoring of body mass (changes should remain < 1–2%), urine specific gravity (should remain < 1.020) or colour and thirst. If available to the team, plasma osmolality (< 290 mmol/kg) can be included in cases of suspected chronic dehydration.

Dehydration and drugs — syncope management recommendations state that fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended in patients with syncope due to acute dehydration, and reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension can be beneficial in selected patients with syncope. In selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake, and rehydration, whether by intravenous or oral formulation, should include sodium supplementation for more rapid recovery. Additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages, and higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages; this treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or HF, uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low- and very-low-carbohydrate diets — medication management and monitoring: Individuals with diabetes who choose to follow a very-low-CHO diet or KD are at an increased risk of hypoglycemia and thus individuals following a very-low-CHO diet for T2D management should be medically supervised; OHAs and/or insulin may need to be reduced or discontinued after initiation, and patients should be instructed to monitor their blood glucose levels before taking OHAs or insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. Patients taking sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should avoid VLCHF/KDs because of an increased risk of SGLT2 inhibitor–associated ketoacidosis, and discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors before initiating a very-low-CHO KD was recommended because of the risk of normoglycemic ketoacidosis. In patients with hypertension on these diets, a reduction in blood pressure frequently occurs; patients should monitor blood pressure at home or in clinic, antihypertensive medications may need to be tapered or discontinued, and diuretics may need to be tapered or discontinued to prevent dehydration and/or hypotension; in T2D with microalbuminuria, continuing a low dose of a renal-protective antihypertensive medication was recommended if a patient does not become hypotensive. Patients taking a vitamin K antagonist for anticoagulation should be instructed on consistent vitamin K intake, consider the potential for increased vitamin K intake from nonstarchy and green leafy vegetables, and more frequent monitoring of anticoagulation therapy may be required because of the potential change in vitamin K intake and its effect on anticoagulation therapy.

Prevention of Occupational Heat-Related Illnesses — dehydration as an associated condition is described: Dehydration due to loss of body fluid from sweating, without adequate replacement, is a common result of heat stress, and dehydration upsets the thermoregulatory mechanisms that reduce body temperature, increasing the risk of heat stroke. Symptoms and signs of dehydration may include thirst, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, and decreased skin turgor, and low urine sodium may be a diagnostic indicator of dehydration.

### Evaluation and treatment of cancer-related fluid deficits: volume depletion and dehydration [^112TRG5Q]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Fluid deficits should be divided into two categories (dehydration and volume depletion) according to pathophysiology and into 3 categories (hyponatremic, hypernatremic, and isotonic) according to the plasma sodium concentration. Dehydration (total water deficit especially intracellular) is always hypernatremic, while volume depletion (intravascular water and sodium deficit) is either hyponatremic, hypernatremic, or isotonic. There are no clear clinical differences among the various categories, but a delay of capillary refill, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension are more common with early volume depletion. An Evans blue and mannitol test can be used to distinguish between hypernatremic volume depletion and dehydration. Careful clinical assessment and laboratory tests (especially serum sodium) are the key to diagnosis and effective management. According to the type (hypernatremic, hyponatremic, or isotonic), severity of fluid deficit, and associated symptoms, oral or parenteral fluid should be given along with treatment of the underlying cause. In hemodynamically compromised individuals with orthostatic hypotension and oliguria, replacement with isotonic saline until hemodynamic stabilization is crucial. Terminal hydration is still controversial. Important ethical principles govern clinical decision-making about hydration at the end of life.

### Cerebral blood flow in orthostatic intolerance [^1165t7M7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CBF in OI

in Syncope

CBF dysregulation can cause syncope, a transient loss of consciousness when there is significantly decreased blood flow to the brain.OH is a diagnosis that commonly experiences CBF dysregulation resulting in syncope. Possible causes of OH include dehydration, medications, or health conditions with secondary dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. As the autonomic nervous system regulates the subconscious process of vasoconstriction, autonomic dysfunction hampers the body's ability to vasoconstrict to prevent venous pooling in the lower extremities in the upright position, resulting in low BP and CBF drops.

A head‐up tilt table test is often used by electrophysiologists to test a patient's likelihood of syncope. The test induces orthostatic stress with passive upright posture during which vital signs such as BP and heart rate are monitored, ideally continuously, throughout the test. Since all types of syncope are essentially caused by a rapid drop in CBF, it is clinically relevant to measure CBv in syncope to reach an accurate diagnosis. Figure 2 shows the BP and CBv patterns of a 20‐year‐old woman with mixed syncope. The onset of syncope coincides with a drop in CBF, followed by a delayed decline in BP. Evidence suggests that CBF drops before the fall in BP in syncope contributing to a syncopal event. Cerebral autoregulation, however, does not appear to be affected in syncope during head‐up tilt. Some people with syncope have a paradoxical increase in cerebrovascular resistance that proceeds the drop in BP. There are surprisingly limited studies addressing CBF in syncope and CBF regulation may differ depending on the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder. For instance, people with neurally mediated syncope or hypotension may develop an altered BP range for autoregulation and baroreflex buffering compared with otherwise healthy people with the occasional vasovagal episodes.

### Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration [^111hR74C]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

How much water we really need depends on water functions and the mechanisms of daily water balance regulation. The aim of this review is to describe the physiology of water balance and consequently to highlight the new recommendations with regard to water requirements. Water has numerous roles in the human body. It acts as a building material; as a solvent, reaction medium and reactant; as a carrier for nutrients and waste products; in thermoregulation; and as a lubricant and shock absorber. The regulation of water balance is very precise, as a loss of 1% of body water is usually compensated within 24 h. Both water intake and water losses are controlled to reach water balance. Minute changes in plasma osmolarity are the main factors that trigger these homeostatic mechanisms. Healthy adults regulate water balance with precision, but young infants and elderly people are at greater risk of dehydration. Dehydration can affect consciousness and can induce speech incoherence, extremity weakness, hypotonia of ocular globes, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Human water requirements are not based on a minimal intake because it might lead to a water deficit due to numerous factors that modify water needs (climate, physical activity, diet and so on). Water needs are based on experimentally derived intake levels that are expected to meet the nutritional adequacy of a healthy population. The regulation of water balance is essential for the maintenance of health and life. On an average, a sedentary adult should drink 1.5 l of water per day, as water is the only liquid nutrient that is really essential for body hydration.

### Preventing acute kidney injury in high-risk patients by temporarily discontinuing medication-an observational study in general practice [^112soBCV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dehydration is a widespread and significant problem, that is more prevalent in infants, elderly and athletes. In healthy patients, dehydration can be resolved quickly by oral rehydration. However, in some cases, dehydration can lead to intravascular volume depletion, which can cause severe complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or hypotension.

Patients with pre-existent chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, and elderly patients have an increased risk of these complications, especially when suffering from concurrent illnesses that cause fluid loss such as vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. In these groups, volume regulation and water and sodium homeostasis is impaired.

When patients also use drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS -inhibitors), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or diuretics, this risk is even higher. In patients who use RAAS-inhibitors, water and sodium retention is impaired, causing a decrease in blood pressure and renal blood flow. RAAS-inhibitors and NSAIDs also impair glomerular haemodynamics, leading to a diminished glomerular filtration pressure and renal function. Patients who use diuretics, have a higher risk of suffering from pre-renal acute kidney injury. This is due to the fact that diuretics decrease extracellular volume by increasing diuresis. A mild concurrent illness with additional fluid loss such as a period of fever, or vomiting can trigger AKI in these patients.

This 'cocktail' of dangerous factors (fragile patients using RAAS-inhibitors, NSAIDS or diuretics combined with dehydration) has been described in multiple case reports, and retrospective studies. In almost all of these cases, this cocktail ultimately led to severe reversible kidney injury or severe hypotension with haemodynamic collapse. The main causes of dehydration were vomiting and diarrhoea. Guidelines recommend to (consider to) temporarily discontinue high-risk medication in patients at risk for dehydration to prevent complications.

The extent and impact of these situations in general practice is unknown. In this research we aimed to determine the number of patients at risk in general practice, guideline adherence and the incidence of complications.

### Consensus recommendations on training and competing in the heat [^1169vSnm]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Section 2: Hydration

The development of hyperthermia during exercise in hot ambient conditions is associated with a rise in sweat rate, which can lead to progressive dehydration if fluid losses are not minimised by increasing fluid consumption. Exercise-induced dehydration, leading to a hypohydrated state, is associated with a decrease in plasma volume and an increase in plasma osmolality that are proportional to the reduction in total body water. The increase in the core temperature threshold for vasodilation and sweating at the onset of exercise is closely linked to the ensuing hyperosmolality and hypovolaemia. During exercise, plasma hyperosmolality reduces the sweat rate for any given core temperature and decreases evaporative heat loss. In addition, dehydration decreases cardiac filling and challenges blood pressure regulation. The rate of heat storage and cardiovascular strain is therefore exacerbated, and the capacity to tolerate exercise in the heat is reduced.

Despite decades of studies in this area, the notion that dehydration impairs aerobic performance in sport settings is not universally accepted and there seems to be a two-sided polarised debate. Numerous studies report that dehydration impairs aerobic performance in the condition that if exercise is performed in warm-hot environments and that body water deficits exceed at least ∼2% of body mass. On the other hand, some recent studies suggest that dehydration up to 4% body mass does not alter cycling performance under an ecologically valid conditions. However, these results must be interpreted in context; that is, in well-trained male cyclists typically exercising for 60 min in ambient conditions up to 33°C and 60% relative humidity, and starting exercise in a euhydrated state. Nonetheless, some have advanced the idea that the detrimental consequences of dehydration have been overemphasised by sports beverage companies. As such, it has been argued that athletes should drink to thirst. However, many studies (often conducted prior to the creation and marketing of 'sport-drinks') have repeatedly observed that drinking to thirst often results in body water deficits that may exceed 2–3% body mass when sweat rates are high and exercise is performed in warm-hot environments. Ultimately, drinking to thirst may be appropriate in many settings, but not in circumstances where severe dehydration is expected (eg, Ironman triathlon).

### Effect of intravenous fluids on dehydrated patients and on normal subjects… [^114t5nok]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dehydration is frequently encountered in both medical and surgical patients. Whether dehydration is the result of vomiting, diarrhea, inability to swallow or electrolyte derangement such as occurs in diabetic acidosis, 1 the intravenous administration of fluids is the mode of therapy usually relied on to restore the normal state of hydration and electrolyte balance. Indeed, so routinely and with such gratifying results are intravenous fluids used for these patients that the physician seldom pauses to consider the exact effect of his therapy on the cardiovascular system. Previous reports in the literature have dealt with the effect of intravenous infusions on pulse rate, blood pressure, blood volume, venous pressure, velocity of blood flow and the electrocardiogram. 2 Altschule and Gilligan3 have also reported the changes in cardiac output in normal men. However, no workers, so far as we are aware, have studied the effect of intravenous fluids on cardiac output. HARDY JD, GODFREY L.

### Ramadan fasting: recommendations for patients with cardiovascular disease [^113afdsL]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

Blood pressure, kidney function and medications (particularly antihypertensives that have a diuretic component such as aldosterone antagonists or thiazide-like diuretics) should be reviewed by HCPs during a routine appointment to reduce the risk of hypotension and/or worsening kidney function. A home blood pressure monitor would be useful to observe a patient's blood pressure response to antihypertensive treatment while fasting and provide clarity on any symptoms that could suggest a low blood pressure. Patients with well-controlled blood pressure, as defined by their HCP, would be deemed 'low-moderate' risk for fasting.

CCS and ACS

The few studies in patients with CCS, whom we deem as 'low-moderate risk', undertaking Ramadan fasting, indicate that it is safe for them to do so, provided patients are compliant with their medications. Patients within a 6-week period of an ACS, whom we deem to be at least high risk, or had cardiac surgery, are advised not to fast, particularly as they may not be able to undertake cardiac rehabilitation due to the risk of hypotension from fasting-associated dehydration.

Heart failure

The few studies in patients with non-severe HFrEF, whom we would deem as 'low-moderate' risk undertaking Ramadan fasting suggest that is safe for them to do so, in line with guidance from the British Heart Foundationand the ESC. We deem patients with severe (LVEF ≤ 35%) HFrEF and advanced HF, as defined by the ESC, as high and very high risk for Ramadan fasting, respectively. There are no studies investigating patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) undertaking Ramadan fasting. We propose that stable patients with HFpEF, as defined by the ESC, are 'low-moderate' risk; however, each patient should be reviewed as particulars about their condition and/or their comorbidities may increase the risk, especially since HFpEF is a heterogeneous group.

### Hypertension despite dehydration during severe pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^114ADh3g]. Pediatric Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may result in both dehydration and cerebral edema but these processes may have opposing effects on blood pressure. We examined the relationship between dehydration and blood pressure in pediatric DKA.

Design

A retrospective review was performed at Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA. Participants were hospitalized children less than 18 yr. Intervention(s) or main exposure was to patients with DKA (venous pH < 7.3, glucose > 300 mg/dL, HCO₃ < 15 mEq/L, and urinary ketosis). Dehydration was calculated as percent body weight lost at admission compared to discharge. Hypertension (systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) percentile > 95%) was defined based on National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI, 2004) nomograms and hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 70 + 2 [age].

Results

Thirty-three patients (median 10.9 yr; range 10 months to 17 yr) were included. Fifty-eight percent of patients (19/33) had hypertension on admission before treatment and 82% had hypertension during the first 6 h of admission. None had admission hypotension. Hypertension 48 h after treatment and weeks after discharge was common (28 and 19%, respectively). Based on weight gained by discharge, 27% of patients had mild, 61% had moderate, and 12% presented with severe dehydration.

Conclusion

Despite dehydration, most children admitted with severe DKA had hypertension.

### Volume depletion versus dehydration: how understanding the difference can guide therapy [^112sEDU7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Although often used interchangeably, dehydration and volume depletion are not synonyms. Dehydration refers to loss of total-body water, producing hypertonicity, which now is the preferred term in lieu of dehydration, whereas volume depletion refers to a deficit in extracellular fluid volume. In particular, hypertonicity implies intracellular volume contraction, whereas volume depletion implies blood volume contraction. Using a case of hyperglycemic hypertonic nonketosis as an example, we examine the changing composition of body fluid spaces to explore the distinction between dehydration and hypertonicity from volume depletion.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^112yVjfQ]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As dehydration is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in older people, its recognition and treatment is important. While individual clinical signs and bedside tests are limited in diagnostic value, a holistic clinical evaluation should still be recommended. Serum osmolality has a role in the diagnosis in hypertonic dehydration with further studies required to evaluate point of care testing. Daily fluid requirements may be lower than previously recommended, but this evidence is weaker for older people. While oral hydration is usually the preferred method, the subcutaneous rate offers reasonable rates of fluid absorption and has the advantage over intravenous routes of having much fewer adverse effects. As complex interventions, behavioural and environmental strategies may result in small increases in fluid intake but are limited by motivation and longevity.

### Hypertension in severe pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: case report and review of literature [^1149EFq5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Dehydration from fluid loss secondary to glycosuria is the central pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Decreased oral intake and increased insensible water loss are also common in DKA. Severe dehydration should lead to hypovolemia and hypotension. We present a case of DKA with severe dehydration and hypertension in contrast to expected hypotension. The aim of this article was to increase awareness that pediatric DKA could present with hypertension, and this should be looked at and included in DKA management protocols.

### Potential role of the skin in hypertension risk through water conservation [^114hkFbX]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous basic and clinical investigations have identified various pathogenic factors and determinants of risk that contribute to hypertension. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of hypertension has not been fully elucidated. Moreover, despite the availability of antihypertensive medications for the management of blood pressure, treatments that address the full spectrum of the pathophysiological defects underpinning hypertension remain to be identified. To further investigate the mechanisms of primary hypertension, it is imperative to consider novel potential aspects, such as fluid management by the skin, in addition to the conventional risk factors. There is a close association between body fluid regulation and blood pressure, and the kidney, which, as the principal organ responsible for body fluid homeostasis, is the primary target for research in the field of hypertension. In addition, the skin functions as a biological barrier, potentially contributing to body fluid regulation. In this review, we propose the hypothesis that changes in skin water conservation are associated with hypertension risk based on recent findings. Further studies are required to clarify whether this novel hypothesis is limited to specific hypertension or applies to physiological blood pressure regulation.

Dehydration-related syncope — salt and fluid repletion states that in selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake. In patients with dehydration, sodium supplementation improves plasma volume and improves orthostatic tolerance, and additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages; higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages. This treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or heart failure (HF), uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

Low or critical battery

This requires replacement of a rechargeable battery with a charged battery or connection of the controller to mains power.

Low flow alarm

For the HVAD and Heartmate II and III, blood flow rate is not directly measured but is estimated from LVAD electrical power consumption and blood viscosity using either the haematocrit or packed cell volume as a surrogate. For a given impeller rotation rate, the blood flow generated by the LVAD is inversely proportional to the pressure difference across the LVAD, i.e. aortic minus left ventricular pressure. Thus, paradoxically, relative hypotension is desirable in LVAD recipients because it is associated with the preservation of adequate LVAD blood flow which not only assures adequate perfusion but minimises the risk of thrombogenesis in the LVAD. This is best achieved through maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the 60–80 mmHg range. A low LVAD blood flow alarm is likely to be caused by inadequate LVAD filling, the most common cause being hypovolaemia which is frequently attributable to dehydration or more rarely, bleeding (e.g. gastrointestinal). The primary intervention in response to suspected hypovolaemia should be a passive leg raise, which, if effective, can be followed by cautious intravenous fluid administration (e.g. 4 ml/kg) targeting a MAP above 60 mmHg. Haemorrhage management requires an individualised balanced approach with due consideration of the severity of bleeding and risk of pump thrombosis. In severe bleeding or that occurring in sensitive compartments, such as the brain, reversal of anticoagulation is almost always indicated. In the case of haemorrhagic cardiac arrest a standardised major haemorrhage protocol with balanced transfusion and reversal of coagulation with specific agents or blood products is necessary.

Heat stroke hydration and fluids highlight that euhydration is an important factor in reducing hyperthermia and that dehydration should be minimized in heat illness (1C); optimizing hydration in heat stroke decreases both the cardiovascular and thermal strain, and in a heat stroke victim with altered mental status and risk of seizure, the intravenous route minimizes aspiration risk, with reasonable replenishment choices of 1 to 2 L of isotonic (0.9% normal saline or normal saline with 5% dextrose) fluids; any effort to provide hydration in suspected heat stroke should not delay rapid whole-body cooling; intravenous fluids should be used for rehydration in EHS (1B), and if intravenous hydration is provided, field monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, lightening of urine color, and increase in urine output can help guide patient response and fluid status.

### WHO guidelines on fluid resuscitation in children: missing the FEAST data [^114yYSur]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Concern has also been expressed about the consequences of not giving bolus fluids to children with moderate hypotension and severe dehydration. Again, FEAST was not powered to detect differences in these subgroups, but the results are consistent with harm from use of bolus resuscitation.

In children with hypotension (defined in FEAST as systolic blood pressure 50–75, 60–75, and 70–85 mm Hg in children aged < 12 months, 1–5 years, and > 5 years respectively, in line with clinical use) there was a trend towards increased mortality in the bolus arms (absolute difference 9.4%, 95% confidence interval −2.6% to 21.4%). Severe hypotension is very uncommon in children, as shown by the very small number of children (n = 29) with this condition who were enrolled in the FEAST trial; all of these children were randomised to receive either colloid of saline boluses. Of interest, only eight of the 29 children fulfilled the WHO definition of shock and all eight died.

Overall, severe dehydration without diarrhoea was present in 236 children (7.5%) in FEAST, and we found no evidence that boluses were of benefit; there were 38/173 (22%) deaths in the bolus arm versus 8/58 (13.8%) in the control (relative risk 1.59, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 3.21).

Diagnosis

Clinical examination

It is generally accepted that the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination is poor. This has recently been confirmed in the Dehydration Recognition in our Elders (DRIE) study). In this England-based study, 188 participants, mean age 86 (± 8) years, were included from 56 care homes. Each participant underwent thorough clinical evaluation which included symptoms of dry eyes/mouth, thirst and feeling out of sorts and examination of the mouth and tongue, lips, eyes, axillae, palms, skin, capillary refill time, foot vein filling, temperature, heart rate and sitting and standing blood pressure. Serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg was the reference standard for dehydration, with a pre-defined sensitivity and specificity of 70% for diagnostic accuracy. Thirty-eight participants had serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg, but none of the 49 signs, symptoms or bed side tests reached the required level of diagnostic accuracy to identify these individuals.

The most recent Cochrane review in this area (Clinical symptoms, signs and tests for identification of impending and current-loss dehydration in older people, 2015) reaches a similar conclusion to the DRIE study. The review used serum osmolality as the gold standard definition of current water-loss dehydration, with a cut-point of ≥ 300 mOsm/kg. It should be noted therefore that the results do not apply to isotonic dehydration. The review included 24 studies. Of these, 13 were classed as high risk of bias, 13 as low risk and the risk in the remaining five was unclear. The review evaluated 36 different signs, symptoms and bedside tests, but with variable cut offs and scales used by different studies this resulted in 152 different diagnostic criteria. A pre-specified criteria of sensitivity 60% and specificity 75% was set as an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy. Of the 152 diagnostic criteria only one met this level of accuracy — bioelectrical impedance analysis (at a resistance level of 50 kHz, ≥ 450 ohm). However, this was a single study (n = 15, unknown risk of bias), with three other studies (all with a lower risk of bias) using the same criteria not reaching these levels of diagnostic accuracy. Unfortunately, a pooled analysis was not possible.

### Guanfacine (Intuniv) [^114AhveW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope

Treatment with INTUNIV can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate INTUNIV slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope.

5.2 Sedation and Somnolence

Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Before using INTUNIV with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with INTUNIV. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol.

5.3 	Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities

The sympatholytic action of INTUNIV may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate INTUNIV slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs.

### Physiologic basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment [^115LjJpK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Dehydration (body water deficit) is a physiologic state that can have profound implications for human health and performance. Unfortunately, dehydration can be difficult to assess, and there is no single, universal gold standard for decision making. In this article, we review the physiologic basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment. We highlight how phenomenologic interpretations of dehydration depend critically on the type (dehydration compared with volume depletion) and magnitude (moderate compared with severe) of dehydration, which in turn influence the osmotic (plasma osmolality) and blood volume-dependent compensatory thresholds for antidiuretic and thirst responses. In particular, we review new findings regarding the biological variation in osmotic responses to dehydration and discuss how this variation can help provide a quantitative and clinically relevant link between the physiology and phenomenology of dehydration. Practical measures with empirical thresholds are provided as a starting point for improving the practice of dehydration assessment.

### Intravenous fluid therapy in critically ill adults [^116DR42o]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is one of the most common interventions in acutely ill patients. Each day, over 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are 'normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^117WmH9m]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Dehydration may, in its simplest form be considered a deficiency of water, but even this simplistic definition is controversial. The lack of formal definition has hindered academic progress, with several professional societies differing in even the basic principles of whether the definition should include factors such as osmolality, intake or output, clinical findings and volume distribution. In 2019, a group of UK academics convened to reach consensus. The group which identifies as multidisciplinary was drawn from anaesthesia/critical care (50%), sports science, cardiology and dietetics and was largely based in southeast England. The group of 12 experts used expert opinion, literature reviews and a modified Delphi process to produce a series of recommendations.

Two types of dehydration were defined by the consensus group:

Hypertonic dehydration, an uncompensated, predominantly pure water deficit (e.g. inadequate water intake or excessive loss) resulting in a raised extracellular osmolality.
Isotonic dehydration, which is a deficiency of water with an associated reduction in salt (e.g. caused by diarrhoea) which does not increase the extracellular osmolality.

While these definitions may have a role in standardising diagnosis, the narrow geographical membership and lack of diverse expertise will likely lead to a lack of uptake by the wider community. However, the definitions are clear and compared with other existing definitions are easily translated into clinical practice.

### Preventing embolus shedding from an arteriovenous fistula during hemodialysis treatment [^111vtpUA]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2016). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 55-year-old male patient who suffered from a neogenic embolism formation and a sudden embolus detachment during hemodialysis treatment. For this case, the sudden onset of thrombosis formation and embolism detachment were caused by severe dehydration due to diarrhea, which resulted in low blood pressure, pachemia, hyperhemoglobinemia and hypercoagulability. An immediate vessel occlusion was performed as a rescue therapy followed by a thrombectomy at the position of vessel occlusion. The vessel occlusion can lead to better control of embolism detachment and reduce the rate of fatal pulmonary embolism formation. This case also indicates that severe diarrhea and dehydration can cause acute AVF thrombosis during hemodialysis therapy.

### Delayed, transient quadriplegia; the importance of spinal cord perfusion [^115qiBwP]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This patient described an unusual clinical course, unique in my experience. It seems most likely that the mechanism behind the transient, apparently complete, loss of spinal cord function relates to impaired perfusion. Certainly, the blood pressure was low, and the spinal canal markedly narrowed as observed on the MRI scan such that spinal perfusion pressure must have been compromised. Spinal cord concussion (neuropraxia) seems very unlikely given the time course. Spinal concussion can certainly result in fully reversible spinal cord dysfunction but it, by definition, occurs immediately after the trauma rather than in a delayed fashion as occurred in this case. It is difficult to imagine a mechanism that could account for such a delay with a subsequently quite rapid and complete resolution. Spinal compression due to subsequent movement is possible, but the deforming force is usually greatest at the moment of injury and the neck was carefully supported by an experienced practitioner following the injury to avoid further flexion. Also, the transient loss of function was apparently complete, affecting the entire cord rather than the anterior or posterior segments alone. Finally, cord function began to improve soon after restoration of blood pressure with vasoconstrictor administration. Hypotension is a consequence as much as a cause of spinal cord dysfunction, but it seems likely that a cycle of hypotension related to the trauma and mild dehydration led to impaired cord perfusion that was then markedly exacerbated by the consequent spinal cord dysfunction-induced vasodilation (neurogenic shock).

This case highlights the utility of established principles of acute management of spinal injury such as field support with neck stabilisation and early surgical fixation. The unusual course, however, strongly emphasises the importance of spinal cord perfusion in the postinjury management of acute spinal cord injury. The favourable impact on spinal recovery of maintenance of cord perfusion is now well establishedalthough the evidence is mostly derived from human cohort and observational studies. Nevertheless, systematic reviews over the yearshave consistently reported a beneficial effect of blood pressure maintenance in spite of the absence of high-level studies. In consequence, the maintenance of perfusion pressure has become part of established clinical guidelines. While the precise pathogenesis of the transient quadriplegia observed in this case cannot be proven, the personal and societal impact of spinal cord injury is so great that any initiative that might ameliorate or even avert the clinical impact of spinal injury, as in the case described, warrants consideration. Initiatives with very low cost and low complication rate such as blood pressure maintenance should be 'standard of care'.

### The real-world safety profile of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors among older adults (≥ 75 years): a retrospective, pharmacovigilance study [^1154B8Pc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

SGLT2i may increase the risk of dehydration due to their osmotic diuretic effect, particularly in older adults and patients receiving additional diuretics or antihypertensives. These, in turn, may result in falls, syncope, and fractures. In this study, we observed increased reporting of nocturia and dehydration following SGLT2i treatment in the entire cohort, without differences between age groups. Indeed, concomitant use of diuretics and hypertensives was more common among those patients. RCT sub-analyses of the older population reported mixed results regarding dehydration risk. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, patients older than 75 years receiving empagliflozin had an increased frequency of volume depletion, but not patients aged < 75 years. In contrast, older dapagliflozin recipients had a similar frequency of dehydration to younger patients in the DECLARE–TIMI 58 and DAPA-HF studies. In our stratified analysis, dehydration reporting did not differ among SGLT2i types. Despite their blood pressure-lowering effect, SGLT2i treatment did not result in hypotension among the pivotal RCTs participants, including older adults. This finding was consistent in patients with severely reduced systolic function, who are particularly susceptible to hypotension. Concordantly, SGLT2i were not associated with an increased reporting of hypotension in both age groups in the FAERS.

Dehydration and drugs — For syncope due to acute dehydration, I C-LD: Fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended in patients with syncope due to acute dehydration. Fluid resuscitation is recommended for syncope secondary to both dehydration and exercise-associated hypotension, and oral fluid bolus may require less volume than intravenous fluid infusion to have a similar treatment effect because oral fluid loading has a pressor effect. Rehydration, whether by intravenous or oral formulation, should include sodium supplementation for more rapid recovery, and beverages with increased sodium concentration (closer to normal body osmolality) rehydrate faster than beverages with lower sodium concentration or increased osmolality.

ACC/AHA/HRS orthostatic tachycardia and hypotension definitions — orthostatic tachycardia is "A sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)". Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "A drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture". Initial (immediate) OH is "A transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope". Classic OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture". Delayed OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop", and "The fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold".

### Hemodynamic effects of the osmopressor response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bgAtd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a crucial feature of cardiovascular autonomic failure. It is prevalent among various patient populations and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and death. Guidelines define OH as a sustained systolic blood pressure (SBP) fall of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) drop of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of active standing or head‐up tilt (HUT) to at least 60 °C on a tilt table. OH may have a prevalence of 30% among those aged ≥ 65 years, to a prevalence of 70% in institutionalized patients. When considering patients with neurogenic OH (OH due to autonomic nervous system damage), the prevalence rises to 80% of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA),30% of patients with Parkinson disease, and 100% of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Although it is possible to have asymptomatic OH, symptoms caused by low blood flow to the brain include presyncope, visual and auditory disturbances, fatigue, light‐headedness, and loss of consciousness. As such, OH may have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life.

Various pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments exist for the management of OH. It has been demonstrated that in patients with OH, rapidly drinking 300 to 500 mL of plain, unsalted water increases SBP by approximately 35 mm Hg and buffers postprandial hypotension. The pressor effect begins after 10 to 15 minutes, peaks around 25 to 40 minutes, and largely dissipates within 90 minutes. A case report also demonstrated that rapid consumption of 8 oz (236.6 mL) of water in a patient with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) eliminated standing tachycardia within 10 minutes. Finally, a study of healthy individuals suggested that water consumption may be a simple and effective way to prevent vasovagal reactions, especially in situations such as blood donation, where vasovagal reactions occur more frequently. The investigators found that of 22 healthy adult participants, 8 experienced hypotension or bradycardia within the first 30 minutes of HUT when they did not consume water beforehand. However, only 1 of the 22 participants experienced these symptoms within the first 30 minutes of HUT when they consumed water before the test. This phenomenon has been termed the osmopressor response and is a point of interest for research throughout orthostatic dysregulation literature.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^1175qM4C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Volume Depletion

JARDIANCE causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. JARDIANCE may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Increased Urination

In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on JARDIANCE than on placebo (see Table 2). Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.

Hypoglycemia in Clinical Trials for Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The incidence of hypoglycemia in adults by trial is shown in Table 3. The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when JARDIANCE was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea.

### C1q / TNF-α-related protein 1 (CTRP1) maintains blood pressure under dehydration conditions [^1154oRsG]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Circulating CTRP1 (C1q/TNF-α [tumor necrosis factor-α]-related protein 1) levels are increased in hypertensive patients compared with those in healthy subjects. Nonetheless, little is known about the molecular and physiological function of CTRP1 in blood pressure (BP) regulation.

Objective

To investigate the physiological/pathophysiological role of CTRP1 in BP regulation.

Methods and Results

CTRP1 production was increased to maintain normotension under dehydration conditions, and this function was impaired in inducible CTRP1 KO (knockout) mice (CTRP1 ΔCAG). The increase in CTRP1 under dehydration conditions was mediated by glucocorticoids, and the antagonist mifepristone prevented the increase in CTRP1 and attenuated BP recovery. Treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid increased the transcription, translation, and secretion of CTRP1 from skeletal muscle cells. Functionally, CTRP1 increases BP through the stimulation of the AT1R (Ang II [angiotensin II] receptor 1)-Rho (Ras homolog gene family)/ROCK (Rho kinase)-signaling pathway to induce vasoconstriction. CTRP1 promoted AT1R plasma membrane trafficking through phosphorylation of AKT and AKT substrate of 160 kDa (AS160). In addition, the administration of an AT1R blocker, losartan, recovered the hypertensive phenotype of CTRP1 TG (transgenic) mice.

Conclusions

For the first time, we provide evidence that CTRP1 contributes to the regulation of BP homeostasis by preventing dehydration-induced hypotension.

FIGURE 2:
Hydration status in different subcategories (multivariate). (A) Transport status and gender, (B) transport status and diabetes; dotted lines reflect range of euvolaemia (± 1.1 L).

Only 24.5% of total patients are both in the normal range of systolic blood pressure and normohydrated, whereas 28.2% of the patients are overhydrated and have a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg. Normal or low systolic blood pressure despite overhydration is present in 28.2%, and 1.5% of patients have a high systolic blood pressure despite dehydration (Figure 3 and).

For patients who were deemed by clinical judgement to be dehydrated, BCM measurement confirmed this in only in 36% of cases, whereas 40 and 24% were labelled as normohydrated and overhydrated. Of those called 'normohydrated' by clinical appreciation, 58.2% were also labelled as euvolaemic by BCM, whereas 5.6 and 36.2% were labelled as dehydrated and overhydrated by BCM. On the other hand, of those clinically assessed as overhydrated, 81.4% were also overhydrated according to BCM (Figure 4). The kappa coefficient was 0.412 (95% CI: 0.362–0.461). When BCM was considered the gold standard, a clinical judgement 'not overhydrated' (so either normohydrated or dehydrated) was only correct in two-thirds of cases, whereas a clinical judgment 'overhydrated' was only false in a minority of cases (positive and negative predictive value of clinical appreciation 64.3 and 18.6%, respectively).

### H₂O coma [^117PEEhV]. Neurocritical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Water intoxication is a rare cause of coma. The leading causes of excessive hydration are endurance exercise, drug abuse, iatrogenic, cerebral salt wasting, or psychiatric conditions. Self-induced water intoxication in an otherwise healthy person is exceedingly rare.

Methods

Single patient case report and review of the literature.

Results

We describe a previously fit and healthy 13-year-old girl who was admitted to the Accident and Emergency department in a comatose state following an unwitnessed seizure. On examination she had a fluctuating Glasgow Coma Score, bilateral mydriatic pupils that responded poorly to light, and an upgoing right plantar. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and oximetry, as well as body mass index, were normal. Routine blood examination revealed hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and a low hematocrit. Water intoxication was suspected and confirmed by reduced urine sodium, serum, and urine osmolality. The computed tomographic brain scan, lumbar puncture opening pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid examination were all normal. She regained consciousness and was fully orientated within 24 hours following intravenous NaCl administration. In this case, thirst without any other apparent pathology led to voluntary water intoxication.

Conclusions

Our case illustrates the classic picture of self-induced water intoxication in a previously fit and healthy patient.

### A mortality prediction rule for non-elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^115NTKon]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

b Age was excluded from this table because all patients were < 65 years. The c statistic for the model is 0.73273

c The existence of a clinical sign of dehydration or blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 210 mg/L

d SpO₂ ≤ 90% or PaO₂ ≤ 60 mmHg

e Systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg

h The reference group is 18–39 years

Fig. 1
Receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting 30-day mortality of non-elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The risk score for non-elderly (range, 0–5) is calculated by summing the existence of the following characteristics: patient requires help with feeding; the existence of a malignancy (any malignancy including metastatic solid tumour); confusion; low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg), and age 40–64 years. The A-DROP score (range, 0–5) is obtained by summing the existence of the following characteristics: confusion, dehydration (existence of a clinical sign of dehydration or blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 210 mg/L), respiratory failure (SpO₂ ≤ 90% or PaO₂ ≤ 60 mmHg), a low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg), and age. For A-DROP, scores for age are 0 points in all patients because all are < 65 years. The area under the curve of the risk score for non-elderly (0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84–0.87) is higher than that of the A-DROP score (0.72, 95% CI: 0.70–0.74) (P < 0.0001)

### Impact of mild dehydration on wellness and on exercise performance [^111yh9Ym]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic mild dehydration is a common condition in some population groups, including especially the elderly and those who participate in physical activity in warm environments. Hypohydration is recognised as a precipitating factor in a number of acute medical conditions in the elderly, and there may be an association, although not necessarily a causal one, between a low habitual fluid intake and some cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There is some evidence of impairments of cognitive function at moderate levels of hypohydration, but even short periods of fluid restriction, leading to a loss of body mass of 1–2%, lead to reductions in the subjective perception of alertness and ability to concentrate and to increases in self-reported tiredness and headache. In exercise lasting more than a few minutes, hypohydration clearly impairs performance capacity, but muscle strength appears to be relatively unaffected.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115wrvSZ]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Treating nOH — step 2: non-pharmacological measures

The next step in the treatment algorithm is to have the patient incorporate a number of simple non-pharmacological measures into their daily routines to address symptoms due to nOH. From a practical perspective, these measures are often incorporated into a treatment plan in parallel to the changes to pharmacology outlined in step 1 above. For patients who are experiencing syncope, near-syncope, or falls, there is some urgency to eliminating destabilizing postural changes. Hence, non-pharmacologic measures may be used individually, but are most effective when used in combination or while concomitantly titrating pharmacologic treatments.

Blood volume repletion

Patients with nOH require interventions which are aimed at ensuring normal or even expanded blood volume. Many patients with nOH, especially older patients, are often blood volume depleted due to inadequate oral fluid intake. This may be due to voluntary restriction of intake for self-management of common conditions causing urinary urgency and urinary frequency including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), overactive bladder, neurogenic bladder, stress incontinence or similar bladder dysfunctions as are commonly seen in many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the most common identifiable and readily treatable problem is decreased daily water intake. Most patients are unaware of the volume of water intake necessary during a typical day. A minimum of 64 oz (approximately 2 L) of water daily is recommended to achieve adequate daily hydration, although many clinicians recommend over 100 oz (3 L) daily to ensure blood volume repletion, depending on cardiac status. Modifications in fluid volume recommendations also need to be considered in geographic areas with warmer weather or during the summer season.

In addition to maintaining intravascular blood volume and to support standing blood pressure, patients with nOH who rapidly consume (within 5 min) 16 oz (approximately 500 ml) of free water can raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mmHg within 5 min. The effect is due to a hypo-osmolar reflex in the portal circulation and can last for an hour to help alleviate the symptoms of nOH experienced on standing. Liquids other than water do not provide the same blood pressure response. Thus, proper hydration can produce both acute and long-lasting significant clinical benefits to patients with nOH.

### Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^112RQAQZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Volume Depletion

Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Empagliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Increased Urination

In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on empagliflozin than on placebo (see Table 2). Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

Hypoglycemia in Clinical Trials with Empagliflozin for Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The incidence of hypoglycemia in adults by trial is shown in Table 3. The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when empagliflozin was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113REeYF]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Even this appropriate testing of blood pressure will not identify all patients with OH, since variability in meals, hydration, time of day, and medications can affect the orthostatic change in blood pressure. Additionally, there is a subgroup of patients who manifest symptoms of OH beyond the 3-min interval, defined as delayed OH, which may be a manifestation of early autonomic failure. Further discussion of this group is outside the scope of this paper.

Upon standing from a supine or seated position, healthy, normally volume-replete individuals will typically experience a modest decline in systolic blood pressure (< 10 mmHg), a very slight increase in diastolic blood pressure (approximately 2.5 mmHg) and a modest increase in heart rate (10–20 beats per minute [bpm]). These compensatory changes are induced primarily by augmentation of norepinephrine output by sympathetic autonomic peripheral nerve endings. Measuring the heart rate change from the supine (and/or seated) to standing may aid in differentiating between nOH and OH. If an individual develops OH upon standing, an increase in heart rate of < 15 bpm suggests a diagnosis of nOH. In contrast, individuals with non-neurogenic OH will typically demonstrate an increase in heart rate of > 15 bpm within 3 min of standing. The heart rate information is acquired during the measurement of orthostatic vital signs as described above. It should be noted that without a fall in blood pressure, the heart rate criteria for nOH do not apply. In addition, monitoring of postural heart rate changes for diagnostic purposes requires that there is no confounding medication effect (e.g. beta blockers, alpha–beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers; see below) or intrinsic cardiac rhythm disturbances (e.g. sick sinus syndrome, complete heart block, dependence on a mechanical pacemaker) that prevent a compensatory heart rate increase upon standing. In a similar fashion, volume depletion (e.g. diuretics) in healthy individuals can be associated with OH, but should not be confused with nOH because there will still be an exaggerated increase in heart rate upon standing (≥ 20 bpm) in OH, contrasted with an expected failure to increase heart rate in nOH.

### Lurasidone hydrochloride [^114Wqgqj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis

Leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and lurasidone hydrochloride should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm³) should discontinue lurasidone hydrochloride and have their WBC followed until recovery.

5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Lurasidone hydrochloride may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naïve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.

Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: ≥ 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and ≥ 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.

Schizophrenia

Adults:

The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (lurasidone hydrochloride incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)].

### Medical management of cerebral edema [^116g8AHx]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema is frequently encountered in clinical practice in critically ill patients with acute brain injury from diverse origins and is a major cause of increased morbidity and death in this subset of patients. The consequences of cerebral edema can be lethal and include cerebral ischemia from compromised regional or global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial compartmental shifts due to intracranial pressure gradients that result in compression of vital brain structures. The overall goal of medical management of cerebral edema is to maintain regional and global CBF to meet the metabolic requirements of the brain and prevent secondary neuronal injury from cerebral ischemia. Medical management of cerebral edema involves using a systematic and algorithmic approach, from general measures (optimal head and neck positioning for facilitating intracranial venous outflow, avoidance of dehydration and systemic hypotension, and maintenance of normothermia) to specific therapeutic interventions (controlled hyperventilation, administration of corticosteroids and diuretics, osmotherapy, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression). This article reviews and highlights the medical management of cerebral edema based on pathophysiological principles in acute brain injury.

### Point of care lactate for differentiating septic shock from hypovolemic shock in non-ICU settings: a prospective observational study [^1145zGi2]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In high diarrhea burden settings, diarrheal infections can be life-threatening if hypovolemic shock due to severe dehydration and septic shock cannot be distinguished quickly. Vibrio cholerae, ETEC, Rotavirus, and Shigella cause acute watery diarrhea in adults in developing countries. These organisms can enter the bloodstream and generate malregulated immune responses that cause sepsis, septic shock, and irreparable organ damage. Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality. The Sepsis-3 criteria by Third International Consensus Definition for septic shock identify septic shock patients having persistent hypotension and serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L. However, clinical features like altered mentation, hypoperfusion and hypotension are overlapping with the features of hypovolemic shock due to severe dehydration make the diagnosis of septic shock difficultin settings with high diarrhea prevalence.

Global burden of sepsis is more than 31.5 million every year with an estimated 5.3 million deaths. Approximately 85% of sepsis cases and sepsis-related deaths worldwide occurred in developing countries. Report from the largest database on diarrheal disease in the world, belonged to the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b), 69% of diarrheal adults progressed to septic shock from severe sepsis. Without timely identification and intervention, septic shock may proceed to organ failure and death.

Widespread tissue hypoperfusion in the body triggered anaerobic metabolism and overproduction of lactate as a by-product. Besides persisting hypotension with a mean arterial pressure of below 65 mm-Hg, blood lactate over 2 mmol/L is current recommended indicator of septic shock. There are paucity of literature describing the temporal relation of lactate with dehydration and their similarity or dissimilarity with septic shock. Based on this important aspect, our study objective was to explore the changes in point of care (POC) lactate levels in adult diarrheal patients with septic shock and hypovolemic shock after initial fluid resuscitation and thus differentiating them from septic shock and hypovolemic shock.

Table 6 shows patients' characteristics for each mortality risk score. There was a significant relationship between the risk score and various characteristics, excluding influenza pneumonia (almost P < 0.0001; influenza pneumonia, P = 0.9158). Particularly, few patients died (only 2 died in 30 days) among 11,297 patients in the lowest risk score (0). The negative likelihood ratio of the score 0 group was 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00–0.04) for 30-day death. The positive likelihood ratio was 19.9 (95% CI: 15.8–24.9) for the score ≥ 4 group.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115KkHZg]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension — pathophysiology and presentation are summarized as excessive venous pooling with impaired compensatory responses and characteristic upright-position syncope. OH involves excessive pooling of blood volume in the splanchnic and leg circulations, causing decreased venous return and cardiac output on standing. In neurogenic OH, vasoconstrictor mechanisms may be inadequate due to neurodegenerative disorders or autonomic peripheral neuropathies. Neurogenic OH may present clinically as classic or delayed OH, and most commonly OH is due to dehydration or medications such as diuretics and vasodilators, with syncope from OH occurring in the upright position.

### Stroke outcome related to initial volume status and diuretic use [^115SAhve]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke depends upon the complex interactions among cerebral and systemic hemodynamic parameters. Previous studies have suggested that the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive medications may reduce the risk of, reduce the severity of, and improve the outcome after stroke. However, these medications have the potential to increase the likelihood of dehydration, or more accurately, a volume contracted state (VCS) at the time of stroke, which may worsen functional outcome. A common side effect of these medications is also change in electrolytes, most notably depletion of serum potassium, which may also be associated with risk of stroke and stroke‐related death. Whether diuretics, hydration status, and potassium levels have an effect in the acute setting has not been determined.

In the acute setting, patients with ischemic stroke are commonly administered intravenous fluid under the premise that dehydration can lead to reduced cerebral perfusion and ultimately worse clinical outcome. The 2018 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke merely state that, "Hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function… " with an admission that, "There are no data to guide volume and duration of parenteral fluid delivery. Although the class of recommendation for this guideline is 1 (strong), the evidence for this merely comes from consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience. Surprisingly, data on the hydration practices and efficacy of this practice are sparse. A few studies have recently begun to look at the effect of a VCS in patients with acute stroke on poststroke outcomes. A single‐center study found that those in a VCS had worse clinical outcome at 90 days than those who were euvolemic. A recent substudy of the ENOS (Efficacy of Nitric Oxide) trial involving data from 310 participants found an unfavorable shift in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and increased death at day 90 in patients with increased urea; however, other markers of dehydration did not yield consistent findings.

### Dehydration and renal failure in older persons during heatwaves-predictable, hard to identify but preventable? [^115VQSyi]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Extremes of temperature are likely to increase in frequency associated with climate change. Older patients are particularly vulnerable to the effects of heat with excess mortality well documented in this population. Age-associated neurohormonal changes particularly affecting the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), alterations in thermoregulatory mechanisms, changes in renal function and body composition render older persons vulnerable to dehydration, renal failure, heat stroke and increased mortality. Barriers to diagnosis and recognition of dehydration and renal failure include the absence of reliable clinical signs and cost-effective diagnostic tools. Regularly used medications also impact on physiological responses to excess heat as well as interfering with the recognition and management of dehydration during heat waves. In view of the above, anticipatory measures should be instituted ideally prior to the onset of heat waves to minimise morbidity and mortality for older people during periods of excess heat.

### Delirium and dehydration: some fluid for thought? [^111QfrAV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Delirium is a frequent complication of advanced cancer. It is characterized by cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbance, and therefore can potentially result in severe symptom distress and impeded communication between patient and family and between patient and medical staff. The reversibility of delirium depends on its underlying causes. Delirium is multifactorial in origin, and precipitating or contributory factors include dehydration and hypovolemia. Much of the debate concerning the role of hydration in advanced cancer has centered on symptoms such as thirst, and ethical issues such as parenteral hydration and its association with prolongation of life, with the association between hydration status and delirium largely excluded. This review examines the latter association in the light of recent studies. It also provides an outline of relevant pathophysiology and clinical assessment, a decision-making framework and a practical approach to the techniques of assisting hydration. This will hopefully help physicians and families in weighing up the merits of assisted hydration in an individual context and help them to achieve a consensus on the role of hydration that is consistent with the goals of care.

Chapter 1: Diagnosis of hypovolaemia

Referenced literature: –

Box 3
no caption available

Background to recommendation 1–1

One of the most basic decisions for maintenance of the homeostasis of the human body is the choice of delivering external solutions. The objectives at the heart of such decision-making are the goals of volume substitution (intravascular) and fluid substitution (interstitial). In the majority of studies, the terms (intracellular) dehydration and (extracellular) volume depletion are used interchangeably, although defining two quite different entities. In addition, posture-related syncope or reflex tachycardia while standing (by over 30 beats min −1) is frequently indicative of a fluid volume deficit (hypovolaemia). In 1999, McGee et al. demonstrated that a dry axilla, in contrast to moist mucous membranes, would also increase the sensitivity for a diagnosis of hypovolaemia. Interestingly, capillary refill time and skin turgidity showed only very poor sensitivity, whereas presence of tachycardia when lying down had only a high specificity.

As every substance delivered to the body interacts with the body's own fluids in accordance with its composition, stability and mode of delivery, predictions as to inertness or the exchange of substances (down to the level of the cell) are virtually impossible.

Total body water is held enclosed in various fluid spaces (compartments): two-thirds are found in cells (intracellular compartment), whereas the remaining water is held in the extracellular compartment and comprises interstitial fluid (31%), blood plasma (7%) and other transcellular fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). The body's own regulation of fluid balance is achieved by osmoregulation and volume regulation, and the thirst reflex. The goal is to maintain body water at a volume of approximately 42 l. As the volume of the intracellular space is generally co-controlled by the extracellular space (cell walls are water-permeable), any fluid delivered to the body can cause water displacement, down to the level of the cell. As the interstitial fluid forms part of the extracellular space and can be determined only indirectly as the difference between overall extracellular space and plasma volume, investigations of interstitial fluid deficit are virtually impossible – at least without additional instrument-based diagnostics. Accordingly, the substance-based substitution of the interstitial space is certainly neither advisable nor necessary. In the event of isotonic hyperhydration, for example extended intravascular volume delivery would result in an expansion of the extracellular space with an increased incidence of interstitial oedema because of diffusion.

### Intravenous solutions in the care of patients with volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities [^1134hMUp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

### Lurasidone hydrochloride (Latuda) [^112xMTWd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

LATUDA may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naïve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.

Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: ≥ 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and ≥ 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.

Schizophrenia

Adults

The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (LATUDA incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)].

### Recommendations for management of diabetes during ramadan: update 2010 [^111D2wtL]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Dehydration and thrombosis

Limitation of fluid intake during the fast, especially if prolonged, is a cause of dehydration. The dehydration may become severe as a result of excessive perspiration in hot and humid climates and among individuals who perform hard physical labor. In addition, hyperglycemia produces an osmotic diuresis, further contributing to volume and electrolyte depletion. Orthostatic hypotension may develop, especially in patients with preexisting autonomic neuropathy. Syncope, falls, injuries, and bone fractures may result from hypovolemia and the associated hypotension. In addition, contraction of the intravascular space can further exacerbate the hypercoagulable state that is well demonstrated in diabetes. Increased blood viscosity secondary to dehydration may enhance the risk of thrombosis and stroke. A report from Saudi Arabia suggested an increased incidence of retinal vein occlusion in patients who fasted during Ramadan. However, hospitalizations due to coronary events or stroke were not increased during Ramadan. There are no data concerning the effect of fasting on mortality in patients with or without diabetes.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Association between orthostatic blood pressure dysregulation and geriatric syndromes: a cross-sectional study [^113z8Ezf]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Orthostatic blood pressure dysregulation is a common condition in the elderly population and its frequency increases with age. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) is about 5% in adults but rises to 30% in the community-dwelling older population aged over 65 years and reached up to 65% in a very old patients when systematic and repeated measurements are performed. Many causes or mechanisms such as dysautonomia secondary to diabetes mellitus or Parkinson's disease, dehydration or polymedication, especially with antihypertensive and psychotropic drugs, explain this increased prevalence of OH in the elderly. OH in elderly should be considered a poor indicator of health. Thus, OH is associated with cardiovascular comorbidities, such as ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease, and with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. An association between OH and geriatric syndromes such as falls, malnutrition and functional dependency, or common illnesses such as depression or neurocognitive disorders, have been described, although the mechanisms of these relationships are still debated. In an Italian cohort of 510 old people, OH was significantly associated with disability, mortality and higher hospitalization rates according to the frailty status of patients.

Orthostatic hypertension (OHT), that seems as frequent as OH, has been less investigated. The prevalence of OHT is estimated at 2.4% in young adults but ranges from 4 to 28% in the elderly, especially in those with hypertension or diabetes. The definition of OHT is not consensual. By analogy with OH, a 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after 1 or 3 min of standing is a widely accepted definition. OHT is associated with excess cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. Thus, in a cohort of nursing home residents, the cardiovascular mortality in patients with OHT was similar to those with OH, near to 25% at 2 years of follow-up, but significantly higher than those without orthostatic blood pressure dysregulation. Moreover, in some studies performed in "young" elderly populations with few geriatric syndromes or, conversely, in very frail nursing home residents, OHT was inconsistently associated with cognitive decline, frailty or disability. Thus, there is poor evidence that geriatric syndromes, that are poor prognosis multifactorial conditions characterizing aging people, are associated with orthostatic blood pressure dysregulation in an elderly community-dwelling population.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between orthostatic blood pressure dysregulation and geriatric syndromes in elderly outpatients followed in a geriatric tertiary care center.

Predisposing factors

Orthostatic hypotension is influenced by a range of factors; cross-sectional analysis not only suggests an influence of age, but also drug effects and orthostatic stress in neurological disorders, particularly PD, DLB and MSA as well as autonomic neuropathies. The association between OH and advanced age may be explained by a number of predisposing factors that occur along with aging, including changes in baroreflex function, inadequate vasoconstrictor responses, reduced cardiac and vascular compliance, reduced blood volume and impaired efficiency of the skeletal muscle pump. In addition, dehydration, deconditioning and poor nutrition contribute to the development of OH in the elderly population.

Another factor massively influencing OH prevalence is the effect of medication. Elderly subjects commonly require medications altering blood pressure, such as diuretics or antihypertensives, which are well known to either cause or exacerbate OH. In addition, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, tricyclic antidepressants, vasodilatators, sympatholytics, and antiparkinsonian agents can increase risk of OH by impairing sympathetic tone or reducing peripheral vascular resistance. Further, increased orthostatic stress in patients with parkinsonian conditions may be observed early in the morning, with a rise in core temperature, in activities which increase intrathoracic pressure (e.g. defecation, coughing), prolonged standing, exertion, alcohol or carbohydrate ingestion. A structured list of OH causes is presented in Table 2.

### When and how to use orthostatic vital signs [^114sYtpa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Much controversy surrounds the use of orthostatic vital signs (OVS), including their indications, performance, and interpretation. This can lead to conflict between nurses, physicians, and consultants. This article summarizes the evidence for OVS in selected emergency department (ED) indications and the basis for a rapid measurement protocol.

Objective

This narrative review is intended to clarify indications for OVS measurement, their performance, and interpretation.

Discussion

Phlebotomy studies indicate that OVS are more discriminating than supine vital signs in hypovolemia, but many findings, even some considered "positive", do not provide compelling evidence in favor of or against disease. Evaluated as a diagnostic test, they have a low yield and controversial criteria for a positive test, but as vital signs, they are useful for selected patients with frequent ED presentations-blood loss, dehydration, dizziness, weakness, and falls. Available evidence supports a rapid measurement protocol, including a 1-min interval after standing.

Conclusion

OVS are useful in selected patients, in a variety of frequent presentations, but their indications and implications for a patient's care are subject to physician interpretation. Given their ease of measurement and effect on decision-making, physicians may consider measuring them early in the evaluation of selected patients.

### Furosemide [^116GFMLt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The principal signs and symptoms of overdose with furosemide are dehydration, blood volume reduction, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, hypokalemia and hypochloremic alkalosis, and are extensions of its diuretic action.

The acute toxicity of furosemide has been determined in mice, rats and dogs. In all three, the oral LD50exceeded 1000 mg/kg body weight, while the intravenous LD50ranged from 300 to 680 mg/kg. The acute intragastric toxicity in neonatal rats is 7 to 10 times that of adult rats.

The concentration of furosemide in biological fluids associated with toxicity or death is not known. Treatment of overdosage is supportive and consists of replacement of excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Serum electrolytes, carbon dioxide level and blood pressure should be determined frequently. Adequate drainage must be assured in patients with urinary bladder outlet obstruction (such as prostatic hypertrophy).

Hemodialysis does not accelerate furosemide elimination.
