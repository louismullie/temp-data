## Question

lower extremity edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing lower extremity edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage by laterality and acuity. Then, I should verify the focused history and medication review. Next, I will examine the physical findings and how they refine the differential. After that, I need to check the initial laboratory and imaging workup aligned with etiologies. Then, I will consider advanced diagnostics for unresolved cases. Finally, I should outline etiology-specific management, special populations, and follow-up with objective monitoring, while continuously validating each step against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the triage framework, because laterality and time course immediately narrow the differential and dictate urgency. Acute unilateral swelling under 72 hours raises concern for deep venous thrombosis, cellulitis, ruptured Baker's cyst, acute compartment syndrome, or a new medication effect, so I should not delay VTE evaluation in that scenario, whereas chronic bilateral edema more often reflects venous insufficiency, systemic disease, or medication effects, and chronic unilateral edema suggests venous obstruction, lymphedema, or post-thrombotic syndrome, so I need to ensure I anchor on these axes before proceeding further [^112zZJxU] [^112haf2y] [^117DKd7J].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently refine the differential. I should confirm onset and progression, positional dependence, pain characteristics, skin changes, trauma or surgery, cancer treatment, and systemic symptoms such as dyspnea or weight gain, while also asking about OSA symptoms because pulmonary hypertension can drive bilateral edema even without overt heart failure, and I should double-check for dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, thiazolidinediones, NSAIDs, hormonal agents, and oncology or immunotherapy drugs that commonly cause edema, since medication-induced edema is frequently overlooked and often misattributed to heart failure [^113fbkTh] [^111c5jRo] [^112uDXVa] [^112cesUS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on exam. I need to ensure I characterize pitting versus nonpitting, distribution, and skin findings carefully. Pitting edema suggests venous or systemic causes early on, whereas nonpitting edema with a positive Stemmer sign and skin thickening points toward lymphedema, and I should remember that early lymphedema can be pitting before fibrosis sets in, so I must not over-rely on pitting alone to exclude lymphedema. I will now examine for hemosiderin deposition, lipodermatosclerosis, and venous ulcers to support chronic venous insufficiency, and I should confirm whether the feet are spared to help distinguish lipedema from lymphedema, while also checking for jugular venous distension, rales, or an S3 if heart failure is suspected [^117DKd7J] [^113y3LBe] [^113EweB2].

> I should double-check the initial laboratory and imaging strategy to match pretest probabilities. For most patients with new bilateral edema, a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, TSH, urinalysis with protein-to-creatinine ratio, and BNP are appropriate to screen for renal, hepatic, endocrine, and cardiac etiologies, and if unilateral acute swelling is present, I need to order a D-dimer and proceed to compression duplex if positive or if clinical suspicion remains high, whereas for chronic edema with venous features, duplex venous ultrasound with reflux assessment is indicated, and if lymphedema remains uncertain, lymphoscintigraphy can provide objective confirmation, though I should remember its limited availability and the need to correlate with clinical context [^113cEMx8] [^112haf2y] [^113y3LBe].

> But wait, what if the etiology remains unclear after initial testing. Let me consider advanced diagnostics selectively. If I suspect proximal venous obstruction such as May-Thurner or post-thrombotic iliac disease, CT venography can identify compressive lesions, and in patients with suspected phlebolymphedema, CT features like skin thickening, honeycombing, and muscle compartment edema correlate with lymphedema severity, though I should confirm that these findings are interpreted in the right clinical context and not overcalled in isolation. If lymphedema is suspected but lymphoscintigraphy is unavailable or equivocal, indocyanine green lymphography or bioimpedance may assist, and I need to ensure I do not substitute imaging for careful clinical synthesis [^1149eHT9] [^1156JSLi] [^115yBfPj].

> Next, I should review etiology-specific management, starting with venous insufficiency and phlebolymphedema, because compression is foundational and diuretics are often ineffective unless there is true systemic volume overload. Graduated compression stockings, leg elevation, calf muscle activation, and skin care are first-line, and for persistent symptoms with documented reflux, endovenous ablation may be appropriate, whereas for iliac vein compression with significant edema or venous claudication, iliac vein stenting can be considered after excluding other causes and aligning with appropriate use criteria. I should confirm that compression is tailored to the patient's arterial status and that expectations are set because edema may be multifactorial and only partially responsive to venous interventions [^111VbfnS] [^116te6Sp] [^111vCpiX].

> I will now examine lymphedema management, and I need to ensure I emphasize that diuretics are not routinely effective for lymphatic failure. Complex decongestive therapy with manual lymphatic drainage, multilayer bandaging, exercise, and meticulous skin care reduces volume and infection risk, and pneumatic or nonpneumatic compression devices can augment maintenance, with emerging data suggesting some nonpneumatic devices improve adherence and outcomes. For refractory cases, lymphaticovenous anastomosis or other microsurgical options may be considered in specialized centers, and I should confirm candidacy and stage before referral [^112Vx45d] [^114otUxH] [^116WD6YZ].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle medication-induced edema, because treating the drug effect with a loop diuretic is a classic prescribing cascade. For dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker edema, dose reduction, switching to another class, or adding an ACE inhibitor are preferred strategies, and observational data show frequent inappropriate loop diuretic use instead of addressing the CCB, which increases adverse events without correcting the cause. For thiazolidinedione-associated edema, I should reassess indication and consider discontinuation if edema is problematic, and for pemetrexed or other chemotherapies, dose modification or steroids may be required depending on severity and competing risks [^1152szBf] [^111XhtF9] [^112uDXVa] [^1161yC6e].

> Let me consider systemic causes next, and I should confirm that diuretics are appropriate only when there is true volume overload. In heart failure with edema, guideline-directed medical therapy and diuretics titrated to congestion are indicated, in cirrhosis with ascites, spironolactone is foundational, and in nephrotic syndrome, management of proteinuria and cautious diuresis are key, while hypothyroid myxedema requires hormone replacement rather than diuretics, so I need to ensure I match the therapy to the pathophysiology rather than defaulting to loop diuretics for all edema [^113cEMx8] [^115GytUr].

> I should double-check special populations and mimics so I do not miss atypical presentations. In pediatrics, vascular malformations and hemihypertrophy are common mimics of lymphedema and require targeted imaging, whereas in adults with cancer, treatment-related lymphedema and phlebolymphedema are prevalent and underrecognized, and in patients with HIV or HHV-8, lymphatic involvement from Kaposi sarcoma can cause severe edema, so I need to maintain a high index of suspicion and tailor diagnostics accordingly [^112TRqzp] [^115q7jHM] [^111i6mYe].

> Next, I should review objective monitoring because clinical impressions of edema are notoriously unreliable. Serial limb circumference or water displacement can track response, and iPad-based 3D scanning shows promise for reproducible volumetry in clinic, though I should confirm feasibility and not let technology replace clinical judgment. The revised Venous Clinical Severity Score provides a standardized severity framework for venous edema, and I need to ensure I document baseline and serial measures to guide therapy and set expectations [^116Jy7gW] [^113QxKVC].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up addresses complications and prevention. Chronic edema increases cellulitis risk, and risk rises with wounds, obesity, diabetes, male sex, and advanced lymphedema stage, so I should reinforce skin care, weight management, and early treatment of minor injuries, and I should consider prophylactic antibiotics in selected high-risk patients with recurrent infections. If I initially assumed bilateral edema implies lymphedema, wait, that would be an overgeneralization; bilateral edema is common in systemic disease and venous insufficiency, so I must continually re-evaluate the diagnosis as new data emerge and adjust the plan accordingly [^114L1eia] [^113CAivE] [^112haf2y].

Lower extremity edema is most often due to **venous insufficiency** or **systemic disease** (heart, kidney, or liver failure) [^113EweB2], but medications — especially **calcium channel blockers** [^111c5jRo] and thiazolidinediones [^112uDXVa] — are common reversible causes [^116t161D]. Acute unilateral swelling warrants **urgent DVT evaluation** [^112haf2y]; chronic bilateral edema suggests systemic or venous disease [^113EweB2]. Initial workup should include history, exam, CBC, CMP, LFTs, TSH, urinalysis, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [^113fbkTh] [^112haf2y]; add BNP if heart failure is suspected [^112haf2y]. Management targets the cause: elevate legs, use compression for venous edema [^113fbkTh], and reserve diuretics for systemic volume overload [^112haf2y]; treat lymphedema with complex decongestive therapy [^112Vx45d] and address medication-induced edema by adjusting or stopping the offending drug [^1152szBf].

---

## Pathophysiology

Lower extremity edema arises from **imbalanced capillary hemodynamics** [^112haf2y], in which filtration exceeds lymphatic drainage, causing interstitial fluid accumulation [^113EweB2]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Increased hydrostatic pressure**: Venous hypertension from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) [^114Zp13i], heart failure, or venous obstruction [^113yEE7o].
- **Increased capillary permeability**: Inflammation, infection, or drugs (e.g. calcium channel blockers) [^111c5jRo].
- **Decreased oncotic pressure**: Hypoalbuminemia from liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, or malnutrition [^1144arSP].
- **Lymphatic obstruction**: Primary or secondary lymphedema [^1166t8NC] [^1166sYLs].

---

## Common etiologies

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Venous | - Chronic venous insufficiency [^114Zp13i] <br/> - Deep vein thrombosis [^112haf2y] <br/> - May-Thurner syndrome [^111vCpiX] |
| Systemic | - Heart failure [^112haf2y] <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome [^1145BULb] <br/> - Liver cirrhosis [^1145BULb] <br/> - Hypothyroidism [^117DKd7J] |
| Medications | - Calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine) [^111c5jRo] <br/> - Thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone) [^112uDXVa] <br/> - NSAIDs [^notfound] <br/> - Hormones [^112haf2y] |
| Lymphatic | - Primary lymphedema [^1166sYLs] <br/> - Secondary lymphedema (post-surgical, radiation, malignancy) [^1166sYLs] |
| Other | - Complex regional pain syndrome [^1147Rwse] <br/> - Lipedema [^112nTrEN] <br/> - Compartment syndrome [^117DKd7J] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential [^112zZJxU]:

- **History**: Onset, duration, unilateral vs bilateral, pain, trauma, surgery, medication use, systemic symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain) [^112haf2y].
- **Physical examination**: Pitting vs non-pitting edema, skin changes (hyperpigmentation, ulcers), varicosities, unilateral vs bilateral, jugular venous distension [^117DKd7J].
- **Initial laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, LFTs, TSH, urinalysis, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, BNP if heart failure suspected [^113cEMx8] [^112haf2y].
- **Imaging**: Duplex ultrasound for DVT/CVI [^112haf2y], echocardiography for heart failure, CT/MRI for suspected venous obstruction or malignancy [^1149eHT9].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Venous insufficiency**: Leg elevation, compression stockings, exercise, treat reflux or obstruction if severe [^111VbfnS] [^113fbkTh].
- **Systemic disease**: Treat heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, hypothyroidism [^115GytUr].
- **Medication-induced edema**: Adjust or discontinue offending drugs (e.g. calcium channel blockers, thiazolidinediones) [^1152szBf] [^112uDXVa].
- **Lymphedema**: Complex decongestive therapy (manual lymphatic drainage, compression, exercise, skin care) [^112Vx45d] [^1166sYLs].
- **Acute unilateral edema**: Rule out DVT with D-dimer and duplex ultrasound; anticoagulate if confirmed [^112haf2y].

---

## Complications

Untreated or poorly managed edema can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Skin changes**: Hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, stasis dermatitis [^117DKd7J] [^113EweB2].
- **Ulceration**: Venous ulcers, particularly over the medial malleolus [^117DKd7J].
- **Infection**: Cellulitis, erysipelas, chronic infection [^114L1eia].
- **Reduced mobility**: Functional impairment, decreased quality of life [^112SZSKZ].
- **Permanent tissue damage**: Fibrosis, lymphedema, chronic pain [^116WD6YZ] [^113yEE7o].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **cause and adherence**. Venous insufficiency and systemic disease-related edema often improve with treatment, though **chronic edema** may persist and require ongoing management [^112haf2y]. Lymphedema is chronic and progressive but can be controlled with **lifelong care** [^113oNtLe]. Medication-induced edema typically resolves after **drug adjustment** [^notfound].

---

Lower extremity edema is a common clinical finding with diverse causes; a **structured evaluation and targeted management** are essential to address the underlying cause and prevent complications [^112haf2y].

### PRACTICE GUIDELINES chronic deep venous obstruction [^113yEE7o]. AVLS (2024). High credibility.

Non-thrombotic and post-thrombotic venous obstruction — clinical manifestations of femoroiliocaval veins (FICV) obstruction: Obstructions of the femoroiliocaval veins (FICV) cause chronic venous hypertension and high venous pressures in the tissues peripheral to the site of obstruction, which can result in inflammatory changes that can be a major cause of physical disability and chronic pain. The common clinical manifestations of chronic venous hypertension include pain in the lower extremities (LE), vulva, pelvis, or low back at rest, with standing or walking, and occasionally pain with intercourse. Lower extremity edema and/or lymphedema secondary to venous obstruction and venous hypertension may reduce physical activity due to the heaviness or stiffness of the lower extremities. In addition, FICV obstruction predisposes patients to recurring cellulitis of the lower extremity, and long-standing venous hypertension can lead to inflammatory skin changes including stasis dermatitis, which may progress to venous leg ulceration (VLU).

### Comprehensive assessment of lower limb edema and its association with quality of life among men with prostate cancer [^114buDvW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer and its treatment can contribute to lower limb edema (LLE). LLE is an accumulation of excess fluid within the body's tissues, commonly presenting as swelling in areas such as the legs, ankles, and feet. LLE can arise from multiple factors, including cancer itself, cancer treatments, and other systemic health disorders. This condition typically presents with swelling, as well as sensations of heaviness and tightness in the limbs and genital area. While initially reversible, LLE can progress to a chronic condition over time, with permanent intradermal fibrosis and tissue inflammation.

The risk of LLE for men with prostate cancer is explained through several mechanisms. Prostate cancer often spreads to lymph nodes in the pelvic area, and this lymphatic obstruction may cause lymphedema in the legs and genital area. In addition, treatment-related factors may play a substantial role in the development of LLE. Hormone therapies for prostate cancer, such as abiraterone, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, and enzalutamide, are associated with increased fluid retention or elevated blood pressure, which may lead to LLE. Also, chemotherapy, e.g. docetaxel can contribute to LLE by increasing blood vessel permeability, leading to fluid leakage into the surrounding tissue, and disrupting fluid balance and lymphatic drainage. Finally, surgery and radiation treatments targeting pelvic lymph nodes, while important for prognosis, may damage the lymphatic system, thereby exacerbating the risk of LLE.

The venous and lymphatic systems are intimately related and mutually interdependent systems, and "CVI (CEAP C3 to C6) is always a chronic venous-lymphatic insufficiency", with recent observational studies confirming that CVI is a common risk factor for lymphedema.

Objectives

Phlebolymphedema, the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in Western societies, seldom gets the attention it deserves. Diagnosis is often missed and when evaluated is through lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) which is cumbersome. This study aims to assess the role of computed tomography (CT) scanning in the diagnosis of phlebolymphedema of the lower extremities by comparing CT characteristics with the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) grading system and LSG.

Methods

Patients presenting with chronic venous disease who underwent a CT scan and LSG of the lower extremities (diagnostic testing) formed the study cohort. Three assessors blinded to the patients' ISL stage and LSG results evaluated the CT for skin thickening (present/absent), subcutaneous interstitial edema (honeycombing; graded 0–2), and muscle compartment (MC) edema (graded 0–2), in the thigh (20 cm above apex of patella), leg (10 cm below apex of patella), and ankle (5 cm above lateral malleolus). Agreement from two of the three raters determined the value used for analysis. Additionally, the final score used for each variable for each limb was determined by taking the most severe value of the three levels. The three CT variables were then compared independently and together with ISL stage and LSG to determine their diagnostic potential for phlebolymphedema. Also assessed was the severity of each CT variable across each limb in addition to the evaluation of the extent of their inter-rater agreement.

Results

Of the 35 patients (50 limbs), 28 were female, with left laterality noted in 22 limbs. Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and Pathophysiological clinical class for the cohort included C0 to 2, 4 limbs (8%); C3, 13 limbs (26%); C4, 17 limbs (34%); C5, 9 limbs (18%); and C6, 7 limbs (14%). Thirty-one limbs underwent stenting for chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction after having failed conservative therapy. Of the 50 limbs, 8 (16%) were ISL stage 0, 10 (20%) ISL stage 1, 2 (4%) ISL stage 2, and 30 (60%) ISL stage 3. With LSG, 6 (12%) had a normal study, 21 (42%) mild disease, 0 (0%) moderate disease, and 23 (46%) severe disease. Correlation between LSG and ISL stage was poor (r = 0.18; p = 0.20). With ISL stage as a reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT in diagnosing phlebolymphedema were as follows: skin thickening (95%/75%/92%), honeycombing (100%/0%/84%), MC edema (100%/0%/84%), any one CT variable (100%/0%/84%), any two CT variables (100%/0%/84%), and all three CT variables (93%/63%/88%). With LSG as a reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT in diagnosing phlebolymphedema were as follows: skin thickening (82%/0%/72%), honeycombing (100%/0%/88%), MC edema (100%/0%/88%), any one CT variable (100%/0%/88%), any two CT variables (100%/0%/88%), and all three CT variables (82%/0%/72%). For CT variables, there was no significant difference between skin thickening in the thigh vs calf vs ankle (P = 0.5). MC edema, however, worsened from thigh to calf (P < .0001) without a difference between the calf and the ankle (P = 0.3). The severity of honeycombing was worst in the ankle and least in the thigh, with a significant difference between all 3 sites (P = 0.008). The inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic) varied from 0.2 for skin thickening to 0.7 for honeycombing.

Conclusions

CT scanning can be used as a screening tool for phlebolymphedema in the lower extremities. However, such a diagnosis depends on the reference standard used, ISL stage vs lymphoscintigram. Although skin thickness offered the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when the ISL stage was used, honeycombing or MC edema had high sensitivity and accuracy but low specificity when LSG was used as the reference. Factoring in inter-rater agreement as well, honeycombing was noted to be the best CT variable to diagnose phlebolymphedema.

### Lymphedema: current strategies for diagnostics and management [^116SiJwo]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphedema (LE) is characterized by the accumulation of lymph in the extremities, impairing functionality and quality of life. Despite its prevalence, accurate diagnoses and management remains complex because of inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria and limited epidemiological studies. This review aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of LE classifications, diagnostic approaches, and current management strategies. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of LE for improvement of clinical consistency and education.

### Lymphedema [^116SzyMM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a set of pathologic conditions that are characterized by the regional accumulation of excessive amounts of interstitial protein-rich fluid. These occur as a result of an imbalance between the demand for lymphatic flow and the capacity of the lymphatic circulation. Lymphedema can result from either primary or acquired (secondary) disorders. In this review, the pathophysiology, classification, natural history, differential diagnosis, and treatment of lymphedema are discussed.

### Is iPad-based three-dimensional scanning the future for evaluating lower extremity volume or edema in clinic? [^116Jy7gW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

As mentioned by the authors, objectively measuring lower extremity volumes may be beneficial, particularly for patients with venous disease, because edema is one of the most cumbersome symptoms that our patients suffer from. It is difficult to evaluate the success of treatment, particularly when the main symptom is limb swelling. Traditionally, lower extremity edema or volume has been quantified by measuring the extremity diameter at different points including the ankle, calf, and thigh and comparing those values with previous measurements. However, based on varying techniques, this approach can cause large variations, rendering the measurements inaccurate and unreliable as a way to quantify limb volumes. Specifically for venous disease the Clinical Etiological Anatomical Pathophysiological score is used, but does not really make a differentiation on the severity of edema. The revised Venous Clinical Severity score takes into consideration the severity of the edema: edema is scored as mild if it is limited to the foot and ankle, moderate if it extends above the ankle but below the knee, and severe if it extends to the knee and above. Much clinical decision-making is also based on patient perception of their symptoms. Usually, patients can tell if their edema is stable, improving, or worsening. However, no objective data can be collected based on patient report. Therefore, the authors' attempt to measure lower extremity edema objectively can be very useful in the clinic setting to correlate volume with symptoms and even gauge treatment result.

### Edema: diagnosis and management… [^117DKd7J]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility. Acute swelling of a limb over a period of less than 72 hours is more characteristic of deep venous thrombosis, cellulitis, ruptured popliteal cyst, acute compartment syndrome from trauma, or recent initiation of calcium channel blockers. The chronic accumulation of more generalized edema is due to the onset or exacerbation of chronic systemic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, renal disease, or hepatic disease. 4, 5. Lower extremity examination should focus on the medial malleolus, the bony portion of the tibia, and the dorsum of the foot. Pitting edema also occurs in the early stages of lymphedema because of an influx of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium, before fibrosis of the subcutaneous tissue; therefore, its presence should not exclude the diagnosis of lymphedema. may produce increased warmth over the affected area.

Because of the deposition of hemosiderin, chronic venous insufficiency is often associated with skin that has a brawny, reddish hue and commonly involves the medial malleolus 4, 5, 8. As venous insufficiency progresses, it can result in lipodermatosclerosis, which is associated with marked sclerotic and hyperpigmented tissue, and characterized by fibrosis and hemosiderin deposition that can lead to venous ulcers over the medial malleolus. These ulcers may progress to deep, weeping erosions. Myxedema from hypothyroidism presents with a generalized dry, thick skin with nonpitting periorbital edema and yellow to orange skin discoloration over the knees, elbows, palms, and soles. Localized pretibial myxedema may be caused by Graves disease. Examination of the feet is important in lower extremity edema.

In patients with lymphedema, there is an inability to tent the skin of the dorsum of the second toe using a pincer grasp 7, 9–11. In patients with lipedema, which is a pathologic accumulation of adipose tissue in the extremities, the feet are generally spared, although the ankles often have prominent malleolar fat pads. 12 Lipedema can also involve the upper extremities.

### Unilateral lower extremity swelling as a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111zuGgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity oedema is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The challenge is to correctly identify the aetiology of oedema, and hence correctly manage the cause. Oedema can be classified as venous oedema and lymphoedema. Lymphoedema of the lower extremities is usually bilateral. Unilateral leg lymphoedema may occur secondary to radiation, surgery, compression by a tumour or early filariasis infection. Unilateral lower extremity lymphoedema has been reported as a rare initial presentation for lymphoma, mostly in women, usually without B-symptoms, and often with inguinal lymphadenopathies or abdominal masses. In this paper, we report a rare case of unilateral lower extremity oedema in a healthy male presenting to the outpatient clinic following trauma; further work-up revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac veins.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride [^112uDXVa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Edema

In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.

Pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) a nd Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.6 Fractures

In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N = 2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N = 2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.

5.7 Macular Edema

Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.

Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione.

Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Differential diagnosis of lower extremity enlargement in pediatric patients referred with a diagnosis of lymphedema [^112TRqzp]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There are many causes for a large lower limb in the pediatric age group. These children are often mislabeled as having lymphedema, and incorrect diagnosis can lead to improper treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients referred for lower extremity "lymphedema" and to clarify management.

Methods

The authors' Vascular Anomalies Center database was reviewed between 1999 and 2010 for patients referred with a diagnosis of lymphedema of the lower extremity. Records were studied to determine the correct cause for the enlarged extremity. Alternative diagnoses, sex, age of onset, and imaging studies were also analyzed.

Results

A referral diagnosis of lower extremity lymphedema was given to 170 children; however, the condition was confirmed in only 72.9 percent of patients. Forty-six children (27.1 percent) had another disorder: microcystic/macrocystic lymphatic malformation (19.6 percent), noneponymous combined vascular malformation (13.0 percent), capillary malformation (10.9 percent), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (10.9 percent), hemihypertrophy (8.7 percent), posttraumatic swelling (8.7 percent), Parkes Weber syndrome (6.5 percent), lipedema (6.5 percent), venous malformation (4.3 percent), rheumatologic disorder (4.3 percent), infantile hemangioma (2.2 percent), kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (2.2 percent), or lipofibromatosis (2.2 percent). Age of onset in children with lymphedema was older than in patients with another diagnosis (p = 0.027).

Conclusions

"Lymphedema" is not a generic term. Approximately one-fourth of pediatric patients with a large lower extremity are misdiagnosed as having lymphedema; the most commonly confused causes are other types of vascular anomalies. History, physical examination, and often radiographic studies are required to differentiate lymphedema from other conditions to ensure the child is managed appropriately.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^115q7jHM]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Cancer-related therapy (CRT) and lymphedema — The panel's support for a CRT–lymphedema association is drawn from the extensive breast cancer literature, and edema has been estimated to occur in 19% of people with advanced cancer. From a Western medical context, CRT remains the most prevalent cause of lymphedema, and when addressing an individual who will be treated for cancer, the subject of lymphedema risk should be addressed and, where appropriate, surveillance and risk-reduction measures should be undertaken.

### Pathophysiology of lower extremity edema in acute heart failure revisited [^114PppRG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology and key determinants of lower extremity edema in patients with acute heart failure are poorly investigated.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 279 unselected patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute heart failure. Lower extremity edema was quantified at predefined locations. Left ventricular ejection fraction, central venous pressure quantifying right ventricular failure, biomarkers to quantify hemodynamic cardiac stress (B-type natriuretic peptide), and the activity of the arginine-vasopressin system (copeptin) also were recorded.

Results

Lower extremity edema was present in 218 (78%) patients and limited to the ankle in 22%, reaching the lower leg in 40%, reaching the upper leg in 11%, and was generalized (anasarca) in 3% of patients. Patients in the 4 strata according to the presence and extent of lower leg edema had comparable systolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, central venous pressure, and B-type natriuretic peptide levels, as well as copeptin and glomerular filtration rate (P = NS for all). The duration of dyspnea preceding the presentation was longer in patients with more extensive edema (P = 0.006), while serum sodium (P = 0.02) and serum albumin (P = 0.03) was lower.

Conclusion

Central venous pressure, hemodynamic cardiac stress, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the activity of the arginine-vasopressin system do not seem to be key determinants of the presence or extent of lower extremity edema in acute heart failure.

### Lower extremity compartment syndrome [^115JXQQD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Lower extremity compartment syndrome is a devastating complication if not rapidly diagnosed and properly managed. The classic symptoms of compartment syndrome can be deceiving as they occur late. Any concern for compartment syndrome based on mechanism, or the presence of pain in the affected extremity, should prompt a compartment pressure check. Both absolute compartment pressures above 30 mm Hg and a pressure differential of less than 30 mm Hg are used to make the diagnosis. The treatment goal is first to save the patient's life and second to salvage the affected limb. Fasciotomy is the only accepted treatment of compartment syndrome and should be performed quickly after the diagnosis is made. Outcomes after fasciotomy are best when there is no delay in treatment.

### Characteristic trends of lower-extremity complex regional pain syndrome [^1145DRE3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a multifaceted, progressive, and potentially devastating disorder generally affecting the extremities. In addition, scant information is available regarding the types of patients who develop lower-extremity CRPS. This is a retrospective chart review study of 64 patients who presented to a pain clinic with CRPS of the lower extremity. The study examined 23 variables broadly classified under demographic characteristics, CRPS characteristics, and healthcare utilization. The sample was found to consist of predominantly white, middle-aged women with CRPS I. Subjective complaints consisted of burning, sharp, throbbing, or aching pain with shooting symptoms. Initial presenting clinical findings included allodynia, edema, erythema, and hyperesthesia. The most common precipitating injuries were blunt trauma of the foot with or without fracture or ankle sprain. The most common inciting surgical events were bunionectomy, tarsal tunnel release, and heel-spur surgery. Referral to the pain clinic was delayed more commonly in trauma patients than in postsurgical patients, with a corresponding increase in pain clinic visits for treatment. This study may act as a guide for physicians treating the lower extremity to aid in the recognition of lower extremity complex regional pain syndrome and its characteristics.

### The 2020 appropriate use criteria for chronic lower extremity venous disease of the American Venous Forum, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the American Vein and Lymphatic Society, and the Society of Interventional Radiology [^116te6Sp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). High credibility.

C3 edema — panel ratings and clinical considerations: The panelists rated interventions for treatment of leg edema due to venous disease (CEAP class 3) as may be appropriate for several scenarios in considering saphenous vein ablations and perforator, iliac, and IVC treatments. Panelists indicated that swelling may be multifactorial and can be associated with numerous coexisting nonvenous causes that would not be expected to benefit from venous interventions. In contrast, when a patient presents with varicose veins, reflux, and edema, the group thought intervention more likely to be of benefit with improved reduction of swelling, in which case the indication for treating venous reflux would be stronger. Unilateral limb swelling was also noted by panelists to be a potential predictor of a favorable response. The response of edema C3 to either ablation for isolated below-knee GSV reflux or segmental vein reflux is not supported by data and led to a rating of may be appropriate, and more research is needed to determine its usefulness for these indications. In general, for several C3 indications, a wide dispersion of ratings was observed, which may at least in part have been due to differences in how C3 was perceived.

The development of peripheral edema can often pose a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for practitioners due to its association with a wide variety of underlying disorders ranging in severity. Updates to the original Starling's principle have provided new mechanistic insights into edema formation. Additionally, contemporary data highlighting the role of hypochloremia in the development of diuretic resistance provide a possible new therapeutic target. This article reviews the pathophysiology of edema formation and discusses implications for treatment.

### A 73-year-old man with shortness of breath, edema, and weight gain [^116kKA5c]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 73-year-old man who sought evaluation for 1 month of shortness of breath, bilateral lower-extremity edema, and weight gain of 14kg. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Peripheral edema: evaluation and management in primary care [^112haf2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema is a common clinical sign that may indicate numerous pathologies. As a sequela of imbalanced capillary hemodynamics, edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial compartment. The chronicity and laterality of the edema guide evaluation. Medications (e.g., antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones) can contribute to edema. Evaluation should begin with obtaining a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function testing, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio. Validated decision rules, such as the Wells and STOP-Bang (snoring, tired, observed, pressure, body mass index, age, neck size, gender) criteria, can guide decision-making regarding the possibility of venous thromboembolic disease and obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. Acute unilateral lower-extremity edema warrants immediate evaluation for deep venous thrombosis with a d-dimer test or compression ultrasonography. For patients with chronic bilateral lower-extremity edema, duplex ultrasonography with reflux can help diagnose chronic venous insufficiency. Patients with pulmonary edema or elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels should undergo echocardiography to assess for heart failure. Lymphedema is often a clinical diagnosis; lymphoscintigraphy can be performed if the diagnosis is unclear. Treatment of edema is specific to the etiology. Diuretics are effective but should be used only for systemic causes of edema. Ruscus extract and horse chestnut seed demonstrate moderate-quality evidence to improve edema from chronic venous insufficiency. Compression therapy is effective for most causes of edema.

### Impact of venorrhaphy and vein ligation in isolated lower-extremity venous injuries on venous thromboembolism and edema [^114aUJAU]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Following venous injury, venorrhaphy can restore outflow, although it risks thrombosis and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Vein ligation is a faster option, although it potentially risks extremity edema. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the management of venous injury on VTE and extremity edema in patients with isolated lower-extremity venous injuries.

Methods

Patients with common iliac, external iliac, and femoral venous injuries over a 10-year period were stratified by age, shock, management of venous injury, injury severity, and timing and type of anticoagulation. Outcomes included development of extremity edema and VTE (pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis). Outcomes were then evaluated to determine risk factors for symptomatic lower-extremity edema and VTE by the management of venous injuries.

Results

Eighty-four patients were identified: 20 common iliac, 27 external iliac, 37 femoral. Forty-nine underwent vein repair and 35 underwent vein ligation. Ninety-three percent were male with a mean Injury Severity Score and Glasgow Coma Scale score of 17 and 14, respectively. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 18 (21%), 15 (18%) deep venous thrombosis, and 4 (5%) pulmonary embolisms. Thirty-two (38%) patients developed lower-extremity edema. Those who underwent vein ligation had a greater degree of shock on presentation (RBC transfusions, 14 vs. 8 units; p = 0.03) and were more likely to receive prophylactic fasciotomies (60% vs. 33%, p = 0.01). There was no difference in time to or type of chemoprophylaxis between patients who underwent vein repair and those who received vein ligation. However, patients with vein ligation had fewer episodes of VTE (9% vs. 31%, p = 0.02) with no difference in symptomatic lower-extremity edema (37% vs. 39%, p = 0.88) or amputation rates (0% vs. 2%, p = 0.99).

Conclusion

Vein repair had a higher incidence of VTE while providing no additional benefit in reducing symptomatic extremity edema compared to ligation in patients suffering venous injury. Ligation of most extremity venous injuries can be performed without increasing patient morbidity.

### The utility of computed tomography venography in the routine evaluation of patients who present to a lymphedema center with lower extremity edema [^1149eHT9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Computed tomography venography (CTV) is not routinely used to screen patients presenting with a presumed lower extremity lymphedema diagnosis for left iliac vein obstruction (IVO) or May-Thurner syndrome (MTS). The objective of this study is to determine the utility of routine CTV screening for these patients by evaluating the proportion presenting with clinically significant CTV-identified left IVO.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 121 patients who had presented to our lymphedema center with lower extremity edema between November 2020 and May 2022. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, lymphedema characteristics, and imaging reports was collected. Cases of IVO present on CTV were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team to determine the clinical significance of the CTV findings.

Results

Of the patients with complete imaging studies, 49% (n = 25) had abnormal lymphoscintigraphy findings, 45% (n = 46) had reflux on ultrasound, and 11.4% (n = 9) had IVO on CTV. Seven patients (6%) had CTV findings of IVO and edema of either the isolated left (n = 4) or bilateral (n = 3) lower extremities. Cases of IVO on CTV were determined by the multidisciplinary team to be the predominant cause of lower extremity edema for three of these seven cases (43%; or 2.5% of all 121 patients).

Conclusions

Six percent of patients presenting to a lymphedema center with lower extremity edema had left-sided IVO on CTV suggestive of MTS. However, the cases of IVO were determined to be clinically significant < 50% of the time or for 2.5% of all patients. CTV should be reserved for patients with isolated left-sided or bilateral lower extremity edema with a greater left-sided component and a history of findings that raise clinical suspicion for MTS.

### Magnitude of and characteristics associated with the treatment of calcium channel blocker-induced lower-extremity edema with loop diuretics [^1152szBf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the risk of experiencing the prescribing cascade of treating dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker–induced lower-extremity edema with a loop diuretic?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1.2 million patients who initiated a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, excessive use of loop diuretics was found, which cannot be fully explained by secular trends or hypertension progression. This was particularly pronounced among patients who received a high dose of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

Meaning

In this study, many patients received loop diuretics instead of a dose reduction or discontinuation of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, constituting a prescribing cascade. Future studies are needed to test strategies to mitigate or prevent prescribing cascades.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### Computed tomography scanning in the diagnosis of lower extremity phlebolymphedema [^115yBfPj]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective analysis
- **Key Findings**: Diagnosis of lower extremity phlebolymphedema on computed tomography (CT) scan depends on the reference standard used, the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) stage vs lymphoscintigraphy. With the ISL stage as reference, skin thickness offers the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. With LSG, the use of subcutaneous interstitial edema (honeycombing) or muscle compartment edema, offers high sensitivity and accuracy, but low specificity. Factoring in inter-rater agreement as well, honeycombing was found to be the best CT scan variable to diagnose phlebolymphedema.
- **Take Home Message**: A CT scan can be used as a screening tool for phlebolymphedema in the lower extremity through the use of tissue characteristics, including skin thickening, subcutaneous interstitial edema, and/or muscle compartment edema. The diagnostic capacity of each variable either alone or in combination is a function of the reference standard, ISL stage vs lymphoscintigram, and inter-rater agreement.

Chronic venous insufficiency has been noted to be the most common cause of lymphedema in the lower extremity in Western societies, accounting for 41.8% of limbs with lymphedema. Phlebolymphedema, the term applied to such lymphedema has been noted to be present in about 20–30% of patients with chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction (CIVO). The diagnosis of lymphedema has been a challenging issue. Clinical diagnosis is fraught with problems with Stemmer's sign being the only reliable criteria. Lymphoscintigram (LSG), although being quite sensitive and specific, is not easily obtainable regularly and comes with additional radiation and radioisotope exposure. Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography faces similar problems relating to use of dye and technical expertise to perform the study. Although bioimpedance spectroscopy is useful for assessing early stages of lymphedema, it is expensive and labor intensive. Limb volumetry enables the assessment of limb edema and changes with therapy, but does not help determine the cause of the edema. Cross-sectional imaging, either computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging is easy to perform and readily available. This study evaluates the role of the CT scan in the diagnosis of phlebolymphedema.

### Penoscrotal edema: a case report and literature review [^114VVFvT]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Penoscrotal edema is typically caused by lymphatic obstruction, which can have both primary and secondary causes. Studies describing congenital penoscrotal edema are rare. Surgery can be divided into two types: The first approach involves extensive removal of diseased tissue and tissue reconstruction. The second approach is removal of the lesions and creating additional lymphatic vascular anastomoses.

Case presentation

We present a case report of a 15-year-old patient with recurrent penoscrotal edema and swelling of both lower extremities. The literature were also reviewed to provide additional information. Physical examination revealed slow lymphatic reflux of the lower extremities and no obvious abnormalities in testicular morphology, bilaterally, or blood supply. Surgery was performed by excising the affected skin and subcutaneous tissue and the flaps was cut in the middle in Y shape to cover the penis and scrotum. Postoperative follow-up revealed wound integrity and patient satisfaction with the outcome.

Conclusion

Excision and reconstructive surgery are the primary treatments for penoscrotal edema. The majority of reported patients undergoing excision and reconstruction achieved satisfactory reshaping and improved their life quality.

### Triamterene [^11195Zv3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Triamterene Capsules are indicated in the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and the nephrotic syndrome; steroid-induced edema, idiopathic edema and edema due to secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Triamterene Capsules may be used alone or with other diuretics, either for its added diuretic effect or its potassium-sparing potential. It also promotes increased diuresis when patients prove resistant or only partially responsive to thiazides or other diuretics because of secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Usage in Pregnancy. The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed toxemia.

Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Diuretics are indicated in pregnancy (however, see PRECAUTIONS below) when edema is due to pathologic causes, just as they are in the absence of pregnancy. Dependent edema in pregnancy, resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded uterus, is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and use of support hose; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is illogical and unnecessary. There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy which is harmful to neither the fetus nor the mother (in the absence of cardiovascular disease), but which is associated with edema, including generalized edema, in the majority of pregnant women. If this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide relief. In rare instances, this edema may cause extreme discomfort which is not relieved by rest. In these cases, a short course of diuretics may provide relief and may be appropriate.

### The effect of muscles in the treatment of lower limb lymphedema: respiratory muscles or leg muscles? [^113oNtLe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introductıon

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive condition caused by abnormal development or damage to the lymphatic system, leading to the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial tissue spaces. Patients with lower extremity lymphedema (LLL) commonly experience swelling, reduced joint range of motion, fatigue, infections, ulceration, sensory impairment, deformity, body asymmetry, and muscle weakness. The increased volume in the affected limb due to edema, along with a sensation of heaviness, can make walking and daily activities challenging, ultimately reducing functional capacity and performance. The primary goals of treatment for lower limb lymphedema (LLL) are to minimize swelling, prevent complications, and restore limb functionality. Managing LLL typically requires lifelong care and may involve conservative, medical, and sometimes surgical interventions. The gold standard treatment is complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP), which includes manual lymphatic drainage and bandaging (MLDB), skin care, and exercise, all provided by trained physiotherapists. CDP has been shown to effectively reduce limb volume and edema while improving function and quality of life (QoL) in patients with lymphedema.

Exercise activates the musculoskeletal system, increasing lymph flow and accelerating protein reabsorption. Additionally, deep inspiration during respiration increases tidal volume, triggering diaphragmatic movement and causing more pronounced pressure changes in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Since these cavities house major veins and lymphatic collecting channels, deep and effective inspiration is expected to enhance lymphatic return, given the slow, rhythmic movement of larger lymphatic collectors and their anatomical positioning within intrathoracic and intra-abdominal cavities.

The pump function of skeletal muscles, particularly the calf muscles in LLL and the respiratory muscles, supports venous return, indirectly stimulating lymph circulation and reducing edema. Studies have shown that improved respiratory and calf muscle pump function positively affects venous refilling time in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Since venous and lymphatic return work in parallel, an increase in venous return can positively impact lymphatic flow. However, most studies have focused on breast cancer-related upper limb lymphedema, reporting that different exercise training programs influence function and QoL in varying ways. In contrast, lower-limb exercises, including hip, knee, and ankle mobility exercises, as well as active range of motion exercises that do not specifically target the calf muscles, have been reported to be effective in reducing lower-limb edema secondary to cancer.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^116TJ2WF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, most commonly in the extremities, leading to swelling, limb heaviness, and susceptibility to infections, among other uncomfortable pathologies. This condition can develop in two main forms: primary lymphedema, which is typically caused by genetic factors, and secondary lymphedema, which often results from trauma, surgical procedures, or radiation therapy, especially related to cancer treatment.

The treatment of lymphedema can be separated into medical and surgical arms, which in the ideal setting, work synergistically to improve quality of life of patients with this debilitating condition. Medical therapies consist of a combination of weight management, physical therapy, compression garments, and avoidance of infection, while surgical options can include physiological and debulking procedures. With advancements in our understanding of lymphedema, we have enhanced our ability to provide a wider range of treatments and improve patient outcomes. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for lymphedema, highlighting recent therapeutic advances and clinical practices.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^115RyK6S]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) differential diagnosis — Table I lists conditions with distinguishing location, pain characteristics, and responses to exercise, rest, and position. Calf IC involves calf muscles with a prevalence of 3% of adult population, presenting with cramping, aching discomfort of reproducible onset on exercise, quickly relieved at rest, with no positional effect and possible atypical limb symptoms on exercise. Nerve root compression radiates down the leg, causes sharp lancinating pain induced by sitting, standing, or walking, is often present at rest, and is improved by change in position. Venous claudication affects the entire leg (worse in calf), produces tight, bursting pain after walking that subsides slowly, with relief speeded by elevation and a history of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis or venous congestion/edema. Foot/ankle arthritis causes aching pain after a variable degree of exercise, is not quickly relieved, and may be relieved by not bearing weight, with symptoms that may relate to activity level and be present at rest.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). High credibility.

Appropriate use criteria for chronic lower extremity venous disease — using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, the appropriate use criteria (AUC) were developed and scored via a modified Delphi incorporating best available evidence and expert opinion. There were 119 scenarios rated on a scale of 1 to 9 by an expert panel, with 1 being never appropriate and 9 being appropriate. The majority of symptomatic indications were deemed appropriate for venous intervention, whereas scenarios with anatomically short segments of reflux and/or no symptoms were rated less appropriate. For edema, ratings showed wide dispersion, especially for short segments of saphenous reflux or stenting for iliac/inferior vena cava disease, noting multifactorial causes of edema that could coexist with venous disease and possibly impact effectiveness of treatment. Several scenarios were considered never appropriate, including treatment of saphenous veins with no reflux, iliac vein or inferior vena cava stenting for iliac vein compression as an incidental finding by imaging with minimal or no symptoms or signs, and incentivizing sonographers to find reflux. The AUC statements are intended to serve as a guide to patient care, particularly where high-quality evidence is lacking, and may also prove useful when applied on a population level.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema of the lower leg: an international cross-sectional study [^114L1eia]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and chronic oedema are common conditions with considerable morbidity. The number of studies designed to assess the epidemiology of cellulitis in chronic oedema is scarce.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of cellulitis in chronic leg oedema, including lymphoedema.

Methods

A cross-sectional study included 40 sites in nine countries during 2014–17. Adults with clinically proven unilateral or bilateral chronic oedema (oedema > 3 months) of the lower leg were included. The main outcome measures were frequency and risk factors for cellulitis within the last 12 months.

Results

Out of 7477 patients, 15·78% had cellulitis within the last 12 months, with a lifetime prevalence of 37·47%. The following risk factors for cellulitis were identified by multivariable analysis: wounds [odds ratio (OR) 2·37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·03–2·78], morbid obesity (OR 1·51, 95% CI 1·27–1·80), obesity (OR 1·21, 95% CI 1·03–1·41), midline swelling (OR 1·32, 95% CI 1·04–1·66), male sex (OR 1·32, 95% CI 1·15–1·52) and diabetes (OR 1·27, 95% CI 1·08–1·49). Controlled swelling was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0·59, 95% CI 0·51–0·67). In a subgroup analysis, the risk increased with the stage of oedema [International Society of Lymphology, stage II OR 2·04 (95% CI 1·23–3·38) and stage III OR 4·88 (95% CI 2·77–8·56)].

Conclusions

Cellulitis in chronic leg oedema is a global problem. Several risk factors for cellulitis were identified, of which some are potentially preventable. Our findings suggest that oedema control is one of these. We also identified that advanced stages of oedema, with hard/fibrotic tissue, might be an important clinical indicator to identify patients at particular risk.

5.5 Edema

In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.

Pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.6 Fractures

In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N = 2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N = 2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.

5.7 Macular Edema

Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.

Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione.

Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see].

### Edematous lower extremities with overlying verrucous plaques [^115qYa7T]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa – Incorrect. While this patient's clinical presentation closely resembles elephantiasis nostras verrucosa with enlarged, disfigured extremities with a fibrotic, cobblestone-like appearance, the presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos hints toward a different diagnosis.
B. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema – Correct. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema presents with verrucous papules and plaques, most commonly on the anterior aspects of the lower legs, on a background of non-pitting edema. The presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos further supports a diagnosis of underlying GD. Histological examination demonstrates abundant mucin accumulation in the dermis, collagen attenuation, and stellate fibroblasts.
C. Lymphatic filariasis – Incorrect. Filariasis is a parasitic infection, common in tropical countries, and caused by the filarial parasites Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi/timori, presenting as elephantiasis. While clinically, the condition may be similar to the one presented here, the patient's history does not support a diagnosis of filariasis.
D. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides – Incorrect. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides describes a form of verrucous carcinoma, secondary to the human papilloma virus, which presents as verrucous papules and plaques involving the lower extremities. While the clinical appearance may be similar to the condition presented here, the disease is often unilateral and asymmetric, and the histologic findings in this case do not support the diagnosis of papillomatosis cutis carcinoides.
E. Lymphedema not otherwise specified – Incorrect. Lymphedema not otherwise specified can present with unilateral and bilateral lower extremity swelling. Without proper treatment, it may take on a similar presentation. However, the histopathologic findings do not support this diagnosis.

### Interventions for lower-extremity lymphedema… [^112Vx45d]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Which interventions for lower-extremity lymphedema are effective. Evidence-Based Answer Complete decongestive physiotherapy effectively improves edema, rates of infection, and quality of life in patients with lower-extremity lymphedema. Microsurgery may be effective for patients in whom complete decongestive physiotherapy is ineffective. There is insufficient evidence about the safety and effectiveness of oral benzopyrones to determine whether they are useful for the treatment of lymphedema.

Evidence Summary COMPLETE DECONGESTIVE PHYSIOTHERAPY A prospective cohort study evaluated 150 patients with primary or secondary unilateral lower-extremity lymphedema who underwent complete decongestive physiotherapy. 2 Treatment consisted of daily structured decongestive physiotherapy for two to four weeks, followed by a maintenance phase consisting of self-care. The volume differences between the abnormal and normal leg decreased from 56% at baseline to 32% at one month. Responses from the SF-36 Health Survey, a validated quality-of-life assessment tool, demonstrated a 4% to 6% absolute improvement in physical function, social function, and mental health at one month. MICROSURGERY A systematic review of surgical options for lymphedema found one prospective study and four retrospective case series evaluating lymphatic reconstructive procedures for lower-extremity edema.

5 Meticulous skin care, range-of-motion exercises, and limb elevation are recommended for patients with no contraindications. Limb elevation and use of compressive garments may be helpful in some patients. Isolated massage and "wringing out" are potentially harmful and are not recommended. Diuretics should be used only in patients with specific comorbid conditions or complications. Long-term diuretic use is discouraged because of the potential for electrolyte imbalance. Treatment with benzopyrones or thermal therapy is not recommended because of unproven effectiveness and potential harms.

### Lower extremity lymphedema update: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines [^1166sYLs]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Lower extremity lymphedema is an important medical issue which causes morbidity and is frequently seen by dermatologists. The subject has not been adequately addressed in dermatologic literature for many years. Primary lymphedema is caused by an inherent malfunction of the lymph-carrying channel, in which no direct outside cause can be found. Secondary lymphedema is caused by an outside force, such as tumors, scar tissue after radiation, or removal of lymph nodes, which results in dysfunction of the lymph-carrying channels. Treatment is based on rerouting the lymph fluid through remaining functional lymph vessels. This is accomplished through elevation, exercises, compression garments/devices, manual lymph drainage, and treatment is combined with good skin care practices.

### Pilot study to evaluate a water displacement technique to compare effects of diuretics and ACE inhibitors to alleviate lower extremity edema due to dihydropyridine calcium antagonists [^115m84pv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is required in many patients to achieve goal blood pressure (BP). Calcium antagonists are highly effective antihypertensive drugs in a broad range of demographic groups. Yet, higher doses are associated with an increased frequency of lower extremity edema. The purpose of our open label, single-center clinical trial was to evaluate the use of concomitant pharmacologic therapies to attenuate the lower extremity edema associated with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists therapy using a water displacement technique. Forty-seven patients received 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine for a period of 6 weeks after a 4-week wash-out off of all antihypertensive medications to establish baseline BP. They were then randomized to receive either an additional 5 mg of amlodipine, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), or 20 mg of benazepril for an additional 6 weeks. Blood pressure determinations and water displacement measurements were obtained at the end of the 4-week placebo wash-out period, after 6 weeks of 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine therapy, and after an additional 6 weeks of 5 mg of amlodipine and randomized drug therapy. Adjusted BP reductions (based on pretreatment BP) were -6.8/-3.8 mm Hg for the 10-mg amlodipine group, -9.9/-8.2 mm Hg for the amlodipine (5 mg)/HCTZ (25 mg) group, and -26.2/-16.4 mm Hg for the amlodipine (5 mg)/benazepril (20 mg) group (P < .0167, group 3 v group 1 diastolic BP, which was statistically significant by the improved Bonferroni method). Seventeen of the 47 patients developed at least a 10% increase in lower extremity edema water displacement in response to 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine therapy (36.2%). Adding 5 mg of amlodipine to a baseline of 5 mg of amlodipine resulted in no net change in lower extremity edema (+58.0 mL,+ 0.6% change, n = 5). Adding 25 mg of HCTZ reduced lower extremity edema by a mean of 136.3 mL (-11.1% change, n = 4). Benazepril reduced water displacement by 204.4 mL (-14.3% change, n = 8). Our pilot study indicates that adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is the most effective way to not only reduce systolic and diastolic BP but also attenuate lower extremity edema. Due to the inherent daily variability of lower extremity edema, power calculations indicate many patients (n = 702, 356 in each group) would be needed to compare the antiedema efficacy of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and the thiazide diuretic.

### Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis diagnosis and treatment algorithm 2018 [^113GRdL8]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) should be considered in any patient that presents to a cancer care provider with nephrotic range proteinuria, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy, unexplained hepatomegaly or diarrhea. More importantly, patients being monitored for smoldering multiple myeloma and a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are at risk for developing AL amyloidosis. MGUS and myeloma patients that have atypical features, including unexplained weight loss; lower extremity edema, early satiety, and dyspnea on exertion should be considered at risk for light chain amyloidosis. Overlooking the diagnosis of light chain amyloidosis leading to therapy delay is common, and it represents an error of diagnostic consideration. Algorithms will be provided on how to evaluate patients with suspected AL amyloid as well as how to manage patients referred from other medical specialties with biopsy-proven amyloid. An organized stepwise approach to the treatment of patients with light chain amyloidosis, including established and investigational therapies, will be reviewed.

### Congestive lower extremity failure: an educational model for improved understanding of phlebolymphedema [^113tWtmf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig
Comparison of congestive heart failure (CHF) and congestive leg failure cascades. CLEF, Congestive lower extremity failure.

Similarly, in the novel CLEF model, inflammation leads to chronic venous insufficiency and resultant lower extremity venous hypertension. This process, in turn, causes lymphatic system overload, culminating in dual system dysfunction and progressive soft tissue edema. Phlebolymphedema develops with secondary dysfunction of the lymphatic pump and dermal lymphatic backflow. This pathological phenomenon then engorges the interstitium and causes increased subcutaneous edema that retards microvascular arterial perfusion. These complications result in venous and lymphatic stasis in CLEF and manifest as leg fatigue, heaviness, leg pain, leg cramps, and progressive swelling. Venous edema and inflammatory processes lead to hemosiderin deposition, lipodermatosclerosis, cellular apoptosis, tissue fibrosis, and ultimately soft tissue ulceration in the final stage. Hence, the CLEF model emphasizes the need to treat both venous and lymphatic pathophysiology to restore tissue homeostasis (Fig). This philosophy mirrors the clinical management of CHF, which addresses both volume overload of the lung (ie, diuretics) as well as dysfunction of the left ventricle (ie, inotropic agents). The pertinent Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic and Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification of CLEF would include stages C2 to C6. Similarly, CHF is described in four progressive stages from A to D. The concept of CLEF, a new teaching model for venous pathophysiology, if incorporated into educational curricula, may improve students' understanding, recognition, and treatment of phlebolymphedema.

Lymphedema pathophysiology and the role of venous disease — Contemporary physiology indicates that "there was no steady state venous reabsorption of microvascular fluid but rather steady, dwindling filtration", and "the lymphatics, not the venules, are predominantly responsible for maintaining tissue fluid balance by absorbing interstitial fluid and ultimately returning it into the circulation". Expert statements note that "lymphatic failure is responsible for all forms of peripheral edema" and that "all chronic edema indicates an inadequacy or failure of lymph drainage", and the panel acknowledges "the significant contribution from CVI". Accordingly, "The edema associated with CVI (C3–C6) represents lymphatic failure or phlebolymphedema".

### Prevalence and risk factors of pedal edema in chronic leg edema [^112vt5WF]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and underlying causes of pedal edema (PE) in legs affected by chronic edema.

Methods

A total of 705 legs with chronic edema, defined as persistent leg edema lasting for > 3 months, were examined in 411 patients who visited our clinic between April 2009 and March 2024. Patients with known systemic edematous conditions or those with serum albumin levels < 3.5 g/dL and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, as confirmed during screening blood tests at their initial visits, were excluded from the study. The presence of edema in the leg, including the pedal region, was confirmed using ultrasonography to detect subcutaneous echo-free spaces (SEFS). Routine assessments included blood screening, duplex venous scans, and skin ultrasonography. Air plethysmography, lymphangioscintigraphy, and bioelectrical impedance analysis were performed whenever feasible.

Results

The prevalence of PE in legs with chronic edema was 64%. Multivariate analyses identified the severity of SEFS in the lateral lower calf, which correlated with the overall severity of leg edema (odds ratio [OR]: 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.46–14.62; P < 0.001), and serum albumin level (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.31–5.05; P < 0.01) as significant risk factors for PE.

Conclusion

PE was present in 64% of legs with chronic edema. The primary contributors to PE were the overall severity of leg edema and lower serum albumin levels, even within the normal range.

### Congestive lower extremity failure: an educational model for improved understanding of phlebolymphedema [^111ckirT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of venous and lymphatic diseases and phlebolymphedema is, therefore, becoming increasingly complex and difficult to teach with existing educational models. Hence, medical students, young doctors, and even clinically advanced physicians and practitioners struggle to stay abreast of these dogma-altering concepts, as we attempt to integrate a renewed understanding of this "conundrum of the microcirculation". Successfully bridging and overcoming this significant educational challenge has the potential reward of improving clinical assessment, diagnosis, and therapeutic management, and to decrease the recidivism rate of patients with phlebolymphedema and its associated complications and morbidities.

In the effort to improve the educational model, we look to congestive heart failure (CHF) as an analogy. CHF is a well-known and well-understood pathophysiologic process that medical students, residents, and fellows can understand, describe in detail, and treat with a high and reproducible level of competency. We believe that CHF can serve as a descriptive analogy for phlebolymphedema, and it can be used as a model for what we introduce here as a novel concept: congestive lower extremity failure (CLEF). The comparison seems obvious; endothelial inflammation and valvular destruction are at the root of both pathologies. In CHF, inflammation is often the primary culprit, which instigates mitral valve destruction, mitral insufficiency, and regurgitation. This pathological reversal of flow causes overload of the left atrium and pulmonary hypertension eventually ensues. Chronic pulmonary hypertension favors further inflammatory processes, resulting in pulmonary edema. Parenchymal lung edema results in respiratory complications owing to volume overload, the compromise of microarterial perfusion, and the concomitant negative impact on gas exchange. Patients typically present with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, and fatigue as cardiac pump failure also develops. The ultimate end-stage effects are characterized by pulmonary microinfarctions, tissue fibrosis, and respiratory failure (Fig).

### The influence of preexisting lower extremity edema and venous stasis disease on body contouring outcomes [^111WNMrE]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

While a cause and effect relationship is traditionally thought to exist between thigh surgery and postoperative lymphedema, the link between obesity-related lymphatic and/or venous disease and post-body contouring lower extremity edema has not been investigated. We hypothesize that patients who experience prolonged lower extremity edema following thigh surgery are predisposed to developing this complication due to unrecognized preoperative lymphovascular disease.

Methods

Fifty-five patients who had undergone body contouring surgery were identified from our prospective registry. Twenty-eight patients completed the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), a validated outcome measure of venous disease. Three time points were assessed: pre-weight loss (T1), post-weight loss but pre-body contouring (T2), and post-body contouring (T3). Based on T3 VCSS, patients were divided into 2 groups-a T3 VCSS ≤ 3 (group 1; N = 13) and a T3 VCSS ≥ 4 (group 2; N = 15).

Results

VCSS for group 1 at T1, T2, and T3 were 3.31 ± 0.55, 1.85 ± 0.27, and 1.54 ± 0.35 (mean ± SEM), respectively, versus 6.3 ± 1.10, 4.33 ± 0.8, and 6.8 ± 0.63 for group 2 (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, and P < 0.0001). Pain scores at T1 was 0.46 ± 0.21 for group 1 versus 1.1 ± 0.24 for group 2 (P < 0.05). Edema scores for group 1 at T1, T2, and T3 were 0.69 ± 0.29, 0.08 ± 0.08, and 0.15 ± 0.10 versus 1.87 ± 0.35, 1.13 ± 0.31, and 2.13 ± 0.24 for group 2 (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, and P < 0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions

Using VCSS, post-bariatric patients with prolonged lower extremity edema experienced clinically identifiable signs of disease prior to weight loss and body contouring surgery. Thus, careful preoperative evaluation may help identify at-risk patients and aid in managing postoperative expectations.

### Amlodipine-induced bilateral upper extremity edema [^115n4cLk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of bilateral upper extremity edema associated with amlodipine use in a child.

Case Summary

A previously well and normotensive 6-year-old girl presented with a generalized vasculitis of unknown origin and severe hypertension. Large vessels predominantly affecting the neck, chest, and abdomen were found to be involved, resulting in abnormal arterial circulation and significant blood pressure differences between the upper and lower extremities. Multiple antihypertensive agents were initially required to control blood pressure. She was stabilized and discharged on amlodipine 10 mg each evening, atenolol 50 mg/day, and warfarin. Three days later she was noted to have facial and bilateral upper extremity pitting edema. Laboratory and radiologic assessments for possible etiologies were negative. Discontinuation of amlodipine resulted in resolution of edema.

Discussion

As of June 2007, there had been no cases of bilateral upper extremity edema associated with amlodipine use reported in the English literature. Adverse effects of amlodipine, a widely used antihypertensive, have been well reported. These include flushing, headache, and peripheral edema. Lower limb edema is the most common, while periocular and perioral edema have occurred less frequently. Anasarca edema has been described only once in the English literature. According to the Naranjo probability scale, amlodipine was a probable cause of bilateral upper extremity edema in this child.

Conclusions

Bilateral upper extremity edema has been associated with amlodipine use in a child with an abnormal arterial circulation. The edema resolved upon discontinuation of the drug.

### Edema: diagnosis and management [^113EweB2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.

### Lymphedema: diagnostic workup and management [^115XEHwz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. It is caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is a chronic progressive disease with serious physical and psychosocial implications. It can be challenging to diagnose, especially in obese patients and in those with coexisting venous disease. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, lymphedema management, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. There are currently no standard guidelines for the diagnosis of lymphedema. There is no cure yet for lymphedema, and the objective for management is to limit disease progression and prevent complications.

The current review highlights the significant advances that have occurred in the investigative and clinical approaches to lymphedema, particularly over the last decade. This review summarizes the progress that has been attained in the realms of genetics, lymphatic imaging, and lymphatic surgery. Newer molecular insights are explored, along with their relationship to future molecular therapeutics. Growing insights into the relationships among lymphedema, obesity, and other comorbidities are important to consider in current and future responses to patients with lymphedema.

### Efficacy study of lymphaticovenular anastomosis via the lymphosome-based four-incision approach for lower limb lymphedema [^116WD6YZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The lymphatic system has a primary function, which is to return protein deposits and the excess interstitial fluid that is discharged from capillaries back to the bloodstream and then into the circulatory system. In this way, it maintains fluid homeostasis in the body. LLL is a chronic condition. It is characterized by swelling in the lower extremities due to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in tissues, resulting from the lymph's inability to flow back into the bloodstream. Lymphedema can be classified into two types based on its etiology: primary lymphedema and secondary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema is caused by congenital or hereditary factors, leading to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in local tissues and resulting in dysplasia or dysfunction of the lymphatic system. The incidence of primary lymphedema in the lower limbs is higher than that in the upper limbs and the genital area. On the other hand, secondary lymphedema is caused by external factors that damage or impair the lymphatic system, causing the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in local tissues. In contrast to primary lymphedema, secondary LLL is commonly caused by postoperative complications following gynecologic malignancies. Sandra et al found that the incidence of secondary LLL after gynecologic malignancy surgery can be as high as 45%.

The clinical manifestations of LLL are as follows: progressively worsening non-pitting edema, sclerosis and thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and skin discoloration, accompanied by pain and a feeling of heaviness. These symptoms usually lead to restricted mobility and an increased risk of infection, and may finally result in irreversible tissue fibrosis. Because these manifestations not only damage physical function but also have a significant impact on psychological well-being and quality of life, early identification and treatment are crucial for effectively controlling the condition and enhancing overall quality of life.

With the application of supermicrosurgical techniques, LVA has been increasingly demonstrated to achieve good therapeutic outcomes across different stages of lymphedema and in various body regions. LVA has been shown to reduce limb swelling, slow disease progression, and decrease the recurrence of cellulitis. The core principle of LVA lies in surgically connecting small lymphatic vessels directly to veins, thereby creating a bypass that allows lymphatic fluid to flow into the venous system, bypassing the obstruction in the lymphatic pathways. This alleviates the retention of lymphatic fluid in the tissues. Although LVA has already become a first-line treatment option in many centers, there is currently no established standard regarding the selection of incision sites or the number of lymphatic-to-venous anastomoses performed.

### Approach to leg edema of unclear etiology [^113fbkTh]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A common challenge for primary care physicians is to determine the cause and find an effective treatment for leg edema of unclear etiology. We were unable to find existing practice guidelines that address this problem in a comprehensive manner. This article provides clinically oriented recommendations for the management of leg edema in adults. We searched on-line resources, textbooks, and MEDLINE (using the MeSH term, "edema") to find clinically relevant articles on leg edema. We then expanded the search by reviewing articles cited in the initial sources. Our goal was to write a brief, focused review that would answer questions about the management of leg edema. We organized the information to make it rapidly accessible to busy clinicians. The most common cause of leg edema in older adults is venous insufficiency. The most common cause in women between menarche and menopause is idiopathic edema, formerly known as "cyclic" edema. A common but under-recognized cause of edema is pulmonary hypertension, which is often associated with sleep apnea. Venous insufficiency is treated with leg elevation, compressive stockings, and sometimes diuretics. The initial treatment of idiopathic edema is spironolactone. Patients who have findings consistent with sleep apnea, such as daytime somnolence, loud snoring, or neck circumference > 17 inches, should be evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with an echocardiogram. If time is limited, the physician must decide whether the evaluation can be delayed until a later appointment (eg, an asymptomatic patient with chronic bilateral edema) or must be completed at the current visit (eg, a patient with dyspnea or a patient with acute edema [< 72 hours]). If the evaluation should be conducted at the current visit, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 could be used as a guide. If the full evaluation could wait for a subsequent visit, the patient should be examined briefly to rule out an obvious systemic cause and basic laboratory tests should be ordered for later review (complete blood count, urinalysis, electrolytes, creatinine, blood sugar, thyroid stimulating hormone, and albumin).

### The role of iliac vein stent placement in pelvic venous disorder management [^116t161D]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis: clinical evaluation

What follows is an approach to the clinical evaluation of the patient with suspected pelvic venous disease, beginning with a complete history and physical exam (Fig 1). A common descriptor of venous etiology pelvic pain is a dull ache that worsens with standing. The combination of postcoital ache and ovarian point tenderness (one-third of the way between the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine) on physical exam is reportedly 94% sensitive and 77% specific for venous origin pelvic pain. Of note, these symptoms are classically associated with reflux-related PeVD, and obstructive etiology PeVD may present differently. For example, patients with iliac vein obstruction may describe lower extremity dominant symptoms. The patient may report lower extremity edema, pruritus, or skin changes such as wounds. Perineal, posterior labial, and vulvar varices (V 3a) may be observed after having the patient stand for approximately 10 minutes prior to examination. Atypical extremity varicosity patterns such as sciatic and/or superficial medial/posterior thigh varices (V 3b) should raise suspicion for venous reflux transmitting through pelvic escape points.

Fig 1
Systematic clinical evaluation of pelvic venous disorder (PeVD). This algorithm is a simplified general approach for evaluating patients with potential PeVD. BNP, Brain natriuretic peptide; CBC, complete blood count; CHF, congestive heart failure; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome.

Due to the nonspecific nature of chronic pelvic pain, it is important to evaluate for non-venous etiologies of the patient's symptoms. The primary gynecologic differential consideration is pelvic floor myalgia. Other common gynecologic causes of pelvic pain include fibroids and adenomyosis. If a patient describes pain during intercourse, endometriosis should be considered. Unlike PeVD, endometriosis pain is cyclic and generally has a pain-free interval each month. Consider gastrointestinal etiologies if the symptoms relate to food intake, are sensitive to dietary changes, or are associated with bowel movements. Lower extremity swelling from underlying venous disease must be distinguished from lymphedema, lipedema, and medical comorbidities that can result in volume overload such as congestive heart failure. Some degree of asymmetry in lower extremity edema is highly likely to relate to venous/lymphatic disease rather than systemic disorders. A thorough medication reconciliation will also help identify common pharmacologic sources of swelling, such as calcium channel blockers.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### A case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type presenting as lower extremity edema and ulcers [^117Di6Rm]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is a rare malignancy, originally described as a separate entity in a 2005 classification of cutaneous lymphomas. It most commonly occurs on the lower extremities in elderly women, accounts for 20% of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and is the most aggressive subtype. Survival rates are 70% with optimal therapy, although > 50% of patients experience disease relapse. Clinically, it typically presents with infiltrative papules, plaques, or nodules on the legs; ulceration, is less common, and can clinically mimic common vascular ulcers. Diagnosis relies on skin biopsy with histologic findings of reticular dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and confluent sheets of atypical lymphocytes (centroblasts and immunoblasts positive for CD20, CD79a, BCL-2, and MUM-1).

### Selumetinib side effects in children treated for plexiform neurofibromas: first case reports of peripheral edema and hair color change [^113JKRaY]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

This is the first case report of pediatric subjects developing peripheral edema and hair color change while treated with selumetinib.

Selumetinib, like other MEK inhibitors, has already been associated with the onset of peripheral edema in adult patients. A 2017 metanalysis evaluated the incidence of peripheral edema in patients with cancer treated with MEK inhibitors. Among all the studies included in the paper, peripheral edema was reported in 13 RCTs and appeared in a total of 284 patients, with an incidence ranging from 11–47.8% in the various cohorts examined. The degree of swelling was usually mild or moderate, and it didn't interfere with the prosecution of the treatment. High-grade peripheral edema, possibly requiring a dose reduction or even the suspension of the drug, was reported in 8 studies, with an incidence that ranged from 0 to 4.3%. As for the timing of appearance of the symptom in adult patients, no conclusive data are available at the moment. Peripheral edema was more common in patients treated with selumetinib, rather than with trametinib or other MEK inhibitors, and it has not been influenced by the presence of other concurrent medical therapies. Apart from the involvement of lower extremities, facial edema has also been reported. The mechanism through which selumetinib causes this clinical feature is not well understood. Peripheral edema is a complex process that involves numerous variables, including hydrostatic and oncotic forces, and vascular permeability. However, none of these elements, alone or combined, appears sufficient, at the moment, to explain the pathophysiology of this process. For example, none of the patients whose cases were described above presented heart, kidney or liver failure, nor a deep vein thrombosis or an ongoing malignant process. Furthermore, no significant abnormalities were found on laboratory tests.

### Magnitude of and characteristics associated with the treatment of calcium channel blocker-induced lower-extremity edema with loop diuretics [^111XhtF9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, despite edema being a well-known adverse effect of DH CCBs, our findings suggest that an appreciable proportion of patients received loop diuretics instead of DH CCB dose reduction or discontinuation. This occurred more commonly among patients who were initially prescribed high-dose DH CCBs. Individuals initiating DH CCBs were at highest risk for the prescribing cascade in the first 4 months following initiation, suggesting the need to evaluate for edema during early follow-up visits. Given that loop diuretics are among the medications most frequently associated with adverse events, especially in older adults, subsequent research is needed to measure downstream consequences of this prescribing cascade, such as fall-related injuries, increased health care utilization, and increased costs.

### Magnitude of and characteristics associated with the treatment of calcium channel blocker-induced lower-extremity edema with loop diuretics [^113fTvWe]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations to note. Certain loop diuretics may be available at community pharmacies at prices below insurance copayments. This may result in missing claims if loop diuretics were paid for out of pocket. Patients who developed DH CCB–induced edema may have been misdiagnosed as having heart failure within 360 days before or after initiation of DH CCBs and were therefore excluded; on the other hand, patients with heart failure may not have been diagnosed (although the diagnosis of heart failure has been validated with specificity of ≥ 95%), also resulting in the potential for misclassification. The diagnosis of edema has not been validated and is likely underdocumented; therefore, we incorporated negative controls, restricted exposure windows, and stratified on number of antihypertensive medications to evaluate excess loop diuretic use in the context of other valid indications.

### Computed tomography scanning in the diagnosis of lower extremity phlebolymphedema [^114dgzeC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study is a single-center retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 2015 to 2018. Informed consent was obtained from participants for all tests and procedures. Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady University institutional review board approval was obtained for dissemination of deidentified patient information.

Setting

The study center is a tertiary center for the management of venous and lymphatic disorders.

Participants

Patients with chronic venous disease who underwent a CT scan and LSG of the lower extremities as part of diagnostic workup formed the study cohort. Patients with phlebolymphedema from acute deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity and those with primary lymphedema or secondary lymphedema from non-venous causes were excluded. Also excluded were patients with other medical causes of leg edema (congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and hepatic insufficiency, among others).

CT scan

The 128-slice Siemens scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) was used to perform CT scans. Because the CT scans were performed for the diagnosis of suspected femoroiliocaval obstruction, contrast enhancement was typically used to opacify the veins. When contrast was unable to be used owing to patient-related factors, a CT scan was done without contrast using a similar imaging protocol. With regard to the assessment of phlebolymphedema on CT scans, characteristics used included skin thickening, muscle compartment (MC) edema, and subcutaneous interstitial edema (honeycombing). The use of contrast did not make a difference; that is, there was no difference between contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced CT scans.

Infection and global lymphedema etiology — The association of lower extremity infection with lymphedema is universally acknowledged, and globally lymphedema frequently occurs due to non-surgically-related lymphatic filariasis, which affects more than 40 million individuals worldwide; in this context, it would be incorrect to say that CRT is the most common factor for developing lymphedema. Damstra et al. performed lymphoscintigraphy on patients with an initial case of erysipelas and found evidence of significant subclinical lymphedema in the uninfected limb at baseline.

### Computed tomography scanning in the diagnosis of lower extremity phlebolymphedema [^111ZbkUP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

ISL and LSG in the diagnosis of lymphedema

Although the ISL staging of lymphedema is a commonly used tool and LSG is often considered the gold standard for diagnosing lymphedema, the correlation between the two has not been studied thoroughly. In fact, a couple of studies, that evaluated LSG against ICG lymphography used the ISL stage as the reference. Using this factor, they noted that ICG is perhaps a better test; however, this result ignores the basic concept that characteristics of ISL staging stage I and II include pitting edema and amelioration of edema with leg elevation can be noted in other forms of edema as well. So, the use of ISL stage to help validate a confirmatory diagnostic test is problematic. Patients in our study had other causes of edema, including primary and secondary lymphedema (besides venous lymphedema) ruled out. When focused on lymphedema owing to venous etiology (phlebolymphedema) alone, the correlation between ISL stage and LSG was poor (r = −0.16; p = 0.26), even though 72% of limbs had a diagnosis of phlebolymphedema on both ISL and LSG. This finding underscores the need for a better clinical staging system for lymphedema.

### Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome of the lower extremity [^1147Rwse]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome, formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or causalgia, is a difficult therapeutic problem for the orthopaedic surgeon treating an affected lower extremity. Despite many divergent and often conflicting theories, the cause of the severe pain, alterations in regional blood flow, and edema is unknown. Interventions that have proved successful for treating similar conditions in the arm and hand frequently do not relieve pain similarly in the lower extremity. Common treatment regimens target individual components of this symptom complex, namely, sympathetic or afferent nerve hyperactivity, vasomotor instability, or regional osteoporosis. Despite widespread use of some of these treatments, few controlled clinical trials quantify their effectiveness. This challenging syndrome is best managed by a multidisciplinary team, including chronic pain management specialists, physical therapists, and orthopaedic surgeons.

### A case series of dose-limiting peripheral edema observed in patients treated with pemetrexed [^1161yC6e]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the phase I and II trials, the dose-limiting toxicities of pemetrexed included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. Grade 3 bilateral peripheral edema that resembled cellulitis was not commonly described.

Methods

Since 2009, the Thoracic Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has identified 14 patients who developed bilateral peripheral edema and erythema of the lower extremities while receiving pemetrexed chemotherapy. During this time, 489 patients with thoracic malignancy have been treated with pemetrexed.

Results

There were seven men and seven women. Average age was 72 years. All patients had stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. The edema presented at a median of eight doses (range, 3–23 doses.) Other causative factors such as deep vein thrombosis, renal insufficiency, and congestive heart failure were excluded. Thirteen of the 14 patients required the drug to be stopped or dose lowered.

Conclusion

We have collected 14 cases with lung adenocarcinoma treated with pemetrexed who developed bilateral lower extremity edema and erythema, a condition rarely described. In all cases, symptoms resolved with discontinuation or dose reduction of the drug. Patients who received corticosteroids showed improvement in their symptoms.

### Is iPad-based three-dimensional scanning the future for evaluating lower extremity volume or edema in clinic? [^113QxKVC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In this article, the authors discuss a technique of limb volumetry using an iPad-based three-dimensional scanner. The objective of the article was to determine whether this technique was reproducible. A standardized protocol was implemented and demonstrated a decrease in measurement variability when using the proposed protocol. Shortcomings of the article include that the study only included 20 limbs from healthy individuals. It will be interesting to see if this protocol will be reproducible in patients with lower extremity pathologies like lymphedema or venous disease. A larger cohort should also be used to test the protocol to ensure its validity.

Although having a simple and objective way to measure limb volume is currently lacking in clinical practice, it remains to be seen if implementing such routine measurements would actually have any impact in treating patients. The iPad-based three-dimensional scanning technology, despite how it can present objectively data and possibly improve overtime, should not replace the physician's role in examining the patient and obtaining a good history of the patient's symptoms. A detailed clinical examination and interview with the patient could still be the easiest, most cost-effective, and patient-oriented approach to the assessment of edema. Treatment of venous disease or lymphedema that cause lower extremity edema should still focus on symptom alleviation. As many clinicians can attest, many patients may have lower extremity edema that is not bothersome enough to warrant treatment. Routinely scanning these patients can be time consuming and not offer much benefit. I congratulate the authors for attempting to objectivize such a cumbersome symptom and recommend future studies with a larger sample size to fully evaulate the benefit of iPad-based three-dimensional scanning in patients with edema.

### The diagnostic unreliability of classic physical signs of lymphedema [^113y3LBe]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

In most communities, the diagnosis of lymphedema in the lower extremity currently rests on clinical signs. Lymphoscintigraphy, which is objective, is performed infrequently to confirm the clinical suspicion. Given absence of a curative option for lymphedema, it is essential to obtain an accurate diagnosis before committing the patient to lifelong conservative therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs in comparison to lymphoscintigraphy, the current objective standard.

Methods

Retrospective review of contemporaneously collected data of 636 consecutive limbs with swelling (318 left, 318 right) that underwent initial evaluation during a 12-month period between 2016 and 2017 was performed. All limbs were assessed for classic clinical signs of lymphedema including dorsal hump of the foot, square toes, Kaposi-Stemmer sign, and nonpitting edema. Lymphoscintigraphy was routinely performed for objective evaluation. The 436 patients who underwent the study were scored positive for lymphedema on the basis of transit time delay for the radioisotope in minutes, presence of dermal backflow, presence of collateral channels, intensity of uptake in the main channel and lymph nodes, number of nodes in the groin, and presence of popliteal nodes. Analysis was carried out to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the clinical signs in determining whether a patient had lymphedema. In addition, regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the predictive value of different clinical signs in determining lymphedema. Patients with positive clinical signs but with normal findings on lymphoscintigraphy who did not have a medical cause for swelling underwent workup to determine a possible venous cause.

Results

Of 636 limbs with swelling, 436 (69%) underwent lymphoscintigraphy, the findings of which were normal in 178 (41%) and abnormal in 258 (59%). Of the 636 swollen limbs, 96 (15%) had clinical signs of lymphedema; 95% had dorsal hump, 37% had square toes, 32% had presence of Kaposi-Stemmer sign, and 12% had nonpitting edema. Of these 96, lymphoscintigraphy was performed on 66 (69%); 45 of 66 (68%) patients with clinical signs were positive for lymphedema; the remaining 32% were normal. Conversely, among 258 swollen limbs with abnormal findings on lymphoscintigraphy, only 45 (17%) had one or more of the clinical signs. Sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs in predicting lymphoscintigraphy-confirmed lymphedema were 17% and 88%, respectively. Overall accuracy was 47%. Of the clinical signs, only the Kaposi-Stemmer sign was a significant predictor of lymphedema (odds ratio, 7.9; p = 0.02). In patients with positive clinical signs but normal findings on lymphoscintigraphy, venous obstruction was the most common cause of swelling.

Conclusions

Clinical signs of lymphedema appear to be unreliable in making a correct diagnosis of lymphedema in one-third of patients. Conversely, in lymphoscintigraphy-confirmed lymphedema, only 17% had positive clinical signs. Of the clinical signs, only Kaposi-Stemmer sign has some predictability in determining lymphoscintigraphy-confirmed lymphedema. Venous obstruction is the most common cause of clinical signs in patients without lymphedema. Routine use of lymphoscintigraphy is recommended in patients to make an objective diagnosis of lymphedema.

A 61-year-old man presented with an 18-month history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, worsening bilateral lower extremity edema, abdominal swelling, and increased assistance with activities of daily living. Pertinent past medical history included right-sided pneumonia secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae that was complicated by empyema, requiring right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication 2 years earlier. He had a negative cardiac history, no recent travel in the last 3 years, and no known exposure to tuberculosis. His medications included aspirin and daily furosemide. His symptoms appeared to be refractory to diuretic therapy. Previous workup 6 months earlier included an echocardiography (ECHO) showing enlarged left and right atria with a normal ejection fraction, and a catheterization of the left side of the heart with reported normal left ventricular function and unobstructed coronary arteries.

### Treatment of edema [^115GytUr]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Edema is the result of an imbalance in the filtration system between the capillary and interstitial spaces. The kidneys play a key role in regulating extracellular fluid volume by adjusting sodium and water excretion. Major causes of edema include venous obstruction, increased capillary permeability, and increased plasma volume secondary to sodium and water retention. A systematic approach is warranted to determine the underlying diagnosis. Treatment includes sodium restriction, diuretic use, and appropriate management of the underlying disorder. Leg elevation may be helpful in some patients. Loop diuretics often are used alone or in combination. In patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV congestive heart failure, spironolactone has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites is treated with paracentesis and spironolactone. Dihydropyridine-induced edema can be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Lymphedema occurs when a protein-rich fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Compression garments and range-of-motion exercises may be helpful in patients with this condition.

### Insulin edema: an untypical etiology of anasarca in a 19-year old female presenting to a pediatric emergency department [^1171cpx4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary edema and anasarca are both common findings in patients presenting to emergency departments (ED). The differential diagnosis for these conditions is very wide and requires an initially broad approach that considers multiple organ systems. Insulin edema has been previously described in multiple case reports as a likely cause of acutely developing edema in mostly type I diabetics either initiating or increasing the intensity of their insulin regimens. This case report describes a 19-year-old female with history of type I diabetes mellitus recently admitted to the hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with dyspnea and weight gain. The patient had been reportedly poorly compliant on her insulin therapy before her last admission for DKA and had strictly begun to adhere to her insulin therapy in the interim. Her clinical presentation was notable for hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, weight gain of 30 kg since discharge 9 days ago, a chest Xray displaying bilateral pulmonary edema and a work-up otherwise unrevealing for cardiac, renal, or liver etiologies. She was then admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) on supplemental oxygen where through further evaluation she was determined to have insulin edema. This case details an unlikely etiology of anasarca and pulmonary edema, however diagnosing this condition highlights the broad diagnostic process that must be considered for any patient without known significant cardiac, renal, or liver history presenting with respiratory distress and anasarca especially on initial presentation to an emergency department.

### Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and primary lymphedema of the lower extremity [^116gmHw6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is the most common genetic overgrowth syndrome. Patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may have hemihypertrophy, but their lymphatic vasculature is intact. We present a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and lower extremity enlargement thought to be due to hemihypertrophy that was instead diagnosed with primary lymphedema. There are many causes of leg overgrowth in the pediatric population and misdiagnosis is common. While extremity enlargement secondary to hemihypertrophy may occur in 15% of patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, progression and pitting edema only occur in primary lymphedema. This report highlights the importance of ensuring an accurate diagnosis so that patients are managed appropriately.

### Comprehensive assessment of lower limb edema and its association with quality of life among men with prostate cancer [^112SZSKZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Among 401 men with prostate cancer, we found a prevalence of 11% for LLE. LLE was associated with lower HRQoL and impairment in daily living. Moreover, presence of LLE was significantly associated with older age, higher BMI, more comorbidities, self-reported swelling prior to diagnosis, and increased ADT exposure. Most participants expressed a desire for more information on how to manage their LLE symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of raising awareness, addressing treatable causes and providing support to improve HRQoL and functional outcomes. Well-designed prospective studies with baseline measurements before cancer treatment are needed to clarify how specific treatments affect LLE and to identify those at greatest risk.

### Edema of the face and extremities secondary to pemetrexed [^117RzBSR]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pemetrexed-induced edema, pseudocellulitis, and sclerosis can be challenging to diagnose in complex patients on combination therapy. This patient initially presented with lower extremity edema, a common clinical finding in the oncology setting. He also had marked sclerosis, including morphea-like plaques on the thighs and lower back. Periorbital edema became more noticeable throughout his course, which in the oncology setting is a specific dAE most often associated with drugs that target BCR-ABL or CSFR1 or pemetrexed. Edema preceding sclerosis is associated with cytotoxic therapies most commonly including gemcitabine and taxanes but can be seen with bleomycin and pemetrexed, as in this case. The differential diagnosis included rare presentations of sclerosis or eosinophilic fasciitis induced by checkpoint blockade, though periorbital edema would not be an expected feature with either of these presentations and therefore pemetrexed was favored. Improvement with continued pembrolizumab confirmed this to be less likely. Additionally, the patient did not experience signs of capillary leak syndrome. The patient's long standing vitamin supplementation made vitamin deficiency an unlikely etiology as well, though folate deficiency may be associated with this finding in pemetrexed treated patients.

This case reflects the difficulty of identifying rare dAEs, the necessity of total body skin examination in these patients, and the importance of periorbital edema in helping identify the drug culprit. This change can happen slowly and early on, and may not be readily apparent to anyone other than the patient. Identifying the drug trigger is paramount, such that the offending agent can be adjusted and detriments to quality of life limited and ideally reversed. Additionally, this case highlights the challenge of appreciating erythema and edema in patients of color, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. While corticosteroid therapy may be effective prophylactic treatment against some pemetrexed-induced adverse events, skin toxicity still occurs in some cases despite premedication, as in our patient. Edema progressing to sclerosis is an inflammatory process and is most often treated with additional systemic steroids and immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate. In the setting of active malignancy, we opted to manage conservatively with topicals, supportive care, and discontinuation of the offending agent. Proposed mechanisms of this toxicity include diffusion of drug into interstitial fluid leading to vascular damage and hypersensitivity. The addition of bevacizumab in this case may have disrupted vascular repair mechanisms. More research is needed to better understand mechanisms and approaches to prevention and treatment in the active malignancy patient.

### The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural history of chronic venous disease [^114Zp13i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic venous disease includes a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from varicose veins through chronic lower extremity pain and edema to venous skin changes and ulceration. Such manifestations may result from primary venous insufficiency or be secondary to other disorders, primarily acute deep venous thrombosis. Regardless of etiology, chronic venous disease has significant socioeconomic consequences and is among the most common problems encountered in surgical practice. Ambulatory venous hypertension underlies most of the sequelae of chronic venous disease, although such hemodynamic derangements may result from either valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. Unfortunately, the factors responsible for the progression of disease from mild to severe manifestations are only beginning to be understood. However, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of chronic venous disease is essential in its management.

### Results from a comparative study to evaluate the treatment effectiveness of a nonpneumatic compression device vs an advanced pneumatic compression device for lower extremity lymphedema swelling (TEAYS study) [^114otUxH]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Multicenter, prospective, randomized cross-over trial
- **Key Findings**: Data from 71 patients (108 affected limbs) with lower extremity lymphedema demonstrated significant greater improvements in limb edema and in quality of life with the use of a novel nonpneumatic compression device than with a commercially available advanced pneumatic compression device. Patients were also significantly more adherent to self-care treatment (81% vs 56%; P < .001), more active (91% vs 0%), and more satisfied (78% vs 22%) with the novel device.
- **Take Home Message**: The results have shown that the novel nonpneumatic compression device is safe and effective for decreasing limb volume in those with lower extremity venous/lymphatic edema. The nonpneumatic compression device is more effective and results in greater adherence and improved quality of life than a commercially available advanced pneumatic compression device.

Lymphedema is a common but often unrecognized clinical condition that is chronic and progressive in nature. The disease arises from an impaired lymphatic drainage causing an excess accumulation of interstitial fluid that results in tissue swelling and can lead to tissue and skin changes. Lymphedema impacts 250 million people worldwide, with tens of millions in the United States, and is classified either as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is associated with malformation of the lymphatic system, which can develop early or onset late in life, whereas secondary lymphedema is typically acquired owing to injury or insult to the lymphatic systems, such as from cancer or cancer-related treatments, injury, trauma, or venous insufficiency. In the United States, secondary lower extremity lymphedema owing to chronic venous insufficiency also known as phlebolymphedema is a leading cause.

Chronic venous insufficiency has been estimated to affect as much as 50% of the adult population, and accounts for 2% of Western health care budgets. Patients with chronic venous insufficiency with venous hypertension have an increased hydrostatic pressure in capillaries and increased capillary permeability, and extravasation of proteins into intracellular spaces. The accumulation of proteins and macromolecules in interstitial spaces occurs more rapidly than lymphatic vessels can drain them, leading to the clinical development of lymphedema. In effect, the functioning of the lymphatic system is inextricably linked to the functional status of the venous system.

### Lymphedema: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations [^116gpPru]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) — across systematic reviews and meta-analyses in adults with chronic venous disease, MPFF improved symptoms, edema, and quality of life (QOL), and was reported as the most effective option in some outcomes. In adults with CVD including CEAP C2, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials reported MPFF was highly effective in improving leg symptoms, edema and QOL assessed by CIVIQ-20. In adults with lower extremity venous edema, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 double-blind, randomized, placebo or other VAD-controlled trials supported assigning Grade A evidence to MPFF for management of symptoms and edema. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 RCTs with a separated analysis of 17 observational studies with sulodexide stated MPFF was the most effective treatment in reducing lower leg volume, CIVIQ-20 score and pain VAS scale.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^114Unsoc]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinician is frequently confronted with the combination of hypovolemia and peripheral edema. In healthy humans, compensatory mechanisms including lymphatic return of extravascular fluid and transcapillary Starling forces act in concert to attenuate edema by increasing plasma volume. When this does not occur, treatment is a challenge, as administration of a diuretic will likely worsen hypovolemia and cause hypotension, while fluid administration worsens the edema. The most common explanation of this confusing condition is that capillary permeability has increased due to damage to the endothelial glycocalyx layer. However, increased capillary leakage normally accelerates lymphatic flow which normalizes the balance between the body fluid volumes, and might even increase the plasma albumin concentration ("interstitial washdown").

This paper discusses how inflammatory insults and certain drugs may disturb the normal exchange of infused crystalloid fluid between the plasma and the interstitial space by mechanisms other than increased capillary leakage. Our review focuses on the possibility that decreased lymphatic return of fluid and protein alone can create hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. The pathophysiology responsible for poor lymphatic return might involve a reduction of the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (P i) or failure of the intrinsic contractility of lymphatic smooth muscle cells. These mechanisms are distinctly different from lymphatic obstruction due to tumors, compression during compartment syndromes and resistance to thoracic duct outflow.

### Developing drugs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what have we learned from clinical trials? [^115mJSvZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Pathophysiologically, HF is defined as the inability of the heart to provide adequate perfusion to the body and its tissues. Clinically, HF is defined as a syndrome with typical signs (pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure) and symptoms (dyspnea, ankle swelling, and fatigue), which result from abnormal cardiac structure or function. 1, 2 HF is a highly prevalent disease, affecting 5.8 million people in the USA and nearly 15 million in Europe. 3, 4 The symptoms and the need for frequent hospitalizations in HF cause a significant burden on individual patients. At the same time, HF is a major public health concern due to the need for frequent and intense healthcare resource utilization. 1, 2, 4, 5 Further, despite the use of currently available therapies, the prognosis of patients with HF is considerably poor, with 5‐year survival rates of 50%, a prognosis even worse than that of patients with advanced cancer or stroke. 6

PATIENT SELECTION FOR NIVL STENT PLACEMENT

Consensus recommendations:

Stent placement for NIVL may be appropriate in the presence of asymmetrical edema significantly affecting QOL, after excluding other systemic causes of edema and primary lymphedema.
Stent placement for NIVL may be appropriate in the presence of progressive Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology class 4 to 6 venous disease or venous claudication with minimal superficial venous disease or following previous treatment of underlying superficial venous reflux.
Stent placement for NIVL is inappropriate in patients with minimal to no symptoms.
Prophylactic stent placement for NIVL is inappropriate in asymptomatic patients to prevent possible future venous thromboembolism events.
Stent placement for NIVL may have a role in some cases with QOL-impacting chronic pelvic pain (CPP) of venous origin in the presence of dilated parauterine veins with or without pelvic venous reflux.

NIVL typically leads to asymmetrical swelling and seldom presents with symmetrical bilateral edema. Rarely, asymptomatic compression may be present bilaterally and at the iliac confluence. Bilateral edema, when encountered, is generally attributable to factors such as medications (ie, calcium channel blockers), lymphedema, bilateral superficial venous reflux, or other systemic causes (Table). – Before intervening on a NIVL, it is critical to evaluate and exclude other potential causes of bilateral edema. Significant edema extending to the thigh that affects QOL may warrant intervention, whereas limited ankle edema may not warrant intervention, and other potential etiologies should be investigated.

Other Causes of Lower Extremity Edema

The treatment of NIVL has primarily relied on data derived from single-center cohort studies and investigational device exemption studies. Studies evaluating iliac vein stent placement in investigational device exemption trials have demonstrated sustained improvements in outcomes, including Venous Clinical Severity Score and QOL, for the NIVL population that are comparable to those observed in the postthrombotic syndrome population. However, there is significant heterogeneity among studies, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcomes reporting/assessment. These inherent limitations serve as a cautionary reminder against relying exclusively on these trials for guiding patient selection.
