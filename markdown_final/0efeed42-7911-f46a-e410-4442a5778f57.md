## Question

A 68-year-old woman presents to the gynecology clinic with a sensation of vaginal bulge and pelvic pressure that has progressively worsened over the past year. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy 10 years ago for benign disease. On examination, she is found to have stage III vaginal vault prolapse. She is otherwise healthy and expresses concern about undergoing further surgery. She asks about non-surgical options for managing her prolapse.

According to current guidelines, what non-surgical management option should be offered to this patient with stage III post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which non-surgical management option should be offered to a 68-year-old woman with stage III post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse who wishes to avoid surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether non-surgical care is appropriate. Then, I should verify which non-surgical modalities are supported by guidelines and at what strength. Next, I will examine the evidence base for each non-surgical option, especially pessaries and pelvic floor muscle training, and confirm applicability to stage III vault prolapse. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation with counseling points and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the relevance of non-surgical management here. Stage III vault prolapse is advanced apical descent beyond the hymen, and in a patient declining surgery, conservative therapy is entirely appropriate and guideline-concordant, provided we set expectations about goals and outcomes [^116xpw2o].

> I need to check which non-surgical options are endorsed for vault prolapse. The RCOG green-top guideline explicitly recommends offering vaginal pessaries as an alternative treatment for stage II–IV post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse, which directly covers this patient's stage III vault prolapse, and it also notes that pelvic floor muscle training is effective for stage I–II prolapse, implying more limited benefit in advanced apical descent [^116xpw2o] [^1162dXsi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pelvic floor muscle training in stage III disease. I initially thought PFMT might be broadly effective across stages, but wait, let me verify the guideline nuance: RCOG supports PFMT for stage I–II prolapse and does not extend that recommendation to stage III–IV apical prolapse, so for this patient with stage III vault descent, PFMT may be adjunctive but should not be the primary non-surgical therapy, whereas pessary is the guideline-endorsed first-line conservative option for advanced vault prolapse [^1162dXsi] [^116xpw2o].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for pessaries. ACOG advises offering a vaginal pessary as an effective nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic POP, with successful fitting in up to 92% of women; ring pessaries work well for stage II–III prolapse, while Gellhorn is often needed for stage IV, and self-management models improve convenience and adherence, which aligns with this patient's preference to avoid surgery [^115VFuDw]. Let me double-check that this applies post-hysterectomy: yes, pessaries are effective for vault prolapse after hysterectomy and are commonly used in this setting, with low complication rates when managed appropriately [^116xpw2o] [^114BLwSh].

> I will now examine expected outcomes and counseling points so I can set realistic expectations. Pessaries provide symptom relief for bulge and pressure in many women, but they do not correct the anatomic defect; ongoing care includes fitting, teaching self-removal and cleaning if feasible, periodic vaginal estrogen for mucosal health in menopause, and surveillance for vaginal irritation or ulceration, which are typically manageable with adjustments and local care [^115VFuDw] [^111GBN4S]. But wait, what if the patient prioritizes avoiding any procedure at all? Even then, pessary remains the most appropriate first-line non-surgical option, with observation alone reserved for minimally symptomatic patients, which is not the case here given stage III descent and bothersome bulge symptoms [^116LE4pf] [^116xpw2o].

> Let me consider adjuncts and what to avoid. Pelvic floor muscle training can be offered as an adjunct to improve support and symptoms, but I should confirm that it is not a substitute for pessary in stage III vault prolapse; indeed, guidelines position PFMT for earlier-stage disease and do not recommend it as sole therapy for advanced apical descent, so expectations should be framed accordingly [^1162dXsi] [^116xpw2o]. I should also ensure we do not overpromise on biologics or other non-surgical add-ons; outside of pessary and PFMT, evidence for other conservative modalities in this context is limited and not guideline-endorsed for vault prolapse [^116xpw2o].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For a 68-year-old with stage III post-hysterectomy vault prolapse who declines surgery, the guideline-concordant, evidence-based non-surgical management is a vaginal pessary, with ring or Gellhorn selection based on anatomy and retention, plus education on self-care and scheduled follow-up; pelvic floor muscle training may be added for symptom modulation but should not replace pessary as primary therapy in this advanced apical prolapse scenario [^116xpw2o] [^115VFuDw] [^1162dXsi].

---

The recommended non-surgical management for stage III post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse is a **vaginal pessary** [^116xpw2o], which is effective, safe, and guideline-supported for stages II–IV vault prolapse [^116xpw2o]. Pessaries relieve bulge and pressure symptoms [^115VFuDw], are adjustable, and allow sexual function when desired. Pelvic floor muscle training is **adjunctive** [^1162dXsi] but not sufficient alone for stage III prolapse [^1162dXsi]. Expectant management is reasonable only if symptoms are minimal and the patient prefers no intervention [^116LE4pf]. Pessary care includes fitting, teaching self-management, regular follow-up, and vaginal estrogen for menopausal patients to reduce irritation [^115VFuDw].

## Non-surgical management options

Key characteristics of non-surgical management options:

| **Aspect** | **Vaginal pessary** | **Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)** | **Expectant management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Description | A silicone device inserted into the vagina to support the prolapsed vault and relieve symptoms [^115VFuDw] | Structured exercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and improve support [^114EUYVw] | Observation without active intervention, reserved for minimally symptomatic patients [^112Lycgi] |
| Effectiveness | Highly effective for symptom relief in stages II–IV vault prolapse; successful fitting in up to 92% of women [^115VFuDw] | Useful adjunct for mild-to-moderate prolapse (stages I–II) [^1162dXsi]; limited benefit alone in stage III [^notfound] | Appropriate only if symptoms are minimal and the patient prefers no treatment [^112Lycgi] |
| Safety | Safe with low complication rates; risks include vaginal irritation, discharge, and rare infection or ulceration [^notfound] | Safe with no significant adverse effects; may cause temporary muscle soreness [^notfound] | Safe but risk of progression exists; requires periodic monitoring [^113DcLJQ] |
| Patient factors | Suitable for sexually active women, those declining surgery, or with high surgical risk [^115VFuDw] | Suitable for motivated patients with mild-to-moderate prolapse or as adjunct to pessary use [^1162dXsi] | Suitable for minimally symptomatic patients who prefer no intervention [^112Lycgi] |

---

## Evidence-based recommendations

- **RCOG guidelines**: Offer vaginal pessaries as an alternative treatment for stages II–IV post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse [^116xpw2o].
- **ACOG guidelines**: Offer vaginal pessaries as an effective nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic POP, including vault prolapse [^115VFuDw].
- **Pelvic floor muscle training**: Recommended for stages I–II prolapse [^1162dXsi]; limited evidence for stage III vault prolapse as monotherapy [^notfound].

---

## Practical considerations and patient counseling

- **Pessary fitting and follow-up**: Requires trained clinicians, patient education, and regular follow-up to monitor for irritation, infection, or ulceration [^115VFuDw].
- **Self-management**: Teaching patients to remove, clean, and reinsert pessaries improves adherence and reduces clinic visits [^111GBN4S].
- **Vaginal estrogen**: Recommended for menopausal patients to reduce irritation and improve comfort with pessary use [^notfound].
- **Sexual function**: Pessaries can be removed for intercourse, allowing sexual activity without significant interference [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a 68-year-old woman with stage III post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse who declines surgery, **vaginal pessary is the preferred non-surgical option** [^116xpw2o]. It is effective, safe, and guideline-supported for advanced vault prolapse [^115VFuDw]. Pelvic floor muscle training may be added as an adjunct but is not sufficient alone for stage III disease [^1162dXsi]. Expectant management is reasonable only if symptoms are minimal and the patient prefers no intervention [^112Lycgi].

Materials and methods

Types of studies

We searched the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any treatment was compared with any other treatment for VVP. Treatment was defined as any treatment to treat a post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse. Trials reporting on the objective and/or subjective outcome of VVP treatments were eligible if they reported on at least 30 participants and a follow-up of at least 6 months. Quasi-randomized studies and cross-over studies were not included. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated through the objective (anatomical) results and/or the subjective (quality of life and satisfaction) results.

A systematic review of the literature on the treatment of post-hysterectomy VVP was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Studies were identified by searching PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase, using the search term "vaginal vault prolapse". The last literature search was run on 25 April 2017. An overview of our full electronic search strategy is presented in Appendix 1. Narrowing down the search by adding the search terms "therapy" or "systematic review", resulted in the loss of relevant articles. We therefore chose a broad search with the term "vaginal vault prolapse". Reference lists of relevant articles identified were checked for additional articles. No restrictions on language or publication year were applied, and foreign-language papers were translated. We did not impose any other limits on any of the searches.

Types of participants

Eligible trials included women seeking treatment for a symptomatic primary VVP, defined as a post-hysterectomy prolapse of the apical compartment. If trials reported on a combination of uterine prolapse and (non-)post-hysterectomy VVP, they were excluded when no subgroup analysis was performed on the group with a VVP.

Types of interventions

Eligible trials compared different types of treatment for VVP, including physiotherapy, pessary treatment, abdominal surgery (open, laparoscopic or robotic), vaginal surgery, native tissue repair, and mesh surgery.

Data collection

Titles and abstracts were assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers (ALC and BNB). Disagreements were referred to a third reviewer (MYB or VD) to reach consensus. Data extraction was independently conducted by two authors (ALC and BNB) and recorded in a predefined data extraction sheet. The selection process can be referred to in the PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart

Two reviewers (ALC and BNB) independently assessed the quality of the trials included utilizing the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Disagreements were discussed with a third reviewer (MYB) to reach consensus (Appendix 1).

Data extraction and management

Data were extracted on type of intervention(s), number and age of trial participants, the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria, the follow-up duration, type of treatment, and type of outcome measure. Our outcome measure is the comparison of the objective and subjective outcomes of the trial interventions. Other extracted parameters are the language of the article, blinding, baseline characteristics, details of the intervention, complications, adverse events, repeat surgery, recurrent prolapse, and loss to follow-up.

Assessment of risk of bias in the studies included

Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane "risk of bias" assessment tool to assess selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data); reporting (selective reporting); and other bias. We presented the conclusions in the "risk of bias" tables (Figs. 2, 3).

Background

Apical vaginal prolapse is the descent of the uterus or vaginal vault (post-hysterectomy). Various surgical treatments are available, but there are no guidelines to recommend which is the best.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of any surgical intervention compared to another intervention for the management of apical vaginal prolapse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 14 March 2022).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery and recurrent prolapse (any site).

Main Results

We included 59 RCTs (6705 women) comparing surgical procedures for apical vaginal prolapse. Evidence certainty ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations included imprecision, poor methodology, and inconsistency. Vaginal procedures compared to sacral colpopexy for vault prolapse (seven RCTs, n = 613; six months to f four-year review) Awareness of prolapse was more common after vaginal procedures (risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 4.21, 4 RCTs, n = 346, I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence). If 8% of women are aware of prolapse after sacral colpopexy, 18% (10% to 32%) are likely to be aware after vaginal procedures. Surgery for recurrent prolapse was more common after vaginal procedures (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.04; 6 RCTs, n = 497, I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence). The confidence interval suggests that if 6% of women require repeat prolapse surgery after sacral colpopexy, 14% (8% to 25%) are likely to require it after vaginal procedures. Prolapse on examination is probably more common after vaginal procedures (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.65; 5 RCTs, n = 422; I² = 24%, moderate-certainty evidence). If 18% of women have recurrent prolapse after sacral colpopexy, between 23% and 47% are likely to do so after vaginal procedures. Other outcomes: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was more common after vaginal procedures (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.94; 3 RCTs, n = 263; I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of vaginal procedures on dyspareunia was uncertain (RR 3.44, 95% CI 0.61 to 19.53; 3 RCTs, n = 106, I² = 65%, low-certainty evidence). Vaginal hysterectomy compared to sacral hysteropexy/cervicopexy (six RCTS, 554 women, one to seven year review) Awareness of prolapse - There may be little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.10 to 9.98; 2 RCTs, n = 200, very low-certainty evidence). Surgery for recurrent prolapse - There may be little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.54; 5 RCTs, n = 403; I² = 9%, low-certainty evidence). Prolapse on examination- there was little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.11; 2 RCTs n = 230; I² = 9%, moderate-certainty evidence). Vaginal hysteropexy compared to sacral hysteropexy/cervicopexy (two RCTs, n = 388, 1-four-year review) Awareness of prolapse - No difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 0.55 95% CI 0.21 to 1.44; 1 RCT n = 257, low-certainty evidence). Surgery for recurrent prolapse - No difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.44; 2 RCTs, n = 345; I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence). Prolapse on examination- There were little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; 2 RCTs n = 367; I² = 9%, moderate-certainty evidence). Vaginal hysterectomy compared to vaginal hysteropexy (four RCTs, n = 620, 6 months to five-year review) Awareness of prolapse - There may be little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 1.0 95% CI 0.44 to 2.24; 2 RCTs, n = 365, I² = 0% moderate-quality certainty evidence). Surgery for recurrent prolapse - There may be little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.60; 3 RCTs, n = 443; I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence). Prolapse on examination- There were little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.61; 2 RCTs n = 361; I² = 74%, low-certainty evidence). Other outcomes: Total vaginal length (TVL) was shorter after vaginal hysterectomy (mean difference (MD) 0.89cm 95% CI 0.49 to 1.28cm shorter; 3 RCTs, n = 413, low-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference between the groups in terms of operating time, dyspareunia and stress urinary incontinence. Other analyses There were no differences identified for any of our primary review outcomes between different types of vaginal native tissue repair (4 RCTs), comparisons of graft materials for vaginal support (3 RCTs), pectopexy versus other apical suspensions (5 RCTs), continuous versus interrupted sutures at sacral colpopexy (2 RCTs), absorbable versus permanent sutures at apical suspensions (5 RCTs) or different routes of sacral colpopexy. Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy is associated with shorter admission time than open approach (3 RCTs) and quicker operating time than robotic approach (3 RCTs). Transvaginal mesh does not confer any advantage over native tissue repair, however is associated with a 17.5% rate of mesh exposure (7 RCTs).

Authors' Conclusions

Sacral colpopexy is associated with lower risk of awareness of prolapse, recurrent prolapse on examination, repeat surgery for prolapse, and postoperative SUI than a variety of vaginal interventions. The limited evidence does not support the use of transvaginal mesh compared to native tissue repair for apical vaginal prolapse. There were no differences in primary outcomes for different routes of sacral colpopexy. However, the laparoscopic approach is associated with a shorter operating time than robotic approach, and shorter admission than open approach. There were no significant differences between vaginal hysteropexy and vaginal hysterectomy for uterine prolapse nor between vaginal hysteropexy and abdominal hysteropexy/cervicopexy. There were no differences detected between absorbable and non absorbable sutures however, the certainty of evidence for mesh exposure and dyspareunia was low.

Anatomical objective outcome

All trials reporting on success had different definitions of success (Table 1). As different success rate definitions were used, these data are difficult to interpret. Therefore, we extracted data from all publications to look for identical outcome measures (Table 4 and Appendix 2 Table 6). Data for point C from the POP-Q was available for almost all trials. Another anatomical outcome measurement was success defined as POP-Q stage 2 or lower. It has to be taken into account that the definitions based on prolapse stage were also different ("no prolapse POP-Q stage > 2", "no prolapse POP-Q stage ≥ 2", "Baden–Walker classification", "position of the vault in relation to the hymen", and "POP-Q stage of any compartment, or some specific compartment"). Nevertheless, the POP-Q stage data have to be interpreted with caution again. Furthermore, not all papers report on other compartments, whereas some techniques are prone to resulting in recurrences in other compartments, even as the possibility of anatomical overcorrection of compartments after some procedures. In addition, the anatomical result does not completely reflect the patient satisfaction correctly, as described by Barber et al. Therefore, other parameters such as subjective outcome are also very important.

Subjective outcome

All trials used different definitions and measurement tools (Table 2). This makes interpretation difficult. As mentioned before, it would be preferable if the ICS/IUGA could recommend validated questionnaires that can be used in future trials, to compare subjective results. Unfortunately, we were unable to extract any identical data about subjective outcome, to make the comparison easier. Also, we were not able to extract enough data from the composite outcome recommended by Barber et al.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse is a common health problem. The prevalence of such prolapse is as much as 40% in women aged more than 45 years, with millions of women affected worldwide, and the incidence is still rising as a result of aging populations and increasing obesity rates. Pelvic organ prolapse has a negative influence on women's quality of life and is associated with physical, psychological, and sexual problems.

The lifetime risk for prolapse surgery is 11–20%, and worldwide vaginal hysterectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure for uterine prolapse. Performing a hysterectomy for uterine prolapse is not an evidence based practice and whether or not the uterus should be removed is debatable. Uterus preserving procedures such as vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy, in which the uterus is attached to the sacrospinous ligament, are becoming more popular. In a recent study we found a trend towards more uterus preservation in the Netherlands, which is in line with more women opting to retain their uterus in case of an equal outcome with hysterectomy. Uterus preservation is thought to be less invasive, and in prospective non-randomised and retrospective cohort studies sacrospinous hysteropexy was as effective as vaginal hysterectomy, with a similar rate of recurrence and repeat surgery but with a shorter operating time, less blood loss, faster recovery, and fewer complications. A hysterectomy has known benefits as well: it prevents the development of uterine cancer and stops menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women. After vaginal hysterectomy, however, women may be at increased risk of recurrent prolapse since hysterectomy disrupts the supportive structures of the pelvic floor. To prevent future prolapse of the vaginal vault after hysterectomy additional vault suspension is recommended. Randomised controlled trials comparing uterus preserving techniques and hysterectomy with vault suspension are limited. One randomised controlled trial found more recurrent uterine prolapse with sacrospinous hysteropexy after 12 months, but the recurrence rate was only a secondary endpoint. Another randomised controlled trial found no differences in sexual functioning after six months but did not report on anatomical outcomes.

Owing to a lack of well executed randomised controlled trials and clear guidelines on the treatment of uterine prolapse, the variation in surgical management of uterine prolapse is enormous and a Cochrane meta-analysis on surgery for pelvic organ prolapse concluded that more research on this subject is needed. We tested the hypothesis that sacrospinous hysteropexy is non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments for surgical failure after 12 months' follow-up.

Background

Apical vaginal prolapse is a descent of the uterus or vaginal vault (post-hysterectomy). Various surgical treatments are available and there are no guidelines to recommend which is the best.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of any surgical intervention compared to another intervention for the management of apical vaginal prolapse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched July 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched January 2016).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery and recurrent prolapse (any site).

Main Results

We included 30 RCTs (3414 women) comparing surgical procedures for apical vaginal prolapse. Evidence quality ranged from low to moderate. Limitations included imprecision, poor methodological reporting and inconsistency. Vaginal procedures versus sacral colpopexy (six RCTs, n = 583; one to four-year review). Awareness of prolapse was more common after vaginal procedures (risk ratio (RR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 4.21, 3 RCTs, n = 277, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). If 7% of women are aware of prolapse after sacral colpopexy, 14% (7% to 27%) are likely to be aware after vaginal procedures. Repeat surgery for prolapse was more common after vaginal procedures (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.32; 4 RCTs, n = 383, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The confidence interval suggests that if 4% of women require repeat prolapse surgery after sacral colpopexy, between 5% and 18% would require it after vaginal procedures. We found no conclusive evidence that vaginal procedures increaserepeat surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.86; 4 RCTs, n = 395; I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). If 3% of women require repeat surgery for SUI after sacral colpopexy, between 2% and 16% are likely to do so after vaginal procedures. Recurrent prolapse is probably more common after vaginal procedures (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.70; 4 RCTs, n = 390; I² = 41%, moderate-quality evidence). If 23% of women have recurrent prolapse after sacral colpopexy, about 41% (31% to 63%) are likely to do so after vaginal procedures. The effect of vaginal procedures on bladder injury was uncertain (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.36; 5 RCTs, n = 511; I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). SUI was more common after vaginal procedures (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.94; 3 RCTs, n = 263; I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Dyspareunia was also more common after vaginal procedures (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.50; 3 RCTs, n = 106, I² = 43%, low-quality evidence). Vaginal surgery with mesh versus without mesh (6 RCTs, n = 598, 1–3 year review). Awareness of prolapse - There may be little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 1.08 95% CI 0.35 to 3.30 1 RCT n = 54, low quality evidence). The confidence interval was wide suggesting that if 18% of women are aware of prolapse after surgery without mesh, between 6% and 59% will be aware of prolapse after surgery with mesh. Repeat surgery for prolapse - There may be little or no difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.60; 5 RCTs, n = 497; I² = 9%, low-quality evidence). If 4% of women require repeat surgery for prolapse after surgery without mesh, 1% to 7% are likely to do so after surgery with mesh. We found no conclusive evidence that surgery with mesh increases repeat surgery for SUI (RR 4.91, 95% CI 0.86 to 27.94; 2 RCTs, n = 220; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). The confidence interval was wide suggesting that if 2% of women require repeat surgery for SUI after vaginal colpopexy without mesh, 2% to 53% are likely to do so after surgery with mesh. We found no clear evidence that surgery with mesh decreases recurrent prolapse (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.40; 3 RCTs n = 269; I² = 91%, low-quality evidence). The confidence interval was very wide and there was serious inconsistency between the studies. Other outcomes There is probably little or no difference between the groups in rates of SUI (de novo) (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.99; 4 RCTs, n = 295; I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) or dyspareunia (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.66; 5 RCTs, n = 501; I² = 0% moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is any difference for bladder injury (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 9.89; 4 RCTs, n = 445; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Vaginal hysterectomy versus alternatives for uterine prolapse (six studies, n = 667)No clear conclusions could be reached from the available evidence, though one RCT found that awareness of prolapse was less likely after hysterectomy than after abdominal sacrohysteropexy (RR 0.38, 955 CI 0.15 to 0.98, n = 84, moderate-quality evidence). Other comparisonsThere was no evidence of a difference for any of our primary review outcomes between different types of vaginal native tissue repair (two RCTs), comparisons of graft materials for vaginal support (two RCTs), different routes for sacral colpopexy (four RCTs), or between sacral colpopexy with and without continence surgery (four RCTs).

Authors' Conclusions

Sacral colpopexy is associated with lower risk of awareness of prolapse, recurrent prolapse on examination, repeat surgery for prolapse, postoperative SUI and dyspareunia than a variety of vaginal interventions. The limited evidence does not support use of transvaginal mesh compared to native tissue repair for apical vaginal prolapse. Most of the evaluated transvaginal meshes are no longer available and new lighter meshes currently lack evidence of safetyThe evidence was inconclusive when comparing access routes for sacral colpopexy. No clear conclusion can be reached from the available data comparing uterine preserving surgery versus vaginal hysterectomy for uterine prolapse.

A comparison of techniques was difficult because of heterogeneity; therefore, a network meta-analysis was not possible. All techniques have proved to be effective and the reported differences between the techniques were negligible. Therefore, a standard treatment for VVP could not be given according to this review.

We are aware of the shortcomings of this systematic literature review. Of the studies on the subject included, only 1 was designed as an RCT, whereas the rest either have no control group or are retrospective and observational in nature. Most studies conducted only a short-term follow-up, including only a small group size. In addition, patients suffering from different POP-Q stages pre-hysterectomy were often grouped together, making it difficult to obtain an objective analysis and interpretation of the data.

Analysis

We created a network plot to illustrate the geometry of the network of the treatments included by using "mvmeta" package in Stata software (version 12.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). For dichotomous data, we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel–Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). For continuous data, if all studies reported exactly the same outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MDs) between treatment groups. We presented 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. We analyzed the data on an intention-to-treat basis (once randomized to an intervention, the participants are analyzed in that intervention and analysis includes all randomized participants) as far as possible. Review manager 5.3 was used for meta-analyses.

We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the studies included were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by measuring the I². An I² measurement greater than 50% was taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity, and a random-effects calculation was undertaken to express greater uncertainly by widening the confidence intervals.

Strengths and limitations

We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses of all randomized controlled trials available on the topic of the treatment of VVP. Although 9 RCTs were included in this review, a treatment of outspoken preference for VVP could not be determined, owing to the large heterogeneity of the trials. Therefore, a network meta-analysis could not be performed because of the lack of a common reference intervention (standard treatment) and the many different comparisons of all the VVP treatments. However, a network plot was constructed to illustrate the geometry of the network and we pooled several data to perform a meta-analysis (Fig. 4).

Many treatment comparisons have been made, using all the different measurement tools and outcomes. To compare treatment options, standard treatment needs to be uniform, using the same measurement tools and outcomes. These measurement tools should be in line with the recommendations of the ICS/IUGA. Initiators of future trials should be aware of this heterogeneity and need to choose carefully the treatments to compare and outcomes. Not only a reference intervention, but also the recommendation of validated and accepted questionnaires would be helpful. The POP-Q classification should be used for the anatomical outcome. Complications can be recorded in a systematic way by using the CTS classification system as advised by the IUGA/ICS or the Clavien–Dindo complication classification. Success should be defined according to the composite score of Barber et al. (recurrent pelvic organ prolapse beyond the hymen in the apical compartment, with bothersome bulge symptoms, and reinterventions). Unfortunately, not all included trials used the POP-Q classification to evaluate the anatomical outcome, and the subjective outcome was measured by many different questionnaires, some not even validated. Also, success was defined in many different ways. The same arguments count as for the standardization of complications. All trials report complications in their own way, which could result in a risk of bias, because authors can choose to include or exclude complications at will. Registration of complications should be recorded in a systematic way and described before the start of a trial. However, we structured the trial results and performed meta-analyses to compare the treatments included if possible.

Introduction

More than 40% of women aged 40 and older have pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The incidence of vault prolapse requiring surgery has been estimated to be 36 per 10,000 women years. The risk of prolapse following hysterectomy is 5.5 times higher in women whose initial indication for hysterectomy was pelvic organ prolapse as opposed to other indications. The number of women with a symptomatic POP who seek medical help is increasing. Vaginal vault prolapse (VVP) is often associated with other compartment defects (cystocele, rectocele, or enterocele), which makes it a challenging condition to treat. There is a growing recognition that adequate support for the vaginal apex is an essential component of a durable surgical repair for women with advanced prolapse. Because of the significant contribution of the apex to vaginal support, anterior and posterior vaginal repairs may fail unless the apex is adequately supported.

Current treatment options for VVP include pelvic floor muscle training, use of pessaries, and surgery. More than 20 different surgical procedures for correcting VVP have been reported; abdominal sacrocolpopexy by laparotomy (ASC), laparoscopy (LSC) and robotics (RSC), using xenograft, polypropylene, abdominal fascia or fascia lata. Sacrospinal fixation (SSF) and transvaginal mesh (VM) are the most frequently used surgical techniques. The best treatment for post-hysterectomy VVP remains controversial. Maher reviewed the management of apical prolapse, but management of uterine descent and VVP were not separately investigated.

The treatment of post-hysterectomy VVP has been investigated in several randomized clinical trials, but a systematic overview of the topic is still lacking. We compared the effectiveness of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault treatments in a systematic review and meta-analysis, combined with a network plot, thus utilizing the most reliable evidence coming from randomized controlled trials.

### The effectiveness of surgical procedures to prevent post-hysterectomy pelvic organ prolapse: a systematic review of the literature [^117PcaQF]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We performed a systematic review of the literature according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). The databases consulted were PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, andup to 13 May 2020. This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020148618). The protocol was initially proposed in April 2020. A search strategy was devised with the keywords "hysterectomy", "post-hysterectom", "prolapse", "colposusp", "culdoplast", "mccall", "mc call", and synonymous words or expressions. No bar on languages and no time limitation were set Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses flow diagram. POP pelvic organ prolapse

Inclusion criteria were meta-analysis, placebo-controlled randomized trials, systematic reviews, cohort studies, case series, and retrospective studies evaluating surgical procedures performed at the time of hysterectomy to prevent the occurrence of de novo post-hysterectomy pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The studies must investigate surgical procedures performed at the time of hysterectomy and describe the occurrence of post-hysterectomy POP as a main or secondary outcome. Subjects were women who underwent a hysterectomy for benign causes and had a follow-up at least 3 months after the surgery. The main outcome of our analysis was to detect the most effective surgical procedure to be performed at the time of hysterectomy in order to lower the incidence of de novo post-hysterectomy POP.

Exclusion criteria were studies that included women undergoing hysterectomy for malignancy or as a treatment of an existing POP. Studies that did not sufficiently describe the surgical procedure, or that had a follow-up period of less than 3 months, were also excluded. Data were categorized in terms of surgical approach to hysterectomy (vaginal, abdominal, laparoscopic) and type of surgical procedure performed at the time of hysterectomy to prevent post-hysterectomy POP.

The papers were selected by two of the authors (G.C. W.U.) of this study independently and then methodologically analyzed according to The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCT (Table 1) and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies — of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for assessment of methodological quality of non-RCTs (Table 2).

The publication of Tate et al. reports on the 5-year follow-up of the same population as in the paper by Culligan et al. However, we decided to include both papers, as the main focus of each paper is a different outcome. They both report on anatomical outcome (no prolapse stage 2 or more). As this outcome is one of the primary outcomes of our review, and the difference in follow-up time is illustrative for this outcome, we decided to include this outcome for both papers. The other outcome on which they both report is complications, although different complications are reported; in the paper by Culligan et al. all complications up to 1 year are reported and the paper by Tate et al. only reports on mesh exposure.

Risk of bias

The assessment of risk of bias in the studies included is presented in Figs. 2 and 3.

Allocation

All trials were randomized trials and used adequate methods of allocation concealment, for example, randomization by sealed envelopes or computer-generated randomization. In 4 studies, block randomization was used. Inclusion of these 9 trials with well-performed randomization, resulted in a low risk of selection bias. However, in 1 of these trials, 4 participants received the other intervention (polypropylene mesh instead of fascia lata) and were not analyzed using the intention-to treat principle, as they were analyzed in the mesh group.

Performance and detection bias

In some trials, blinding is very difficult because the type of incision is very different. However, patients were blinded in 3 trials and in 1 trial patients were blinded during their admission. The operating staff could not be blinded, although the ward staff were blinded in 2 trials.

Blinding of outcome assessment at the follow-up consult was performed in 5 studies. In 1 study the observer was an independent researcher, who was not blinded. Three studies did not report any blinding of the outcome observation.

Incomplete outcome data

In 7 studies, follow-up rates were described. The follow-up rates varied within the range 69–97% with different follow-up periods. However, only 2 trials specified the reasons for loss to follow-up and looked at patient characteristics of responders and nonresponders, which were balanced between groups. It is unclear if missing data were imputed in any of the studies, which results in a risk of bias.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) risk factors and reoperation — Risk factors for developing symptomatic POP include parity, vaginal delivery, age, obesity, connective tissue disorders, menopausal status, and chronic constipation; modifiable risk factors (obesity and constipation) should be addressed in patients at wellness visits because improvement in these factors may reduce the risk of developing POP. It is not clear if hysterectomy for non-POP conditions is a risk factor; in a cohort subanalysis patients who underwent a hysterectomy had a 5% cumulative risk of undergoing prolapse surgery within the next 15 years, whereas a more recent study found no increased risk of POP in women who underwent prior hysterectomy for non-POP indications. Older studies reported an approximate 30–50% chance of needing a second prolapse surgery after primary POP surgery, with more recent studies showing a lower reoperation rate of approximately 6–30%, and POP surgery that includes suspension of the vaginal apex is associated with a decreased reoperation rate. Risk factors for recurrent prolapse include age younger than 60 years for patients who underwent vaginal surgery for POP, obesity, and preoperative stage III or stage IV prolapse.

### Sacrocolpopexy: the way I do It [^114kpnnv]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The ICI current evidence-based algorithm highlights native-tissue interventions for primary uterine prolapse and reserves SCP for post-hysterectomy prolapse. Our practice is in keeping with these recommendations. Evidence regarding the efficacy of SCP has largely been conducted in the context of vault prolapse alone and has been extrapolated to include concomitant procedures. In addition, the mesh exposure rate is significantly higher if the SCP is done with a concomitant hysterectomy. Therefore, we recommend SCP for vault prolapse with absorbable sutures, a monofilament mesh and commonly performed with a paravaginal repair for optimal patient outcomes.

Surgical Access (Open Versus Laparoscopic Versus Robotic)

The historical concerns of a laparoscopic approach to SCP (as opposed to an open SCP) have largely been debunked. The concerns centred around a proposed lower efficacy when an SCP was performed laparoscopically compared with an open approach. Costantini et al. undertook an RCT comparing surgical outcomes for women with a symptomatic prolapse stage ≥ 2 (POP-Q) who were randomised to either an abdominal (n = 60) or a laparoscopic (n = 61) approach to their SCP. Cure was defined as prolapse stage 1 or less (POP-Q staging), point C/D (POP-Q system) −5 or less and total vaginal length of at least 7 cm. With a mean follow-up period of 41.7 months, the cure rate was 100% for both approaches. Therefore, the laparoscopic approach has comparable outcomes with an abdominal approach, with the additional benefits of less blood loss and a shorter hospital stay. The ICI (12) has implemented these findings by stating that a laparoscopic approach to SCP is associated with lower levels of blood loss, longer operating times, shorter hospital stays, quicker return to activities of daily living and a lower cost, with no difference in objective or subjective cure rates compared with an open approach (grade B evidence on the Oxford scale).

Measurements and procedures

Gynaecological examination before surgery included pelvic ultrasonography to exclude uterine or ovarian disease, a cervical smear test, and vaginal inspection in 45° semi-upright position for staging pelvic organ prolapse using the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system (POP-Q). This system involves quantitative measurements of various points of the vaginal wall, using the hymen as a reference point. The degree of prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall, posterior vaginal wall, and uterus or vaginal vault is measured in centimetres either above or proximal to the hymen (negative number) or beyond, or distal to the hymen (positive number), with the plane of the hymen being defined as zero. The genital hiatus, perineal body, and total vaginal length are also measured. Based on these measurements, a stage (0–4) is determined for each compartment. The overall stage is equal to the stage of the most severely prolapsed compartment. The women came to the hospital to be examined for pelvic organ prolapse stage at baseline and at six weeks, six months, and 12 months after surgery and annually thereafter until 60 months' follow-up. At the time of the follow-up visits women completed validated health related and disease specific quality of life questionnaires: short form-36, Euroqol 5D, urogenital distress inventory, defecatory distress inventory, and incontinence impact questionnaire. We defined the presence of bothersome bulge symptoms after surgery as a positive answer to any of the following two questions from the urogenital distress inventory: "Do you experience a sensation of bulging or protrusion from the vagina?" and "Do you have a bulge or something falling out that you can see in the vagina?" in combination with a response "somewhat bothered" to "very much bothered" to the question "how much does this bother you?" To assess sexual functioning, we used the 12 item pelvic organ prolapse/urinary incontinence sexual questionnaire, translated from the validated questionnaire but not validated for Dutch language.

During hospital admission and the first six weeks after surgery, the women kept a diary to evaluate postoperative pain (range 0–10), measured by a validated visual analogue scale; analgesics; and postoperative recovery, measured with the validated recovery index-10.

Data were entered and registered using a web based application facilitated by the Dutch consortium for studies in women's health and reproductivity.

### Hysterectomy versus uterine preservation for pelvic organ prolapse surgery: a prospective cohort study [^1123o9G6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

One in 5 females will have surgery to treat pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. Uterine-preserving surgery involving suspension of the uterus is an increasingly popular alternative to the traditional use of hysterectomy with vaginal vault suspension to treat pelvic organ prolapse; however, comparative evidence with native tissue repairs remains limited in scope and quality.

Objective

To compare 1-year outcomes between hysterectomy-based and uterine-preserving native tissue prolapse surgeries performed through minimally invasive approaches.

Study Design

We used a nonrandomized design with patients self-selecting their surgical group to integrate a pragmatic, patient-centered, and autonomy-focused approach. Participants chose between uterine-preserving surgery or hysterectomy-based surgery, guided by neutral evidence-based discussions and individualized decision-making, with support from fellowship-trained urogynecologists. Inverse probability of treatment weighting based on high-dimensional propensity scores was used to balance baseline differences across surgical groups in an effort to resemble a randomized clinical trial. A prospective cohort study of 321 participants with stage ≥ 2 prolapse involving the uterus who desired surgical treatment were recruited between 2020 and 2022 and followed to 1 year (retention > 90%). Patients chose to receive uterine-preserving pelvic organ prolapse surgery through hysteropexy (n = 151) or hysterectomy with vaginal vault suspension (n = 170; reference group), with repair of anterior and/or posterior prolapse if indicated. The primary outcome was anatomic prolapse recurrence within 1 year, defined as apical descent ≥ 50% of the total vaginal length. Secondary outcomes were perioperative, functional, clinical, and healthcare outcomes measured at 6 weeks and 1 year. Inverse probability of treatment weighted linear regression and modified Poisson regression were used to estimate adjusted mean differences and relative risks, respectively.

Results

Apical anatomic recurrence rates at 1 year were 17.2% following hysterectomy and 7.5% following uterine-preservation, resulting in an adjusted relative risk of 0.35 (95% CI 0.15, 0.83). Uterine-preserving surgery was associated with shorter length of surgery (adjusted mean difference -0.68 hours [-0.80, -0.55]) and hospitalization (adjusted mean difference -4.34 hours [-7.91, -0.77]), less use of any opioids within 24 hours (adjusted relative risk 0.79 [0.65, 0.97]), and fewer procedural complications (adjusted relative risk 0.19 [0.04, 0.83]) than hysterectomy. Up to 1 year, uterine-preserving surgery was associated with lower risk of composite recurrence (stage ≥ 2 prolapse in any compartment or retreatment; adjusted relative risk 0.47 [0.32, 0.69]) than hysterectomy, driven by anatomic outcomes. There were no clinically meaningful differences in functional or healthcare outcomes between surgical groups.

Conclusion

This study adds real-world evidence to the growing body of research supportive of uterine-preserving surgery as a safe, efficient, and effective alternative to hysterectomy during native tissue prolapse repair. Given mounting evidence on safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of uterine-preserving surgery and its alignment with the preferences of approximately half of patients to keep their uterus, the standard of care should include routine offering and patient choice between uterine-preserving and hysterectomy-based surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.

### Clinical presentation… [^115CV1Z9]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the pelvic structures from the normal anatomic location toward or through the vaginal opening. 1 Pelvic organ prolapse may be associated with urinary incontinence or defecatory dysfunction. Epidemiology The prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse varies widely across studies, depending on the population studied and entry criteria. Women of all ages may be affected, although it is more common in older women. In the Women's Health Initiative study, investigators found a 41. 1 percent prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse at a standard physical assessment in postmenopausal women older than 60 years who had not had a hysterectomy.

Etiology The cause of pelvic organ prolapse is multi-factorial, resulting from loss of the support maintained by a complex interaction among the levator ani, the vagina, and the connective tissue, as well as neurologic injury from stretching of the pudendal nerves that may occur during childbirth. In a healthy woman in whom the levator ani has normal tone and the vagina has adequate depth, the upper vagina lies nearly horizontal when she is upright. The result is a "flap valve" in which the upper vagina presses against the levator plate when there is an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. When the levator ani loses tone, it moves from a horizontal to a semi-vertical position, creating a widened genital hiatus that forces the pelvic structures to rely on connective tissue for support.

When the connective tissue support also fails, as a result of possible collagen decrease and tearing, prolapse may occur. 3, 4 Table 1 lists risk factors associated with pelvic organ prolapse. 2, 5–12. Clinical Presentation TERMINOLOGY Older terms describing pelvic organ prolapse have been replaced because they imply an unrealistic certainty about the structures on the other side of the vaginal bulge, particularly in women who have had previous pelvic organ prolapse surgery. The current practice is to divide the pelvis into anterior, posterior, and middle or apical compartments. 13 Following hysterectomy, prolapse of the vaginal apex with or without prolapse of the anterior and/or posterior vaginal wall is referred to as vault prolapse.
13. HISTORY During a well-woman examination, screening questions with a thorough pelvic examination are important.

1 This is true of patients who are older, obese, or otherwise at risk. 14, 15 The report of a bulge has an 81 percent positive predictive value and a 76 percent negative predictive value for pelvic organ prolapse.
16. The uterus and surrounding pelvic support tend to be dynamic in prolapse, resulting in a variation of symptoms depending on the position of the uterus and pressure of the surrounding structures. 1 Consequently, as the day progresses, bulging and discomfort may increase. 1 Extensive standing, lifting, coughing, and physical exertion may increase patient awareness of discomfort in the pelvis, vagina, abdomen, and low back. Vaginal discharge may be present in patients with complete uterine prolapse who have a decubitus ulcer of the cervix or vagina. Pelvic organ prolapse may progress with increasing body mass index. 17 Weight loss does not reverse the prolapse.

Importance

The optimal surgical repair of vaginal vault prolapse after hysterectomy remains undetermined.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of 3 surgical approaches for vaginal vault prolapse after hysterectomy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a multisite, 3-arm, superiority and noninferiority randomized clinical trial. Outcomes were assessed biannually up to 60 months, until the last participant reached 36 months of follow-up. Settings included 9 clinical sites in the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. Between February 2016 and April 2019, women with symptomatic vaginal vault prolapse after hysterectomy who desired surgical correction were randomized. Data were analyzed from November 2022 to January 2023.

Interventions

Mesh-augmented (either abdominally [sacrocolpopexy] or through a vaginal incision [transvaginal mesh]) vs transvaginal native tissue repair.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time until composite treatment failure (including retreatment for prolapse, prolapse beyond the hymen, or prolapse symptoms) evaluated with survival models. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported symptom-specific results, objective measures, and adverse events.

Results

Of 376 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 66.1 [8.7] years), 360 (96%) had surgery, and 296 (82%) completed follow-up. Adjusted 36-month failure incidence was 28% (95% CI, 20%-37%) for sacrocolpopexy, 29% (95% CI, 21%-38%) for transvaginal mesh, and 43% (95% CI, 35%-53%) for native tissue repair. Sacrocolpopexy was found to be superior to native tissue repair (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.57; 99% CI, 0.33–0.98; P = 0.01). Transvaginal mesh was not statistically superior to native tissue after adjustment for multiple comparisons (aHR, 0.60; 99% CI, 0.34–1.03; P = 0.02) but was noninferior to sacrocolpopexy (aHR, 1.05; 97% CI, 0–1.65; P = 0.01). All 3 surgeries resulted in sustained benefits in subjective outcomes. Mesh exposure rates were low (4 of 120 [3%] for sacrocolpopexy and 6 of 115 [5%] for transvaginal mesh) as were the rates of dyspareunia.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among participants undergoing apical repair for vaginal vault prolapse, sacrocolpopexy and transvaginal mesh resulted in similar composite failure rates at study completion; both had lower failure rates than native tissue repair, although only sacrocolpopexy met a statistically significant difference. Low rates of mesh complications and adverse events corroborated the overall safety of each approach.

Reoperation

Because of the heterogeneity of the subjective and objective outcome measurements used in the trials, reoperations for POP can be a good reflection of the patient's satisfaction and anatomical result. All trials report low reoperation rates for POP, with an outlier of 11% for LSC in 1 trial. Based on these data we can conclude cautiously that all techniques are effective, with the best results for ASC (0–3%) and VM (0–5%). However, the highest general reoperation rates (for POP, incontinence, and complications), and a wide range of anatomical outcomes, are reported for VM. Different techniques are available for fixating the transvaginal mesh for apical suspension. Others show better results of VM, depending on which technique was used (for example, the AMS Elevate system; AMS, Minnetonka, MN, USA).

Complications and mesh exposure

The highest complication rate was described for VM (31.6% Clavien–Dindo grade 3). These complications were often associated with mesh exposure, which correlate with the highest exposure rates for the VM technique (8–21%). Mesh exposure reported in the literature ranges from 3.2 to 17% depending on the treated compartment. Although the exposure rate of 21% seems to be exceptionally high compared with other studies, women treated with VM should be informed about the chance of exposure and the use of VM should be considered very well.

Serious adverse events and mesh-related complications should also be taken into account for the LSC. The FDA recently issued a public health notification on the use of mesh in surgery for vaginal prolapse treatment. This, however, concerns the use of vaginal meshes for the treatment of vaginal prolapse, as opposed to abdominal mesh. According to our review, the mesh exposure rate ranged from 0 to 5%, with a maximum follow-up time of 5 years. However, higher exposure rates of 10.5% are reported after ASC. Nevertheless, the follow-up time of this trial was 7 years, which could be an explanation for the lower rate in this review. Although mesh complications need to be taken into account in the decision regarding which treatment is to be performed, the prevalence of these complications is lower in LSC than in VM.

The ASC was the only technique associated with a Clavien–Dindo grade 5 complication. This is very rare, but unacceptable for elective surgery. Therefore, surgeons and patients should be aware of the complexity of this abdominal procedure.

Outcome measures

Initially the primary outcome was surgical failure at the 12 month follow-up. As outcome definitions to evaluate prolapse surgery were improved after the start of this trial, we changed the primary outcome during enrolment and before data analysis into the composite outcome measure of recurrent pelvic organ prolapse stage 2 or higher in the apical compartment (uterus or vaginal vault) with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at the 12 month follow-up. Isala hospital's medical ethical committee approved this change, and during enrolment we published the protocol in an open access online journal.

We evaluated the original primary outcome, overall anatomical failure (pelvic organ prolapse stage 2 or higher in any compartment), as a secondary outcome together with two additional definitions of surgical failure or success. Firstly, a composite outcome of success, defined as no prolapse beyond the hymen, no bothersome bulge symptoms, and no repeat surgery or pessary use for recurrent prolapse within 12 months. Secondly, overall surgical failure: pelvic organ prolapse stage 2 or higher, pessary use, or repeat surgery for recurrent prolapse in any compartment within 12 months. Other secondary outcomes were functional outcome, quality of life, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning.

Uterosacral and cardinal ligament fixation versus uterosacral, cardinal, and round ligament fixation

Cardone et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 377 patients with hysterectomy for benign non-POP indications. However, as 6 patients suffering from carcinoma in situ of the portio were included in the study group, there was an inconsistency in adhering to the inclusion criteria.

A total of 133 patients underwent fixation of the vaginal vault to the uterosacral and cardinal ligament, 244 patient underwent fixation of the vaginal wall to the uterosacral, cardinal, and round ligaments.

During the yearly follow-ups, starting after a minimum of 12 months and continuing up to a maximum of 12 years, 20 patients from the group with uterosacral and cardinal ligament fixation, and 11 patients from the group with additional round ligament fixation developed POP. The authors conclude that an additional fixation of the vaginal cuff to the round ligaments should be considered to further prevent post-hysterectomy prolapse. However, they cautioned against cuff fixation to the round ligament if excessive tension was necessary, as this has been described in previous literature to be painful for patients.

Clinical outcome

a Grade 1: requires no treatment; grade 2: requires drug therapy; grade 3: requires a procedure or intervention; grade 4: IC/ICU organ or system dysfunction; grade 5: death

Grade 2 complications were reported in 6 out of 9 trials and comprised mainly: urinary tract infections (LSC n = 6, VM n = 4, RSC n = 5, SSF n = 5); postoperative fever (ASC n = 4); wound infection (ASC n = 1, RSC n = 2); and pulmonary embolism (ASC n = 2).

The highest grade 3 complication rate was seen after VM (34.2%). Grade 3 complications were reported in all trials and comprised mainly: bladder lesions in 11 cases (ASC n = 2, SSF n = 2, VM n = 3, LSC n = 5, RSC n = 2); bowel lesions in 3 cases (ASC n = 1, LSC n = 1, RSC n = 1); severe bleeding in 22 cases (ASC n = 3, SSF n = 7, LSC n = 1, VM n = 11); and mesh problems in 28 cases (ASC n = 6, LSC n = 1, VM n = 19, RSC n = 2).

### Vaginal hysterectomy: past, present, and future [^116c1fWv]. International Urogynecology Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Vaginal hysterectomy is the oldest and least invasive of the hysterectomy techniques and fulfills the evidence-based requirements as the preferred route of hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease. Currently, vaginal hysterectomy is commonly utilized for treating uterine prolapse, but despite proven safety and effectiveness, the use of vaginal hysterectomy for treating non-prolapse conditions has been and remains underutilized in surgical practice. Improving the use of vaginal hysterectomy in the future will likely depend on addressing the key issues of training and maintaining skills in the technique and increasing awareness of the scientific evidence supporting its use.

### Sacrocolpopexy: the way I do It [^116J2dDh]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Sacrocolpopexy (SCP) is an established surgical procedure for apical vaginal vault prolapse. There remains significant variation amongst surgeons in both the surgical steps and concomitant surgeries utilised when undertaking an SCP.

Methods

This review article is aimed at summarising the evidence and providing a detailed update of SCP in modern practice, reviewing contemporary evidence behind its indications, efficacy, outcomes, surgical steps, and complications.

Results

Sacrocolpopexy remains the gold standard for post-hysterectomy apical prolapse based on good long-term outcomes, patient satisfaction and low complication rates. SCP with concomitant total hysterectomy is not recommended owing to high rates of mesh exposure. The laparoscopic approach remains the preferred option in terms of low morbidity, quicker recovery and lower cost than alternative access options. For optimal outcomes an SCP should be performed with monofilament mesh, using absorbable sutures and with a paravaginal repair for cystocele.

Conclusions

Although SCP has become increasingly utilised for apical prolapse, its established efficacy regarding anatomical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and complications is in the context of post-hysterectomy prolapse. SCP with concomitant total hysterectomy has higher rates of mesh exposure. The efficacy and safety of SCP with sub-total hysterectomy or hysteropexy have not been clearly established and require further assessment through well-designed, rigorous randomised controlled trials.

### Anatomical and functional outcomes after hysterectomy and bilateral sacrospinous ligament fixation for stage IV uterovaginal prolapse: a prospective case series [^1118av7V]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

The surgical treatment of POP stage IV is challenging. Advanced POP is often combined with vaginal wall ulcerations so that the use of synthetic material becomes a risk factor or completely inappropriate. Furthermore, the excessive lengthening of the vagina may impose difficulties in an abdominal approach as the vaginal cuff may reach the fixation point (e.g. promontorium) and lead to unsatisfactory anatomical results. Abdominal hysterectomy and concomitant sacral colpopexy could lead to further increase of the total vaginal length. Abdominal concomitant total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy increases operating time and costs and is associated with more complications.

Another important factor in the conceptualisation of this study is the increasing trend of moving away from the use of synthetic graft material for the treatment of primary POP. After the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released two public health notifications regarding the potential complications of transvaginal POP repair with synthetic mesh in 2008 and 2011, transvaginal surgical meshes showed a substantial decline. In England, the number of SSLFs grew more than 3 times over the years, whereas sacrocolpopexy remained stable during the considered period of time (2005–2016). Furthermore, patients' information through media has increased. According to published data, more than two thirds of patients with POP are informed about their condition and treatment options. In many cases, they reject any treatment, which involves synthetic materials. Hence, there is an emerging need to offer patients with advanced prolapse, who need apical support, efficient treatment options.

Traditionally, SSLF is performed unilaterally, mostly on the right side of the patient. Although it was initially meant as a treatment for post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse, it is now a common procedure performed concomitant to vaginal hysterectomy for uterovaginal prolapse. As treatment of posthysterectomy vault prolapse, Hewson reported a high initial overall satisfaction rate of approximately 90%, and this rate was maintained at 80%, after 4 years. Reports that are more recent show distinctively modest results. Barber et al. in the OPTIMAL randomised trial reported a surgical success rate after SSLF of 60.5%, at 2 years postoperative. Five years postoperative, the estimated surgical failure rate was 70.3% in the SSLF group. The SSLF procedure, performed unilaterally was a modification of the Michigan 4-wall technique.

### The treatment of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nveaE]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Reoperations for POP

The reoperation rate for POP seems to be the lowest after ASC, with a range of 0–3% and the VM with a range of 0–5%. All procedures report low reoperation rates for POP, except for the outlier of 11% for LSC. However, in another trial, the reoperation rate after the LSC is the lowest (0%). The highest general reoperation rates (for POP, incontinence, and complications) are reported for the VM (13–22%) and SSF (5–27%.

Mesh exposure

The reported mesh exposure rate after a sacrocolpopexy is very low, regardless of the introduction technique of fixation material. Mesh exposure after a sacrocolpopexy ranges from 0 to 5%, in contrast to the VM, which seems to be associated with an exposure rate of 8–21% after 1-year follow-up.

Dyspareunia

Most trials did not report any significant difference between the investigated interventions; however, in only 2 trials were the numbers of participants given. The dyspareunia rate varied between 3 and 20%, and ASC and SSF were associated with the highest dyspareunia rates of 20% and 19% respectively.

De novo incontinence

Stress urinary incontinence was most frequently seen after VM (38%) and SSF (33%). However, most trials did not report data on incontinence.

### Surgical management of symptomatic apical pelvic organ prolapse: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143JS38]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically review objective and subjective success and complications of apical suspensions for symptomatic uterine or vaginal vault pelvic organ prolapse (POP).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EMBASE (2002–2019) were searched using multiple terms for apical POP surgeries, including comparative studies in French and English.

Methods Of Study Selection

From 2,665 records, we included randomized controlled trials and comparative studies of interventions with or without hysterectomy, including abdominal apical reconstruction through open, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches and vaginal apical reconstructions. Repairs using transvaginal mesh, off-the-market products, procedures without apical suspension, and follow-up less than 6 months were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Relative risk (RR) was used to estimate the effect of surgical procedure on each outcome. For each outcome and comparison, a meta-analysis was conducted to pool the RRs when possible. Meta-regression and bias tests were performed when appropriate. The GRADE (Grades for Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system for quality rating and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting were used. Sixty-two articles were included in the review (N = 22,792) and 50 studies in the meta-analyses. There was heterogeneity in study quality, techniques used, and outcomes reported. Median follow-up was 1–5 years. Vaginal suspensions showed higher risk of overall and apical anatomic recurrence compared with sacrocolpopexy (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.22–2.74 and RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.33–5.50) (moderate), whereas minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy showed less overall and posterior anatomic recurrence compared with open sacrocolpopexy (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47–0.75 and RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.80, respectively) (low). Different vaginal approaches, and hysterectomy and suspension compared with hysteropexy had similar anatomic success. Subjective POP recurrence, reintervention for POP recurrence and complications were similar between most procedures.

Conclusion

Despite variations in anatomic outcomes, subjective outcomes and complications were similar for apical POP procedures at 1–5 years. Standardization of outcome reporting and comparative studies with longer follow-up are urgently needed.

### Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial [^1153izv5]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

A major strength of this study is its randomised multicentre design and sufficient study population. This is to our best knowledge the first randomised trial to compare uterus preservation with hysterectomy on a large scale using clinically relevant outcome measures.

The study also has some limitations. Firstly, our findings are based on a relatively short follow-up period of 12 months. However, results from registry studies suggest that the highest risk of prolapse surgery after hysterectomy is in the first two postoperative years. Furthermore, not only is long term surgical outcome important but also short term secondary outcomes, such as complication rate and postoperative recovery. The women consented to follow-up for 60 months after surgery, and these data will be further analysed.

After vaginal hysterectomy the ligatures of the uterosacral ligaments were to be sutured to the vaginal vault to aid in long term vaginal support. However, the protocol was ignored in six women and the McCall procedure was performed instead of suspension of the uterosacral ligaments. Both procedures rely on the uterosacral ligaments for support of the vaginal apex but are considered different treatment modalities for suspension of the vaginal vault, which could have led to differences between treatments. As far as we know, strong evidence on the best technique for vault suspension after vaginal hysterectomy is lacking in the literature, and a recent published trial found similar outcomes after suspension of the uterosacral ligaments and sacrospinous fixation for apical prolapse. In the per protocol analysis these women were excluded, but this did not alter the conclusions.

Another limitation might be that residents were allowed to perform sacrospinous hysteropexy or vaginal hysterectomy under direct supervision of a gynaecologist because of their training position. Surgery by residents may have led to variation in procedures. In the hysterectomy group more procedures were performed by residents. No statistically significant difference was found in surgical failure rate in women who underwent surgery by either gynaecologist or resident, but the higher number of procedures performed by residents could have contributed to a longer operation time in the vaginal hysterectomy group. Surgery performed by residents may improve the generalisability of the trial findings as their involvement in treatment of pelvic organ prolapse is common in Dutch urogynaecological practice.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) nonsurgical management with a vaginal pessary — use and selection: Women considering treatment of POP should be offered a vaginal pessary as an alternative to surgery, and a pessary should be considered for a woman with symptomatic POP who wishes to become pregnant in the future; a vaginal pessary is an effective nonsurgical treatment, and up to 92% of women can be fitted successfully. In one study protocol, a ring pessary was inserted first, followed by a Gellhorn pessary if the ring did not stay in place; ring pessaries were used more successfully with stage II (100%) and stage III (71%) prolapse, whereas stage IV prolapse more frequently required Gellhorn pessaries (64%). If possible, women should be taught to change their pessaries independently.

### Small bowel obstruction associated with post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse [^115CX9J6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients may present with post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse in conjunction with small bowel obstruction. Prior pelvic surgery, malignancy, and radiation therapy may be associated with this presentation.

Case

An 83-year-old multiparous woman with a history of poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma was treated with radiation therapy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy. Anterior exenteration was performed for a recurrence. Seventeen years after her last pelvic operation, she had small bowel obstruction that coincided with a worsening post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse. Surgical management included a side-to-side ileoileostomy and excision with closure of the vaginal apex.

Conclusion

Although pelvic organ prolapse primarily affects quality of life, clinicians should be alert for bowel obstruction occurring with post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse.

### Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial [^115wSkqt]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate whether uterus preserving vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy is non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in the surgical treatment of uterine prolapse.

Design Multicentre randomised controlled non-blinded non-inferiority trial.

Setting 4 non-university teaching hospitals, the Netherlands.

Participants 208 healthy women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher requiring surgery and no history of pelvic floor surgery.

Interventions Treatment with sacrospinous hysteropexy or vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an increase in surgical failure rate of 7%.

Main outcome measures Primary outcome was recurrent prolapse stage 2 or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at 12 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical recurrences, including recurrent anterior compartment (bladder) and/or posterior compartment (bowel) prolapse, functional outcome, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning.

Results Sacrospinous hysteropexy was non-inferior for anatomical recurrence of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery (n = 0, 0%) compared with vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments (n = 4, 4.0%, difference −3.9%, 95% confidence interval for difference −8.6% to 0.7%). At 12 months, overall anatomical recurrences, functional outcome, quality of life, complications, hospital stay, measures on postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning did not differ between the two groups. Five serious adverse events were reported during hospital stay. None was considered to be related to the type of surgery.

Conclusions Uterus preservation by sacrospinous hysteropexy was non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments for surgical failure of the apical compartment at 12 months' follow-up.

### Management of recurrent vault prolapse [^113M6msX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

In the ageing female population, recurrent vaginal vault prolapse is a significant healthcare burden. There is limited evidence regarding the optimal management strategy for recurrent vault prolapse. This paper aims to discuss treatment modalities available for recurrent vault prolapse. A literature search and analysis was performed using Medline, PubMed, Cochrane database, current texts and references from relevant articles. We found inconclusive evidence supporting conservative, mechanical and some surgical options for treating recurrent vault prolapse; including iliococcygeal fixation, McCall culdoplasty, and infracoccygeal sacropexy. Sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF), sacrocolpopexy, mesh implants and colpocleisis are shown to have good outcomes in Level II studies. Nevertheless, the first two are associated with haemorrhage, dyspareunia and scarring whilst colpocleisis is limited to selected patients. More well-designed studies are required for recurrent vault prolapse. Current evidence suggests SSLF, and sacrocolpopexy are alternative surgical options to colpocleisis in treating recurrent vault prolapse. Randomised trials are required to determine the efficacy and safety of trocar-guided mesh kits.

### Management of apical compartment prolapse (uterine and vault prolapse): a FIGO working group report [^114BLwSh]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

Apical prolapse includes descent of the uterus, vagina cuff, or rarely solely of the cervix. It is estimated that women have an 11–19% life-time risk of undergoing surgery for POP. This rate is projected to increase over the next 2–3 decades. In this FIGO working group report we address the conservative and surgical treatment options for apical prolapse.

Methods

The FIGO working group "Pelvic Floor Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery" describes the different treatments for apical prolapse based on the literature evidence, the cost-effectiveness, the degree of difficulty and summed them up with an experts recommendation.

Results

Among the conservative treatment options, pessaries are the most successful options since centuries with a low complication rate and low costs. Among the vaginal operative procedures the sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) and the uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) show comparable outcomes and efficacy with a different, however, rather low complication pattern and a favorable cost-benefit profile. Sacrocolpopexy, independent on the open abdominal, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted laparoscopic technique has a good durability and quality of life performance. The minimal invasive techniques are as effective as the open abdominal techniques and there is no difference in mesh exposure.

Conclusion

Vaginal procedures are well described procedures with favorable outcomes and cost-benefit profiles. Sacral colpopexy has a high-effectivity; data on the route of performance and long-term outcome are awaited. The cost with mesh implants are higher compared to the operations with autologous tissue or any conservative treatment and further studies are recommended to evaluate the cure rates in the span of decades and the possible long-term mesh complications.

### Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: observational follow-up of a multicentre randomised trial [^116cmZTR]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

Details of the trial protocol have been published previously. All women gave written informed consent before randomisation.

In the original trial, women with uterine prolapse at stage 2 (uterine prolapse 1 cm above or beyond the hymen, according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system) or higher were randomly assigned to sacrospinous hysteropexy or vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in a non-blinded multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. Concomitant repair of anterior or posterior vaginal prolapse (colporrhaphy) was allowed, as was anti-incontinence surgery. We excluded women with previous pelvic floor or prolapse surgery, known malignancy, an abnormal cervical smear test result, a wish to preserve fertility, language barriers, immunological or haematological disorders interfering with recovery after surgery, abnormal ultrasound findings of the uterus or ovaries, and abnormal uterine bleeding. The women were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a web based application with computer generated randomisation tables in blocks of four, stratified by hospital and stage of uterine prolapse. The trial was non-blinded as it was impossible to blind surgeons and women to the allocated surgical procedure. An independent doctor or specialist nurse not involved in treatment carried out the follow-up visits.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome of the original SAVE U study was surgical failure of the apical compartment, defined as a recurrent prolapse stage 2 or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by the POP-Q system in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse after 12 months follow-up. This outcome was also used as the primary outcome after five years. The predefined secondary outcomes at five year follow-up included overall anatomical failure (pelvic organ prolapse stage 2 or higher in any compartment), a composite outcome of success (defined as no prolapse beyond the hymen, no bothersome bulge symptoms, and no repeat surgery or pessary use for recurrent prolapse), functional outcome, quality of life, repeat surgery, and sexual functioning.

### Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial [^115HLD9W]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether uterus preserving vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy is non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in the surgical treatment of uterine prolapse.

Design

Multicentre randomised controlled non-blinded non-inferiority trial.

Setting

4 non-university teaching hospitals, the Netherlands.

Participants

208 healthy women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher requiring surgery and no history of pelvic floor surgery.

Interventions

Treatment with sacrospinous hysteropexy or vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an increase in surgical failure rate of 7%.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was recurrent prolapse stage 2 or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at 12 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical recurrences, including recurrent anterior compartment (bladder) and/or posterior compartment (bowel) prolapse, functional outcome, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning.

Results

Sacrospinous hysteropexy was non-inferior for anatomical recurrence of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery (n = 0, 0%) compared with vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments (n = 4, 4.0%, difference -3.9%, 95% confidence interval for difference -8.6% to 0.7%). At 12 months, overall anatomical recurrences, functional outcome, quality of life, complications, hospital stay, measures on postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning did not differ between the two groups. Five serious adverse events were reported during hospital stay. None was considered to be related to the type of surgery.

Conclusions

Uterus preservation by sacrospinous hysteropexy was non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments for surgical failure of the apical compartment at 12 months' follow-up.

### Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: observational follow-up of a multicentre randomised trial [^112QqTsS]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and success of uterus preserving sacrospinous hysteropexy as an alternative to vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension in the surgical treatment of uterine prolapse five years after surgery.

Design

Observational follow-up of SAVE U (sacrospinous fixation versus vaginal hysterectomy in treatment of uterine prolapse ≥ 2) randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Four non-university teaching hospitals, the Netherlands.

Participants

204 of 208 healthy women in the initial trial (2009–12) with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher requiring surgery and no history of pelvic floor surgery who had been randomised to sacrospinous hysteropexy or vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension. The women were followed annually for five years after surgery. This extended trial reports the results at five years.

Main outcome measures

Prespecified primary outcome evaluated at five year follow-up was recurrent prolapse of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) stage 2 or higher evaluated by pelvic organ prolapse quantification system in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical failure (recurrent prolapse stage 2 or higher in apical, anterior, or posterior compartment), composite outcome of success (defined as no prolapse beyond the hymen, no bothersome bulge symptoms, and no repeat surgery or pessary use for recurrent prolapse), functional outcome, quality of life, repeat surgery, and sexual functioning.

Results

At five years, surgical failure of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery occurred in one woman (1%) after sacrospinous hysteropexy compared with eight women (7.8%) after vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension (difference−6.7%, 95% confidence interval −12.8% to−0.7%). A statistically significant difference was found in composite outcome of success between sacrospinous hysteropexy and vaginal hysterectomy (89/102 (87%) v 77/102 (76%). The other secondary outcomes did not differ. Time-to-event analysis at five years showed no differences between the interventions.

Conclusions

At five year follow-up significantly less anatomical recurrences of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery were found after sacrospinous hysteropexy compared with vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension. After hysteropexy a higher proportion of women had a composite outcome of success. Time-to-event analysis showed no differences in outcomes between the procedures.

### Pelvic organ prolapse: ACOG practice bulletin, number 214 [^116LE4pf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse — The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B): Many women with POP on physical examination do not report symptoms of POP, and treatment is indicated only if prolapse is causing bothersome bulge and pressure symptoms, sexual dysfunction, lower urinary tract dysfunction, or defecatory dysfunction. Women considering treatment of POP should be offered a vaginal pessary as an alternative to surgery, and vaginal apex suspension should be performed at the time of hysterectomy for uterine prolapse to reduce the risk of recurrent POP. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with synthetic mesh has a lower risk of recurrent POP but is associated with more complications than vaginal apex repair with native tissue. Obliterative procedures — which narrow, shorten, or completely close the vagina — are effective for the treatment of POP and should be considered a first-line surgical treatment for women with significant medical comorbidities who do not desire future vaginal intercourse or vaginal preservation. The use of synthetic mesh or biologic grafts in POP surgery is associated with unique complications not seen in POP repair with native tissue. Hysterectomy is a viable alternative to hysteropexy in women with uterine prolapse, although there is less available evidence on safety and efficacy compared with hysteropexy.

### Surgical anatomy of the vaginal vault [^116DyRfQ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Vaginal vault (VV) surgery should be a key part of surgery for a majority of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The surgical anatomy of the VV, the upper most part of the vagina, has not been recently subject to a dedicated examination and description.

Methods

Cadaver studies were performed in (i) 10 unembalmed cadaveric pelves (observation); (ii) 2 unembalmed cadaveric pelves (dissection); (iii) 5 formalinized hemipelves (dissection). The structural outline and ligamentous supports of the VV were determined. Further confirmation of observations in post-hysterectomy patients were from a separate study on 300 consecutive POP repairs, 46% of whom had undergone prior hysterectomy.

Results

The VV is equivalent to the Level I section of the vagina, measured posteriorly from the top of the posterior vaginal wall (apex or highest part of the vagina) to 2.5cm below this point. It comprises the anterior fornix (through which cervix protrudes or is removed at hysterectomy), posterior fornix and two lateral fornices. Before hysterectomy, the posterior aspects of the cervix and upper vagina are supported by the uterosacral (USL) and cardinal ligaments (CL), the distal segments of which fuse together to form a cardinal-uterosacral ligament complex (cardinal utero-sacral complex), around 2-3cm long. Post---hysterectomy, there is some residual USL support to the anterior fornix but the posterior fornix has no ligamentous support and is thus more vulnerable to prolapse.

Conclusion

Effective management of VV prolapse will need to be part of most POP repairs. Enhanced understanding of the surgical anatomy of the vaginal vault allows more effective planning of those POP surgeries.

### Pelvic organ prolapse: ACOG practice bulletin, number 214 [^115yxY44]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse — hysteropexy versus hysterectomy comparative outcomes show mixed evidence, with one study favoring hysterectomy for recurrence and a randomized trial showing noninferiority of sacrospinous hysteropexy. Hysteropexy is a viable alternative to hysterectomy in women with uterine prolapse, although there is less available evidence on safety and efficacy compared with hysterectomy; outcome data comparing hysterectomy with hysteropexy are not clear, and in one study, vaginal hysterectomy for stage II or greater POP was associated with a lower risk of recurrent prolapse than hysteropexy. In a randomized trial for stage 2 or greater POP, sacrospinous hysteropexy was found to be noninferior to vaginal hysterectomy for anatomic recurrence or repeat surgery, with sacrospinous hysteropexy 0% (n = 0) versus vaginal hysterectomy 4.0% (n = 4), a difference of −3.9% (95% CI, −8.6% to 0.79%) over 12 months; a 2016 cohort study comparing laparoscopic sacral hysteropexy with vaginal mesh hysteropexy found that, at 1-year follow-up, the two procedures had similar efficacy and no significant differences in complications, blood loss, or length of hospitalization.

### A randomised controlled trial of abdominal versus laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for the treatment of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse: LAS study [^112HLWv8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This prospective multi-centre true two-sided equivalence trial was designed to test the clinical equivalence of open (ASCP) and laparoscopic (LSCP) sacrocolpopexy using objective and subjective outcomes

Methods

The study was carried out in three urogynaecology units in England, UK and the patient population consisted of women referred with symptomatic and bothersome post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at least 1 cm above or beyond the hymeneal remnants. The interventions were either abdominal or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy following randomisation to one of the types of surgery.

Results

For the primary outcome (point C on the POP-Q) the results at 1 year were -6.63 cm for the open ASCP and -6.67 cm for the LSCP respectively. Subjective outcomes at 1 year showed that 90% of the ASCP group and 80% of the LSCP group were "much better". There were improvements with regard to blood loss, haemoglobin and shorter length of stay in the LSCP group compared with the ASCP group.

Conclusion

This fully powered randomised controlled trial comparing open and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy has shown clinical equivalence.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^113cV1Wv]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is downward descent of female pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus or post-hysterectomy vaginal cuff, and the small or large bowel, resulting in protrusion of the vagina, uterus, or both. Prolapse development is multifactorial, with vaginal child birth, advancing age, and increasing body-mass index as the most consistent risk factors. Vaginal delivery, hysterectomy, chronic straining, normal ageing, and abnormalities of connective tissue or connective-tissue repair predispose some women to disruption, stretching, or dysfunction of the levator ani complex, connective-tissue attachments of the vagina, or both, resulting in prolapse. Patients generally present with several complaints, including bladder, bowel, and pelvic symptoms; however, with the exception of vaginal bulging, none is specific to prolapse. Women with symptoms suggestive of prolapse should undergo a pelvic examination and medical history check. Radiographic assessment is usually unnecessary. Many women with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic and do not need treatment. When prolapse is symptomatic, options include observation, pessary use, and surgery. Surgical strategies for prolapse can be categorised broadly by reconstructive and obliterative techniques. Reconstructive procedures can be done by either an abdominal or vaginal approach. Although no effective prevention strategy for prolapse has been identified, considerations include weight loss, reduction of heavy lifting, treatment of constipation, modification or reduction of obstetric risk factors, and pelvic-floor physical therapy.

### Transvaginal iliococcygeus fixation for posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse repair [^111WW4pM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse repair is a surgical challenge. Successful surgical management using native tissue can be achieved via the vaginal approach by iliococcygeus fascia fixation. However, although iliococcygeus fascia fixation is technically simple and has a low morbidity, it is not commonly performed. The aim of the video is to provide anatomic views and the surgical steps necessary to achieve successful transvaginal iliococcygeus fascia fixation for vaginal vault prolapse repair.

Methods

A 60-year-old woman with symptomatic stage III vaginal vault prolapse was admitted for transvaginal iliococcygeus fascia fixation according to the described technique.

Results

Surgery was successful without complications. The final examination showed good apical support and preservation of vaginal length. This step-by-step video tutorial may be an important tool to improve practical surgical knowledge. In particular, proper suture positioning requires adequate pararectal space preparation and levator ani exposure, as shown in the video.

Conclusions

Transvaginal iliococcygeus fascia fixation is an alternative technique for apical support without the use of synthetic prosthetic materials. This technique may be indicated when an abdominal approach or a synthetic device is not recommended.

### A survey of prolapse practice in UK women's health physiotherapists: what has changed in the last decade? [^112MHN27]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Recent research provides evidence of the beneficial effects of PFMT on prolapse, and almost half of respondents had changed their practice as a result. The introduction into practice of a wider variety of treatments such as group PFMT and pessaries was also evident, as was the combination of PFMT with a pessary.

Pelvic floor muscle strength was still the most commonly used measure of treatment progress. It was encouraging that 18% of respondents were using the POP-Q, as the reliability of physiotherapists using the POP-Q has recently been demonstrated to be good, and the availability of such data is useful for multidisciplinary discussion. A survey of gynaecologists and urogynaecologists, who may be more established in their use of the POP-Q, found that 40% used the POP-Q in routine clinical practice.

There was considerable use of validated symptom measures, in particular the POP-SS and the ICIQ Vaginal Symptoms Score. Such symptom outcome measures are valuable as symptoms are the main driver for women seeking treatment.

Respondents using guidelines named the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) guidelines. NICE propose care pathways for urinary incontinence in women, advise pelvic floor exercises in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, and offer guidelines on surgical mesh repair in the treatment of prolapse. However, there are no care pathways, clinical guidelines or referral guidelines specific to prolapse. RCOG offer only guidelines on "post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse", which state that the role of conservative measures in treatment, including pelvic floor exercise, is "unclear". The CSP offers no guidelines of its own, but recommends using those produced by NICE. Although not mentioned by respondents, the International Consultation on Incontinence textbook, which synthesises the evidence on incontinence and other pelvic floor problems, provides a treatment pathway for prolapse that includes a recommendation for PFMT before surgical intervention. The need for clear, accessible guidelines and care pathways is apparent and will become increasingly important in avoiding large variations in local practice primarily determined by the practitioners' individual experience.

For anterior vaginal repair (anterior colporrhaphy), the aim is "To correct anterior wall prolapse", and it "May be used for the treatment of prolapse of the bladder or urethra". For posterior vaginal repair (posterior colporrhaphy) and perineorrhaphy, the aim is "To correct posterior wall prolapse", and it "May be used for the treatment of rectocele… defects of the perineum, or both". For vaginal repair with synthetic mesh or biologic graft augmentation, the aim is "To correct anterior wall prolapse, apical vaginal prolapse, or both", and "Depending on the specific defect, the mesh augmentation can either be anterior, apical, or both. This repair is not routinely recommended".

### Surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse in women [^114NV4vy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse may occur in up to 50% of parous women. A variety of urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms may be associated with the prolapse.

Objectives

To determine the effects of the many different surgeries used in the management of pelvic organ prolapse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, healthcare-related bibliographic databases, handsearched conference proceedings (searched 20 August 2012), and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that included surgical operations for pelvic organ prolapse.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were assessed and data extracted independently by two review authors. Six investigators were contacted for additional information with five responding.

Main Results

Fifty-six randomised controlled trials were identified evaluating 5954 women. For upper vaginal prolapse (uterine or vault) abdominal sacral colpopexy was associated with a lower rate of recurrent vault prolapse on examination and painful intercourse than with vaginal sacrospinous colpopexy. These benefits must be balanced against a longer operating time, longer time to return to activities of daily living and increased cost of the abdominal approach. In single studies the sacral colpopexy had a higher success rate on examination and lower reoperation rate than high vaginal uterosacral suspension and transvaginal polypropylene mesh. Twenty-one trials compared a variety of surgical procedures for anterior compartment prolapse (cystocele). Ten compared native tissue repair with graft (absorbable and permanent mesh, biological grafts) repair for anterior compartment prolapse. Native tissue anterior repair was associated with more recurrent anterior compartment prolapse than when supplemented with a polyglactin (absorbable) mesh inlay (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.90) or porcine dermis mesh inlay (RR 2.08, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.01), however there was no difference in post-operative awareness of prolapse after absorbable mesh (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.81) or a biological graft (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.30). Data on morbidity and other clinical outcomes were lacking. Standard anterior repair was associated with more anterior compartment prolapse on examination than for any polypropylene (permanent) mesh repair (RR 3.15, 95% CI 2.50 to 3.96). Awareness of prolapse was also higher after the anterior repair as compared to polypropylene mesh repair (28% versus 18%, RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.07). However, the reoperation rate for prolapse was similar at 14/459 (3%) after the native tissue repair compared to 6/470 (1.3%) (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.93 to 5.10) after the anterior polypropylene mesh repair and no differences in quality of life data or de novo dyspareunia were identified. Blood loss (MD 64 ml, 95% CI 48 to 81), operating time (MD 19 min, 95% CI 16 to 21), recurrences in apical or posterior compartment (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4) and de novo stress urinary incontinence (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.1) were significantly higher with transobturator meshes than for native tissue anterior repair. Mesh erosions were reported in 11.4% (64/563), with surgical interventions being performed in 6.8% (32/470). Data from three trials compared native tissue repairs with a variety of total, anterior, or posterior polypropylene kit meshes for vaginal prolapse in multiple compartments. While no difference in awareness of prolapse was able to be identified between the groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.7) the recurrence rate on examination was higher in the native tissue repair group compared to the transvaginal polypropylene mesh group (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.1). The mesh erosion rate was 35/194 (18%), and 18/194 (9%) underwent surgical correction for mesh erosion. The reoperation rate after transvaginal polypropylene mesh repair of 22/194 (11%) was higher than after the native tissue repair (7/189, 3.7%) (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 7.3). Data from three trials compared posterior vaginal repair and transanal repair for the treatment of posterior compartment prolapse (rectocele). The posterior vaginal repair had fewer recurrent prolapse symptoms (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0) and lower recurrence on examination (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) and on defecography (MD -1.2 cm, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.3). Sixteen trials included significant data on bladder outcomes following a variety of prolapse surgeries. Women undergoing prolapse surgery may have benefited from having continence surgery performed concomitantly, especially if they had stress urinary incontinence (RR 7.4, 95% CI 4.0 to 14) or if they were continent and had occult stress urinary incontinence demonstrated pre-operatively (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 6.6). Following prolapse surgery, 12% of women developed de novo symptoms of bladder overactivity and 9% de novo voiding dysfunction.

Authors' Conclusions

Sacral colpopexy has superior outcomes to a variety of vaginal procedures including sacrospinous colpopexy, uterosacral colpopexy and transvaginal mesh. These benefits must be balanced against a longer operating time, longer time to return to activities of daily living, and increased cost of the abdominal approach. The use of mesh or graft inlays at the time of anterior vaginal wall repair reduces the risk of recurrent anterior wall prolapse on examination. Anterior vaginal polypropylene mesh also reduces awareness of prolapse, however these benefits must be weighted against increased operating time, blood loss, rate of apical or posterior compartment prolapse, de novo stress urinary incontinence, and reoperation rate for mesh exposures associated with the use of polypropylene mesh. Posterior vaginal wall repair may be better than transanal repair in the management of rectocele in terms of recurrence of prolapse. The evidence is not supportive of any grafts at the time of posterior vaginal repair. Adequately powered randomised, controlled clinical trials with blinding of assessors are urgently needed on a wide variety of issues, and they particularly need to include women's perceptions of prolapse symptoms. Following the withdrawal of some commercial transvaginal mesh kits from the market, the generalisability of the findings, especially relating to anterior compartment transvaginal mesh, should be interpreted with caution.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery — indications and approach selection: Surgery is indicated for the treatment of POP in women who are bothered by their POP and have failed or declined nonsurgical treatments. There are various vaginal and abdominal surgical approaches, and important considerations for deciding the type and route include the location and severity of prolapse, symptom nature (eg, urinary, bowel, or sexual dysfunction), the patient's general health, patient preference, and the surgeon's expertise.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) staging — maximal extent relative to the hymen — is defined as follows: Stage 0: No prolapse; anterior and posterior points are all −3 cm, and C or D is between −TVL and − (TVL − 2) cm. Stage I: The criteria for stage 0 are not met, and the most distal prolapse is more than 1 cm above the level of the hymen (less than −1 cm). Stage II: The most distal prolapse is between 1 cm above and 1 cm below the hymen (at least one point is −1, 0, or +1). Stage III: The most distal prolapse is more than 1 cm below the hymen but no further than 2 cm less than TVL. Stage IV: Represents complete procidentia or vault eversion; the most distal prolapse protrudes to at least (TVL − 2) cm. Stages are based on the maximal extent of prolapse relative to the hymen, in one or more compartments.

POP-Q Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification

At 12 months, in the vaginal group, none of the participants required treatment for recurrent prolapse, whereas in the laparoscopic group 15 (34%) required retreatment (p < 0.001) for recurrent bothersome POP. Of these, 11 women (25%) underwent pessary placement and 4 (9% opted for repeat pelvic reconstructive surgery.

Binomial logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of age, BMI, menopausal status, preoperative apical stage and the type of procedure on the likelihood that participants had any prolapse > 0 and the likelihood of symptomatic prolapse at 12 months. Only the laparoscopic procedure showed an association with recurrent prolapse beyond the hymen and symptomatic prolapse.

### Laparoscopic management of pelvic organ prolapse recurrence after open sacrocervicopexy [^112w3CX7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

In this narrated video we present a case of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) recurrence 12 years after sacrocervicopexy, outline our management and suggest an optimal laparoscopic surgical technique that may reduce the risk of future recurrence. A 71-year-old patient, who had undergone an open sub-total hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy 12 years previously, complained of a bulging sensation in her vagina, of 12 months' duration. On physical examination, a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) stage III prolapse was diagnosed, with marked apical, anterior and posterior compartment prolapse. On laparoscopy we identified the old mesh attached to the promontory and to the vaginal apex, without any fixation of the vaginal walls. Complete mesh excision was performed, followed by vaginal dissection to facilitate implantation of two new meshes and performing a new sacrocolpopexy. No postoperative complications occurred. Over 6 weeks of post-operative follow-up, there was no pelvic pain, dysuria or dyschezia. A good anatomical result was noted without any prolapse. Laparoscopy appears to be an effective approach to complete mesh excision. For the treatment of prolapse recurrence, complete excision of the old mesh with new pelvic mesh-augmented reconstruction is recommended. Thorough dissection of the vesico-vaginal and recto-vaginal spaces followed by mesh fixation to the relevant vaginal walls may reduce recurrence.

Uterovaginal prolapse

The second question assessed trends in the surgical management of second degree uterine prolapse in conjunction with AWP. In women with UVP, 75% of respondents would still perform vaginal hysterectomy combined with vaginal wall repair as the procedure of choice, but this was not a significant change from the previous surveys. The proportion of respondents who would perform a sacrohysteropexy (SHP) was 10%. The method of choice for vault support during a vaginal hysterectomy had shifted from attaching the uterosacral ligaments to the vault to a McCall culdoplasty. In the current survey, 37% of respondents would operate in women whose family was incomplete compared with 35% in 2011 and 26% in 2006, and the procedure of choice was still SHP. These results are shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Question 2: Uterovaginal wall prolapse (stage II)

a Sacrohysteropexy 10%, sacrospinous hysteropexy 8%, subtotal hysterectomy and sacrocervicopexy 4%, Manchester repair 2%, other 1%

Of all respondents, 55% would perform SHP, and of those performing the procedure, 62% would offer it routinely. All respondents offering SHP as a primary procedure for prolapse would perform the procedure laparoscopically. For 67% of respondents the method of choice was the wrap-around technique through the broad ligament and anchored to the cervix anteriorly, and for the remaining 33% the method of choice anchoring the mesh posteriorly to the cervix and upper vagina.

Comparing surgical practice in the management of UVP, similar proportions of respondents in the three groups would perform preoperative urodynamics (group A 13%, group B 36%, group C 9%). Similar proportions of respondents would perform vaginal hysterectomy and repair as the procedure of choice (group A 73%, group B 76%, group C 46%). Similar proportions of respondents would also perform McCall culdoplasty as the procedure of choice for supporting the vault (group A 31%, group B 24%, group C 18%). Uterus-preserving surgery was the procedure of choice in 16%, 18% and 36% of group A, B and C respondents, respectively, and SHP was the procedure of choice in 15%, 5% and 36% of respondents, respectively.

### The effectiveness of surgical procedures to prevent post-hysterectomy pelvic organ prolapse: a systematic review of the literature [^113mFY8w]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Cruikshank method

In another study, Cruikshank carried out a prospective uncontrolled case series performing vaginal hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions in 112 consecutive patients. To prevent subsequent vaginal vault prolapse and enterocele, the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments were sutured to the lateral angles of the vagina. Then, the peritoneum was closed, incorporating the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, as well as the anterior rectal serosa, into the running purse string suture. Nineteen out of 112 patients initially presented with what the authors described as "symptomatic pelvic relaxation" and in these cases the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments were shortened in addition to being sutured to the vaginal apex.

During the follow-up period of 7 to 42 months, none of the patients presented with evidence for post-hysterectomy vaginal prolapse or enterocele. The author concluded that, although a longer follow-up period would be necessary, this additional procedure was promising in preventing the formation of enterocele after hysterectomy.

Fixation of the vaginal apex to the cervical versus the intermediate portion of the uterosacral ligaments

Gizzo et al. conducted a cohort study with 42 women undergoing hysterectomy either using LigaSure™ (group A, n = 21) or a clamp technique (group B, n = 21).

Group A was further subdivided into subgroup A1, with 10 patients undergoing a suspension of the vagina to the cervical (more distal) portion of the uterosacral ligament, and subgroup A2, with 11 patients undergoing a suspension of the vagina to the intermediate (more cranial) portion of the uterosacral ligament. The description of the surgical procedure in group B mentions the "incorporation of the uterosacral–cardinal complex".

After 6 months of follow-ups, 4 participants from subgroup A1 developed vaginal vault prolapse compared with none from subgroup A2, and none from group B. The authors attributed these prolapses to thermal damage of the uterosacral ligament and hypothesized that suspension of the vagina to the uterosacral ligament further away from the coagulation site might yield better results.

### Evidence basis for hysterectomy [^113QDqeS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although vaginal hysterectomy has long been championed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as the preferred mode of uterine removal, nationwide vaginal hysterectomy utilization has steadily declined. This article reviews the evidence comparing vaginal with other modes of hysterectomy and highlights areas of ongoing controversy regarding contraindications to vaginal surgery, risk of subsequent prolapse development, and impacts of changing hysterectomy trends on resident education.

### Maintaining the apex: a novel technique for vault suspension during vaginal hysterectomy [^111WwaWf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Post-hysterectomy vault prolapse poses significant challenges to patients and surgeons alike. Despite numerous surgical interventions during initial vaginal hysterectomy to counteract this, a comparative analysis of their efficacy is limited. This study introduces a pioneering technique intended to avert vault prolapse during vaginal hysterectomy by harmoniously merging level 1 and level 2 support.

Methods

After obtaining informed consent, we recorded a variation of the McCall technique performed during vaginal hysterectomy and anterior repair. Patient follow-ups were conducted up to 6 months post-operation to evaluate anatomical outcomes and quality of life.

Results

A total of 46 women underwent the surgery. Anatomical evaluations at the 6-month mark were commendable, with no recurrence instances. Quality-of-life assessments, using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12 (PISQ-12), showcased substantial improvement.

Conclusion

Our novel approach to vault suspension provides an uncomplicated, easily impartible, surgical procedure utilizing standard sutures. We believe that this approach is both enduring and safe.

### Sacrocolpopexy: the way I do It [^116f4L9v]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 11 trials assessing mesh exposure risk at SCP, the risk of vaginal mesh exposure was significantly increased if a total hysterectomy was concomitantly performed (8.6%) to 2.2% (p < 0.05), and if the SCP was done for a post-hysterectomy prolapse. More recently, Matthews et al. followed up 182 previously randomised patients who underwent a laparoscopic or robotic SCP with a concomitant total hysterectomy. The mean post-operative follow-up time was 3.9 years, and the mesh exposure rate was 7.7%. This mesh exposure rate is significantly higher than what has been established for SCP for vault prolapse. Thus, the evidence establishes higher rates of mesh exposure associated with SCP and concomitant total hysterectomy. This is thought to be secondary to increased devascularisation of vaginal tissue (from the hysterectomy) causing tissue necrosis and eventually higher rates of mesh exposure. Vaginal mesh exposure following SCP can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and be particularly difficult to manage compared with vaginal mesh exposure following vaginal interventions. Considering that mesh exposure rates are significantly increased when SCP is performed concomitantly with a total hysterectomy (compared with SCP for vault prolapse) the ICI has concluded that hysterectomy at the time of SCP should not be considered. The issue is further complicated by the medico-legal intricacies associated with the use of pelvic mesh in modern urogynaecological practice. These risks need to be carefully explained to patients and close post-operative follow-up put in place.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^111T5SJx]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the anterior vaginal wall, posterior vaginal wall, the uterus (cervix), or the apex of the vagina (vaginal vault or cuff scar after hysterectomy). Prevalence increases with age. The cause of prolapse is multifactorial but is primarily associated with pregnancy and vaginal delivery, which lead to direct pelvic floor muscle and connective tissue injury. Hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, and conditions associated with sustained episodes of increased intra-abdominal pressure, including obesity, chronic cough, constipation, and repeated heavy lifting, also contribute to prolapse. Most patients with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic. Symptoms become more bothersome as the bulge protrudes past the vaginal opening. Initial evaluation includes a history and systematic pelvic examination including assessment for urinary incontinence, bladder outlet obstruction, and fecal incontinence. Treatment options include observation, vaginal pessaries, and surgery. Most women can be successfully fit with a vaginal pessary. Available surgical options are reconstructive pelvic surgery with or without mesh augmentation and obliterative surgery.

Methods

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University Hospital of Tübingen (Ethikkommission Universitätskliikum Tübingen) (ref. number: 130/2017BO2) and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 02998216).

This prospective interventional pilot, single centre, non-randomized study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Tübingen in the period from March 2017 to March 2018. All women suffering from symptomatic uterovaginal POP stage IV (Fig. 1), according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system, were included in the study.

Fig. 1
Pelvic organ prolapse stage IV according to POP-Q system

Exclusion criteria were previous POP or incontinence surgeries, age < 18 and > 75 years, participation in other clinical trials, active malignant disease and inability to understand the purpose of the study and sign the informed consent. The exclusion of women over 75 was made on the basis of recruiting a homogenous group of women who would profit from the procedure and would not require or prefer an obliterative procedure for the correction of their prolapse. We also had to provide an upper cut-off age in our inclusion criteria for anesthesiological reasons, to avoid including fragile and multi-morbid patients.

The primary outcome measure was the improvement of the pelvic floor symptoms and the secondary outcome measure was the anatomical correction of prolapse.

Pelvic floor symptoms were assessed using the self-administered, validated German version of the Australian female pelvic floor questionnaire. Questions are grouped according to the physiological functions of the pelvic floor, i.e. bladder function, bowel function, prolapse symptoms, and sexual function domains. The scores are then calculated on a 0 to 10 scale on each domain, ranging from less to most severe and giving a potential final overall score of maximum 40. Patients were asked to answer the female pelvic floor questionnaire before, as well as 6 and 12 months after surgery. Additionally, a complete staging using the POP-Q system was performed using a standard measurement tape and patients' health condition was measured on 5-point Likert scales (1 = much worse, 5 = much better). The POP-Q quantification was not performed by the surgeon, in order to avoid bias. Epidemiological data, such as age, parity, comorbidities and medication, as well as duration of surgery, intra- and postoperative complications were recorded.

### Epidemiology and outcome assessment of pelvic organ prolapse [^1164aePR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The aim was to determine the incidence and prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse surgery and describe how outcomes are reported.

Methods

Every 4 years and as part of the Fifth International Collaboration on Incontinence we reviewed the English-language scientific literature after searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library and Cochrane database of systematic reviews, published up to January 2012. Publications were classified as level 1 evidence (randomised controlled trials [RCT] or systematic reviews, level 2 (poor quality RCT, prospective cohort studies), level 3 (case series or retrospective studies) and level 4 (case reports). The highest level of evidence was utilised by the committee to make evidence-based recommendations based upon the Oxford grading system. A grade A recommendation usually depends on consistent level 1 evidence. A grade B recommendation usually depends on consistent level 2 and/or 3 studies, or "majority evidence" from RCTs. A grade C recommendation usually depends on level 4 studies or "majority evidence" from level 2/3 studies or Delphi processed expert opinion. A grade D "no recommendation possible" would be used where the evidence is inadequate or conflicting and when expert opinion is delivered without a formal analytical process, such as by Delphi.

Results

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) when defined by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6% and up to 50% when based upon vaginal examination. Surgery for prolapse is performed twice as commonly as continence surgery and prevalence varies widely from 6 to 18%. The incidence of POP surgery ranges from 1.5 to 1.8 per 1,000 women years and peaks in women aged 60–69. When reporting outcomes of the surgical management of prolapse, authors should include a variety of standardised anatomical and functional outcomes. Anatomical outcomes reported should include all POP-Q points and staging, utilising a traditional definition of success with the hymen as the threshold for success. Assessment should be prospective and assessors blinded as to the surgical intervention performed if possible and without any conflict of interest related to the assessment undertaken (grade C). Subjective success postoperatively should be defined as the absence of a vaginal bulge (grade C). Functional outcomes are best reported using valid, reliable and responsive symptom questionnaires and condition-specific HRQOL instruments (grade C). Sexual function is best reported utilising validated condition-specific HRQOL that assess sexual function or validated sexual function questionnaires such as the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ) or the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The sexual activity status of all study participants should be reported pre- and postoperatively under the following categories: sexually active without pain, sexually active with pain or not sexually active (grade C). Prolapse surgery should be defined as primary surgery, and repeat surgery sub-classified as primary surgery different site, repeat surgery, complications related to surgery and surgery for non-prolapse-related conditions (grade C).

Conclusion

Significant variation exists in the prevalence and incidence of pelvic organ prolapse surgery and how the outcomes are reported. Much of the variation may be improved by standardisation of definitions and outcomes of reporting on pelvic organ prolapse surgery.

### Surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse in women: the updated summary version cochrane review [^1166P3mp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

A previous version of the Cochrane review for prolapse surgery in 2008 provided two conclusions: abdominal sacrocolpopexy had lower recurrent vault prolapse rates than sacrospinous colpopexy but this was balanced against a longer time to return to activities of daily life. An additional continence procedure at the time of prolapse surgery might be beneficial in reducing post-operative stress urinary incontinence; however, this was weighed against potential adverse effects. The aim of this review is to provide an updated summary version of the current Cochrane review on the surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register and reference lists of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials on surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. Trials were assessed independently by two reviewers.

Results

We identified 40 trials including 18 new and three updates. There were no additional studies on surgery for posterior prolapse. Native tissue anterior repair was associated with more anterior compartment failures than polypropylene mesh repair as an overlay (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.23–3.74) or armed transobturator mesh (RR 3.55, 95% CI 2.29–5.51). There were no differences in subjective outcomes, quality of life data, de novo dyspareunia, stress urinary incontinence, reoperation rates for prolapse or incontinence, although some of these data were limited. Mesh erosions were reported in 10% (30/293). Including new studies on the impact of continence surgery at the time of prolapse surgery, meta-analysis revealed that concurrent continence surgery did not significantly reduce the rate of post-operative stress urinary incontinence (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.53–3.70; random-effects model).

Conclusion

The inclusion of new randomised controlled trials showed that the use of mesh at the time of anterior vaginal wall repair reduced the risk of recurrent anterior vaginal wall prolapse on examination. However, this was not translated into improved functional or quality of life outcomes. The value of a continence procedure in addition to a prolapse operation in women who are continent pre-operatively remains uncertain. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed and should particularly include women's perceptions of prolapse symptoms and functional outcome.

### Pelvic organ prolapse after laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with vaginal hysterectomy: the POP-UP study [^114y6T3T]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Combining questionnaire with POP-Q results

In the total POP-Q population, 27 women (11%) had a symptomatic prolapse (defined as bulging plus any ≥ stage 2 prolapse) post-hysterectomy after a median follow-up of 16 years. The results per group are displayed in Table 3.

Thirty percent of our population (n = 74) fulfilled the composite outcome (Barber criteria: prolapse beyond the hymen, and/or bulging, and/or a history of POP surgery): 16% of the LH group (n = 14), 24% of the VH-1 group (n = 12), and 45% of the VH-2 group, n = 48 (p < 0.0001; Table 3).

Anatomical vaginal vault prolapse ≥ stage 2 was found in 19 women (8%), with or without symptoms. Combining this with women who underwent surgery for apical compartment prolapse in the follow-up period, 31 women in total had a vaginal vault prolapse after hysterectomy; 4.4% (n = 4) in the LH group, 5.8% of the VH-1 group (n = 3), and 23% in the VH-2 group (n = 24). The prevalence of vaginal vault prolapse in our POP-Q population is 13%. An overview per subgroup is presented in Table 4.

Table 4
Overview of the prevalence of vaginal vault prolapse

Univariate logistic regression

When analyzing the effect of confounding factors such as age, BMI, and obstetric history, we found no changes in outcome. Using univariate analysis of variance for age and parity (the two variables that were unequal at baseline), the VH-2 as an independent factor still correlated significantly with the presence of a prolapse (F-value = 25.1 with p < 0.0001).

Indication of response bias

Of the women who attended the POP-Q examination, 32 experienced bulging (13%). This was only 5% (n = 8 out of 159) for women who filled out the questionnaire but did not attend the POP-Q examination. Of the nonresponders who responded to the telephone interview, 14% experienced bulging symptoms (n = 6 out of 42).

### Sacrospinous hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher: observational follow-up of a multicentre randomised trial [^116tKahk]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uterine prolapse is a common health problem, with increasing incidence due to aging populations and rising obesity rates. Women's lifetime risk for prolapse surgery is 11–20%, and worldwide vaginal hysterectomy is the most common surgical procedure for uterine prolapse. Studies comparing vaginal hysterectomy with uterus preserving procedures are limited, and no data are available on long term follow-up. Guidelines for pelvic organ prolapse are therefore ambiguous, resulting in variation in treatment. The SAVE U (sacrospinous fixation versus vaginal hysterectomy in treatment of uterine prolapse ≥ 2) randomised trial compared uterus preservation with hysterectomy on a large scale with relevant outcome measures. Treatment with sacrospinous hysteropexy was non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments for surgical failure of the apical compartment after 12 months' follow-up. No notable differences were found between the interventions for overall anatomical and surgical failure, functional outcome, quality of life, complications, postoperative recovery, length of hospital stay, and sexual functioning. One of the study's limitations was short duration of follow-up (12 months). Two recent systematic reviews with meta-analysis on apical pelvic organ prolapse surgery confirmed the short term results of the SAVE U trial. The studies also concluded that long term follow-up of the comparison between vaginal hysterectomy with apical suspension and vaginal hysteropexy is necessary because the impact of the uterus on prolapse outcomes many years after surgery is still unknown. We report the five year outcomes in women after sacrospinous hysteropexy or vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments enrolled in the SAVE U randomised trial.

### Practice pattern variation: treatment of pelvic organ prolapse in the Netherlands [^113c9pm9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple studies have shown a growing preference of women for uterus preservation. Patients considered restoration of 'normality', symptom relief and physical improvement to be the most important factors. However, physician's preference has a major impact on the counseling of the patient and therefore on the choice of treatment. Surgeons tend to pick data and use studies that confirm their own beliefs, which causes confirmation bias. These beliefs are often based on their own experiences or on those of their colleagues. Counseling might also be influenced by the capacities of the surgeon. Ideally, every gynecologist should be able to offer at least the most common surgical techniques for POP. In reality, patients will only be counseled for the techniques the gynecologist is most familiar and experienced with. Fortunately, patient preference and shared decision-making are gaining more attention in the medical field. Optimizing the shared decision-making process and minimizing the difference in surgical approaches should contribute to a further decrease of PPV. To provide non-ambiguous counseling and care, a future perspective might be in centralized pelvic floor centers.

Recent publications on uterus-preserving operative techniques have provided more insight into these treatment modalities. In a Danish register-based study, a decrease of vaginal hysterectomies and an increase of uterus-preserving techniques such as SSH and MF were described. A matched cohort extracted from the same database (DugaBase) showed that the risk of recurrence in any compartment was higher after VH (18.3%) compared to MF (7.8%). The authors suggested that if there is no other indication for hysterectomy, VH should never be the first choice for surgical treatment of POP. In the coming years, the results of an ongoing randomized controlled trial concerning two uterus-preserving surgical techniques for uterine descent (SSH and MF) will be published. This will provide new scientific evidence on the role of these operative techniques that can contribute to further reduction of PPV. Despite several publications concerning PPV in urogynecology, not one has described a change in PPV based on a nationwide registration. The known studies are based on surveys among gynecologists and mainly describe operative techniques and interoperative differences. Some other studies have demonstrated PPV in the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse or determined compliance to evidence-based practices in the (surgical) management of POP.

Conservative management — pelvic floor muscle exercises and pelvic floor physical therapy for POP may be helpful for some women, with a 2013 review citing 4 trials showing symptom and anatomic improvements; this review included a multicenter randomized study of 447 women with symptomatic prolapse in which the pelvic floor muscle training group had significantly greater reduction of prolapse symptoms, and another trial in stages I to III prolapse found that 19% of women undergoing muscle training improved one POP-Q stage compared to only 8% of controls.
