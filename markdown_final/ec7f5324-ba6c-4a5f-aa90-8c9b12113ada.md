## Question

Bell's palsy treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment approach for Bell's palsy, including corticosteroids, antivirals, surgery, and supportive care, with attention to timing, severity, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for corticosteroids and the optimal regimen. Next, I will examine whether antivirals add benefit and in whom. After that, I need to check the role and timing of surgical decompression. Finally, I will review supportive care, follow-up, and pediatric considerations, and then synthesize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making points [^116neao9].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. Bell's palsy is a clinical diagnosis of acute, unilateral, lower motor neuron facial weakness after excluding other causes such as stroke, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Lyme disease, tumors, or trauma; history and physical examination are sufficient in most cases, and routine labs or imaging are not indicated unless red flags are present, so I need to ensure I am not overtesting or missing an alternative etiology [^116neao9] [^114gS89s].

> Now, I should verify the cornerstone therapy. High-quality randomized trials and Cochrane reviews consistently show that oral corticosteroids within 72 hours of symptom onset improve the probability of complete recovery and reduce incomplete recovery and synkinesis; the number needed to treat is about 6–10, and guideline panels from AAO-HNSF and AAN issue strong recommendations to prescribe steroids in this window, which I should not delay once the diagnosis is secured [^1171VQCw] [^111UzZYk] [^111YrahE] [^115A1Tw2].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal steroid regimen. Standard adult regimens include prednisolone 50 mg daily for 10 days or prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days followed by a 5-day taper; both are guideline-endorsed and supported by large RCTs, and I should start within 72 hours because benefit wanes after that window, so timing is critical to outcomes [^115P2zJT] [^111UzZYk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antivirals. I initially thought the 2015 Cochrane review showed a clear benefit of adding antivirals to steroids, but I should double-check the most recent update; the 2019 Cochrane review indicates that adding antivirals to corticosteroids may have little or no effect on incomplete recovery overall, though there is moderate-certainty evidence that combination therapy reduces long-term sequelae like synkinesis and crocodile tears, and some subgroup analyses suggest a modest benefit in severe cases, so the signal is mixed and not strong enough for a universal mandate [^113rL6V2] [^114MhGZz].

> I need to check how guidelines reconcile this. The AAO-HNSF offers combination therapy as an option within 72 hours, especially for severe presentations, while emphasizing shared decision-making and noting the evidence quality is limited; the AAN suggests antivirals may be offered with steroids because any benefit is likely modest at best; AAFP advises against antivirals alone and supports considering combination therapy to reduce synkinesis, so I should frame antivirals as optional adjuncts rather than core therapy [^1149LJCZ] [^116FmLoX] [^115qH27f] [^113kk6jp].

> Let me consider severity stratification. In patients with complete paralysis (House-Brackmann V–VI), the potential benefit of adding antivirals may be greater, and electrodiagnostic testing (ENoG/EMG) can help prognosticate; if ENoG shows > 90% degeneration and EMG lacks voluntary activity, a very high-risk subgroup may be identified, but even then, evidence for routine decompression remains uncertain, so I should use this to guide counseling rather than reflexively escalate to surgery [^116neao9] [^114vMu5d].

> Next, I should review surgical decompression. Multiple Cochrane reviews conclude that evidence for early facial nerve decompression is very low quality and insufficient to recommend routine use; guidelines issue no recommendation, and given high spontaneous recovery and meaningful surgical risks (hearing loss, vertigo, facial nerve injury), surgery should generally be reserved for exceptional cases in specialized centers after careful shared decision-making, not as standard care [^114r6Er6] [^1167Myd5] [^1128eWcx] [^114NEB8x].

> I will now examine supportive care, which is non-negotiable. Eye protection is essential for incomplete eye closure to prevent exposure keratopathy: lubricating drops/ointment, taping at night, moisture chambers, and urgent ophthalmology referral if corneal symptoms develop; I should also counsel on facial hygiene, oral care, and psychosocial support during recovery, and arrange follow-up to monitor for synkinesis or incomplete recovery [^111irM4e] [^114EogDq].

> Let me think about follow-up and when to pivot. Most patients improve within 2–3 weeks and recover by 3–4 months; if there is new or worsening neurologic deficit, ocular symptoms, or incomplete recovery at 3 months, I should reassess the diagnosis and refer to a facial nerve specialist, consider imaging or electrodiagnostics if not already done, and evaluate for alternative etiologies or long-term sequelae management [^1113YWHP] [^112MKA9K] [^112T6ec3].

> But wait, what about children. I should confirm pediatric nuances. Evidence for corticosteroids in children is limited; a multicenter RCT did not show improved complete recovery at 1 month with prednisolone, though recovery rates are high overall, and a recent systematic review suggests possible benefit on time to recovery without clear differences in long-term outcomes, so routine steroid use in children remains uncertain and should be individualized with caregiver input and careful follow-up [^1161DbqY] [^113LPAPj] [^1115ktbg].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Within 72 hours of onset, confirm Bell's palsy clinically and start oral corticosteroids; discuss adding an antiviral (acyclovir or valacyclovir) for possible modest benefit, especially in severe cases, using shared decision-making; implement strict eye protection; avoid antivirals alone; do not order routine labs or imaging unless red flags are present; and arrange reassessment at about 3 months to evaluate recovery and manage sequelae, escalating evaluation if recovery is incomplete or atypical features emerge [^111UzZYk] [^1149LJCZ] [^116FmLoX] [^115qH27f].

> Finally, I should double-check the strength of evidence and communicate uncertainty. The benefit of corticosteroids is robust and time-sensitive, forming the backbone of therapy; the incremental benefit of antivirals is small, heterogeneous across studies, and most pronounced for reducing long-term sequelae rather than ensuring complete recovery, so I should counsel patients accordingly and document the shared decision, especially when considering combination therapy in severe presentations [^1171VQCw] [^113rL6V2] [^114PHok2].

The cornerstone of Bell's palsy treatment is **corticosteroids within 72 hours** [^111UzZYk] of symptom onset to improve recovery and reduce sequelae [^1171VQCw]. Antivirals are **not routinely recommended** [^113rL6V2]; consider adding valacyclovir or acyclovir only in severe cases (complete paralysis) or when a viral etiology is suspected, and avoid antiviral monotherapy [^111yBuX4]. Eye care is essential to prevent corneal injury: use lubrication, taping, and shields, and refer urgently if exposure keratopathy is suspected [^114EogDq]. Physical therapy is reasonable for persistent weakness or synkinesis, and surgical decompression is reserved for refractory cases with > 90% degeneration on ENoG/EMG [^114vMu5d]. Most patients recover spontaneously, but timely steroids improve outcomes [^1113YWHP].

---

## Pharmacological treatment

### Corticosteroids

- **Recommendation**: Strong evidence supports oral corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset to improve recovery and reduce sequelae [^1171VQCw] [^111UzZYk].
- **Regimen**: Prednisolone 50 mg daily for 10 days or prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days then tapered over 5 days [^115P2zJT].
- **Benefit**: Reduces incomplete recovery and synkinesis; NNT ≈ 10 for complete recovery [^1171VQCw] [^111UzZYk].

---

### Antiviral therapy

- **Recommendation**: Not routine; consider adding valacyclovir or acyclovir in severe cases or when viral etiology is suspected [^113rL6V2] [^1149LJCZ].
- **Evidence**: Mixed; some studies show modest benefit in severe cases, others none [^113rL6V2] [^114MhGZz].
- **Monotherapy**: Avoid antivirals alone; inferior to steroids and placebo [^111PfcaG] [^111yBuX4].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatment

### Eye care

Eye care is **essential** to prevent exposure keratopathy [^111irM4e]. Measures include lubricating drops/ointment, taping the eyelid at night, and using protective shields; urgent ophthalmology referral is indicated if exposure keratopathy is suspected [^114EogDq].

---

### Physical therapy

Physical therapy is **reasonable** for persistent weakness or synkinesis [^116X1QPC]. Facial neuromuscular retraining may improve symmetry and reduce synkinesis, though evidence quality is limited [^notfound].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical decompression is **reserved** for refractory cases with > 90% degeneration on ENoG/EMG [^114vMu5d]. Evidence is limited and controversial; use only in specialized centers after careful selection [^1167Myd5].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **steroids** may be considered, but evidence is limited and recovery is high without treatment [^1115ktbg] [^1161DbqY]. Antivirals are not routinely recommended due to insufficient evidence [^114PHok2].

---

### Pregnant patients

In pregnancy, **steroids** are considered safe and may be used after individualized risk–benefit assessment; antivirals should be avoided or used cautiously.

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Prognosis is favorable: **70–94% recover completely**, most within 3–6 months [^1113YWHP]. Incomplete recovery is more likely with severe initial paralysis, older age, diabetes, hypertension, and delayed treatment [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids | Strongly recommended within 72 hours | High |
| Antivirals | Consider in severe cases or suspected viral etiology | Moderate |
| Eye care | Essential for all patients | High |
| Physical therapy | Reasonable for persistent weakness or synkinesis | Moderate |
| Surgical decompression | Reserved for refractory cases with severe degeneration | Low |

---

Corticosteroids within 72 hours are the **mainstay** of treatment; antivirals are selective, eye care is mandatory, and surgery is rare. Most patients recover fully, but timely intervention reduces sequelae [^1164UxKM].

Background

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but the effectiveness of additional treatment with an antiviral agent is uncertain. This review was first published in 2001 and most recently updated in 2015. Since a significant benefit of corticosteroids for the early management of Bell's palsy has been demonstrated, the main focus of this update, as in the previous version, was to determine the effect of adding antivirals to corticosteroid treatment. We undertook this update to integrate additional evidence and to better assess the robustness of findings, taking risk of bias fully into account.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral treatments alone or in combination with any other therapy for Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS in July 2019. We reviewed the bibliographies of the identified trials and contacted trial authors to identify additional published or unpublished data. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. We excluded trials that followed-up participants for less than three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trials for relevance, eligibility, and risk of bias, using standard Cochrane procedures. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high or unclear risk of bias in at least five domains, and reported these data as the primary analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen trials, including 2488 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. We included four new studies at this update. Incomplete recoveryA combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in people with Bell's palsy compared to corticosteroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.74; 3 trials, N = 766; random-effects; low-certainty evidence). We excluded 10 trials that were at high or unclear risk of bias in several domains from this analysis and limited all analyses to studies at lower risk of bias. Recovery rates were better in participants receiving corticosteroids alone than antivirals alone (RR 2.69, 95% CI 0.73 to 10.01; 2 trials, N = 667; random-effects), but the result was imprecise and allowed for the possibility of no effect. The rate of incomplete recovery was lower with antivirals plus corticosteroids than with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.76; 2 trials, N = 658; random-effects). Antivirals alone had no clear effect on incomplete recovery rates compared with placebo, but the result was imprecise (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.40; 2 trials, N = 658; fixed-effect). For people with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann score of 5 and 6, or equivalent on other scales), we found that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on incomplete recovery at month six compared to corticosteroids alone, although the result was again imprecise (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17; 2 trials, N = 98; random-effects). Motor synkinesis or crocodile tearsAntivirals plus corticosteroids reduced the proportion of participants who experienced these long-term sequelae from Bell's palsy compared to placebo plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 2 trials, N = 469; fixed-effect; moderate-certainty evidence). Antivirals plus corticosteroids reduced long-term sequelae compared to placebo but there was no clear difference in this outcome with antivirals alone compared to placebo. Adverse events Adverse event data were available in four studies providing data on 1592 participants. None of the four comparisons showed clear differences in adverse events between treatment and comparison arms (very low-certainty evidence); for the comparison of antivirals plus corticosteroids and corticosteroids alone in studies at lower risk of bias, the RR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.69; 2 trials, N = 656; fixed-effect; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in comparison to corticosteroids alone in Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity, or in people with severe Bell's palsy, but the results were very imprecise. Corticosteroids alone were probably more effective than antivirals alone and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo or no treatment. There was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids probably reduced the late sequelae of Bell's palsy compared with corticosteroids alone. Studies also showed fewer episodes of long-term sequelae in corticosteroid-treated participants than antiviral-treated participants. We found no clear difference in adverse events from the use of antivirals compared with either placebo or corticosteroids, but the evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions. An adequately powered RCT in people with Bell's palsy that compares different antiviral agents may be indicated.

### Antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^114MhGZz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but the effectiveness of additional treatment with an antiviral agent is uncertain. Significant morbidity can be associated with severe cases of Bell's palsy. This review was first published in 2001 and revised several times, most recently in 2009. This version replaces an update of the review in Issue 7 of the Cochrane Library subsequently withdrawn because of an ongoing investigation into the reliability of data from an included study.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral treatments alone or in combination with any other therapy for Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 7 October 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, DARE, NHS EED, and HTA. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the identified trials and contacted trial authors and known experts in the field and relevant drug companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. We excluded trials that had a high risk of bias in several domains.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed trials for relevance, eligibility, and risk of bias, using standard Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

Ten trials, including 2280 participants, met the inclusion criteria and are included in the final analysis. Some of the trials were small, and a number were at high or unclear risk of bias. Other trials did not meet current best standards in allocation concealment and blinding. Incomplete recoveryWe found a significant benefit from adding antivirals to corticosteroids in comparison with corticosteroids alone for people with Bell's palsy (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.97, n = 1315). For people with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann scores of 5 and 6 or the equivalent in other scales), we found a reduction in the rate of incomplete recovery at month six when antivirals plus corticosteroids were used, compared to corticosteroids alone (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99, n = 478). The outcome for the participants receiving corticosteroids alone was significantly better than for those receiving antivirals alone (RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.32, n = 768). The treatment effect of placebo was significantly lower than that of antivirals plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76, n = 658). Antivirals alone produced no benefit compared with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.40, n = 658). Motor synkinesis or crocodile tearsIn two trials comparing antivirals and corticosteroids with corticosteroids and placebo that assessed this outcome, we found a significant difference in long-term sequelae in favour of antivirals plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, n = 469). Two trials comparing antivirals alone with corticosteroids alone investigating this outcome showed fewer sequelae with corticosteroids (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.12, n = 472). We found no data on long-term sequelae for other comparisons. Adverse events Adverse event data were available in three studies giving comparison data on 1528 participants. None of the four comparisons (antivirals plus corticosteroids versus corticosteroids plus placebo or no treatment; antivirals versus corticosteroids; antivirals plus corticosteroids versus placebo; antivirals versus placebo) showed significant differences in adverse events between treatment and control arms. We could find no correlation with specific treatment within these results.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials showed a benefit from the combination of antivirals with corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids alone for the treatment of Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity. Low-quality evidence showed a benefit of combination therapy compared with corticosteroids alone in severe Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids alone were more effective than antivirals alone and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo or no treatment. There was no benefit from antivirals alone over placebo. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids reduced sequelae of Bell's palsy compared with corticosteroids alone. We found no significant increase in adverse events from the use of antivirals compared with either placebo or corticosteroids, based on low-quality evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy executive summary [^114oshwv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new Clinical Practice Guideline: Bell's Palsy. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations developed encourage accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitate patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy; some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, there are numerous diagnostic tests available that are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have an unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^114r6Er6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy is an acute paralysis of one side of the face of unknown aetiology. Bell's palsy should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of all other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology is swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgery in the management of Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 29 October 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2012). We also handsearched selected conference abstracts for the original version of the review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy. We compared surgical interventions to no treatment, sham treatment, other surgical treatments or medical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed whether trials identified from the searches were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Two trials with a total of 69 participants met the inclusion criteria. The first study considered the treatment of 403 people but only included 44 participants in the surgical trial, who were randomised into surgical and non-surgical groups. However, the report did not provide information on the method of randomisation. The second study randomly allocated 25 participants into surgical or control groups using statistical charts. There was no attempt in either study to conceal allocation. Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blind to the interventions, in either study. The first study lost seven participants to follow-up and there were no losses to follow-up in the second study. Surgeons in both studies decompressed the nerves of all the surgical group participants using a retroauricular approach. The primary outcome was recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. The first study showed that the operated group and the non-operated group (who received oral prednisolone) had comparable facial nerve recovery at nine months. This study did not statistically compare the groups but the scores and size of the groups suggested that statistically significant differences are unlikely. The second study reported no statistically significant differences between the operated and control (no treatment) groups. One operated participant in the first study had 20 dB sensorineural hearing loss and persistent vertigo. We identified no new studies when we updated the searches in October 2012.

Authors' Conclusions

There is only very low quality evidence from randomised controlled trials and this is insufficient to decide whether surgical intervention is beneficial or harmful in the management of Bell's palsy. Further research into the role of surgical intervention is unlikely to be performed because spontaneous recovery occurs in most cases.

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^1167Myd5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy is an acute unilateral facial paralysis of unknown aetiology and should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of any other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology is swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option; this is ideally performed as soon as possible after onset. This is an update of a review first published in 2011, and last updated in 2013. This update includes evidence from one newly identified study.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgery in the early management of Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 20 March 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We handsearched selected conference abstracts for the original version of the review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy. Trials compared surgical interventions to no treatment, later treatment (beyond three months), sham treatment, other surgical treatments or medical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were complete recovery at three and six months, synkinesis and contracture at 12 months, psychosocial outcomes at 12 months, and side effects and complications of treatment.

Main Results

Two trials with 65 participants met the inclusion criteria; one was newly identified at this update. The first study randomised 25 participants into surgical or non-surgical (no treatment) groups using statistical charts. One participant declined surgery, leaving 24 evaluable participants. The second study quasi-randomised 53 participants; however, only 41 were evaluable as 12 declined the intervention they were allocated. These 41 participants were then divided into early surgery, late surgery or non-surgical (no treatment) groups using alternation. There was no mention on how alternation was decided. Neither study mentioned if there was any attempt to conceal allocation. Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded to the interventions in either study. There were no losses to follow-up in the first study. The second study lost three participants to follow-up, and 17 did not contribute to the assessment of secondary outcomes. Both studies were at high risk of bias. Surgeons in both studies used a retro-auricular/transmastoid approach to decompress the facial nerve. For the outcome recovery of facial palsy at 12 months, the evidence was uncertain. The first study reported no differences between the surgical and no treatment groups. The second study fully reported numerical data, but included no statistical comparisons between groups for complete recovery. There was no evidence of a difference for the early surgery versus no treatment comparison (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 11.11; P = 0.84; 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and for the early surgery versus late surgery comparison (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.03 to 6.60; P = 0.58; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We considered the effects of surgery on facial nerve function at 12 months very uncertain (2 RCTs, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the second study reported adverse effects with a statistically significant decrease in lacrimal control in the surgical group within two to three months of denervation. Four participants in the second study had 35 dB to 50 dB of sensorineural hearing loss at 4000 Hz, and three had tinnitus. Because of the small numbers and trial design we also considered the adverse effects evidence very uncertain (2 RCTs, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence from RCTs or quasi-RCTs on surgery for the early management of Bell's palsy, and this is insufficient to decide whether surgical intervention is beneficial or harmful. Further research into the role of surgical intervention is unlikely to be performed because spontaneous or medically supported recovery occurs in most cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112TmDho]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — classification and use of evidence-based statements emphasize that guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes, minimize harms, and reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care; evidence supporting policies must be identified, appraised, summarized, and explicitly linked to statements, which reflect both the quality of evidence and the anticipated balance of benefit and harm; guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment, less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than with a "recommendation", and "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability; clinicians should act in patients' best interests, within their training and scope of practice, and the GDG applied values to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^114pKvSz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence levels for grades of evidence specify study designs by domain: For treatment and harm, grade A is well-designed randomized controlled trials performed on a population similar to the guideline's target population, and for diagnosis at grade A the evidence is a systematic review of cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding. Grade B comprises randomized controlled trials or overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies for treatment and harm, and individual cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding for diagnosis. Grade C comprises observational studies (case control and cohort design) for treatment and harm, and nonconsecutive studies, case-control studies, or studies with poor, nonindependent, or inconsistently applied reference standards for diagnosis. Grade D is mechanism-based reasoning or case reports. Grade X applies to exceptional situations where validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit over harm; the scheme aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) classification scheme updated for consistency with current level of evidence definitions.

### Do either corticosteroids or antiviral agents reduce the risk of long-term facial paresis in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy? [^115A1Tw2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of Bell's palsy remains uncertain, although accumulating evidence suggests a viral etiology. To date, treatment to minimize long-term deficits from this disorder typically includes anti-inflammatory or antiviral medication.

Clinical Question

Do corticosteroids or antiviral agents, either alone or in combination, reduce the risk of long-term facial paresis in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy?

Evidence Review

Three multicenter, randomized, controlled trials enrolled over 1,500 adult patients with paroxysmal, unilateral paresis of cranial nerve VII and treated them with varying regimens and combinations of prednisolone, antiviral agents, and placebo, and evaluated complete recovery up to 12 months later.

Results

The two larger, most recent trials incorporated similar factorial designs to allow for comparisons between steroids, antivirals, both combined, and placebo, and assessed recovery using validated measures of facial nerve function. In the larger, blinded trial, the numbers needed to treat to achieve complete recovery for patients in the prednisolone and acyclovir groups at 9 months were 7.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9–13.7) and 18.7 (95% CI 9.5-infinity), respectively. The number needed to treat to achieve complete recovery for patients in the valacyclovir plus prednisolone group vs. the prednisolone alone group in the second trial was 14.8 (95% CI 9.1–744.8).

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that prednisolone, an inexpensive and readily available medication, is effective for this common condition, but there was no statistically significant difference observed with acyclovir. Valacyclovir provides minimal added benefit to prednisolone alone.

### Use of corticosteroids in children with Bell's palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LPAPj]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance: Corticosteroids are recommended as first-line treatment for adults with acute Bell's palsy, but their role in children remains uncertain. Objective: To assess the effect of corticosteroid therapy on recovery rates in children with acute Bell's palsy. Evidence Review: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to April 2, 2025, for studies on corticosteroids for children with Bell's palsy. Odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were pooled using R software (version 4.2.3). Risk of bias was assessed with RoB2 and ROBINS-I. Findings: Eleven studies were included, comprising 750 children, of whom 495 (66%) received corticosteroids. The analysis across final follow-ups showed no significant difference. Because follow-ups ranged from 1 to 24 months, 1, 3, and 6 months were used as key points to create comparable intervals. The following subgroups were analyzed for each interval: corticosteroid monotherapy and corticosteroids plus adjunctive therapy. Corticosteroid monotherapy was associated with higher complete recovery rates beyond 1 month and a lower risk of incomplete recovery after 6 months. Conclusions and Relevance: Corticosteroid monotherapy in children with acute Bell's palsy may improve recovery rates beyond the first month, supporting its implementation in treatment protocols.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^117AbonC]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy is the most common condition involving a rapid and unilateral onset of peripheral paresis/paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. It affects 11.5–53.3 per 100,000 individuals a year across different populations. Bell's palsy is a health issue causing concern and has an extremely negative effect on both patients and their families. Therefore, diagnosis and prompt cause determination are key for early treatment. However, the etiology of Bell's palsy is unclear, and this affects its treatment. Thus, it is critical to determine the causes of Bell's palsy so that targeted treatment approaches can be developed and employed. This article reviews the literature on the diagnosis of Bell's palsy and examines possible etiologies of the disorder. It also suggests that the diagnosis of idiopathic facial palsy is based on exclusion and is most often made based on five factors including anatomical structure, viral infection, ischemia, inflammation, and cold stimulation responsivity.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1115Bery]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — physical therapy: No recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in Bell's palsy patients, and Policy level: No recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, Level of confidence in evidence: Low, due to significant flaws in existing trials, and Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm. Supporting text notes there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between rehabilitation techniques; a Cochrane review concluded that no treatment produced significantly more improvement than untreated controls; risks were not identified; there is no evidence to support benefit or harm of physical therapy as a treatment; and the lack of standardized therapy modalities and protocols hampers the ability to make a recommendation.

### Comparing the use of high-dose to standard-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of Bell's palsy in adults – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LfrJa]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy is typically treated with oral corticosteroids (40–60 mg daily). Concomitant antivirals are currently not recommended. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effect of high-dose versus standard-dose corticosteroids, without antivirals, in the management of Bell's palsy.

Databases Reviewed

Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing high-dose (≥ 80 mg) or standard-dose (40–60 mg) corticosteroid therapy for Bell's palsy were included. Exclusion criteria were coexisting antiviral treatment, nonoral drug delivery, and facial palsy due to other causes. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. A weighted estimate of treatment effects across trials as odds ratios (OR) using a Mantel-Haenzel random-effects model was calculated.

Results

Three articles were included in the analysis, representing 485 patients. There was a significant decrease in nonrecovery with high-dose, compared with standard-dose, corticosteroids at 6 months follow-up (OR = 0.17, 95% confidence interval = 0.05–0.56, p = 0.004). Overall adverse events were 5.8% (n = 28), all reported in one study in the high-dose group (transient elevated liver enzymes and fecal occult blood).

Conclusions

Our analysis shows a favorable effect of high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of Bell's palsy. It is the first to evaluate this effect without the use of antivirals in keeping with current treatment recommendations. As all included studies had a serious risk of bias, future research should focus on larger trials with more robust methodology. This will allow for more up-to-date and large-scale analyses where more valid conclusions can be drawn that may potentially influence treatment protocols.

### Bell's palsy [^111maL17]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is characterised by an acute, unilateral, partial, or complete paralysis of the face. Bell's palsy occurs in a lower motor neurone pattern. The weakness may be partial or complete, and may be associated with mild pain, numbness, increased sensitivity to sound, and altered taste. Bell's palsy is idiopathic, but a proportion of cases may be caused by re-activation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Bell's palsy is most common in people aged 15 to 40 years, with a 1 in 60 lifetime risk. Most people make a spontaneous recovery within 1 month, but up to 30% show delayed or incomplete recovery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for Bell's palsy in adults and children? What are the effects of physical treatments for Bell's palsy in adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiviral treatment, corticosteroids (alone or with antiviral treatment), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and facial re-training.

### Bell's palsy [^116itkA1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is characterised by an acute, unilateral, partial or complete paralysis of the face, which may occur with mild pain, numbness, increased sensitivity to sound, and altered taste. Bell's palsy remains idiopathic, but a proportion may be caused by reactivation of herpes viruses from cranial nerve ganglia. Bell's palsy is most common in people aged 15–40 years, affecting 1 in 60 in their lifetime. Most make a spontaneous recovery within 1 month, but up to 30% have delayed or incomplete recovery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found eight systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiviral treatment, corticosteroids (alone or plus antiviral treatment), facial nerve decompression surgery, and mime therapy.

### Antiviral treatment of Bell's palsy based on baseline severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YHBex]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral agents on complete recovery of Bell's palsy.

Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and sources of unpublished literature to November 1, 2014. Primary and secondary outcomes were complete and satisfactory recovery, respectively. To evaluate statistical heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analysis of baseline severity of Bell's palsy and between-study sensitivity analyses based on risk of allocation and detection bias.

Results

The 10 included randomized controlled trials (2419 patients; 807 with severe Bell's palsy at onset) had variable risk of bias, with 9 trials having a high risk of bias in at least 1 domain. Complete recovery was not statistically significantly greater with antiviral use versus no antiviral use in the random-effects meta-analysis of 6 trials (relative risk, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.16; I(2) = 65%). Conversely, random-effects meta-analysis of 9 trials showed a statistically significant difference in satisfactory recovery (relative risk, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.18; I(2) = 63%). Response to antiviral agents did not differ visually or statistically between patients with severe symptoms at baseline and those with milder disease (test for interaction, P = 0.11). Sensitivity analyses did not show a clear effect of bias on outcomes.

Conclusions

Antiviral agents are not efficacious in increasing the proportion of patients with Bell's palsy who achieved complete recovery, regardless of baseline symptom severity.

### Managing Bell's palsy [^115WHq4x]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, around 1 in 5,000 people develop Bell's palsy — a unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness of rapid onset that can be physically and psychologically disabling. While around 71% of patients recover normal function of the facial muscles without treatment, 13% are left with slight weakness and 16% with moderate to severe weakness resulting in major facial dysfunction. People who recover usually do so quickly, with 85% of them reporting some improvement in the first 3 weeks. There is longstanding controversy about what, if any, treatment should be initiated for Bell's palsy. Here we discuss the management of patients with this condition.

### Should children with Bell's palsy be treated with corticosteroids? A systematic review [^112nLceM]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of pediatric Bell's palsy. A systematic review of trials that included pediatric (< 16 years old) cases with Bell's palsy and involved the use of steroids was conducted. Eight trials were identified, five of which were randomized, and prednisone was used in six trials, whereas corticotropin was used in the other two. The methods of randomization and allocation concealment of the treatments used were rarely reported. Only one trial was done exclusively in children; none of the other seven trials analyzed the pediatric cases separately. Four trials reported some benefit from steroids. The pediatric trial did not provide evidence for benefit from corticosteroids. There was substantial heterogeneity in the population and interventions used; hence a meta-analysis was not done. Based on this systematic review, we do not recommend the routine use of steroids in children with Bell's palsy.

Statement 8 — Surgical decompression for Bell's palsy issues no directive and emphasizes shared decision-making. The guideline states, "No recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for Bell's palsy patients. No recommendation based on low-quality, nonrandomized trials and equilibrium of benefit and harm". The action profile lists "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D", with "Level of confidence in evidence: Low due to insufficient number of patients and poor quality of studies. Low confidence in the evidence led to a downgrade of the aggregate evidence quality from C to D". It notes "Benefit: Improved facial nerve functional recovery" and "Risks, harms, costs: Surgical risks and complications, anesthetic risks, direct and indirect costs of surgery", with "Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm". Value judgments include that "there may be a significant benefit for a small subset of patients who meet eligibility criteria and desire surgical management", patient preferences are "Large", the "Policy level: No recommendation", and "Differences of opinion: Major".

Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### Update on managing Bell's palsy [^111FfGhm]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, around 1 in 5,000 people develops Bell's palsy — idiopathic unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness of rapid onset. Of those who are not treated, about 16% end up with permanent moderate to severe weakness, which can result in facial dysfunction and disfigurement, and psychological difficulties. There has been longstanding controversy about what, if any, treatment should be given, with potential alternatives including corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, acupuncture and physiotherapy. We last reviewed this condition in 2006, indicating that "published trials on the efficacy of drug treatments have been poor and no firm conclusions can be drawn about the benefit of any single drug", and "it is unclear what place, if any, acupuncture and physiotherapy have in the management of patients with Bell's palsy". Here we update our conclusions in the light of recently published evidence.

### Clinical practice guidelines in idiopathic facial paralysis: systematic review using the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREE II) instrument [^113ZxCoa]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy, or idiopathic facial paralysis, is a peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause that presents as sudden, unilateral weakness of the muscles of the face. Prompt treatment of Bell's palsy is critical in order for patients to achieve complete recovery of facial function. Delays in diagnosis and management can result in permanent facial defects. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) exist to guide clinical decision-making in patients presenting with idiopathic facial paralysis. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive review of the methodological rigor and quality of these CPGs. Thus, the objective of the authors is to appraise the existing CPGs to ensure safe and effective practices. A total of eight guidelines met the inclusion criteria and were appraised. Only two CPGs achieved an overall rating of 'High', having five or more quality domains scoring > 60%. Across the CPGs, the domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability has the lowest overall scores with 48.1%, 43.9%, and 43.1%, respectively. Based on the AGREE II instrument, the methodological rigor and quality of CPGs for Bell's palsy is low to average. In particular, future guidelines for Bell's palsy should look to the quality domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability as the greatest opportunities for improvement.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^114vMu5d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy surgical decompression — supporting context highlights uncertain benefit, typical recovery without surgery, and a high-risk subset potentially considered for more aggressive intervention. Evidence summaries note "a lack of definitive benefit of surgery", though "a few selected trials" in early cases "have demonstrated effectiveness at improving the percentage of patients recovering to normal or near-normal facial function". Typical recovery is high: "Most patients are not surgical candidates due to the excellent overall rates of recovery, ranging from approximately 70% with no treatment to 94% with steroids". A poorer-prognosis subgroup is defined by electrodiagnostics: "patients with complete paralysis, greater than 90% reduction in amplitude on ENoG testing relative to the unaffected side of the face, and absent volitional nerve activity on EMG are less likely to recover spontaneously or with medical treatment alone", and "in this small group of patients… more aggressive intervention could be considered". Timing rationale includes that "decompression of the facial nerve within 12 days of injury" improved regeneration in animals, and the panel concludes that, given literature flaws and risks, "the GDG could make no recommendation for or against its use".

### WITHDRAWN. antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^117RBXD5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but the effectiveness of additional treatment with an antiviral agent is uncertain. Significant morbidity can be associated with severe cases of Bell's palsy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral treatments alone or in combination with any other therapy for Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 7 October 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, DARE, NHS EED, and HTA. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the identified trials and contacted trial authors and known experts in the field and relevant drug companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. We excluded trials that had a high risk of bias in several domains.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed trials for relevance, eligibility, and risk of bias, using standard Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

Eleven trials, including 2883 participants, met the inclusion criteria and are included in the final analysis. We added four studies to the previous review for this update. Some of the trials were small, and a number were at high or unclear risk of bias. Other trials did not meet current best standards in allocation concealment and blinding. Incomplete recoveryWe found no significant benefit from adding antivirals to corticosteroids in comparison with corticosteroids alone for people with Bell's palsy (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.02, n = 1715). For people with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann scores of 5 and 6 or the equivalent in other scales), we found a reduction in the rate of incomplete recovery at month six when antivirals plus corticosteroids were used (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99, n = 478). The outcome for the participants receiving corticosteroids alone was significantly better than for those receiving antivirals alone (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.20, n = 1169). The treatment effect of placebo was significantly lower than that of antivirals plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76, n = 658). Antivirals alone had a non-significant detrimental effect on the outcome compared with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.40, n = 658). Motor synkinesis or crocodile tearsIn three trials comparing antivirals and corticosteroids with corticosteroids and placebo that assessed this outcome, we found a significant difference in long-term sequelae in favour or antivirals plus corticosteroids (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99, n = 869). Three trials comparing antivirals alone with corticosteroids alone investigating this outcome showed fewer sequelae with corticosteroids (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.85, n = 873). We found no data on long-term sequelae for other comparisons. Adverse events Adverse event data were available in three studies giving comparison data on 1528 participants. None of the four comparisons (antivirals plus corticosteroids versus corticosteroids plus placebo or no treatment; antivirals versus corticosteroids; antivirals plus corticosteroids versus placebo; antivirals versus placebo) showed significant differences in adverse events between treatment and control arms. We could find no correlation with specific treatment within these results.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials showed no additional benefit from the combination of antivirals with corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids alone or with placebo, and no benefit from antivirals alone compared to placebo, for the treatment of Bell's palsy. Moderate-quality evidence showed a small but just significant benefit of combination therapy compared with corticosteroids alone in severe Bell's palsy. We found no significant increase in adverse events from the use of antivirals compared with either placebo or corticosteroids.

### Antivirals for Bell's palsy? [^1142AdT7]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK around 1 in 5,000 people develop Bell's palsy-idiopathic unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness of rapid onset. Although about 70% recover spontaneously, the remaining 30% are at risk of complications;(1) 13% have residual slight weakness and about 16% have persistent moderate to severe weakness if not treated.(2) As we have discussed in two previous articles there has been longstanding controversy about the best form of treatment.(2,3) In 2006 we concluded that published trials on the efficacy of drug treatments have been poor and no firm conclusions can be drawn about the benefit of any single drug;(2) in 2008 we noted that evidence suggests oral prednisolone started within 72 hours of symptom onset makes recovery more likely and that there was little good evidence that an antiviral drug helps.(3) The place of antivirals in the management of Bell's palsy remains a controversial issue. In this article we review the evidence for antiviral therapy alone or in conjunction with corticosteroid treatment.

### Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^1171VQCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve are implicated in causing Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids have a potent anti-inflammatory action that should minimise nerve damage. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2010.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy in people with Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

On 4 March 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished trials. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials comparing different routes of administration and dosage schemes of corticosteroid or adrenocorticotrophic hormone therapy versus a control group receiving no therapy considered effective for this condition, unless the same therapy was given in a similar way to the experimental group.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. The main outcome of interest was incomplete recovery of facial motor function (i.e. residual facial weakness). Secondary outcomes were cosmetically disabling persistent sequelae, development of motor synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction (i.e. hemifacial spasm, crocodile tears) and adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy manifested during follow-up.

Main Results

We identified seven trials, with 895 evaluable participants for this review. All provided data suitable for the primary outcome meta-analysis. One of the trials was new since the last version of this Cochrane systematic review. Risk of bias in the older, smaller studies included some unclear- or high-risk assessments, whereas we deemed the larger studies at low risk of bias. Overall, 79/452 (17%) participants allocated to corticosteroids had incomplete recovery of facial motor function six months or more after randomisation; significantly fewer than the 125/447 (28%) in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.80, seven trials, n = 895). The number of people who need to be treated with corticosteroids to avoid one incomplete recovery was 10 (95% CI 6 to 20). The reduction in the proportion of participants with cosmetically disabling sequelae six months after randomisation was very similar in the corticosteroid and placebo groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.29, two trials, n = 75, low-quality evidence). However, there was a significant reduction in motor synkinesis during follow-up in participants receiving corticosteroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91, three trials, n = 485, moderate-quality evidence). Three studies explicitly recorded the absence of adverse effects attributable to corticosteroids. One trial reported that three participants receiving prednisolone had temporary sleep disturbances and two trials gave a detailed account of adverse effects occurring in 93 participants, all non-serious; the combined analysis of data from these three trials found no significant difference in adverse effect rates between people receiving corticosteroids and people receiving placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51, n = 715).

Authors' Conclusions

The available moderate- to high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials showed significant benefit from treating Bell's palsy with corticosteroids.

### High-dose corticosteroids for adult Bell's palsy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154rW4i]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of high-dose corticosteroids (initial prednisolone [PSL] of 100mg or more daily) and standard-dose corticosteroids (initial PSL of 50–60mg) in patients with Bell's palsy.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ichushi-Web, Web of Science, and CINAHL, combined with data from ClinicalTrials.gov.

Study Selection

Published and unpublished cohort studies comparing high- and standard-dose corticosteroids in adult patients with Bell's palsy were included.

Data Extraction

Study characteristics (study design, patient's number), patient characteristics (sex, age, disease severity, prescription of antivirals), and outcomes (nonrecovery, any adverse effects).

Data Synthesis

From the 1,974 identified articles, 8 studies were met eligible criteria. Of the included studies, the initial dose in high-dose corticosteroids regimens varied from 120mg to 200mg PSL daily. Compared with standard-dose corticosteroids, high-dose corticosteroids were associated with a significantly decreased nonrecovery at 6 months after disease onset (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22–0.80; very low quality) in patients with Bell's palsy. No severe adverse effects were observed in patients receiving high- or standard-dose corticosteroids.

Conclusion

High-dose corticosteroids reduce nonrecovery in patients with Bell's palsy. The dose of high-dose corticosteroids was varied and further prospective study is needed to identify an adequate dose of corticosteroids in these patients.

### Bell's palsy-unclear terminology and definitions impede progress [^112k8nSb]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance: Bell's palsy (BP) is reported as the most common cause of facial paralysis, yet literature lacks a standardized definition of BP. Objective: To identify and categorize how the term "Bell's palsy" is defined and applied in published medical literature. Evidence Review: Randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and reviews containing "Bell's palsy" were identified in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases from inception until April 2, 2024. Articles were indexed by their definition of BP: (1) acute (≤ 72-h onset) idiopathic facial paralysis with no known etiologies, (2) acute "idiopathic" facial paralysis despite providing etiologies, (3) acute non-idiopathic facial paralysis, (4) non-acute but "idiopathic" facial paralysis with or without providing etiologies, (5) synonymous with facial paralysis, and (6) no definition. Ascribed etiologies were recorded. Original articles' exclusion criteria for patients with BP were also categorized. Findings: Of 4,395 articles obtained, 924 met the criteria. Based on the aforementioned categories, incongruent definitions of BP exist in the literature: (1) 12.88%, (2) 14.72%, (3) 4.00% (4) 15.26%, (5) 8.12%, and (6) 45.02%. Ascribed etiologies and exclusion criteria for BP also varied. Conclusions and Relevance: BP is a common condition seen by providers of many specialties, and as such patient diagnosis, management, and research rely on consistency and a shared language. This systematic review found inconsistent definitions and applications of the term "Bell's palsy" in the literature.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^116En9mK]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy is the most common condition involving a rapid and unilateral onset of peripheral paresis/paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. It affects 11.5–53.3 per 100,000 individuals a year across different populations. Bell's palsy is a health issue causing concern and has an extremely negative effect on both patients and their families. Therefore, diagnosis and prompt cause determination are key for early treatment. However, the etiology of Bell's palsy is unclear, and this affects its treatment. Thus, it is critical to determine the causes of Bell's palsy so that targeted treatment approaches can be developed and employed. This article reviews the literature on the diagnosis of Bell's palsy and examines possible etiologies of the disorder. It also suggests that the diagnosis of idiopathic facial palsy is based on exclusion and is most often made based on five factors including anatomical structure, viral infection, ischemia, inflammation, and cold stimulation responsivity.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112m58i6]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — recommendations for future research: It is unlikely that additional research regarding the efficacy of steroids will change the current estimate of its effect, and large randomized trials comparing outcomes in patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids with or without antivirals would help in determining whether the addition of antivirals to steroid treatment results in a modest benefit. Such trials should be powered to allow pre-specified subgroup analyses, and further research efforts should be directed toward determining the optimal dose and timing of steroids, the effect of other therapeutic modalities, and the identification of the effect of steroids in specific populations, such as in children.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116FmLoX]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — treatment recommendations: For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, oral steroids should be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial nerve function (Level A). For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, antivirals (in addition to steroids) might be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial function (Level C). Patients offered antivirals should be counseled that a benefit from antivirals has not been established, and, if there is a benefit, it is likely that it is modest at best (RD < 7%).

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111UzZYk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — oral corticosteroids: Clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older. Strong recommendation based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A, confidence in evidence is High, and the role of patient preferences is Small; exceptions include diabetes, morbid obesity, previous steroid intolerance, and psychiatric disorders, and pregnant women should be treated on an individualized basis. An American Academy of Neurology (AAN) parameter concluded steroids are highly likely to be effective and should be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial nerve function (risk difference 12.8 percent–15 percent). Randomized trials showed benefit: a factorial trial of 551 patients reported significant improvement with prednisolone within 72 hours of onset, with 83% recovery at 3 months versus 63.6% with placebo (P < .001) and 94.4% versus 81.6% at 9 months; a multicenter trial of 829 patients (ages 18–75 years) found statistically significant shorter times to recovery in the 416 patients treated with prednisolone compared with the 413 who did not. Prednisolone regimens used were a 10-day course of 25 mg twice daily for 10 days, or 60 mg per day for 5 days, then tapered over 5 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1115ktbg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy in children — use of steroids: Information is limited because children were excluded from most treatment trials of new-onset Bell's palsy, and several studies indicate that prognosis of untreated Bell's palsy in children is better than adults; therefore, the potential benefit of corticosteroid treatment is inconclusive. Compelling data are lacking for steroid use in children, and the need for steroid treatment is unclear. The GDG identified 2 systematic reviews/meta-analyses addressing oral corticosteroid use in children; one systematic review found no controlled trials and concluded the evidence for steroid use in children is inconclusive, and another review including patients younger than 16 years concluded there was no firm evidence for the routine use of steroids in children with new-onset Bell's palsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^115kyzeQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — acupuncture use is supported by small randomized controlled trials but the guideline development group (GDG) could make no recommendation due to study quality and uncertain benefit-harm balance; a systematic review included 6 RCTs with a total of 537 participants, and meta-analyses reported a 7% higher recovery rate for acupuncture alone versus medical therapy and an 11% higher recovery rate for acupuncture plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone, yet the GDG notes methodological flaws and states these trials do not permit reliable conclusions, and as a result the GDG was unable to determine the ratio of benefit to harm and therefore could make no recommendation regarding the use of acupuncture. In the Chen review, four RCTs compared acupuncture with medication, while 2 compared acupuncture with manipulation and physical therapy, and identified risks, harms, and costs include cost of acupuncture therapy, time required for therapy, therapy side effects, and delay in instituting steroid therapy. Safety data indicate that prospective European studies estimate mild acupuncture-related adverse events at 6.7% to 15%, while 2 observational studies estimate serious adverse events between 0.024% and 2.2%. Preference-sensitive decision-making is emphasized as the role of patient preferences is Large, and differences of opinion were Major with the GDG divided regarding whether to recommend against acupuncture or to make no recommendation.

### Do oral steroids aid recovery in children with Bell's palsy? [^112sgBwd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that steroids are not beneficial for treatment of paediatric patients with Bell's palsy. To investigate, we conducted a retrospective longitudinal study examining notes of 100 children, over 12 years coded for facial nerve palsy. Of the 79 diagnosed with Bell's palsy, all recovered, and for 46 patients we had data on interval from onset of symptoms to resolution (median duration in treated group = 5 weeks, range = 39; median duration in untreated group = 6 weeks, range = 11; p = 0.86). From our results, we conclude that all children with Bell's palsy recovered, with or without steroid treatment, with no statistically significant difference in symptoms duration. Complications of unresolved Bell's palsy can have important long-term functional and psychosocial consequences. Therefore, we need further research on use of steroids in children with complete/severe cases; it would be a shame to omit treatment due to "absence of evidence" rather than "evidence of absence".

### Surgical treatment of Bell's palsy: current attitudes [^114xz2tf]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To learn the current management of Bell's palsy among practicing otologists and neurotologists and to better define the role of surgical decompression of the facial nerve in the treatment of Bell's palsy.

Study Design

Survey questionnaire.

Methods

We conducted a survey of members of the American Otological Society and the American Neurotology Society to learn their current practices in the treatment of Bell's palsy.

Results

Eighty-six neurotologists responded out of 334 surveys (26%). The majority of respondents obtain magnetic resonance imaging and electrical testing for new patients and treat with a combination of steroids and antiviral agents. More than two thirds of respondents would recommend surgery to patients who met the established electrophysiologic criteria (electroneuronography < 10% normal, no spontaneous motor unit action potentials on electromyography within 10 days of onset of complete paralysis). However, only half believe that surgical decompression should be the standard of care, and only half would use a standard middle fossa approach. Lack of evidence was the most commonly cited reason for not recommending surgery. Several respondents wrote that they would leave the option of surgery to the patient. Most important, one third of neurotologists have not performed a surgical decompression for Bell's palsy in the last 10 years, and 95% perform less than one procedure per year.

Conclusions

Disagreement persists among practicing otologists about the role of surgical decompression for Bell's palsy. More convincing clinical evidence will be needed before there is widespread consensus regarding the surgical treatment of this condition.

### Bell's palsy: a review of treatment using antiviral agents [^112p5qGo]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of antiviral agents to reduce morbidity associated with Bell's palsy.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched (all up to April 2006) for English-language, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of antiviral agents in Bell's palsy. Search terms included Bell's palsy, acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, and randomized controlled trials.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated efficacy and safety endpoints of antiviral agents in the treatment of Bell's palsy were included. Primary efficacy outcomes included facial paralysis recovery profile, facial paralysis recovery index, and the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading scale. Safety outcomes were also identified by each trial.

Data Synthesis

Two prospective, randomized clinical trials were included in this review, both involving the use of acyclovir for treatment of Bell's palsy. Acyclovir monotherapy was shown to be inferior to prednisone monotherapy; however, the combination of acyclovir and prednisone was found to be superior to prednisone alone. There are limited data describing the safety of acyclovir in Bell's palsy.

Conclusions

The use of acyclovir in the treatment of Bell's palsy remains controversial. Additional, adequately powered, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to definitively support its use. For the time being, the evidence reviewed in this article would favor the combination of acyclovir and prednisone if commenced within the first 72 hours of symptom onset.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^114PHok2]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether steroids plus antivirals provide a better degree of facial muscle recovery in patients with Bell's palsy than steroids alone.

Design

Meta-analysis.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published in all languages from 1984 to January 2009. Additional studies were identified from cited references. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared steroids with the combination of steroids and antivirals for the treatment of Bell's palsy were included in this study. At least one month of follow-up and a primary end point of at least partial facial muscle recovery, as defined by a House-Brackmann grade of at least 2 (complete palsy is designated a grade of 6) or an equivalent score on an alternative recognised scoring system, were required. Review methods Two authors independently reviewed studies for methodological quality, treatment regimens, duration of symptoms before treatment, length of follow-up, and outcomes. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and pooled using a random effects model.

Results

Six trials were included, a total of 1145 patients; 574 patients received steroids alone and 571 patients received steroids and antivirals. The pooled odds ratio for facial muscle recovery showed no benefit of steroids plus antivirals compared with steroids alone (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.69; P = 0.18). A one study removed analysis showed that the highest quality studies had the greatest effect on the lack of difference between study arms shown by the odds ratio. Subgroup analyses assessing causes of heterogeneity defined a priori (time from symptom onset to treatment, length of follow-up, and type of antiviral studied) showed no benefit of antivirals in addition to that provided by steroids.

Conclusions

Antivirals did not provide an added benefit in achieving at least partial facial muscle recovery compared with steroids alone in patients with Bell's palsy. This study does not, therefore, support the routine use of antivirals in Bell's palsy. Future studies should use improved herpes virus diagnostics and newer antivirals to assess whether combination therapy benefits patients with more severe facial paralysis at study entry.

### Comparison of glucocorticoids combined with antiviral drugs versus glucocorticoids alone in the management of Bell's palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^116pwXEZ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of glucocorticoids combined with antiviral drugs (GA) versus glucocorticoids alone (GO) in the treatment of Bell's Palsy.

Database Reviewed

According to the PRISMA2020 guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for English articles from their inception to August 10, 2023, and performed a secondary search on October 31, 2024.

Methods

Studies describing the efficacy of (GA) for Bell's Palsy versus (GO). Patient demographics, cure rates, and results of subgroup analysis were collected. Stata 17.0 was used to perform the calculation and to draw relevant meta-analysis pictures. RevMan 5.4 was used to determine the source of bias and to summarize the risk of bias. Heterogeneity was assessed using Q-tests and I 2 statistics.

Results

A total of 10 RCTs enrolling 2893 participants were finally included in the meta-analysis. The treatment rate in the group of GA and the group of GO was 88.7% and 83.2%, respectively. The difference in the treatment rate between the two groups for Bell's Palsy was significant (relative risk (RR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–1.15), and significant heterogeneity was (I 2 = 63.6%, p = 0.003 < 0.1).

Conclusions

This review suggests that GA may be an effective treatment for Bell's palsy. Compared with GO, GA can improve the cure rate of Bell's palsy.

### Bell's palsy: aetiology, clinical features and multidisciplinary care [^113j2nSu]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is a common cranial neuropathy causing acute unilateral lower motor neuron facial paralysis. Immune, infective and ischaemic mechanisms are all potential contributors to the development of Bell's palsy, but the precise cause remains unclear. Advancements in the understanding of intra-axonal signal molecules and the molecular mechanisms underpinning Wallerian degeneration may further delineate its pathogenesis along with in vitro studies of virus-axon interactions. Recently published guidelines for the acute treatment of Bell's palsy advocate for steroid monotherapy, although controversy exists over whether combined corticosteroids and antivirals may possibly have a beneficial role in select cases of severe Bell's palsy. For those with longstanding sequaelae from incomplete recovery, aesthetic, functional (nasal patency, eye closure, speech and swallowing) and psychological considerations need to be addressed by the treating team. Increasingly, multidisciplinary collaboration between interested clinicians from a wide variety of subspecialties has proven effective. A patient centred approach utilising physiotherapy, targeted botulinum toxin injection and selective surgical intervention has reduced the burden of long-term disability in facial palsy.

### Bell's palsy [^112aibLo]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is unilateral, acute onset facial paralysis that is a common condition. One in every 65 people experiences Bell's palsy in the course of their lifetime. The majority of patients afflicted with this idiopathic disorder recover facial function. Initial treatment involves oral corticosteroids, possible antiviral drugs, and protection of the eye from desiccation. A small subset of patients may be left with incomplete recovery, synkinesis, facial contracture, or hemifacial spasm. A combination of medical and surgical treatment options exist to treat the long-term sequelae of Bell's palsy.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^1174wP8k]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of study

A key strength of our meta-analysis is the inclusion of high quality randomised controlled trials. Non-randomised trials have been published on the topic of antivirals in Bell's palsy; however, one should be guarded in making final conclusions from these studies given the limitations of the study design. Despite other meta-analyses being performed on the treatment of Bell's palsy, our meta-analysis is the first to define whether the addition of antivirals provides any benefit over treatment with steroids alone. We purposely used a random effects model owing to our concerns about study heterogeneity and performed several subgroup analyses in an attempt to characterise the potential causes of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we accounted for publication bias.

Our meta-analysis has some limitations. The Adour et al study did not report intention to treat analyses; therefore, we used the number of patients at final follow-up as our denominator, as these data were available for all studies. However, even when the Adour et al study was removed from the analysis of intention to treat data, the confidence interval of our pooled odds ratio still crossed 1 (odds ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.56; P = 0.163). In addition, when the three unaccounted lost to follow-up patients from the Adour et al study were added to either arm, our primary finding did not notably change. Our subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of included studies and thus may lack statistical power. However, this was not the case in our subgroup analysis of studies that included patients who presented within three days of symptom onset. Finally, three prospective randomised studies were not included in this meta-analysis as they analysed time to recovery, and the number of patients in each arm was not reported in one such study. In addition, we were unable to obtain the necessary raw data from the investigators leading each of these studies. However, none of these three studies showed a significant benefit of combination therapy over steroids alone. In fact, in the largest of these, the mean time to recovery was shorter in patients on steroids alone (70.7 days) compared with those on combination therapy (76.4 days), although this difference was not significant (P = 0.977).

At least one month of follow-up and a primary end point of at least partial facial muscle recovery, as defined by a House-Brackmann grade of at least 2 (complete palsy is designated a grade of 6) or an equivalent score on an alternative recognised scoring system, were required.

Review methods Two authors independently reviewed studies for methodological quality, treatment regimens, duration of symptoms before treatment, length of follow-up, and outcomes. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and pooled using a random effects model.

Results Six trials were included, a total of 1145 patients; 574 patients received steroids alone and 571 patients received steroids and antivirals. The pooled odds ratio for facial muscle recovery showed no benefit of steroids plus antivirals compared with steroids alone (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.69; P = 0.18). A one study removed analysis showed that the highest quality studies had the greatest effect on the lack of difference between study arms shown by the odds ratio. Subgroup analyses assessing causes of heterogeneity defined a priori (time from symptom onset to treatment, length of follow-up, and type of antiviral studied) showed no benefit of antivirals in addition to that provided by steroids.

Conclusions Antivirals did not provide an added benefit in achieving at least partial facial muscle recovery compared with steroids alone in patients with Bell's palsy. This study does not, therefore, support the routine use of antivirals in Bell's palsy. Future studies should use improved herpes virus diagnostics and newer antivirals to assess whether combination therapy benefits patients with more severe facial paralysis at study entry.

### Risk factors associated with Bell's palsy: a real-world analysis of 281, 600 patients [^114TWLbx]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The goal must be to eradicate BP as a final diagnosis, as idiopathic can be equated with "not yet explainable". Therefore, further and more detailed research on potential risk factors for disease incidence, treatment options, and recovery rate is needed to provide these specific patients with individualized and successful treatment options.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^1138KXgk]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Sample size estimation

Based on observational data we expect 60% of children without prednisolone to have complete recovery at 1 month. This is in line with data from the pediatric RCT which reported complete recovery without prednisolone in 72% at 4 months. A study in adults deemed an improvement of 12% with prednisolone compared with placebo to be a clinically important difference between treatment groups. We therefore power our study to find an increase in the proportion with complete recovery from 60% in the placebo group to 72% in the prednisolone group. This is a conservative estimate of efficacy compared with that found in our observational pilot data which showed an increase in complete recovery at 1 month of 16% in those treated with prednisolone (75%) compared with those not receiving prednisolone (59%). To enable us to identify an increase in recovery from 60 to 72% or larger with 80% power requires a study with 244 subjects in each treatment group based on a two-sided test with α = 0.05. Hence we aim to recruit 270 per group (540 in total) to allow for 10% loss to follow-up at 1 month.

Statistical analysis

Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. For the primary analysis, multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data, imputing all outcomes using a single (joint) imputation model. Imputation will be carried out separately by treatment arm to ensure that any treatment effects are maintained. As a secondary analysis, all analyses will be repeated using a complete case analysis, including all participants with data available for each outcome.

The primary outcome of complete recovery at 1 month post randomization on the HB scale (as determined by the site specialist clinician) will be presented as a proportion in each treatment group, with a comparison between the groups presented as a difference in proportions and as an odds ratio from a logistic regression model adjusted for site and age, with a 95% CI and p -value. In addition, we will present the results as Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) and its 95% CI. As an additional sensitivity analysis, the analysis of recovery at 1 month will be repeated assuming that all participants with missing data who have not previously been recorded as achieving complete recovery 1) have recovered, and 2) have not recovered.

### Bell's palsy syndrome: mimics and chameleons [^116SeRq3]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

In this article we will explore the mimics and chameleons of Bell's palsy and in addition argue that we should use the term 'Bell's palsy syndrome' to help guide clinical reasoning when thinking about patients with facial weakness. The diagnosis of Bell's palsy can usually be made on clinical grounds without the need for further investigations. This is because the diagnosis is not one of exclusion (despite this being commonly how it is described), a lower motor neurone facial weakness where all alternative causes have been eliminated, but rather a positive recognition of a clinical syndrome, with a number of exclusions, which are described below. This perhaps would be more accurately referred to a 'Bell's palsy syndrome'. Treatment with corticosteroids improves outcome; adding an antiviral probably reduces the rates of long-term complications.

### Bell's palsy and its semantic change over time [^1152S8J6]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

From 1821 to 1829, Sir Charles Bell presented cases of facial paralysis from infection, trauma, and unknown causes. As such, "Bell's palsy" initially referred to facial palsy of any etiology. Today, the term is reserved for idiopathic peripheral facial palsy. The objectives of this analysis were to establish when the eponym came to vogue and delineate the semantic shift from its original definition to its current one.

Methods

Extensive review of available 19th and 20th century literature mentioning "Bell's palsy" and "Bell's paralysis".

Results

Historical accounts have eponymously attached Bell's name to facial paralysis as early as the 1840s-Bell's palsy was first used to describe cases of facial palsy of any cause. In 1886, Gowers characterized Bell's palsy as a "neuritis usually within the Fallopian Canal", distinguishing it as a separate etiology. Over the next decades, the definition narrowed to peripheral facial paralysis from cold exposure or unknown causes. By the 1940s, its natural history was well described-an acute, unilateral, idiopathic, and usually self-limited peripheral facial palsy.

Conclusion

The semantic change of a word over time can tell us a remarkable story of its history and origins. Absence of a discrete lesion, lack of proven treatment, and good prognosis without intervention distinguished Bell's palsy from other causes of facial paralysis. Over time, the definition has narrowed from a facial palsy of any cause to an idiopathic peripheral facial palsy. Recent evidence supporting Bell's palsy as a viral mononeuritis may have driven its recent semantic change toward this specific etiology.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^114EogDq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — post-diagnosis follow-up and referrals are outlined as follows: Immediate reevaluation is warranted, particularly if there is a history of head and neck cancer; for new neurologic findings a referral to a neurologist would be appropriate; if there is concern for head and neck malignancy, a referral to a head and neck specialist would be appropriate; and if an otolaryngologist with expertise in facial nerve paralysis was the initial provider, a return visit for reassessment to the same clinician would be reasonable. To prevent ocular complications in severe facial paresis/paralysis with incomplete eye closure, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist or eye specialist for evaluation and treatment, and in the interim patients should be educated about strategies for eye closure and moisturization (for example, taping, eye ointment, artificial tears, humidified eye chambers). For persistent deficits, the timing of reconstructive techniques should be discussed with a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon if the patient has not shown meaningful functional recovery; patients may also benefit from support or counseling, and depression and, rarely, chronic pain should be managed by referral to the appropriate specialist. This recommendation represents the minimum follow-up required, and the GDG recognized there may be value in additional early follow-up for all patients with Bell's palsy for support, monitoring of recovery, and identifying complications or new neurologic findings.

Bell's palsy — health care utilization and cost state that costs include emergency room or urgent care, primary care, and laboratory and imaging studies, and evaluations may include audiometric, vestibular, electrical, and serologic tests, as well as CT imaging or MRI studies. A "gold standard" treatment has yet to be defined, medical and surgical intervention is variable, and while no explicit cost estimates are available, the burden is significant given 35,000 to 100,000 cases annually in the United States.

### Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^115gSe3B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve are implicated in causing Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids have a potent anti-inflammatory action which should minimise nerve damage and thereby improve the outcome of patients suffering from this condition.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of steroid therapy in the recovery of patients with Bell's palsy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register (searched December 2003) for randomised trials, as well as MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2003) and LILACS (January 1982 to April 2003). We contacted known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing different routes of administration and dosage schemes of corticosteroid or adrenocorticotrophic hormone therapy versus a control group where no therapy considered effective for this condition was administered, unless it was also given in a similar way to the experimental group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, trial quality, and extracted the data.

Main Results

Four trials with a total of 179 patients were included. One trial compared cortisone acetate with placebo; one compared prednisone plus vitamins, with vitamins alone; one compared high-dose prednisone administered intravenously against saline solution, and one, not-placebo controlled, tested the efficacy of methylprednisolone. Allocation concealment was appropriate in two trials, and the data reported allowed an intention-to-treat analysis. The data included in the meta-analyses were collected from three trials with a total of 117 patients. Overall 13/59 (22%) of the patients allocated to steroid therapy had incomplete recovery of facial motor function six months after randomisation, compared with 15/58 (26%) in the control group. This reduction was not significant (relative risk 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 1.59). The reduction in the proportion of patients with cosmetically disabling sequelae six months after randomisation was also not significant (relative risk 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.98). The trial not included in the meta-analysis showed a non-significant difference in outcomes between the arms.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The available evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show significant benefit from treating Bell's palsy with corticosteroids. More randomised controlled trials with a greater number of patients are needed to determine reliably whether there is real benefit (or harm) from the use of corticosteroid therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^1111un3d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antiviral agents against herpes simplex virus are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but their effectiveness is uncertain. Significant morbidity can be associated with severe cases.

Objectives

This review addresses the effect of antiviral therapy on Bell's palsy.

Search Strategy

We updated the search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (December 2008), MEDLINE (from January 1966 to December 8 2008), EMBASE (from January 1980 to December 8 2008) and LILACS (from January 1982 to December 2008).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Twenty-three papers were selected for consideration.

Main Results

Seven trials including 1987 participants met the inclusion criteria, adding five studies to the two in the previous review. Incomplete recovery at one year. There was no significant benefit in the rate of incomplete recovery from antivirals compared with placebo (n = 1886, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.18). In meta-analyses with some unexplained heterogeneity, the outcome with antivirals was significantly worse than with corticosteroids (n = 768, RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.32) and the outcome with antivirals plus corticosteroids was significantly better than with placebo (n = 658, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76). Motor synkinesis or crocodile tears at one year. In single trials, there was no significant difference in long term sequelae comparing antivirals and corticosteroids with corticosteroids alone (n = 99, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.07) or antivirals with corticosteroids (n = 101, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.07). Adverse events. There was no significant difference in rates of adverse events between antivirals and placebo (n = 1544, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.38), between antivirals and corticosteroids (n = 667, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41) or between the antiviral-corticosteroid combination and placebo (n = 658, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.66).

Authors' Conclusions

High quality evidence showed no significant benefit from anti-herpes simplex antivirals compared with placebo in producing complete recovery from Bell's palsy. Moderate quality evidence showed that antivirals were significantly less likely than corticosteroids to produce complete recovery.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^117DiN69]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Data from the United Kingdom reported an incidence of Bell's palsy of more than 6 per 100,000 person-years in children under 14 years and more than 20 per 100,000 person-years in people aged 15–29 years, although the true incidence may be higher. In an emergency department based study of stroke mimics in children Bell's palsy was the third most frequent diagnosis in children with sudden onset neurological dysfunction. In adults, up to 30% of untreated patients fail to make a complete recovery. While in children up to 100% recover from Bell's palsy within 12 months, it often leaves them with a prolonged period of functional impairment, disfigurement and emotional distress.

The main agents used for the treatment of Bell's palsy are steroids. The anti-inflammatory effect of steroids (such as prednisolone) is assumed to minimize facial nerve swelling, compression and damage, therefore reducing the length of time to and increasing the likelihood of recovery. Two recent, large, blinded randomised controlled trial (RCTs) of steroids in adults (combined n = 1309) reported statistically and clinically significant improvements in the proportion who reached complete recovery when Bell's palsy was treated with steroids compared with placebo. The participants in both studies were randomised to receive prednisolone and acyclovir, prednisolone and placebo, acyclovir and placebo or placebo and placebo. One of the studies, by Engstrom et al. (839 patients), showed shorter times to recovery for patients who received prednisolone compared with those who did not (combining those who did and did not receive acyclovir, hazard ratio 1.4 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.64; p < 0.0001). The other study (Sullivan et al. 496 patients) found that more patients had complete recovery by 3 months in the group who received prednisolone (83%) compared with placebo (63%) (again combining participants who did and did not receive acyclovir, difference 19.4%; 95% CI: 11.7 to 27.1%); number needed to treat to achieve one additional complete recovery was 6 (95% CI: 4 to 9). A recent (2010) Cochrane review (8 trials, n = 1569) on treatment for Bell's palsy, including the two RCTs above, found that corticosteroid treated patients had a lower risk of incomplete recovery than placebo treated patients (relative risk [RR] 0.71; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) and that those treated with corticosteroids also had reduced risk of synkinesis during follow up (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Subsequently, in 2012 the American Academy of Neurology released a guideline update on the use of steroids and antivirals to treat Bell's palsy. It concluded that steroids have proven efficacy in treating Bell's palsy in adults, and that no further research is required. Similarly, in 2013 the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation published a clinical practice guideline recommending the use of oral steroids within 72 hours in patients with Bell's palsy 16 years and older.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^111wixWu]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This review was conducted to the suggested QUOROM guideline standards. We began our meta-analysis by performing a detailed literature search for articles published between 1984 (year that aciclovir was licensed for clinical use) and January 2009 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, we searched reference lists of systematic reviews for appropriate articles. Hand searching of conference abstract books was not performed. Our search terms included: "bell palsy", "bell's palsy", "bell's palsies", "bells palsy", "idiopathic facial paralyses", "idiopathic facial paralysis", "herpetic facial paralysis", "anti-viral agents", "acyclovir", "valacyclovir", "famcyclovir", and "famciclovir". Steroids were not included in the search terms as we were not interested in studies that only assessed the benefits of steroids alone. Two independent investigators performed the search.

We included all randomised controlled trials that compared steroids with the combination of steroids and antivirals in patients with Bell's palsy. No studies were excluded on the basis of language. Other inclusion criteria included: at least one month of follow-up after treatment initiation; and an assessment of facial muscle recovery, as determined by a recognised scoring system such as the House-Brackmann grade, Yanagihara score, or the facial paralysis recovery index. We excluded animal studies, review articles, meta-analyses, case series, studies involving children or pregnant women, studies lacking a control group, studies that did not report the proportion of patients with facial recovery, and studies comparing steroids with antivirals alone. Where duplicate papers using overlapping data sets were published, the study with the larger population was included.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^115qmevJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Randomisation

Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: intervention (prednisolone) or matched placebo. An independent statistician has generated a randomization schedule using variable block sizes, stratified by site. This schedule will be used by the central study pharmacist at RCH to undertake the blinding, labelling and distribution of the study drugs to participating sites by putting together study packs of the required drug labelled with sequential study numbers for each site and dosing instructions. Randomization will be undertaken at the site by ED and research staff by selecting the lowest numbered study pack (next pack system) from the study drug store in ED.

Interventions

There is currently little evidence to assist in determining the best prednisolone dose in children. Adult studies of Bell's palsy have used various steroids and doses. The two large adult RCT used 50 mg prednisolone daily for 10 days or 60 mg prednisolone daily for 5 days then weaning over 5 days. The only paediatric RCT of steroid use for Bell's palsy used methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1.25 mg/kg/day prednisolone) for 10 days, then weaned over 3–5 days. Observational data from the central study site, and unpublished survey data from the PREDICT network indicate that prednisolone is the most frequently used steroid for Bell's palsy in children, usually at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for a variable number of days. Prednisolone is also the most frequently used oral corticosteroid in children in Australia and New Zealand for various other inflammatory conditions, with routine doses of 1–2 mg/kg/day.

Noting the adult dose used by Sullivan et al. (50 mg for 10 days without taper); having sought advice from endocrinologists and rheumatologists; in consideration of the current local guidelines and with consideration to ease of preparation of study drugs, a dose of ~1 mg/kg daily for 10 days without taper was chosen for the current study. For the 10-day study treatment period, participants will therefore be assigned to receive either ~1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone (based on weight categories) up to a maximum of 50 mg/day or to receive matching placebo.

Adverse events from this dose and short duration are expected to be limited to minor behavioral changes and possible weight gain. Drug related adverse events will be recorded. Risks should be reduced by adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^111gH1Qp]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the conclusive evidence of benefit from steroids in adults with Bell's palsy, two systematic review of the use of steroids to treat Bell's palsy in children found no placebo controlled trials. There has only been one small randomised trial of steroid use in children with Bell's palsy. Unüvar et al. randomised 42 children (mean age 53 months) to receive 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or no treatment (no placebo). The study found that all children fully recovered within 12 months regardless of treatment. However, at 4 and 6 months after treatment, more children in the methylprednisolone group had recovered compared with the no treatment group (86 vs 72% at 4 months and 100 vs 85% at 6 months). These findings suggest that although children eventually recover, steroids hasten the time to recovery. The lack of a placebo arm, small patient numbers, and inclusion of only children with severe signs and symptoms at presentation limit the generalisability of these results. Two systematic reviews of the use of steroids to treat Bell's palsy in children found no placebo controlled trials and either state that there was insufficient evidence to make a treatment recommendation or provide no positive evidence for the beneficial effects of corticosteroids and do not recommend the routine use of steroids in children. The results from adult studies of steroids to treat Bell's palsy are difficult to extrapolate to children as medical conditions often manifest differently and have different responses to treatment in adults and children. For example, there are documented differences from adults in the pathophysiology and natural history of other paediatric demyelinating conditions: (i) acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which is typically monophasic, has different presenting features and involves different brain structures than similar diseases in adults (such as multiple sclerosis); (ii) acute myelitis can have a good prognosis in children but usually has a poor prognosis in adults. Similarly, it is unclear whether the pathophysiology in children is different from adults.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^1175jfRy]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Both systematic reviews of the use of steroids to treat Bell's palsy in children call for a definitive trial to be conducted. The American Academy of Neurology similarly called for RCTs to determine if Bell's palsy in children should be treated with steroids. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guideline states that corticosteroids may be considered in pediatric patients with a large role for care giver involvement in the decision making process. A consequence of the lack of evidence and firm treatment recommendations is variable use of steroid in children reported from a number of centers.

Based on the lack of placebo-controlled evidence for or against steroid use in Bell's palsy in children and the resulting variability in care, and the high level evidence of the efficacy of prednisolone in adults we designed a study with the primary aim to determine, in children aged between 6 months and less than 18 years presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of Bell's palsy (unilateral, peripheral facial nerve palsy), whether treatment with oral prednisolone (at ~1 mg/kg daily for 10 days) increases the proportion of children who have complete recovery at 1 month (defined as grade 1 on the House-Brackmann (HB) scale) compared with children receiving placebo. This study will also provide a unique insight into Bell's palsy related questions including the time to complete recovery; the emotional and functional impact of Bell's palsy; the effect of initial severity and time to treatment on subsequent recovery; and the nature of pain, motor synkinesis and autonomic dysfunction in children with Bell's palsy.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^114smKXf]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This is a phase III, triple-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial of prednisolone for treatment of Bell's palsy. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive ~ 1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone, up to a maximum of 50 mg, or matched placebo for 10 days. The study will include a total of 540 children (approximately 270 in each treatment group). This sample size allows for 10% loss to follow-up at 1 month. The study will be conducted at sites of the Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) research network in Australia and New Zealand. The central study site is the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Melbourne (MCRI), Australia and the central study pharmacy is at the co-located Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), Melbourne, Australia.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^115P2zJT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — oral corticosteroid regimen specifies a 10-day course of oral steroids with at least 5 days at a high dose (either prednisolone 50 mg for 10 days or prednisone 60 mg for 5 days with a 5-day taper) initiated within 72 hours of symptom onset, and the benefit of treatment after 72 hours is less clear.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1149LJCZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — combination antiviral therapy with steroids (Statement 5B) may be offered within 72 hours of symptom onset as an option for patients with Bell's palsy, with aggregate evidence quality Grade B, a small potential improvement in facial nerve function, treatment side effects and cost as risks, and an equilibrium of benefit and harm; exceptions include diabetes, morbid obesity, previous steroid intolerance, and individualized management in pregnancy. Trial data include 221 patients showing higher full facial nerve recovery at 6 months with valacyclovir plus prednisolone versus placebo plus prednisolone (96.5% vs 89.7%); a meta-analysis of 18 trials found a 25% reduced risk of incomplete nerve recovery with combination therapy versus steroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.00), with an estimate that 26 patients would require treatment to achieve 1 better facial nerve outcome than with steroid therapy alone, and an additional large trial of 829 patients within 72 hours of onset has been published. Due to the potential of a small benefit and relatively low risk, the guideline development group concluded that patients may be offered combination therapy if treated within 72 hours of onset of Bell's palsy, with a large role for shared decision making.

### Prednisolone – but not antiviral drugs – improves outcome in patients with Bell's palsy [^114Z5o91]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have provided compelling evidence that treatment with prednisolone improves outcome in patients with acute idiopathic peripheral facial (Bell's) palsy. The low rate of adverse effects, the small number needed to treat, and the modest cost of therapy indicate that prednisolone should be used in all patients with facial palsy of < 72 h duration who do not have contraindications to steroid therapy. By contrast, the best-designed recent clinical trials have failed to suggest any significant beneficial effect on Bell's palsy of treatment with acyclovir or valacyclovir, either as single agents or in combination with prednisolone. Antiviral therapy should not, therefore, be routinely used in the treatment of Bell's palsy.

### Physical therapy for facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy): an updated and extended systematic review of the evidence for facial exercise therapy [^115fqMDL]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

The evidence base for therapy in acute and chronic cases remains limited. Currently, a range of treatment options may be offered, with a recent study identifying considerable variation in the care pathways experienced by patients in the United Kingdom. These range from medication and physical therapies to surgery. Evidence of the effectiveness of surgical interventions remains limited, with a Cochrane systematic review reporting insufficient proof of benefit and further trials judged to be unlikely. Cochrane reviews have identified one pharmaceutical treatment (prednisolone) as an effective treatment (versus placebo) for Bell's palsy, but only if administered within 72 h of symptom onset. – Use of adjunctive antiviral therapy was reported to be of uncertain value, although more recent evidence of its value in the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, the second most common cause of facial palsy, has emerged. In addition to medication, a number of physical therapy options are available. Facial exercise therapy (facial neuromuscular retraining) is the most widely evaluated. – A Cochrane review of physical therapies published in 2011 reported some evidence that facial exercise therapy could improve facial function for moderate paralysis and chronic cases and reduce sequelae in acute cases, but it recommended the need for further studies. We have therefore undertaken a systematic review to identify and appraise any further studies that have examined the effectiveness of facial exercise therapy. Updated evidence on effectiveness is required to inform the planned development of facial remote activity monitoring eyewear to enable telerehabilitation in a patient's own home.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111PfcaG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — antiviral monotherapy: Clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. Strong recommendation (against) based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of confidence in evidence: High. Evidence shows that antiviral therapy alone is no better than placebo with regard to facial nerve recovery in Bell's palsy and is inferior to steroid therapy with regard to facial nerve recovery rate, with acyclovir and valacyclovir the most extensively studied antivirals. The most comprehensive randomized controlled trial failed to find an improved rate of facial nerve recovery in 207 patients treated with valacyclovir alone, compared with 209 patients treated with placebo alone. Reported harms note gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) with rare severe reactions (hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, hepatic or renal failure), no serious adverse events were noted in the Bell's palsy literature, and antiviral therapy may carry an increased risk for pregnant patients. In summary, antiviral therapy alone (acyclovir or valacyclovir) is not recommended in the treatment of Bell's palsy due to lack of effectiveness of currently available drugs, unnecessary cost, and the potential for drug-related complications.

### The "Mirror effect plus protocol" for acute Bell's palsy: a randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up [^112aA4yg]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is a disabling condition for patients affected by it, particularly for those experiencing severe enduring sequelae despite an adequate medication intake. Recent systematic review reported the advantages of early facial rehabilitation combined with standard medication for moderately severe to total acute Bell's Palsy. Benefits of early facial rehabilitation and counseling are multifold: it helps guiding patients in not overstimulating their face and it allows for passive and specific soft tissue mobilization. Moreover, as loss of facial nerve activity leads to rapid changes in cortical representations, early intervention is desired to avoid a "learned paralysis".

Contrary to chronic Bell's Palsy, no specific facial therapy seems to stand out for the treatment of acute Bell's Palsy. As demonstrated by recent data, – interesting results could be achieved with mirror therapy. Our team developed an early intervention for patients with acute and moderately severe to total Bell's Palsy, using mirror therapy as the main tool. The "Mirror Effect Plus Protocol" or MEPP (see methods for details and our previous publication about the exact nature of MEPP) also integrates facial manipulations, motor imagery sessions, principles of motor learning, and components of facial neuromuscular retraining. Paolucci et al.also recently used mirror therapy and motor imagery with 22 patients suffering from facial palsy secondary to an acoustic neuroma resection. Their experimental (mirror therapy) group showed better recovery and fewer functional impairments than the control group, who received traditional facial neuromuscular retraining.

To date, no studies have reported on the long-terms effects of mirror therapy on patients with acute Bell's Palsy, by assessing simultaneously the perspective of clinicians with standardized scales, perspective of patients with patient-centered outcome measures, or perspective of naïve observers. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the long-term effects of the MEPP in acute Bell's Palsy compared to medical treatment and basic counseling alone, through those three perspectives.

Based on recent evidence, we hypothesized that the MEPP would help patients achieve better facial symmetry and a better-perceived quality of life, and that those effects would still be present at one-year post-onset. Also, based on contradictory evidence, we made the weak hypothesis that the MEPP would have a beneficial effect on the long-term development of synkinesis. Finally, based on the findings of Moverare et al.we hypothesized that the MEPP would have no effect on speech intelligibility.

### Efficacy of prednisolone for Bell palsy in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^1161DbqY]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Corticosteroids are used to treat the early stages of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell palsy) in children, but their effectiveness is uncertain. We set out to determine whether prednisolone improves the proportion of children with Bell palsy with complete recovery at 1 month.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of prednisolone in children presenting to emergency departments with Bell palsy. Patients aged 6 months to younger than 18 years were recruited within 72 hours after the symptom onset and were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of treatment with oral prednisolone (approximately 1 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial function at 1 month rated on the House-Brackmann scale. Secondary outcomes included facial function, adverse events, and pain up to 6 months. Target recruitment was n = 540 (270 per group).

Results

Between October 13, 2015, and August 23, 2020, 187 children were randomized (94 to prednisolone and 93 to placebo) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 1 month, the proportions of patients who had recovered facial function were 49% (n = 43/87) in the prednisolone group compared with 57% (n = 50/87) in the placebo group (risk difference -8.1%, 95% CI -22.8 to 6.7; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.3). At 3 months, these proportions were 90% (n = 71/79) for the prednisolone group vs 85% (n = 72/85) for the placebo group (risk difference 5.2%, 95% CI -5.0 to 15.3; aOR 1.2, 95% CI 0.4 to 3.0) and, at 6 months, 99% (n = 77/78) and 93% (n = 76/82), respectively (risk difference 6.0%, 95% CI -0.1 to 12.2; aOR 3.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 17.7). There were no serious adverse events and little evidence for group differences in secondary outcomes.

Discussion

In children with Bell palsy, the vast majority recover without treatment. This study, although underpowered, does not provide evidence that early treatment with prednisolone improves complete recovery.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that for children with Bell palsy, prednisolone does not significantly change recovery of complete facial function at 1 month. However, this study lacked the precision to exclude an important harm or benefit from prednisolone.
