## Question

grading of albuminuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about grading albuminuria and its integration into CKD classification and risk stratification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current KDIGO 2024 albuminuria categories and their thresholds. Then, I should verify the preferred measurement method and pre-analytical considerations. Next, I will review the need for confirmation due to biological variability. After that, I should integrate albuminuria with GFR into the CGA framework and explain the risk heat map. Then, I will examine prognostic implications and how albuminuria informs therapy selection. Finally, I will consider special populations, limitations, and practical implementation steps, making sure I double-check any legacy terminology and correct it where needed [^115kbQdq] [^1151q3ky] [^112g2Y3D].

> Let me first confirm the current categorical framework. KDIGO 2024 retains three albuminuria categories defined by albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in mg/g: A1 normal to mildly increased (< 30 mg/g), A2 moderately increased (30–299 mg/g), and A3 severely increased (≥ 300 mg/g), with approximate SI equivalents of < 3, 3–29, and ≥ 30 mg/mmol, respectively [^1149n6iE]. Wait, I initially thought A3 might be labeled as > 300 mg/g, but I should correct that: KDIGO 2024 uses ≥ 300 mg/g for A3, not strictly > 300 mg/g, so I need to ensure I report it as ≥ 300 mg/g to be precise [^1149n6iE].

> I need to check the preferred measurement approach. KDIGO 2024 recommends a first-morning spot urine for initial testing, with ACR as the preferred quantitative index, and if ACR is elevated on a random sample, it should be confirmed with a first-morning void to reduce diurnal and hydration-related variability; reagent strip positives should be confirmed by quantitative laboratory ACR whenever possible [^114dapSw] [^1175ZuJn]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: ACR adjusts for urine concentration, but creatinine excretion varies with sex, age, and muscle mass, so first-morning sampling and, when needed, timed collections help mitigate misclassification and improve reproducibility [^111Yd4cx] [^1144KNsB].

> Next, I should review confirmation strategy because of within-person variability. I need to ensure persistence is documented: confirm an elevated ACR with at least two additional tests over 3–6 months, and classify based on the majority result; transient elevations can occur with exercise, fever, infection, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, or marked hypertension, so I should repeat testing after these factors resolve before labeling someone with CKD due to albuminuria [^111VG1ea]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "two of three samples must be abnormal", but I should be precise: two of three in the same category is the conventional approach to improve reliability and reduce misclassification, which aligns with diabetes and CKD guidance on confirming albuminuria [^111VG1ea] [^112bBHEU].

> I will now examine integration with GFR into the CGA system. KDIGO 2024 endorses classifying CKD by Cause, GFR category (G1–G5), and Albuminuria category (A1–A3), which together provide a more granular prognosis than GFR alone; the risk heat map visually stratifies from green (low) to red (very high) risk based on the intersection of GFR and albuminuria, and this framework is retained in 2024 with emphasis on individualized risk assessment [^115kbQdq] [^113J7JTd]. Hold on, I should verify that the heat map concept and color coding are consistent with prior KDIGO iterations; yes, the risk gradient has been a consistent feature since 2012 and remains in 2024, supporting its use for counseling and monitoring frequency decisions [^113J7JTd].

> Let me consider prognostic implications across the albuminuria spectrum. Albuminuria independently predicts kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality, with risk rising continuously even below traditional thresholds; large meta-analyses and cohort data show that each approximately eightfold higher ACR associates with higher mortality and ESRD risk, and combining GFR with albuminuria substantially improves prediction of kidney failure compared with GFR alone [^111QW2Ju] [^1145qNUq]. I should double-check whether lower albuminuria levels still matter: yes, even ACR in the 10–29 mg/g range carries higher risk than < 10 mg/g, reinforcing the graded nature of risk without a clear lower bound [^114PCqxY].

> Next, I should review how albuminuria informs therapy. For patients with A2–A3 albuminuria, particularly with diabetes or hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated, and SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for CKD with albuminuria to slow kidney disease progression and reduce cardiovascular events; albuminuria reduction itself is a treatment target, with a 30% ACR reduction correlating with about a 19% lower hazard of kidney failure or doubling of creatinine across diverse interventions [^111nKzxh] [^112yXhTT] [^115MKfv3]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for SGLT2s beyond diabetes: yes, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY support benefit in CKD with albuminuria regardless of diabetes status, aligning with contemporary guidance [^112yXhTT].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and nuances. In diabetes, screen annually with ACR and eGFR, and remember that a substantial fraction of diabetic CKD is non-albuminuric, so eGFR assessment remains essential; in older adults, reduced GFR is common and must be interpreted in context, and albuminuria still adds prognostic value; in pregnancy, interpret ACR cautiously due to physiologic changes and consider obstetric collaboration [^112bBHEU]. Hold on, I should verify the non-albuminuric CKD point: multiple diabetes cohorts document GFR decline without albuminuria, supporting concurrent assessment of both markers rather than reliance on albuminuria alone [^115UqZcU].

> But wait, what about limitations and controversies. I should confirm that the historical terms "microalbuminuria" and "macroalbuminuria" have been retired in favor of A1–A3 to reflect the continuous risk relationship; additionally, laboratory variability in ACR measurement can exceed 40% across methods, so standardization and participation in quality assurance programs are critical, and when results are discordant or decisions hinge on accuracy, consider timed AER or repeat first-morning ACR to reduce misclassification [^112CrwN8] [^117FjbRp] [^111Yd4cx]. Let me reconsider whether ACR always approximates 24-hour AER: no, interindividual differences in creatinine excretion and muscle mass can create discrepancies, so consistent methods over time and awareness of sex-specific biases are important for longitudinal interpretation [^1144KNsB].

> I should double-check practical implementation steps. Use first-morning ACR for initial testing, confirm elevations with repeat testing in 3–6 months, document persistence, and then classify into A1–A3; integrate with GFR category to assign CGA and use the heat map to guide monitoring frequency and referral; monitor higher-risk patients more frequently, and consider nephrology referral for A3 albuminuria, rapidly changing ACR, or refractory albuminuria despite optimized renin–angiotensin blockade and risk-factor control [^1138ivYJ] [^1175ZuJn]. Hold on, I should verify that KDIGO 2024 supports using risk models incorporating eGFR and albuminuria to refine referral and preventive therapy decisions; yes, externally validated risk equations and the 3–5% 5-year kidney failure risk threshold can inform referral and intensity of care [^1124xu67] [^112pNGco].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is coherent: albuminuria is graded into A1, A2, and A3 by ACR, measured preferentially with first-morning spot urine and confirmed for persistence; it is then integrated with GFR and cause into the CGA framework to stratify risk and guide therapy, with higher albuminuria signaling greater risks of kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality and informing use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors; attention to pre-analytical factors, assay variability, and population-specific nuances improves accuracy and clinical decision-making [^115kbQdq] [^1149n6iE] [^112g2Y3D].

Albuminuria is graded by the **urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)** [^111Yd4cx] into three categories: **A1 (< 30 mg/g)**, **A2 (30–300 mg/g)**, and **A3 (> 300 mg/g)** [^1149n6iE]. These categories reflect increasing severity and risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^112sDakR] [^111QW2Ju]. ACR should be measured in a **first-morning spot urine** [^114dapSw]; if elevated, confirm with two additional tests over 3–6 months [^111VG1ea] to account for variability [^112cYWvN]. Persistent albuminuria is a key marker of kidney damage and is integrated with eGFR into the **CGA classification** [^115kbQdq] to guide risk stratification and management [^113J7JTd].

---

## Albuminuria categories and definitions

The **KDIGO 2024 guidelines** define albuminuria categories based on ACR as follows:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Acr (mg/g)** | **Acr (mg/mmol)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A1 | Normal to mildly increased | < 30 | < 3 |
| A2 | Moderately increased | 30–300 | 3–30 |
| A3 | Severely increased | > 300 | > 30 |

---

These categories replace the older terms "microalbuminuria" and "macroalbuminuria", which are no longer recommended [^112CrwN8].

---

## Clinical significance of albuminuria categories

Albuminuria is a **strong, independent predictor** of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality [^111QW2Ju] [^1171wmis]. Risk increases across ACR categories: A1 confers the lowest risk, A2 confers moderate risk, and A3 confers the highest risk [^114PCqxY].

---

## Measurement and confirmation of albuminuria

- **Initial testing**: Use a first-morning spot urine sample [^114dapSw] to measure ACR [^111Yd4cx].
- **Confirmation**: If ACR is ≥ 30 mg/g, confirm with two additional tests over 3–6 months [^111VG1ea] due to biological variability [^117HSGQS].
- **Factors affecting interpretation**: Consider exercise, infection, fever, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, and marked hypertension, which can transiently elevate ACR [^115UqZcU].

---

## Integration with CKD classification

Albuminuria is integrated with eGFR into the **CGA classification** (Cause, GFR, Albuminuria) [^115kbQdq] to provide a comprehensive assessment of CKD severity and prognosis [^113J7JTd]. This classification guides clinical decision-making and management strategies [^112g2Y3D].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **A1 (normal to mildly increased)**: Generally requires routine monitoring and management of cardiovascular risk factors [^112g2Y3D].
- **A2 (moderately increased)**: Indicates higher risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events; consider closer monitoring, blood pressure control, and potential pharmacological interventions (e.g. ACE inhibitors or ARBs) [^111nKzxh].
- **A3 (severely increased)**: Signifies high risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events; necessitates aggressive management, frequent monitoring, and specialist referral [^1124xu67].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Variability**: Albuminuria levels can fluctuate due to physiological and pathological factors, necessitating repeated measurements for accurate classification [^115UqZcU].
- **Alternative markers**: In certain populations (e.g. muscular individuals), alternative markers or adjusted equations may be considered to improve accuracy [^113QhceT].
- **Clinical context**: Albuminuria classification should always be interpreted within the broader clinical context, including patient demographics, comorbidities, and underlying causes of kidney disease [^112QdDyk].

---

Albuminuria is graded into three categories (A1, A2, A3) based on ACR, reflecting increasing severity and risk. Persistent albuminuria is a key marker of kidney damage and is integrated with eGFR into the CGA classification to guide risk stratification and management.

### The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO controversies conference report [^114cAf7s]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

### Definition and classification of chronic kidney disease: a position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^114vgs4Y]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. A simple definition and classification of kidney disease is necessary for international development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conducted a survey and sponsored a controversies conference to (1) provide a clear understanding to both the nephrology and nonnephrology communities of the evidence base for the definition and classification recommended by Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (K/DOQI), (2) develop global consensus for the adoption of a simple definition and classification system, and (3) identify a collaborative research agenda and plan that would improve the evidence base and facilitate implementation of the definition and classification of CKD. The K/DOQI definition and classification were accepted, with clarifications. CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for 3 months or more, irrespective of cause. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g in two of three spot urine specimens. GFR can be estimated from calibrated serum creatinine and estimating equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation or the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Kidney disease severity is classified into five stages according to the level of GFR. Kidney disease treatment by dialysis and transplantation should be noted. Simple, uniform classifications of CKD by cause and by risks for kidney disease progression and CVD should be developed.

### National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification [^111NhAoF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed ("spot") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists.

### Diagnosing chronic kidney disease [^1158RGKW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current state-of-the art in diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) using classification systems based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and kidney damage.

Recent Findings

CKD, as defined by current classification systems, has many pitfalls, but the presence and stage of CKD has important value in determining prognosis, particularly when the effects of albuminuria are added to eGFR SUMMARY: The diagnosis of CKD using current classification schema based on eGFR alone needs to be approached with some caution, particularly in the elderly without concomitant signs of kidney damage. The presence and magnitude of albuminuria has important diagnostic and prognostic significance.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification elements — The commentary work group supports the addition of albuminuria into the classification scheme of CKD and characterization of the level of albuminuria by its severity rather than the terms microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria, but views it premature to add cause of CKD to the classification scheme because there are currently no accurate methods to quantify risk based on cause of disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1171wmis]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114GRPqv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification — KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO 2012 states that KDIGO recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for evaluation and management, with primary recommendations to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. The commentary work group agreed with most KDIGO recommendations, particularly those regarding the definition and classification of CKD, but noted concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification. The foreword notes that the inherent imprecision of formulas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for CKD classification was often underappreciated, that stage 5 CKD came to be interpreted by some as "time for dialysis", and that albuminuria, not part of the 2002 classification scheme, was itself an independent predictor of important clinical outcomes and that a more precise degree of risk prediction became available.

### Renal albumin excretion in healthy young adults and its association with mortality risk in the US population [^116CD5qi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current classification systems do not specify a healthy normal range for urinary albumin excretion. Occult microvascular disease induced by a Western lifestyle may mean that normal values for apparently healthy adults exceed optimal levels defined by mortality risk.

Methods

Using a national population sample [the US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) cohort; n = 11 887], the distributions of albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and fractional excretion of albumin (FEalb) were studied in healthy young adults [ages 20–40years, without cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk factors]. The threshold for mortality risk prediction in the whole adult population sample was then studied across ACR/FEalb categories corresponding to quartiles for healthy young adults.

Results

ACR quartiles for healthy young adults were 2.7, 4.2 and 5.9mg/g in men and 3.8, 6.2 and 9.8mg/g in women. Increases in ACR below the medians for healthy young adults were not associated with increased mortality or with cardiovascular risk factors when tested in the whole adult population. Increases above this threshold were independently associated with mortality risk [hazard ratio 1.2 (95% confidence interval 1.1–1.4) and 1.8 (1.6–2.0) for Quartiles 3 and 4, respectively]. The prevalence of an optimal ACR below the mortality risk threshold was < 25% in the setting of diabetes, hypertension, age > 70years or CVD. Using FEalb to define quartiles of albuminuria gave the same findings.

Conclusion

Based on mortality risk in the whole adult population, there is an optimal range of albumin excretion (ACR < 6mg/g and 4mg/g for women and men, respectively). However, only half of even apparently healthy young US adults fall within this range.

4 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

4.1 Prognostic significance

The staging of CKD has traditionally been based on eGFR, a marker of kidney function strongly associated with kidney outcomes and mortality. However, CKD defined by low eGFR reflects advanced kidney damage and is considered a late marker of disease, limiting opportunities for early preventive interventions. Therefore, the 2012 KDIGO guidelines redefined CKD classification by introducing the CGA system, which incorporates 'Albuminuria' alongside 'Cause' and 'eGFR'. Unlike eGFR, albuminuria allows for the identification of CKD at earlier stages, when kidney function is still relatively preserved. This classification approach has been retained in the KDIGO 2024 guidelines, underscoring its continued relevance in CKD assessment and risk stratification.

The foundation for this new definition was provided, among others, by data from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End‐stage Disease (PREVEND) study, a prospective community‐based cohort of approximately 8500 participants. This study demonstrated that higher albuminuria identifies individuals at risk for cardiovascular morbidity and all‐cause mortality beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Further analyses from the PREVEND study revealed that changes in albuminuria are also associated with subsequent risk for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes and that the absolute benefits of interventions to improve prognosis are related to baseline albuminuria levels.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^111ioe8P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline: 2012 Update — research priorities in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) state that, given the limitations of albuminuria as an outcome measure, studies are needed to evaluate durability of effects on urinary albumin excretion, and the categorization of albuminuria outcomes should be based on a minimum of two of three consecutive urine samples being in the same category. Consider an indication for regulatory approval based on demonstration of a lasting reduction in urinary albumin excretion, but conditional upon firm commitment to continue long-term studies to determine effects on GFR (glomerular filtration rate) loss and clinically relevant outcomes. Evaluate the relative roles of ACE-Is (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), renin blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers on progression of DKD in patients with albuminuria. Kidney biopsy outcomes based on carefully measured structural variables that correlate strongly with GFR loss may reduce the duration of primary prevention or early intervention DKD clinical trials, and enzyme replacement for Fabry's Disease is given as an example. Clinical trials represent important opportunities to advance knowledge beyond addressing the primary hypotheses themselves, and protocols should include plans for acquiring and banking blood, urine, DNA, and other samples for eventual biomarker discovery and validation, with the DCCT cited as an example.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to classification, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to stage CKD using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation without the race variable and measure a first-morning urine sample for albumin-to-creatinine ratio to test for albuminuria.

### Integrating albuminuria and GFR in the assessment of diabetic nephropathy [^115qk2hS]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of diabetic nephropathy from research and clinical viewpoints depends on the assessment of two continuous variables, albumin excretion rate (AER) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These two parameters form the basis of both the European classification of five stages of diabetic nephropathy, assessed according to changes in AER and GFR (hyperfiltration, normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria and end-stage renal disease), and the National Kidney Foundation classification of five stages of chronic kidney disease based on categories of estimated GFR. Although increases in AER generally precede a decline in GFR, some patients follow a non-albuminuric pathway to renal impairment. In addition, studies indicate that GFR decreases in a linear fashion from normal or above-normal levels. Whether hyperfiltration is part of the pathogenetic process leading to diabetic nephropathy remains unclear. Ideally, both AER and GFR should be assessed at an early stage in patients being evaluated for diabetic nephropathy. New methods such as the use of cystatin-C-based equations for estimating GFR should be considered because current creatinine-based estimates are inaccurate at normal or high GFRs. Serial assessments of both AER and GFR might allow diabetic nephropathy to be diagnosed at early stages of the disease process that are selectively responsive to new interventions. The successful integration of AER categories with the recently defined stages of GFR represents a new challenge in the management of diabetic nephropathy.

### Unbiased kidney-centric molecular categorization of chronic kidney disease as a step towards precision medicine [^116KDRbi]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden affecting more than 850 million people worldwide, with a high cost of care and an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality. Biologically, CKD is a highly heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by sustained alterations in kidney structure and function arising from a wide range of etiologies and associated with a multitude of underlying molecular processes in the kidney. Even within the same diagnostic group, individual disease presentation, histopathologic features, progression rates, and treatment responses are variable, reflecting the underlying biological heterogeneity.

According to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines, CKD is classified into 5 stages (CKD 1–5), based on gradations of glomerular filtration rate estimated (eGFR) from serum creatinine level and degree of albuminuria. This classification system, now widely accepted, was a major achievement in the field, as it provided a common vocabulary and standardized approach for disease management. – However, the classification relies on systemic, indirect measures and therefore is agnostic to the local kidney pathophysiology. As a result, biologically diverse cases presenting with the same GFR or albuminuria values are classified under the same CKD-stage category, thereby precluding personalized prognosis and treatment options. Thus, a novel molecular dimension to use to categorize CKD is needed urgently, to fuel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic development toward precision medicine. –

Assessment of albuminuria status and renal function

Screening for microalbuminuria can be performed by measurement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection (preferred method); 24-h or timed collections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. Measurement of a spot urine for albumin only, whether by immunoassay or by using a dipstick test specific for microalbumin, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is somewhat less expensive but susceptible to false-negative and -positive determinations as a result of variation in urine concentration due to hydration and other factors.

Abnormalities of albumin excretion are defined in Table 14. Because of variability in urinary albumin excretion, two of three specimens collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have crossed one of these diagnostic thresholds. Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, CHF, marked hyperglycemia, and marked hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values.

Table 14
Definitions of abnormalities in albumin excretion

Information on presence of abnormal urine albumin excretion in addition to level of GFR may be used to stage CKD. The National Kidney Foundation classification (Table 15) is primarily based on GFR levels and therefore differs from other systems, in which staging is based primarily on urinary albumin excretion. Studies have found decreased GFR in the absence of increased urine albumin excretion in a substantial percentage of adults with diabetes. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of those with CKD in the setting of diabetes have little or no detectable albuminuria. Serum creatinine should therefore be measured at least annually in all adults with diabetes, regardless of the degree of urine albumin excretion.

Table 15
Stages of CKD

Serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and to stage the level of CKD, if present. Estimated GFR (eGFR) is commonly co-reported by laboratories or can be estimated using formulae such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation. Recent reports have indicated that the MDRD is more accurate for the diagnosis and stratification of CKD in patients with diabetes than the Cockcroft-Gault formula. GFR calculators are available at.

### Albuminuria: an underappreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease [^111NkAbW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevated levels of inflammatory markers are also associated with the presence of albuminuria, providing another link to the association of albuminuria with CVD. Many of these inflammation products are present in processes associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Beyond the shared pathogenetic processes, there is also a strong interplay of the cardiovascular and renal systems where dysfunction of one system can lead to dysfunction of the other, termed cardiorenal syndromes. In chronic cardiac dysfunction, compensatory mechanisms to improve cardiac output and reduce venous congestion can lead to renal hypoperfusion and kidney damage, including albuminuria.

Albuminuria is classified into 1 of 3 categories, A1 to A3, depending on the severity (Figure 2). There are several methods to detect albuminuria in daily clinical practice (Table 2). The gold standard is the 24‐hour measurement of albumin excretion rate (AER), as albuminuria has a high short‐term within‐person variability. However, this test is cumbersome and not convenient for routine clinical practice. The spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) is another method of measuring albuminuria, and it quantifies the amount of urinary albumin per gram of urinary creatinine, which accounts for differences in urine concentration. The use of this ratio is based on the assumption that creatinine excretion is approximately 1 g per day. Because the amount of creatinine excreted into the urine varies, the ratio of albumin to creatinine is only an approximation of 24‐hour AER.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^11668n5B]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guideline for evaluation, classification, and stratification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was published in 2002. The KDOQI guideline was well accepted by the medical and public health communities, but concerns and criticisms arose as new evidence became available since the publication of the original guidelines. KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for the evaluation and management of individuals with CKD based on new evidence published since 2002. The primary recommendations were to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. NKF-KDOQI convened a work group to write a commentary on the KDIGO guideline in order to assist US practitioners in interpreting the KDIGO guideline and determining its applicability within their own practices. Overall, the commentary work group agreed with most of the recommendations contained in the KDIGO guidelines, particularly the recommendations regarding the definition and classification of CKD. However, there were some concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification, in addition to certain recommendations for evaluation and management.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### Combining GFR and albuminuria to classify CKD improves prediction of ESRD [^1145qNUq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), relatively few individuals with CKD progress to ESRD. A better understanding of the risk factors for progression could improve the classification system of CKD and strategies for screening. We analyzed data from 65,589 adults who participated in the Nord-Trøndelag Health (HUNT 2) Study (1995 to 1997) and found 124 patients who progressed to ESRD after 10.3 yr of follow-up. In multivariable survival analysis, estimated GFR (eGFR) and albuminuria were independently and strongly associated with progression to ESRD: Hazard ratios for eGFR 45 to 59, 30 to 44, and 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were 6.7, 18.8, and 65.7, respectively (P < 0.001 for all), and for micro- and macroalbuminuria were 13.0 and 47.2 (P < 0.001 for both). Hypertension, diabetes, male gender, smoking, depression, obesity, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, physical activity and education did not add predictive information. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that considering both the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and eGFR substantially improved diagnostic accuracy. Referral based on current stages 3 to 4 CKD (eGFR 15 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) would include 4.7% of the general population and identify 69.4% of all individuals progressing to ESRD. Referral based on our classification system would include 1.4% of the general population without losing predictive power (i.e., it would detect 65.6% of all individuals progressing to ESRD). In conclusion, all levels of reduced eGFR should be complemented by quantification of urinary albumin to predict optimally progression to ESRD.

Epidemiology and prognosis

The definition and classification of CKD was introduced by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative in 2002, and the international guideline group Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes in 2004. Kidney damage refers to kidney abnormalities observed during clinical evaluation indicating a reduction in kidney function. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities in kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² that have been present for > 3 months and have an impact on health. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g (Figure 3). Because there is an increasing evidence indicating a continuous relationship between albuminuria and cardiorenal risk in the renal and nonrenal population, albuminuria is considered a prognostic marker for cardiovascular or renal risk, or both. Higher levels of albuminuria indicate a graded increase in risk for mortality independent of eGFR.

Figure 3.
Classification and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines. GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate. Adapted from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group.

CKD is increasingly recognized as a global public health problemimposing huge medical and financial burdens on societies and health care systems with an estimated prevalence of 13.4% globally. The worldwide rise in the prevalence of CKD is accompanied by an increase in patients reaching CKD stage 5 requiring kidney replacement therapy. Currently, about 3 million patients are receiving kidney replacement therapy for CKD stage 5D worldwide out of 10 million who would qualify for kidney replacement therapy; these numbers are expected to grow by 50% to 100% until 2030, (Figure 4). Reasons for the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD, among others, include aging populations, increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and a low detection rate and therapeutic inertia in the early stages of CKD.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^117FjbRp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Standardised reporting and handling practices are crucial for ensuring consistent and reliable urine ACR results. Urine albumin concentration can be measured in various ways, including immunoturbidimetric, immunonephelometric and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) methods. Ideally, measurement should be traceable to an international standard, but this has not yet been fully implemented. Consequently, laboratory variability can exceed 40% due to methodological differences, significantly affecting result interpretation. Proper storage and handling are also essential to prevent albumin degradation and ensure accuracy in detecting and monitoring kidney disease. Fresh urine samples provide the most reliable results. If immediate analysis is not possible, albumin remains stable in urine stored at 2–8°C for up to 7 days. Prolonged storage at −20°C can lead to albumin loss, whereas samples stored at −80°C maintain stable albumin concentrations, albeit with slightly increased variability. Anyway, precipitates formed during refrigeration or freezing should be redissolved by warming samples to room temperature and mixing before analysis. Variability in laboratory methods continues to challenge consistent albuminuria classification and CKD risk stratification. Efforts are currently under way to develop certified reference materials and standardised measurement procedures, including the use of LC–MS/MS‐based candidate reference measurement procedures to improve consistency across laboratories. Until these reference systems become widely available, laboratories should participate in external quality assessment schemes for urine albumin, creatinine and ACR to ensure accurate and reliable testing.

3.2 Reference values

The reference values for albuminuria have evolved based on historical and practical considerations. Consensus on definitions using albumin excretion and concentrations emerged in the mid‐1990s, including the introduction of sex‐specific ACR cut‐offs. At that time, the most sensitive strips detected albuminuria at a threshold of 20 mg/L. The lower limit for microalbuminuria (30 mg/24 h) was derived by multiplying this threshold by an average daily urine output of 1.5 L. The upper limits of 200 mg/L and 300 mg/24 h reflected the sensitivity of earlier albumin sticks, which detected concentrations between 100 and 300 mg/L. These cut‐offs are therefore somewhat arbitrary, as they were not established through prospective studies to define optimal thresholds based on prevalence or prognostic significance.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^112yEMN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73 m². We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73 m²) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^115xrZhi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30–300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5–7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^115PF1g2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

KDIGO guidelines recommend that nephrologists approach kidney disease classification as well as prognosis with a composite of cause, GFR categories (index of kidney function in health and disease), and albuminuria categories (marker of kidney damage). Independent of eGFR, albuminuria has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney events as well as cognitive decline in addition to overall mortality. In line with the eGFR‐based estimates, KDIGO guidelines agree that eGFR values < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² correspond with severe kidney impairment irrespective of the degree of albuminuria. However, they deviate from eGFR‐based categorization for eGFR values ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as demonstrated in Table 1.

Table 1
CKD classification

This eGFR and albuminuria‐based categorization was developed by KDIGO based on correlation of these parameters with diagnosis and progression of CKD in subjects with various forms of kidney diseases and has been applied successfully by nephrologists for almost a decade. It is worthwhile testing whether this algorithm may serve as a better predictor of drug pharmacokinetics as well and thus provide a more nuanced and accurate framework for dose modifications of drugs whose exposure is impacted by kidney impairment.

RISK ASSESSMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CKD

A summary of the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline recommendation statements and practice points on the risk assessment of people with CKD is presented in Table 2.

Table 2:

Summary of recommendation statements and practice points relevant to risk assessment in people with CKD in the 2024 KDIGO Guideline and differences from the 2012 KDIGO Guideline.

Monitoring of CKD

Monitoring eGFR and albuminuria in both adults and children with CKD is important not only to update staging for prognosis but also to guide clinical decisions. Because the KDIGO CKD staging classification based on eGFR and albuminuria is based on future kidney failure risk, their recommendation is to monitor those at higher risk of progression more frequently (e.g. they suggest monitoring kidney function and albuminuria once annually to people with CKD G1A2, but thrice annually to people with CKD G1A3, and consider even increasing this depending on the underlying aetiology of CKD). While the recommendation makes sense, the challenge lies in its implementation. European healthcare systems, as in other parts of the world, are affected by a severe under-recognition of CKD. While creatinine is measured in healthcare for many indications (and in most European healthcare systems eGFR is automatically reported), albuminuria screening and monitoring is still the bottleneck. For example, in a North European evaluation of processes of CKD care, only about a third of patients with incident CKD stages 3–5 received albuminuria monitoring within the following 18 months. Strategies to improve monitoring rates could involve educational campaigns to primary care and general physicians as well as individuals at high risk of CKD. Indeed, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline helpfully provides a list of at-risk individuals (Table 3). Economic incentives have been successfully shown in the UK to improve monitoring rates. In settings with less access to laboratory services, utilisation of novel and accurate POCT tools could also be potentially useful.

### Urine albumin-creatinine ratio versus albumin excretion for albuminuria staging: a prospective longitudinal cohort study [^112sDakR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

New guidelines advocate the use of albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a urine sample instead of 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) for staging albuminuria. Concern has been expressed that this may result in misclassification for reasons including interindividual differences in urinary creatinine excretion.

Study Design

Prospective longitudinal cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We examined 7,623 participants of the PREVEND and RENAAL studies for reclassified when using ACR instead of 24-hour UAE, the characteristics of reclassified participants, and their outcomes. Albuminuria was categorized into 3 ACR and UAE categories: < 30, 30 to 300, and > 300mg/g or mg/24 h, respectively.

Predictors

Baseline ACR and 24-hour UAE.

Outcomes

Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality.

Results

When using ACR in the early morning void instead of 24-hour UAE, 88% of participants were classified in corresponding albuminuria categories. 307 (4.0%) participants were reclassified to a higher, and 603 (7.9%), to a lower category. Participants who were reclassified to a higher ACR category in general had a worse CV risk profile compared with nonreclassified participants, whereas the reverse was true for participants reclassified to a lower ACR category. Similarly, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that reclassification to a higher ACR category was associated with a tendency for increased risk for CV morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality, whereas reclassification to a lower ACR category was associated with a tendency for lower risk. Net reclassification improvement, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of follow-up, was 0.107 (P = 0.002) for CV events and 0.089 (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality.

Limitations

Early morning void urine collection instead of spot urine collection.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that there is high agreement between early morning void ACR and 24-hour UAE categories. Reclassification is therefore limited, but when present, is generally indicative of the presence of CV risk factors and prognosis.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114jogtT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — loss of GFR within CKD stage 1 in people with elevated urinary albumin excretion may already represent DKD, and formulae estimating GFR from serum creatinine values are problematic in their application to patients with diabetes. Measures of albuminuria in combination with estimates of GFR will serve as useful guides in assessing and managing patients with diabetes and CKD, and the Work Group developed a novel grid (Table 6) to combine staging by albuminuria classification and GFR, although evidence to define DKD probabilities within each box is lacking. The diagnosis and staging of DKD in an individual patient should include an evaluation of other related factors, and apart from albuminuria and GFR, patients should be evaluated for the presence of hypertension, poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and smoking. A family history of DKD or hypertension and/or CVD and stroke in persons without diabetes also is relevant, and because DKD typically does not occur in isolation, patients with DKD should have regular surveillance for other microvascular and macrovascular complications.

Albuminuria as a surrogate marker — KDOQI notes that relationships between glomerular structural lesions and the presence or absence of microalbuminuria in diabetes are not straightforward, intrapatient variability in albuminuria measurements is large with controversy about standardization, and therefore the evidence for using albuminuria as a surrogate marker for clinical outcomes was not sufficiently strong to merit a guideline statement.

### Time to abandon microalbuminuria? [^115HyvzB]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The term microalbuminuria — a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) between 20 and 200 microg/min — has been introduced to identify subjects at increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between albuminuria and risk is not restricted to the microalbuminuric range and extends to as low as 2–5 microg/min. On the contrary, the increase of UAE above 200 microg/min (macroalbuminuria) heralds the onset of proteinuria (urinary protein excretion above 0.5 g/24 h) and progressive renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria is a component of the metabolic syndrome and may represent a marker of the increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Proteinuria is a sign of established kidney damage and plays a direct pathogenic role in the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria reflects functional and potentially reversible abnormalities initiated by glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, a size-selective dysfunction of the glomerular barrier normally associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline that may result in end-stage renal disease. Thus, the limit of 200 microg/min segregates patients with albuminuria or proteinuria who are at quite different risk. Among subjects with albuminuria, however, there is a continuous relationship between albumin excretion and risk and no lower bound between normal albuminuria and microalbuminuria can be identified that segregates subjects at different risk. Thus, the terms microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria could be replaced by the concepts of albuminuria- and proteinuria-associated diseases. Future studies are needed to identify levels of albuminuria below which therapy is no longer beneficial.

### What is the evidence that microalbuminuria is a predictor of cardiovascular disease events? [^116vTsgd]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes recently published studies evaluating the association between microalbuminuria and the development of cardiovascular disease events either in the presence of diabetes or hypertension, or in the population as a whole.

Recent Findings

Prospective studies confirm that microalbuminuria is predictive, independently of classical risk factors, of cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality within groups of patients with diabetes or hypertension and in the general population. However, these studies suggest that levels of albuminuria below the conventional cutoff point definition of microalbuminuria are significantly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiological mechanism underyling this association is still uncertain. Data from recent intervention studies suggest that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, as well as intensive multi-factorial intervention including behaviour modification and targeted pharmacotherapy in patients with microalbuminuria, offers significant reduction in cardiovascular and renal morbidity in people with albuminuria.

Summary

Future absolute risk prediction scores for primary cardiovascular events could include microalbuminuria as a modifiable risk factor. The association between levels of albuminuria and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals within the normoalbuminuric range questions the current categorical definition of microalbuminuria. Intensive multifactorial interventions, including the use of agents that affect the renin-angiotensin pathway, are effective in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with microalbuminuria and diabetes or hypertension.

### 'Progressive diabetic nephropathy. how useful is microalbuminuria? contra' [^117LC9VE]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The concept of microalbuminuria has been central to the development of clinical practice and research in the area of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, in recent times, the value of a paradigm of DKD based solely on microalbuminuria has been questioned. Although both the absolute level and rate of change of microalbuminuria are linked to the development and progression of DKD, microalbuminuria on its own lacks the necessary sensitivity or specificity to accurately predict kidney outcomes for people with diabetes. The development of microalbumiuria can no longer be viewed as a committed and irreversible stage of DKD, as spontaneous remission is now reported as a common occurrence. In addition, the absence of microalbuminuria or its progression to proteinuria does not signify that an individual patient is safe from a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furthermore, although reductions in albuminuria within the microalbuminuric range can be linked to a slower GFR decline in observational studies, this relationship has not been robustly demonstrated in intervention studies. Conclusions regarding the kidney health of individuals with diabetes will continue to be flawed if an inappropriate emphasis is placed on the presence or absence of albuminuria or changes in albuminuria within the microalbuminuric range. This has important implications in terms of undermining the value of microalbuminuria as a surrogate renal end point for intervention trials. There is a need to develop broader models of progressive DKD that include novel pathways and risk markers apart from those related to the traditional 'albuminuric pathway' to renal impairment.

Urine albumin reporting and terminology — reporting albumin or total protein as a ratio to urine creatinine helps account for concentration variability in spot samples, but direct conversion from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to albumin excretion rate (AER) is cautioned: "Assuming a creatinine excretion of 1 g/d, an ACR of 1,000 mg/g would translate to an albumin excretion rate (AER) of 1,000 mg/d. However, this assumption is not correct". Implementation notes that "Clinicians may be resistant to switching from urine protein to urine albumin", and the commentary states, "we endorse the elimination of 'microalbuminuria' and 'macroalbuminuria' from the diagnostic testing lexicon".

DKD is now defined, in part, by increased urinary albumin excretion and is divided into microalbuminuria, a modest elevation associated with stable kidney function but a greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure, and macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation associated with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased systemic blood pressure, and a high risk of kidney failure. These generalizations do not apply in all cases because people with normal urinary albumin excretion may have advanced DKD, whereas those with microalbuminuria may have either substantial or no pathological evidence of kidney damage; because diabetes is highly prevalent, some individuals with diabetes may have other types of CKD, although in most cases, clinical measures may be used to diagnose DKD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m² or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### Prevention of cardiorenal damage: importance of albuminuria [^115ucSwj]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is projected to become a leading global cause of death by 2040, and its early detection is critical for effective and timely management. The current definition of CKD identifies only advanced stages, when kidney injury has already destroyed > 50% of functioning kidney mass as reflected by an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > six-fold higher than physiological levels (i.e. > 30 mg/g). An elevated urinary albumin-excretion rate is a known early predictor of future cardiovascular events. There is thus a 'blind spot' in the detection of CKD, when kidney injury is present but is undetectable by current diagnostic criteria, and no intervention is made before renal and cardiovascular damage occurs. The present review discusses the CKD 'blind spot' concept and how it may facilitate a holistic approach to CKD and cardiovascular disease prevention and implement the call for albuminuria screening implicit in current guidelines. Cardiorenal risk associated with albuminuria in the high-normal range, novel genetic and biochemical markers of elevated cardiorenal risk, and the role of heart and kidney protective drugs evaluated in recent clinical trials are also discussed. As albuminuria is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, starting from levels not yet considered in the definition of CKD, the implementation of opportunistic or systematic albuminuria screening and therapy, possibly complemented with novel early biomarkers, has the potential to improve cardiorenal outcomes and mitigate the dismal 2040 projections for CKD and related cardiovascular burden.

### Albuminuria in cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic disorders: a state-of-the-art review [^112icoTg]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria-increased urine albumin excretion-is associated with cardiovascular mortality among patients with diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure, as well as among adults with few cardiovascular risk factors. Many authors have hypothesized that albuminuria reflects widespread endothelial dysfunction, but additional work is needed to uncover whether albuminuria is directly pathologic or causative of cardiovascular disease. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio is an attractive, unifying biomarker of cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic conditions that may be useful for identifying and monitoring disease trajectory. However, albuminuria may develop through unique mechanisms across these distinct clinical phenotypes. This state-of-the-art review discusses the role of albuminuria in cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic conditions; identifies potential pathways linking albuminuria to adverse outcomes; and provides practical approaches to screening and managing albuminuria for clinical cardiologists. Future research is needed to determine how broadly and how frequently to screen patients for albuminuria, whether it is cost-effective to treat low-grade albuminuria (10–30 mg/g), and how to equitably offer newer antiproteinuric therapies across the spectrum of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic diseases.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^112g2Y3D]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment in people with CKD — overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories states the following practice points: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD. Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

Other drugs, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and β-blockers, should be used as additional therapy to further lower blood pressure in patients already treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs or as alternate therapy in the rare individual unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Studies in patients with varying stages of nephropathy have shown that protein restriction helps slow the progression of albuminuria, GFR decline, and occurrence of ESRD. Protein restriction should be considered particularly in patients whose nephropathy seems to be progressing despite optimal glucose and blood pressure control and use of ACE inhibitor and/or ARBs.

Assessment of albuminuria status and renal function

Screening for microalbuminuria can be performed by measurement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection (preferred method); 24-h or timed collections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. Measurement of a spot urine for albumin only, whether by immunoassay or by using a dipstick test specific for microalbumin, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is somewhat less expensive but susceptible to false-negative and -positive determinations as a result of variation in urine concentration due to hydration and other factors.

Abnormalities of albumin excretion are defined in Table 12. Because of variability in urinary albumin excretion, two of three specimens collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have crossed one of these diagnostic thresholds. Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, CHF, marked hyperglycemia, and marked hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values.

Information on presence of abnormal urine albumin excretion in addition to level of GFR may be used to stage CKD. The National Kidney Foundation classification (Table 13) is primarily based on GFR levels and therefore differs from other systems, in which staging is based primarily on urinary albumin excretion. Studies have found decreased GFR in the absence of increased urine albumin excretion in a substantial percentage of adults with diabetes. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of those with CKD in the setting of diabetes have little or no detectable albuminuria. Serum creatinine should therefore be measured at least annually in all adults with diabetes, regardless of the degree of urine albumin excretion.

Serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and to stage the level of CKD, if present. GFR can be estimated using formulae such as the Cockroft-Gault equation or a prediction formula using data from the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease study. GFR calculators are available at. Many clinical laboratories now report estimated GFR in addition to serum creatinine.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116qhouk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and KDIGO classification — CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that persists below 60 mL/minute/ 1.73 m² for > 3 months constitutes CKD, even in the absence of kidney damage markers or other abnormalities. KDIGO emphasizes identification of CKD etiology and classification of severity according to both GFR level (6 strata) and albuminuria level (3 strata), with albuminuria categories expressed as mg albumin per g creatinine in urine: A1 (< 30 mg/g), A2 (30–300 mg/g), and A3 (> 300 mg/g); GFR categories are G1 (≥ 90), G2 (60–89), G3a (45–59), G3b (30–44), G4 (15–29), and G5 (< 15). GFR and albuminuria are reported as independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes including CKD progression, ESRD, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^113U7LTM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria, the abnormal presence of albumin in urine, is a key marker of kidney damage and a strong predictor of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Its clinical significance has evolved from early historical observations to its current role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) detection, risk stratification and treatment monitoring. Advances in measurement techniques and evidence from large-scale studies have reinforced its prognostic value, particularly in guiding interventions such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Albuminuria assessment is now integrated into CKD staging, cardiovascular risk prediction models and therapy selection. Despite its established utility, challenges remain, including measurement variability, assay standardisation and under-utilisation in clinical practice. This review provides a practical update on albuminuria testing, summarising its historical development, technical aspects and clinical implications, and emphasising its role in CKD management and cardiovascular risk assessment.

KDOQI commentary — blood pressure targets and renin–angiotensin system blockade in CKD: The guideline notes that the recommended target blood pressure for patients with CKD without albuminuria is ≤ 140/90 mm Hg, and the 2004 KDOQI guideline recommended ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with CKD, while the blood pressure goal of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for individuals with albuminuria is based on relatively low-quality evidence (2D). It further states that in patients with CKD, JNC 8 recommended initiation of treatment for blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mm Hg for patients of all ages without differentiation of targets by level of proteinuria. Additionally, the KDIGO guideline recommends an ACE inhibitor or ARB for patients with diabetes whose urinary albumin excretion is 30–300 mg/24 h and for all patients, with and without diabetes, whose urinary albumin excretion is > 300 mg/24 h, and it agrees to use an ACE inhibitor or ARB and not the combination due to accumulating evidence of harm with combination therapy.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

### Conceptual model of CKD: applications and implications [^111JNNmB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The conceptual model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was developed by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and subsequently revised and adopted by an international consensus under the auspices of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) in 2005. This model includes concepts of definition, staging, outcomes, and treatment, as well as risk factors for the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Treatments are available for patients with risk factors and for each stage of CKD; these include slowing the progression of kidney disease, preventing and treating the complications of decreased glomerular filtration rate, and reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors and treating cardiovascular disease. In principle, measures to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment could reduce adverse outcomes, improve the quality of life, and prolong the survival of individuals with CKD. The conceptual model for CKD is now being applied to a public health approach for the prevention of the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Primary prevention is defined as prevention of CKD; secondary and tertiary prevention are defined as improving outcomes of patients with CKD stages 1 to 4 and kidney failure (CKD stage 5), respectively. The conceptual model has also fostered debate about important questions: Is CKD a disease or a cardiovascular disease risk-factor condition? Do all patients with CKD need to be referred to a nephrologist? What does CKD care include? Should the classification be modified to include cause of disease and prognosis? Can CKD evolve from acute kidney disease, and is CKD reversible? Is albuminuria a manifestation of a kidney disease or systemic endothelial dysfunction? Is the age-related decrease in glomerular filtration rate normal or abnormal, and should we change the definition of CKD in the elderly? A combination of immediate action, data gathering, and research to establish the efficacy, effectiveness, and costs related to CKD are needed to respond to CKD as a public health problem.

### Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria are associated with mortality and end-stage renal disease. A collaborative meta-analysis of kidney disease population cohorts [^111QW2Ju]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

We studied here the independent associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria with mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We performed a collaborative meta-analysis of 13 studies totaling 21,688 patients selected for CKD of diverse etiology. After adjustment for potential confounders and albuminuria, we found that a 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² lower eGFR below a threshold of 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² was significantly associated with mortality and ESRD (pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.47 and 6.24, respectively). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for both HR estimates. After adjustment for risk factors and eGFR, an eightfold higher albumin- or protein-to-creatinine ratio was significantly associated with mortality (pooled HR 1.40) without evidence of significant heterogeneity and with ESRD (pooled HR 3.04), with significant heterogeneity between HR estimates. Lower eGFR and more severe albuminuria independently predict mortality and ESRD among individuals selected for CKD, with the associations stronger for ESRD than for mortality. Thus, these relationships are consistent with CKD stage classifications based on eGFR and suggest that albuminuria provides additional prognostic information among individuals with CKD.

### Comparison of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio and albumin excretion rate in the diabetes control and complications trial / epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications study [^1144KNsB]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare random urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) with timed urine albumin excretion rate (AER) in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A total of 1186 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study provided spot urine specimens concurrent with 4-hour timed urine collections. ACR and AER were compared using Bland-Altman plots, cross-classification of albuminuria status and its change over time, and within-person variability.

Results

Despite moderate correlation (r = 0.62), ACR levels (mg/g) were lower than AER levels (mg/24 hr). This difference was greatest for men. Gender-specific estimated AER (eAER) values were empirically derived from ACR. Comparing the eAER with measured AER, agreement of prevalent microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria classification was fair to moderate, and classification of change in albuminuria status over time was different. Intraclass correlations were 0.697 for ACR and 0.803 for AER. Effects of DCCT intensive versus conventional diabetes therapy on urine albumin excretion or classification of albuminuria were similar using the eAER versus measured AER, as were the effects of the previous glycosylated hemoglobin.

Conclusions

Systematic differences exist between urine ACR and AER, related to gender and other determinants of muscle mass. Use of ACR (or eAER) versus AER yields differences in classification of prevalent albuminuria states and changes in albuminuria states over time. These findings support the use of consistent ascertainment methods over time and further efforts to standardize and optimally interpret measurement of urine albumin excretion.

KDOQI commentary — referral refinements for albuminuria and ACE-inhibitor/ARB issues: We agree that the consideration of both GFR and albuminuria will guide appropriate referrals and that referral of all patients with CKD stage 4 or worse will promote interventions to delay progression and reduce CKD complications; in the opinion of the commentary work group, 2 groups of patients who should be referred are those with side effects or contraindications to ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy, but albuminuria > 300 mg/g or nephrotic-range albuminuria or proteinuria; we suggest modifying the list above to add questions about the etiology of albuminuria and difficulty with decreasing level of albuminuria despite institution of ACE-inhibitor or ARB therapy.

### Determining the optimal protocol for measuring an albuminuria class transition in clinical trials in diabetic kidney disease [^112hiwfq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Albuminuria class transition (normo- to micro- to macroalbuminuria) is used as an intermediate end point to assess renoprotective drug efficacy. However, definitions of such class transition vary between trials. To determine the most optimal protocol, we evaluated the approaches used in four clinical trials testing the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system intervention on albuminuria class transition in patients with diabetes: the BENEDICT, the DIRECT, the ALTITUDE, and the IRMA-2 Trial. The definition of albuminuria class transition used in each trial differed from the definitions used in the other trials by the number (one, two, or three) of consecutively collected urine samples at each study visit, the time interval between study visits, the requirement of an additional visit to confirm the class transition, and the requirement of a percentage increase in albuminuria from baseline in addition to the class transition. In Cox regression analysis, neither increasing the number of urine samples collected at a single study visit nor differences in the other variables used to define albuminuria class transition altered the average drug effect. However, the SEM of the treatment effect increased (decreased precision) with stricter end point definitions, resulting in a loss of statistical significance. In conclusion, the optimal albuminuria transition end point for use in drug intervention trials can be determined with a single urine collection for albuminuria assessment per study visit. A confirmation of the end point or a requirement of a minimal percentage change in albuminuria from baseline seems unnecessary.

### The public health dimension of chronic kidney disease: what we have learnt over the past decade [^112kje8q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Much progress has been made in chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemiology in the last decade to establish CKD as a condition that is common, harmful and treatable. The introduction of the new equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the publication of international reference standards for creatinine and cystatin measurement paved the way for improved global estimates of CKD prevalence. The addition of albuminuria categories to the staging of CKD paved the way for research linking albuminuria and GFR to a wide range of renal and cardiovascular adverse outcomes. The advent of genome-wide association studies ushered in insights into genetic polymorphisms underpinning some types of CKD. Finally, a number of new randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have informed evidence-based guidelines for the treatment and prevention of CKD. In this review, we discuss the lessons learnt from epidemiological investigations of the staging, etiology, prevalence and prognosis of CKD between 2007 and 2016.

### A meta-analysis of albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure [^115MKfv3]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Albuminuria is a central biomarker in chronic kidney disease (CKD), used for the detection and prognosis of the disease. In clinical trials assessing CKD progression, change in the level of albuminuria is a candidate surrogate endpoint for kidney failure. Evaluation of the validity of this surrogate endpoint across a diverse range of interventions and populations is required to support its further acceptance. Here, in an individual participant data analysis of 48 randomized controlled trials (studies) involving 85,681 participants, we assessed the association between treatment effects on 6-month urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) change and the established clinical endpoint of kidney failure or doubling of serum creatinine concentrations. Across all trials, each 30% reduction in the geometric mean of the UACR in the treatment group relative to the control group was associated with an average of 19% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 5–30%); median coefficient of determination (R²) = 0.66 (95% BCI: 0.06–0.98). There was no clear evidence that this association varied by CKD etiology. These results provide further support for use of albuminuria change as a surrogate endpoint in CKD clinical trials.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

### Early changes of kidney function are a tell for heart disease risk [^115jaXvk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The estimated global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the adult population ranges from 8% to 16%. This includes people with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 60 mL/min) and normal. Global prevalence rates of CKD are rising as a result of aging in the global population, with more diabetes, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. Classification by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), divides patients into glomerular filtration rate categories G1 to G5 and 3 albuminuria categories A1 to A3 (Figure). The heat map indicates not only increased renal risk but also increased cardiovascular risk. Twenty years ago, GO demonstrated the striking association between lower eGFR levels and higher risks of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization in a large community‐based population from the Kaiser Permanente Renal Registry. The rate of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD in people with increased cardiovascular risk is generally 10 fold that of progression to dialysis.

Figure
Current chronic kidney disease (CKD) nomenclature used by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health. CKD is classified based on cause, GFR category (G1–G5), and albuminuria category (A1–A3): green indicates low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no CKD); yellow, moderately increased risk; orange, high risk; and red, very high risk. GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate. Reproduced from Cheung et alunder the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC‐BY‐NC‐ND) license.

The article by Choi and jacobs in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) seeks to address the importance of urine albumin levels together with the level of kidney function as a risk enhancer for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in participants of the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Disease in Young Adults) cohort, aged 27 to 41 years with no history of CVD, early in the natural history of CKD. They point out that the American Heart Association — American College of Cardiology 2018 Cholesterol Guideline uses only eGFR for the definition of CKD. Other groups, such as the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseaseand the 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice, include abnormal albuminuria with normal eGFR.

### Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria for detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney disease in adults: a systematic review [^111Yd4cx]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Because early-stage kidney disease is asymptomatic and is associated with both morbidity and mortality, laboratory measurements are required for its detection.

Objective

To summarize evidence supporting the use of laboratory tests for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to detect and stage acute kidney injury, acute kidney diseases and disorders, and chronic kidney disease in adults.

Evidence Review

We reviewed recent guidelines from various professional groups identified via the National Guideline Clearing House and author knowledge, and systematically searched MEDLINE for other sources of evidence for selected topics.

Findings

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines define and stage acute and chronic kidney diseases by GFR and albuminuria. For initial assessment of GFR, measuring serum creatinine and reporting estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 equation is recommended. If confirmation of GFR is required because of conditions that affect serum creatinine independent of GFR (eg, extremes of muscle mass or diet), or interference with the assay, cystatin C should be measured and estimated GFR should be calculated and reported using cystatin C (eGFRcys) and serum creatinine (eGFRcr-cys) or GFR should be measured directly using a clearance procedure. Initial assessment of albuminuria includes measuring urine albumin and creatinine in an untimed spot urine collection and reporting albumin-to-creatinine ratio. If confirmation of albuminuria is required because of diurnal variation or conditions affecting creatinine excretion, such as extremes of muscle mass or diet, the albumin excretion rate should be measured from a timed urine collection.

Conclusions and Relevance

Detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney diseases can be relatively simple. Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with kidney disease, early diagnosis is important and should be pursued in at-risk populations.

### Microalbuminuria as an early marker for cardiovascular disease [^113kN1bB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Excretion of albumin in the urine is highly variable, ranging from nondetectable quantities to milligrams of albumin and even grams of albumin. Microalbuminuria is defined as low levels of urinary albumin excretion of 30 to 300 mg/d. Microalbuminuria is highly prevalent; in hypertensive and diabetic populations, its prevalence varies from 10 to 40%. It is interesting that microalbuminuria also is found frequently in seemingly healthy individuals (5 to 7%). The variable excretion of albumin in the urine is related to the risk for the individual to develop cardiovascular (CV) disease: Absence or very low levels of albuminuria is associated with low CV risk, whereas the CV risk increases markedly with increasing amount of albumin in the urine (even within the now considered normal range). The predictive power of urinary albumin levels for CV risk is independent of other CV risk factors and not only is present in individual with diabetes and/or hypertension but also in healthy individuals. Treatments that lower albuminuria are associated with CV protection, as demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials of patients with diabetes as well as in patients with hypertension. There is preliminary evidence that albuminuria lowering is CV protective in healthy individuals with an elevated albumin excretion rate. Differences between individuals in their level of albumin excretion are already observed at a very early age (just after birth). In fact, the interindividual variability seems to be relatively constant in the first 5 decades of life, indicating that microalbuminuria is not necessarily a consequence of vascular damage at later age. Higher levels of urinary albumin seem to reflect the ordinary interindividual variability in (renal and systemic) endothelial function. Experimental data show that between strains and even within strains, rats at young age show a remarkable difference in individual endothelial function, and this is strongly related to the susceptibility of that rat to organ damage. In conclusion, albuminuria seems to be a sensitive marker very early in life for the susceptibility of an individual to CV disease. It therefore may be an ideal target for early primary prevention using CV-protective therapy regimens.

### Biopsy-proven CKD etiology and outcomes: the chronic kidney disease Japan cohort (CKD-JAC) study [^111bsCwd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines advocate the cause–glomerular filtration rate–albuminuria classification for predicting outcomes.
Instead of using the etiology of chronic kidney disease, only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria are usually used in risk stratification.

What this study adds?

Past kidney biopsy results contribute additional value to conventional risk stratification by eGFR and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio in predicting important outcomes for patients with CKD.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

The results will pave the way for incorporating the 'C' element by medical chart review in predicting outcomes, which was advocated in the 2012 KDIGO guidelines.

### Too much nephrology? The CKD epidemic is real and concerning. A CON view [^1173VebH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) clearly depends on its definition, and the definition used most often is the one proposed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines in 2012: 'CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3months, with implications for health'. Abnormality of kidney function is a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60mL/min/1.73 m2, and the most frequently used marker of kidney damage is the presence of albuminuria [albumin excretion rate > 30mg/24h or albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) > 30mg/g (or 3mg/mmol)]. However, two major aspects of this definition could explain why CKD prevalence is, in our view, overstated in most epidemiological studies. First, the fixed threshold at 60mL/min/1.73 m2 is questionable because normal GFR decreases with age. This and the profound consequence it has on CKD epidemiology will be illustrated. The second aspect of the definition is the criterion of chronicity, which is ignored by the vast majority of epidemiological studies. In other words, confirming CKD (low GFR and/or high ACR) is mandatory. Indeed, a large proportion of subjects with a low first GFR level has a normal GFR level when tested a second time. The prevalence of CKD may hence, in fact, be considerably lower although still neither negligible nor irrelevant.

### Multiple versus single and other estimates of baseline proteinuria status as predictors of adverse outcomes in the general population [^1132G2nL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The association of proteinuria and adverse clinical outcomes is well established. The optimal method of classifying proteinuria status for study participants in whom it is measured multiple times is unknown, especially when the frequency of measurement varies between participants.

Study Design

Population-based longitudinal study.

Setting & Participants

All adults with at least one outpatient serum creatinine measurement in the province of Alberta, Canada.

Factor

Proteinuria (dipstick, albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR]).

Outcomes

All-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease, or doubling of serum creatinine level.

Measures

All outpatient urine dipstick and ACR measurements in the 6-month period before and after the first (index) estimated glomerular filtration rate were used to establish baseline proteinuria. Dipstick measures were analyzed as ceiling (median value up to the next integer), floor (median value down to the next integer), high (single highest dipstick value), low (single lowest dipstick value), and first (first available dipstick value only). Measurements of ACR were evaluated similarly and a median (median of all ACR measurements) value was added.

Results

Of 920,985 participants, 17% (n = 160,548) had multiple dipstick urinalysis measurements and 22% (n = 22,814) had multiple ACR measurements. With single measurements, absolute rates of mortality and renal outcomes were lower in every proteinuria category compared with multiple measurements. In contrast, the relative increase in rate ratio was greater with increasing proteinuria in patients with single measurements compared with those with multiple measurements. In all classification systems evaluated, more severe proteinuria was associated with significantly higher rates of both outcomes (all P for trend < 0.001).

Limitations

Lack of a gold standard for choosing between methods.

Conclusions

Rates of adverse outcomes related to multiple baseline proteinuria/albuminuria measurements were similar, independent of the measure of baseline proteinuria that was used to combine results. In contrast, discarding follow-up measurements and relying on only the first measurement led to lower estimates of absolute and relative risk for each proteinuria category.

### Evaluation of cardiovascular disease burden and therapeutic goal attainment in US adults with chronic kidney disease: an analysis of national health and nutritional examination survey data, 2001–2010 [^111BKy4Q]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The stratification of CKD into 5 stages according to the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or level of decline in eGFR was previously based on criteria developed in 2002 by the NKF and subsequently endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Foundation. However, refinements to the CKD classification system were proposed to provide a more comprehensive description of CKD severity, disease prognosis, and CV risk. For example, the high prevalence of Stage 3 CKD, and potential differences in CV risk profiles within this stage, led some experts to suggest subdividing this category into Stage 3a and 3b CKD (eGFR 45–59 and 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2). This analysis of 2001–2010 NHANES data found that the prevalence of CV-related comorbidities and CV risk factors was significantly higher in Stage 3b versus 3a CKD, including an observed ~2-fold increase in the prevalence of CVD and stroke between Stage 3a and 3b, thus supporting this particular revision of the CKD classification system. Indeed, the recently released KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease now includes the subdivision of Stage 3 CKD, as well as the addition of albuminuria stages and diagnosis of CKD by cause, to enable more precise estimations of disease risk and prognosis in patients with CKD.

### Association of albuminuria and regression of chronic kidney disease in adults with newly diagnosed moderate to severe chronic kidney disease [^117AMvRd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are risk-stratified for adverse events based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria level. CKD has often a favorable course (CKD regression) regardless of eGFR. Determining whether lower albuminuria is associated with CKD regression may have implications on CKD management.

Objective

To assess the 5-year probability of CKD regression across albuminuria categories accounting for the competing risks of CKD progression and death in people with newly diagnosed CKD and the association between albuminuria level and CKD regression.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study used administrative and laboratory data from Alberta, Canada, for adults with incident moderate to severe CKD (defined as sustained eGFR of 15–44 mL/min/1.73 m² for > 90 days), between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2017, and albuminuria measures before cohort entry. Data analysis occurred in January to June 2022.

Exposure

Albuminuria categories were defined by albumin to creatinine ratios (ACRs): A1 (ACR, < 3 mg/mmol), A2 (ACR, 3–29 mg/mmol), A3 < 60 (ACR, 30–59 mg/mmol), and A3 ≥ 60 (ACR, ≥ 60 mg/mmol).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was time to the earliest of CKD regression or progression (sustained change in CKD stage for > 3 months and ≥ 25% increase or decrease in eGFR from baseline or kidney failure, respectively), death, or censoring (outmigration or study end date: March 31, 2019). Cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate absolute risks, and cause-specific Cox models were used to assess the association between albuminuria and CKD regression, accounting for age, sex, eGFR, comorbidities, and health services use indicators.

Results

Of 58 004 people with moderate to severe CKD (mean [SD] age, 77 [12] years; 31 725 [55%] women), 35 360 had A1 albuminuria (61%), 15 597 had A2 albuminuria (27%), 1527 had A3 < 60 albuminuria (3%), and 5520 had A3 ≥ 60 albuminuria (10%). Five-year probability of regression was highest with A1 (22.6%), followed by A2 (16.5%), and A3 < 60 (11.6%) and lowest with A3 ≥ 60 (5.3%). Using A1 albuminuria as the reference group, the hazard of regression was highest for A2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72–0.79), then A3 < 60 (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.40–0.54), and lowest for A3 ≥ 60 (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.24–0.30).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of people with moderate to severe CKD, albuminuria levels were inversely associated with CKD regression. These findings extend the key prognostic role of albuminuria, offering novel opportunities to discuss both favorable and adverse outcomes in people with CKD and inform CKD management.

### Using proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate to classify risk in patients with chronic kidney disease: a cohort study [^1165WDNv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The staging system for chronic kidney disease relies almost exclusively on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), although proteinuria is also associated with adverse outcomes.

Objective

To validate a 5-category system for risk stratification based on the combination of eGFR and proteinuria.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A provincial laboratory registry in Alberta, Canada, and a representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults.

Patients

A derivation data set of 474 521 adult outpatients, 2 independent internal validation cohorts with 51 356 and 460 623 patients, and an external validation cohort of 14 358 patients.

Measurements

Glomerular filtration rate, estimated by using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, and proteinuria, measured by using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or dipstick urinalysis. Outcomes included all-cause mortality and a composite renal outcome of kidney failure or doubling of serum creatinine level.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 38 months in the internal validation cohorts, higher risk categories (indicating lower eGFR or more proteinuria) were associated with a graded increase in the risk for the composite renal outcome. The projected number of U.S. adults assigned to risk categories 3 and 4 in the alternate system was 3.9 million, compared with 16.3 million assigned to stage 3 and 4 in the current staging system. The alternate system was more likely to correctly reclassify persons who did not develop the renal outcome than those who did, although some persons developed the renal outcome despite reclassification to a lower category. However, all analyses of patients reclassified to a lower category showed that substantially fewer such patients developed the renal outcome than did not. Correct reclassification by the alternate system was more likely when proteinuria was measured by using albumin-to-creatinine ratio than with dipstick testing, and also more likely for the composite renal outcome than for mortality.

Limitation

The study had a short follow-up time.

Conclusion

Using proteinuria in combination with eGFR may reduce unnecessary referrals for care at the cost of not referring or delaying referral for some patients who go on to develop kidney failure.

### Individualized risk of CKD progression among US adults [^111USAJq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study with results generalizable to the US adult population, we had several key findings. First, 1.04 million US adults who do not meet laboratory-based criteria for CKD have a high risk (risk ≥ 5%) of CKD progression, and this risk is driven by factors other than eGFR or albuminuria. Second, 60% of US adults with CKD are classified as CKD on the basis of albuminuria alone (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In this group, over 3.73 million (24%) have a high risk of CKD progression. Importantly, 1.51 million (41%) of them do not have diabetes and would not qualify for UACR testing according to current Merit-based Incentive Payment System Clinical Quality Measures quality metrics. Third, 55% of US adults with CKD belong to stage G3a-A1, and 94% of them have a low risk of CKD progression (risk < 5%). Even among the 1.40 million adults with stage G3b-A1, 69% had 3-year risk < 5%. These findings highlight the importance of considering the individual-level risk of progression in the definition and management of CKD, similar to how the risk of cardiovascular disease is considered in the treatment of hypertension.

At present, most patients with CKD are diagnosed and staged using guideline-recommended cutoffs of laboratory values, namely UACR and creatinine-derived eGFR, on the basis of expert consensus. An eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² is the threshold for diagnosing CKD unless albuminuria or structural disease is present, irrespective of eGFR. Prognostication of CKD relies heavily on eGFR and albuminuria stages. However, the risks of CKD progression and kidney failure attributed per CKD stage in the KDIGO heatmapare relative to those with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and no albuminuria. A 65-year-old patient with an eGFR of 50 ml/min per 1.73 m² and UACR of 15 mg/g is classified as stage G3a-A1 and deemed to have a four-fold higher risk of CKD progression and 22-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with someone without CKD. For an individual categorized as stage 3a-A1, however, their range of possible CKD progression risk, 0.5%–12% in our study, is widely contingent on the presence of other risk factors, with different clinical management implications.

### Chronic kidney disease as cardiovascular risk factor in routine clinical practice: a position statement by the council of the European renal association [^112yXhTT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

ESC 2021 guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice

In 2021, the ESC issued an update of its seminal guideline on CVD prevention in clinical practice. This update was made in consensus with 12 medical societies, including the European Renal Association (ERA). As the prior 2016 edition, the 2021 guideline recognizes CKD, diagnosed as a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), as a CV risk factor. However, from the perspective of the ERA, this guide-line incorporates four main novelties:

The concept of moderate and severe CKD is expanded by incorporating albuminuria into the definition. Thus, moderate CKD is no longer limited to persons with an eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and severe CKD is no longer limited to an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, as they were in 2016. Rather, moderate, and severe CKD now follow the KDIGO global risk classes to encompass a combination of eGFR and UACR values that is associated with high or very-high CVD risk (Figure 1). Thus, now CKD diagnosed by not only low eGFR, but also high UACR is acknowledged as a strong and independent risk factor for CVD. Although the 2016 guideline mentioned albuminuria, it did not integrate it into an integrated CV risk score.
Assessment of CKD, based on either elevated albuminuria (> 30 mg/g) or low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), should be part of routine CV risk assessment (see below).
When CKD is present, not only an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, but also an SGLT2 inhibitor should be considered if non-diabetic and is recommended if the patient has Type 2 diabetes to prevent progression of CKD and CV events (Table 1). This advice was based on the results of the DAPA-CKD trial, in which patients with CKD and with or without Type 2 diabetes were included. Recently, the EMPA-KIDNEY Trial, that included a similar patient population, was stopped early because of positive efficacy that met the study's pre-specified threshold for early termination. This has strengthened the evidence supporting this advice.
Nomenclature for CKD classes is proposed, which is easier to understand than the original one by KDIGO. It is based on the associated overall risk of adverse health outcomes: mild CKD, moderate CKD (associated with high CV risk), and severe CKD (associated with very-high CV risk) (Figure 1). This simplified nomenclature may facilitate uptake of the CKD concept, and its incorporation into clinical diagnostic codes and risk assessment tools.

### Best albuminuria measurement to predict cardiovascular and renal events [^113QhceT]. American Journal of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines encourage clinicians to estimate 24-hour albuminuria as albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) from spot urine samples. However, ACR underestimates 24-hour albumin excretion in muscular individuals. Equations that adjust ACR for surrogates of muscle mass to yield an estimated albumin excretion rate (eAER) were developed. We hypothesised that eAER is a better predictor of cardiovascular and renal outcomes than ACR.

Methods

We determined ACR and eAER among 443 patients with chronic kidney disease G2-G4 recruited into the CARE FOR HOMe study. Patients were classified into KDIGO albuminuria categories, and followed for cardiovascular and renal events. The primary analysis was the net reclassification improvement (NRI) for those with and without events within 3 years of follow-up.

Results

Eighty five patients experienced cardiovascular events during 3 years of follow-up, 13 of whom were reclassified to a more advanced albuminuria category, and 1 patient to a less advanced category by eAER compared to ACR (NRIevent: 14.1% (95% CI 5.8–22.4)). Among 358 patients without a cardiovascular event, 17 patients were reclassified to a more advanced albuminuria category, and 2 patients to a less advanced category by eAER (NRIno event: -4.2%, 95% CI -8.5 to -1.8). Sixty patients went through renal events, and 383 patients had event-free 3-year follow-up. NRIevent was 6.7% (95% CI -1.2 to 14.5), and NRIno event was -6.0% (95% CI -10.6 to 3.4) for renal events.

Conclusion

Compared to ACR albuminuria categories, eAER categories are better associated with future cardiovascular events, but not with renal events.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria: diagnosis, staging, and prognosis [^111ggmND]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and important outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The first part of the review presents the evidence linking eGFR and albuminuria to important clinical outcomes, and the second part highlights the importance of these risk relationships across multiple subgroups and in clinical risk prediction.

Recent Findings

Investigators have used data from large population-based cohort studies and conducted collaborative meta-analyses to definitively establish the relationship between eGFR, albuminuria, and adverse clinical outcomes. Recent systematic reviews have also highlighted the importance of these variables in predicting the risk of kidney failure and all-cause mortality.

Summary

eGFR and albuminuria are important independent risk factors for kidney failure, acute kidney injury, and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. These relationships are independent of age, sex, race, or ethnicity. eGFR and albuminuria can be combined with other demographic variables to accurately predict the risk of kidney failure and should be measured concurrently to determine diagnosis, staging, and prognosis in patients with CKD.

The rationale includes that "First, level of albuminuria or crossing an ACR threshold is not a clinical end point" and "Second, RAS inhibitors might mask the progression of DKD marked by albuminuria". It also highlights that "Third, few normotensive patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria have been enrolled in clinical trials of treatments for kidney disease", and although "The demonstrated benefits of RAS inhibition for reducing and stabilizing albuminuria were noted", "the Work Group found this evidence insufficient to justify a higher rating".

### Dietary acid load and chronic kidney disease among adults in the United States [^114gZMCq]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement and classification of albuminuria and kidney function

Serum and urine samples were collected in the MEC. Serum creatinine was measured by means of the modified kinetic Jaffé method using different analyzers in different survey years. Random spot urine samples were obtained and frozen. Urine albumin was measured using solid-phase fluorescence immunoassay, and urine creatinine was measured using the modified Jaffé kinetic method in the same laboratory. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated according to the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable 4-variable MDRD Study equation for calibrated creatinine. As specified in NHANES documentation, we corrected serum creatinine levels in the 1999–2000 survey. Albuminuria, which is calculated as the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), is expressed as milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine (mg/g Cr) using American Diabetes Association categories: normal (< 30 mg/g Cr), and albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g Cr). We defined the stages of CKD according to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) CKD classification based on the level of kidney function (eGFR) and presence or absence of kidney damage (albuminuria). According to the recent CKD nomenclature used by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO), we defined the prognosis of CKD by eGFR and albuminuria categories where the risk groups ranged from low, moderately increased, high to very high.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected on less accurate methods:

- confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive)

- confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^112oZ34q]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Early diagnosis of CKD may prove vital in people with T2D, allowing for more immediate clinical care, and identification of the risks for progression to ESKD. This may be particularly important in Afro-Caribbean/African-American, Hispanic and Asian populations, who tend to have a higher risk of CKD progression relative to White people; the increased risk may be explained in part by factors such as higher blood pressure and increased prevalence of T2D and cardiovascular disease in these populations. However, diagnosis of CKD is challenging because of the lack of symptoms during its early stages. Other potential factors that hinder early detection of CKD include a lack of awareness of CKD in the general population, poor adherence to clinical guidelines, and the variation in screening and treatment incentives by practice and by country.

Diagnosis and determination of the severity of CKD relies on routine measurement of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) for at least 3 months and/or persistently elevated albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)), to assess the overall kidney function and the presence of kidney damage, respectively. As such, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD working group uses a combination of eGFR and UACR categories in its risk stratification tool for predicting CKD outcomes (figure 1). Clinical guidelines in Europe, USA and other countries recommend yearly screening of albuminuria and eGFR in people with T2D. However, real-world data suggest that rates of albuminuria testing in clinical practice are suboptimal, resulting in a gross underestimation of the risk of CKD in people with T2D. Routine assessment of both screening for CKD prognosis and management was further emphasized in a recent systematic review that showed an association between the prevalence of comorbidities in CKD and an increase in albuminuria severity. While CKD is common, only a small proportion of patients were classified as high risk or very high risk according to the KDIGO classification, highlighting key gaps in the burden and outcomes of CKD defined by the KDIGO 2012 guideline. With novel treatment interventions now available that can slow CKD progression, there is an urgent need for the early screening and diagnosis of kidney function decline in people with T2D. To this end, this review discusses albuminuria as a marker of kidney damage and cardiorenal risk, and the importance of earlier and more frequent screening.

### Diverging association of reduced glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with coronary and noncoronary events in patients with type 2 diabetes: the renal insufficiency and cardiovascular events (RIACE) Italian multicenter study [^113zYGrU]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

A large body of evidence suggests that individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more likely to die, particularly from cardiovascular disease (CVD), than to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), although recent findings seem to favor progression. In fact, although CVD risk is particularly increased in patients with ESRD, where CVD mortality accounts for the vast majority of deaths, even mild-to-moderate renal impairment is associated with CVD, as shown in the general population and in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

For clinical and epidemiologic purposes, CKD is currently classified into five stages, according to the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI). Classification is based on the presence or absence of kidney damage, as manifested by pathologic abnormalities or by disease markers such as micro- or macroalbuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as calculated by the use of estimating equations from serum creatinine measurements. Although stages 1–2 CKD are identified by evidence of kidney damage, stages 3–5 CKD are defined solely on the basis of estimated GFR (eGFR), irrespective of albuminuria. Because staging systems for disease classification should assign people with worse prognoses to more advanced stages, based on that introduced by the NKF KDOQI, subjects with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e. stage ≥ 3 CKD) without albuminuria would carry the same CVD and renal risk as those with albuminuria but a lower risk than individuals with albuminuria and normal or subnormal eGFR, who are assigned to stages 1–2 CKD.

In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) cohort, increased albuminuria and reduced eGFR were both associated with increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality overall and within every eGFR and albuminuria category, respectively. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that albuminuria, with no threshold, and an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 are both independent predictors of death and indicated that these two abnormalities are multiplicatively associated with risk of death without evidence of interaction. However, in other samples of the general population, the eGFR cutoff point for optimal discrimination of CVD risk was higher, whereas more recent reports showed that individuals with reduced eGFR without albuminuria are at much lower CVD risk than subjects with albuminuria without reduced eGFR. Studies in patients with type 2 diabetes showed that albuminuria and reduced eGFR are associated to the same extent with total CVD events, whereas albuminuria predicts death from CVD better than reduced eGFR.

### New insights into the significance of microalbuminuria [^1156CbiU]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent work that has explored the association between microalbuminuria and adverse clinical outcomes in the presence and absence of diabetes.

Recent Findings

Recent investigations have documented the prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general community and have also highlighted the continuous relationship between the level of urinary albumin excretion and clinical endpoints. Even below traditional microalbuminuria thresholds, urinary albumin levels appear to correlate with clinical outcomes. Microalbuminuria is becoming increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. At least for subjects with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, intensive, multifactorial interventions can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by about 50%. Although several studies have found an association between microalbuminuria and surrogate measurements of vascular disease, the exact molecular mechanisms linking an increase in urinary albumin excretion and vascular disease are still unknown. Microalbuminuria also has a well-documented association with progressive diabetic renal disease but recent studies have suggested that the prognostic significance of microalbuminuria in this regard may not be as powerful as originally reported.

Summary

Aggressive, multifactorial interventions, including the use of drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system are strongly recommended for patients with diabetes and micro-albuminuria to ameliorate the progression of renal and vascular complications. This approach should also possibly apply to microalbuminuric subjects without diabetes. The relationship between microalbuminuria and progressive diabetic renal disease requires re-evaluation given temporal trends in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.

As described in detail in the conference report, the meeting attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations for English language medical journals: (i) to use 'kidney' rather than 'renal' or 'nephro' when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use 'kidney failure' with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment rather than 'end-stage kidney disease'; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of CKD rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify CKD (Figure 1, Take home figure); and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased GFR, rather than 'abnormal' or 'reduced' kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function (Table 1). Accordingly, the proposed glossary contains five corresponding sections and comprises specific items for which there was general agreement among the conference participants (, Supplementary material online, Table S1). For each section, the glossary includes preferred terms, abbreviations, descriptions, and terms to avoid, with the acknowledgment that journals may choose which of the recommendations to implement, and that journal style will dictate when and how to abbreviate terms to be consistent with nomenclature for other diseases.

Chronic kidney disease nomenclature used by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health. Chronic kidney disease is classified based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category (G1–G5), and albuminuria category (A1–A3), abbreviated as CGA. Prognosis of chronic kidney disease by glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria category is colour-coded as follows: green, low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no chronic kidney disease); yellow, moderately increased risk; orange, high risk; red, very high risk. CKD, chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes.

### Microalbuminuria: target for renoprotective therapy PRO [^111DZ3WX]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Drug efficacy is ascertained using clinically meaningful outcomes that directly affect the well-being of patients. However, in studies of chronic kidney disease progression, clinically meaningful outcomes like end-stage renal disease take a long time to occur. The use of surrogate end points/markers as replacement for clinical outcomes is tempting as it may reduce sample size requirements, shorten follow-up time, facilitate trial conduct, and allow the performance of intervention trials in earlier stages of kidney disease to be carried out. We here reviewed recent data supporting the use of microalbuminuria as a valid surrogate end point in clinical trials of chronic kidney disease. We provide data that albuminuria is associated with worse renal prognosis and that pharmacological treatment aimed to reduce albuminuria levels delays the progression of renal disease and the occurrence of clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we review new studies showing that albumin is not only an inert molecule but also directly affects the function of several cell types in the kidney and may have a pathogenic role in renal disease. Accepting microalbuminuria as a surrogate marker for renal outcomes will lead to less resource-consuming hard outcome trials, will accelerate the development of drugs for chronic kidney disease, and enable earlier access of these drugs to individual patients.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115Bhbq2]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Kidney assessment in hypertension — hypertension is highlighted as "the second most important cause of CKD after diabetes". Antihypertensive therapy can transiently affect creatinine: "BP reduction by antihypertensive treatment often leads to an acute increase in serum creatinine by as much as 20–30%, especially with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers", and CKD classification uses eGFR: "CKD is classified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula". Albuminuria assessment is specified: "The albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is measured from a spot urine sample (preferably early morning urine), and is the preferred method to quantify urinary albumin excretion". Monitoring is advised: "Serum creatinine, eGFR, and ACR should be documented in all hypertensive patients, and if CKD is diagnosed, repeated at least annually", and urinalysis caveat: "One negative urinary dipstick test does not rule out albuminuria, in contrast to a normal ACR".

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^117Q2UQf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

### Screening for albuminuria identifies individuals at increased renal risk [^116sEUhn]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

It is unknown whether screening for albuminuria in the general population identifies individuals at increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) or accelerated loss of renal function. Here, in a general population-based cohort of 40,854 individuals aged 28 to 75 yr, we collected a first morning void for measurement of urinary albumin. In a subset of 6879 individuals, we measured 24-h urinary albumin excretion and estimated GFR at baseline and during 6 yr of follow-up. Linkage with the national RRT registry identified 45 individuals who started RRT during 9 yr of follow-up. The quantity of albuminuria was associated with increased renal risk: the higher the level of albuminuria, the higher the risk of need for renal replacement therapy and the more rapid renal function decline. A urinary albumin concentration of ≥ 20 mg/L identified individuals who started RRT during follow-up with 58% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Of the identified individuals, 39% were previously unknown to have impaired renal function, and 50% were not being medically treated. Restricting screening to high-risk groups (e.g., known hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease [CVD], older age) reduced the sensitivity of the test only marginally but failed to identify 45% of individuals with micro- and macroalbuminuria. In conclusion, individuals with elevated levels of urinary albumin are at increased risk for RRT and accelerated loss of renal function. Screening for albuminuria identifies patients at increased risk for progressive renal disease, 40 to 50% of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated.

### Differences in risk factors for the onset of albuminuria and decrease in glomerular filtration rate in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease [^114FyqRg]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide, reflecting the global increase in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic kidney disease has been traditionally diagnosed based on the presence of (micro)albuminuria 1, 2. In 2002, the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation proposed guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of chronic kidney disease, including diabetic kidney disease 3, in which chronic kidney disease was defined and staged mainly according to estimated GFR (eGFR). Recently, the classification of chronic kidney disease has been modified to include both eGFR and albuminuria stages, creating the 'heat map' that describes the relative risks for renal and cardiovascular outcomes 4.

It is generally believed that microalbuminuria is an early clinical manifestation of diabetic kidney disease, and that decreased GFR occurs secondarily, mainly in people with longstanding diabetes. This clinical course appears to be typical for those with Type 1 diabetes 5. In contrast, the natural history of chronic kidney disease in Type 2 diabetes appears to be heterogeneous. We 6 and others 7, 8 identified a subgroup of people with Type 2 diabetes who had decreased GFR despite normoalbuminuria. These cross‐sectional observations suggest that risk factors for albuminuria and those for decreased GFR may differ; however, previous longitudinal studies in people with Type 2 diabetes have focused exclusively on risk factors for albuminuria 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. We conducted the present observational cohort study to investigate, therefore, whether onset of albuminuria and decreased eGFR share common risk factors or have unique sets of risk factors in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114dapSw]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use the following measurements, preferably on a midstream sample of the first morning void, for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference):

- urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio

- reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio with automated reading.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114idCUp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, and adverse outcomes… [^114PCqxY]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

For the latter 2 methods, the values were extrapolated to the UACR using a previously published multivariable conversion equation. 12 In the categorical analyses, dipstick proteinuria categories of negative, trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ or 4+ were classified into the UACR categories of less than 10 mg/g, 10 to 29 mg/g, 30 to 299 mg/g, 300 to 999 mg/g, and 1000 mg/g or greater, respectively. In the sensitivity analyses without dipstick values, all dipstick measures were classified in the missing UACR category. In the categorical analyses, individuals were classified by the categories of eGFR and UACR. In the categorical analyses of eGFR based on creatinine alone, compared with the reference category of 90 to 104 mL/min/1. 73 m2, the lower categories were significantly associated with higher risk for each outcome.

Compared with the reference UACR category of less than 10 mg/g, the higher categories were associated with higher rates for each outcome. Risks among people with missing UACR data were comparable with those within the UACR category of 10 to 29 mg/g. Compared with the UACR reference category of less than 10 mg/g, higher UACR categories were associated with higher rates for each outcome. Among those with measures of albuminuria, the prevalence of the UACR category of 30 to 299 mg/g was 9. 9%,
3. 1% had the UACR category of 300 to 999 mg/g, and 1. 2% had the UACR category of 1000 mg/g or greater.

### Association of empagliflozin treatment with albuminuria levels in patients with heart failure… [^116CDvNk]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

A, Time to incidence of macroalbuminuria in patients with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria at baseline. B, Time to remission to normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria in patients with macroalbuminuria at baseline. A, Association of empagliflozin with macroalbuminuria in patients with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria at baseline. B, Remission to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria in patients with macroalbuminuria at baseline. A, Overall population. B, Patients with normoalbuminuria at baseline. C, Patients with microalbuminuria at baseline. D, Patients with macroalbuminuria at baseline.

Albuminuria was assessed using UACR from a morning void spot urine sample and collected at randomization and each subsequent study visit and analyzed by the central laboratory. Normoalbuminuria was defined as UACR less than 30 mg/g, microalbuminuria as UACR ranging from 30 to 300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria as UACR greater than 300 mg/g.
28. Baseline characteristics were compared across categories of baseline UACR using ordinal regression likelihood ratio test. Associations between baseline UACR categories and subsequent outcomes were studied by comparing the placebo events rates across categories. In the pooled population, 5552 patients had normoalbuminuria, and 1025 patients had macroalbuminuria.; UACR 30–300 mg/g–placebo slope, −2. 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/y; empagliflozin slope, −1. 4 (95% CI, −1. 7.

### Estimated prevalence and testing for albuminuria in US adults at risk for CKD… [^111PtR2k]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Albuminuria testing was associated with higher adjusted odds of receiving ACEi or ARB treatment, SGLT2i treatment, and having blood pressure controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg. We used NHANES to develop an estimation model for albuminuria, defined as UACR greater than or equal to 30 mg/g, which could be applied to untested patients in the EHR study population. We fit a logistic regression model with age, sex, race, ethnicity, systolic BP, eGFR, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and heart failure as independent variables based on their established associations with albuminuria. 11, 31 Continuous variables were modeled as spline terms to accommodate nonlinear associations. Our estimation model for albuminuria demonstrated good discrimination: C statistics were 0. 730 in the NHANES population and
0. 682 when applied to the EHR subgroup with UACR testing. When examining UACR testing rates by quintile of estimated albuminuria risk, higher risk of albuminuria was associated with progressively higher UACR testing rates. The UACR testing rates ranged from 3. 7% among patients least likely to have albuminuria to
36. 0% among the patients most likely to have albuminuria. In multivariable adjusted analyses, having UACR testing was associated with an approximate 2. 4-fold odds of receiving ACEi or ARB treatment, an
8. 2-fold odds of. Given the crucial role of albuminuria for risk stratification and determining indicated treatments in CKD, our results reinforce the need for concerted efforts to increase the use of albuminuria testing for enhanced kidney and cardiovascular preventive care.

### Albuminuria: its clinical significance as shown by chemical study of the blood… [^111B4wAy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although many tests of kidney function have come into prominence and waned to insignificance, albuminuria has long been a simple criterion of abnormality. But albuminuria is not a sure indication of damaged kidneys; for it may appear when these organs are normal, as in orthostatic albuminuria, 1 or it may be absent in a wide spread degeneration of the kidneys, as in interstitial nephritis. Furthermore, as will be pointed out in this paper, albuminuria may be excessive from passive congestion of the kidneys, the primary difficulty being in the heart. When albuminuria is excessive and associated with oliguria and apparent uremia, 2 as a late event in arterial hypertension, or in circulatory failure, it may cause much apprehension; on the other hand, the absence of albumin in the urine may give a false sense of security. The nephroses of acute infection or resulting from focal infection, are associated with albuminuria, 3 more or COFFEN TH.
