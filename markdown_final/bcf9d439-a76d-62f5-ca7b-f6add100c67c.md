## Question

Nerve conduction test

Assistant: **Nerve conduction studies** are diagnostic tests used to measure how quickly electrical signals travel through your nerves. These signals control various functions like muscle movement and sensation.

### Why They're Done

1. **Detect Nerve Damage**: Identify potential issues like compression or injury.
2. **Diagnose Neuropathies**: Conditions such as diabetic neuropathy or nerve compression syndromes.
3. **Evaluate Muscle Weakness**: Help pinpoint whether problems originate in the nerves or muscles.

### How It Works
- Small electrical impulses are sent through the nerve.
- The time it takes to respond is recorded.
- Slower-than-expected responses can indicate potential damage or other issues.

Slowed conduction velocity in left peroneal nerve

Assistant: When a nerve conduction study shows **slowed conduction velocity** in the **left peroneal nerve**, it suggests the signals traveling along that nerve are taking longer than usual to reach their destination.

### Possible Causes

1. **Compression**: Prolonged pressure on the nerve (e.g., crossing your legs too often).
2. **Nerve Damage**: Injury or health conditions affecting the nerve's insulation.
3. **Inflammation**: Swelling that impairs normal nerve function.

### Symptoms You May Notice
- Weakness or difficulty lifting your foot (foot drop).
- Numbness or tingling in the top of the foot or shin.
- Pain or discomfort around the outside of the lower leg.

Let me know if you'd like more information about what this might mean for daily activities!

Meaning of these results

Assistant: A **reduced conduction speed** in the left peroneal nerve typically means your nerve isn't carrying signals at the normal rate. In practical terms, this could manifest in day-to-day tasks like walking or running.

### Everyday Implications

1. **Balance and Stability**: You might feel unsteady if your muscles aren't getting signals quickly enough.
2. **Foot Movement**: You could have trouble lifting your foot properly, which can affect activities like climbing stairs.
3. **Sensitivity Changes**: Slowed conduction may come with numbness or tingling, altering how your foot feels temperature or texture.

The level of seriousness depends on how significantly the nerve is slowed and whether it's due to a temporary factor (like swelling) or a more persistent issue. A medical professional would interpret these results alongside your clinical symptoms and history.

Is that permanent nerve damage?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether slowed conduction velocity in the left peroneal nerve on a nerve conduction study means the damage is permanent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what slowed conduction velocity actually signifies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the common reversible versus irreversible causes of peroneal slowing. Next, I will review prognostic data and timelines for recovery. After that, I need to check for red flags that suggest a higher likelihood of permanence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with next steps and counseling points, making sure I anchor each claim to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm what slowed conduction velocity implies. Slowing reflects impaired saltatory conduction, most often from focal demyelination or segmental conduction block, which can be transient if the insult resolves, whereas axonal loss tends to reduce amplitude and may recover more slowly or incompletely; importantly, slowed velocity alone does not prove axonal degeneration, so I should not jump to conclusions about permanence based on velocity alone [^50019dd9] [^39218f94].

> Now, I need to check the typical causes of peroneal slowing and whether they are reversible. Compression at the fibular head, neurapraxia from stretch or ischemia, and metabolic or toxic demyelination (for example, from diabetes or chemotherapeutic agents) can all slow conduction and often improve with removal of the compressive load, supportive care, or disease-modifying therapy; case series and reviews show recovery of peroneal function after decompression or removal of the offending agent, and consensus criteria for conduction block emphasize that focal demyelination can be transient and recoverable [^bd5132ee] [^5882df84] [^39218f94] [^cd17f815].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify prognostic timelines. Mild compressive or demyelinating injuries frequently recover over weeks to months as remyelination and remyelination-driven velocity normalization occur, whereas axonal regrowth proceeds at roughly 1–3 mm per day and may take a year or more in long nerves; this is why surgical series and electrodiagnostic guidance often advise reassessing at 3–6 month intervals to document recovery trajectory before labeling deficits as permanent [^2e27873d] [^4eb40ba2].

> I will now examine factors that increase the risk of permanence. Marked amplitude drop with absent or very low CMAPs, widespread demyelination or mixed axonal-demyelinating patterns, chronicity beyond 6–12 months without improvement, and systemic drivers such as poor glycemic control or ongoing neurotoxin exposure portend a higher likelihood of persistent deficit; conversely, preserved amplitudes with isolated slowing and a clear, reversible precipitant favor recovery, and this distinction is reflected in electrodiagnostic criteria that separate demyelinating features from axonal loss [^e199369f] [^ea7c7502] [^8c4351df].

> But wait, what if the slowing is part of a polyneuropathy rather than a focal lesion. In distal symmetric polyneuropathy, peroneal slowing often coexists with other nerve abnormalities and may progress unless the underlying process is treated; even then, established axonal loss may not fully reverse, though tight glycemic control and risk-factor modification can halt or modestly improve conduction parameters in some cohorts, underscoring that permanence is a spectrum rather than a binary outcome [^ea7c7502] [^03d7b910] [^e4f89bd9].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Slowed peroneal conduction velocity alone is not proof of permanent damage; it is a marker of impaired conduction that is often reversible if the cause is identified and addressed in a timely manner. Permanence becomes more likely when there is substantial axonal loss, chronic injury without improvement over 6–12 months, or ongoing systemic insults, so serial clinical and electrodiagnostic follow-up is essential to distinguish reversible demyelination or block from irreversible axonal degeneration [^39218f94] [^4eb40ba2] [^2e27873d].

> Next, I should review practical steps. I need to ensure we identify and treat the cause (for example, decompression at the fibular head, optimize diabetes control, remove toxins), monitor symptoms and function over time, and repeat nerve conduction studies at 3–6 month intervals to document recovery; if there is no improvement by 6–12 months, I should reconsider the diagnosis, look for alternative or additional etiologies, and discuss long-term management and rehabilitation options, aligning with guideline-based approaches to electrodiagnostic follow-up and perioperative or compressive neuropathy care [^4eb40ba2] [^39218f94] [^cd17f815].

> In summary, I should confirm that slowed peroneal conduction velocity is not inherently permanent; it signals a potentially reversible process in many cases, and the likelihood of recovery depends on the underlying mechanism, the severity of axonal involvement, and the timeliness of intervention, so the correct clinical message is cautious optimism with structured follow-up rather than assuming permanence from a single study [^50019dd9] [^39218f94] [^2e27873d].

---

Not necessarily. Slowed peroneal conduction velocity reflects **demyelination or conduction block** [^39218f94], which can be **reversible** with treatment of the cause (e.g. decompression, glucose control, or immunotherapy) [^2e27873d] [^03d7b910] [^1f87bbac]. Permanence is more likely with **axonal loss** or chronic injury; even then, recovery can occur over months to years [^12fe7ff4]. Serial nerve conduction studies and clinical follow-up are needed to assess recovery and guide management [^4eb40ba2].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of slowed conduction velocity

Slowed conduction velocity in the peroneal nerve is typically due to **demyelination** or **conduction block**, which impair saltatory conduction and delay signal propagation [^39218f94]. Common causes include:

- **Compression**: Fibular head compression (common peroneal neuropathy) [^bd5132ee] or entrapment syndromes [^cd17f815].
- **Metabolic**: Diabetic neuropathy, where poor glycemic control accelerates nerve dysfunction [^03d7b910] [^8c4351df].
- **Inflammatory**: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or Guillain-Barré syndrome [^1f87bbac] [^33a478fc].
- **Toxic**: Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (e.g. bortezomib) [^5882df84].

---

## Reversibility of slowed conduction velocity

The reversibility of slowed conduction velocity depends on the **underlying cause and extent of axonal injury**:

| **Cause** | **Reversibility** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Compression (e.g. fibular head) | Often reversible with decompression | Case reports and surgical series show recovery after decompression [^bd5132ee] [^2e27873d] |
| Diabetic neuropathy | Improved with glycemic control; partial reversal possible | Tight control slows progression; some recovery reported [^03d7b910] [^8c4351df] |
| CIDP/GBS | Immunotherapy (IVIG, steroids, plasma exchange) can restore conduction | Guidelines and studies show clinical and electrophysiologic improvement [^1f87bbac] [^33a478fc] |
| Axonal loss (e.g. severe trauma) | Limited reversibility; slow axonal regrowth | Axonal regrowth is slow (~1 mm/day); incomplete recovery common [^12fe7ff4] |

---

## Clinical evidence of recovery

Several studies and case reports document **recovery of peroneal conduction velocity** after targeted treatment:

- **Decompression**: Fibular head decompression restores conduction and function in common peroneal neuropathy [^bd5132ee].
- **Glycemic control**: Intensive diabetes management slows or partially reverses neuropathy progression [^03d7b910] [^8c4351df].
- **Immunotherapy**: CIDP/GBS patients show conduction recovery with IVIG or plasma exchange [^1f87bbac] [^33a478fc].

---

## Factors influencing recovery

Recovery is shaped by **cause**, **severity**, and **timing**. Demyelinating or compressive lesions recover faster than axonal loss; milder injuries and earlier treatment yield better outcomes, whereas chronic or severe axonal injury limits recovery [^39218f94] [^12fe7ff4]. Younger patients and those without comorbidities also tend to recover more fully.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Identify the cause**: Use clinical evaluation, imaging, and labs to guide therapy (e.g. decompression, glucose control, immunotherapy) [^4eb40ba2].
- **Serial monitoring**: Repeat NCS to track recovery and adjust management [^e4f89bd9].
- **Rehabilitation**: Physical therapy supports functional recovery and prevents complications [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Slowed peroneal conduction velocity is **not necessarily permanent**. Many cases improve or resolve with treatment of the cause, especially when demyelination or conduction block predominates. Permanence is more likely with axonal loss or chronic injury, but even then, partial recovery is possible. Serial studies and individualized management are essential to optimize outcomes [^39218f94] [^4eb40ba2].

### Slowing of peripheral nerve conduction velocity in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is predicted by glucose fluctuations [^8c4351df]. Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) abnormalities are the forerunners of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effect of glucose profile quality on NCV in children and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Fifty-three children age 5 to 23 years with type 1 diabetes were recruited to participate in the study, which was conducted prospectively at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Switzerland from 2016 to 2022. Glycemic targets were recorded, and a cross-sectional nerve conduction study analyzing the peroneal, tibial, median motor, and median sensory nerves was performed. Data were compared with those of a control group of 50 healthy children. In the age- and height-matched diabetes subgroup aged 10–16 years, all four nerves showed significantly slower NCV, most pronounced for the peroneal nerve. Because height has a retarding effect on peroneal NCV, NCV was adjusted for height (dNCV). Peroneal dNCV correlated negatively with long-term glycated hemoglobin and highly significantly with glucose variability. Because high glucose variability clearly increases the risk of neuropathy, together with but also independently of the mean glucose level, this aspect of glycemic control should be given more attention in the care of individuals with diabetes.

Article Highlights

There is a strong need for the better identification of early subclinical manifestations of microvascular complications, such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, in young individuals with diabetes. To identify peripheral neuropathy and contributing factors at an asymptomatic disease stage, and to exclude height as a known modifying factor, we performed association studies of height-adjusted nerve conduction velocity. We identified high glucose variability, especially the SD of mean glucose, as an unexpectedly strong predictor of slowed nerve conduction velocity. More attention should be paid to the goal of low glucose variability in the care of individuals with diabetes.

### Comment on: fraser et al. the effects of long-term oral benfotiamine supplementation on peripheral nerve function and inflammatory markers in patients with type 1 diabetes: a 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. diabetes care 2012; 35: 1095–1097 [^b948a6d4]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Fraser et al. reported that "high-dose benfotiamine (300 mg/day) supplementation over 24 months has no significant effects upon peripheral nerve function or soluble markers of inflammation in patients with type 1 diabetes". Although this conclusion may be correct based on these findings, the clinical relevance remains obscure in view of the questionable study design. According to the recent consensus statement of the Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group, a possible diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) can be diagnosed if symptoms or signs of DSPN are present. In the case of probable DSPN, a combination of symptoms and signs of neuropathy is present. The authors state that among the patients included, 56% had subclinical neuropathy based on abnormal nerve conduction studies (NCS), and 16% had probable DSPN. Unfortunately, how abnormal NCS was defined is unclear. In fact, this high percentage is surprising given that mean sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV), which is one of the most sensitive indicators of DSPN, was well within the normal range. Moreover, clinical neuropathy scores have been used to assume probable DSPN, but obviously the latter has not been confirmed by abnormal NCS. Because the number of subjects included with confirmed DSPN was presumably very low, this trial does not provide any information on the important question as to whether treatment with benfotiamine may improve DSPN or slow its progression. The authors note that in previous studies using benfotiamine, no effect on NCV was shown. In the study by Stracke et al. cited by the authors, improvement in peroneal motor NCV in diabetic patients with DSPN was documented.

### Lower extremity nerve decompression for superimposed peripheral neuropathy in diabetes: awareness among medical professionals [^2e27873d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Another challenge when evaluating surgical outcomes, is the relatively short follow-up period reported in the studies. This may overlook potential long-term benefits that could result from LEND surgery, as nerve regeneration is a slow process. This is especially important considering reinnervation of the foot. For example, proximal decompressed nerves (eg, common peroneal nerve, tibial nerve at soleal sling) may need 1 to 1.5 years to reach their somatosensory target in the foot. Recent long-term (ie, 10 years) modeled outcomes suggest that LEND surgery may be both cost saving and cost effective compared with nonsurgical management, offering significant potential socioeconomic advantages. – This particularly includes the result of reinnervating the plantar foot (tibial nerve) and thereby preventing reulceration. However, well-designed long-term real-world studies are needed to confirm this. To date, 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocols have been published. – Liao and colleagues compare decompression of the tibial nerve, common, and deep peroneal nerve to a nonsurgical group receiving current best care and plan to score pain, sensory function, motor function, and neural signal conduction in 40 patients at 6 months after LEND surgery. Daeschler and colleagues unilaterally decompress the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve and compare this to the nondecompressed contralateral lower extremity. They plan to evaluate pain reduction, sensory function, quality of life, and analgetic use in 74 patients 12 months after surgery. An RCT by Rinkel et al. extended the observational period to 4 years, aiming to contribute real-life data to the current quality-of-life analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. – In the DeCompression trial, up to 5 sites of nerve entrapment in the lower extremity are decompressed. The surgery is compared with a current best care group of diabetic subjects receiving no additional nerve surgery.

### Heart rate variability and peripheral nerve conduction velocity in relation to blood lead in newly hired lead workers [^9b00cceb]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A cross-sectional study of labourers working in the copper industry in Germany involved 109 clinically healthy exposed male workers (mean age 42.6 years) and 27 non-exposed matched controls, who both underwent psychometric strain testing. In exposed workers, the blood lead concentration averaged 31.2 µg/dL. Exposed compared with non-exposed participants had a lower heart rate, higher sinus arrhythmia and a dysregulated heart rate variability at rest, during psychometric strain testing and after recovery. The authors' interpretation was that long-term lead exposure (19 years) was associated with inhibition of vagal activity, supporting the authors' hypothesis that the long vagal nerve, compared with shorter sympathetic fibres, is more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of lead. A 4-year follow-up study of 17 exposed workers, during which blood lead increased from 39.4 to 43.3 µg/dLand a later study with focus on neurocognitive performanceproduced confirmatory results. The latter study involved 70 exposed workers whose blood lead at examination averaged 30.4 μg/dL. However, an earlier study of 98 lead-exposed workers, whose blood lead ranged from 40 to 75 mgμg/dL and who were compared with 85 controls, failed to detect any influence on the autonomic nervous system, as assessed by quantifying sinus arrhythmia.

A meta-analysis of summary statistics, derived from 49 studies for the association between nerve conduction velocity and blood lead, included 1629 controls (women 21.0%) and 2825 exposed individuals (12.9%). Age and blood lead averaged 39.2 years and 15.7 µg/dL in controls, and 38.4 years and 53.0 µg/dL in exposed individuals. In exposed individuals compared with controls, conduction velocity was reduced in the median, ulnar and radial nerves in the arm, and in the deep peroneal nerve in the leg. Distal latencies of the median, ulnar and deep peroneal nerves were longer. No changes in the amplitudes of compound muscle or nerve action potentials were detected. The lowest concentration, at which a relation with blood lead was detected, was 33.0 µg/dL for the nerve conduction velocity of the median sensory nerve.

### Nerve conduction defects are retarded by tight metabolic control in type I diabetes [^03d7b910]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

This follow-up study examines whether the development of nerve dysfunction is retarded by tight metabolic control in patients with type I diabetes mellitus. Seventy-one patients and 115 age-matched healthy control subjects underwent studies of nerve conduction in peroneal and sural nerves. The presence of diabetes was associated with a reduction in peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) by 5.9 m/s, sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) by 3.4 m/s, and sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude by 22%. Dysfunction in peroneal MCV, sural SCV, and sural SNAP were related to long-term poor metabolic control. Eleven of 12 patients with HbA1c < 6.5% had normal nerve conduction or abnormality in only one nerve as compared to 2 of 15 patients with HbA1c > 8.0%. It is concluded that tight long-term metabolic control (HbA1c < 6.5%) can retard nerve dysfunction in patients with type I diabetes mellitus and a mean disease duration of 12 years.

### The efficacy of neuromodulation interventions for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^73a6579b]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Nerve conduction study (ncs)

The 5 studies, revealed the results for immediate-term effect of nerve conduction studies involving the common peroneal nerve, sural nerve, median nerve, ulnar nerve, and tibial nerve. Among them, 3 studies, fully reported distal nerve latency, amplitude, and conduction velocity, while the other two, only reported nerve conduction velocity.

For neuromodulation with usual care, the results of one studyshowed that the included population was in the normal range of neurophysiological examinations at baseline, and there was no significant difference for endpoints compared to baseline. However, another studyshowed a significant improvement in nerve conduction velocities of peroneal nerve sensory at the end of the treatment when neuromodulation interventions with usual care compared to usual care (P < 0.01), and this intervention regimen was also statistically significant in a within-group comparison of MCV in the bilateral median nerve and the peroneal nerve.

For the use of neuromodulation alone, one studyshowed significant differences in the improvement of the amplitude of the sural nerve, MCV of the peroneal nerve, and the amplitude and the MCV of the tibial nerve when compared to usual care. However, another study showedthat at the end of the treatment, all outcomes were not statistically significant when compared to the usual care. Rick showed thatthere was no statistically significant improvement in NCV of the peroneal nerve with neuromodulation compared to sham groups, and there was a significant difference in conduction velocities of peroneal nerve after 3 weeks of interventions (P = 0.021), whereas the difference was not statistically significant after 3 months of interventions.

### Multifocal leukoencephalopathy and polyneuropathy after 18 years on interferon alpha [^10313f9e]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

Multifocal leukoencephalopathy and sensory-motor polyneuropathy have not been reported as side-effects of long-lasting interferon alpha therapy in a single patient. In a 77-year-old man interferon alpha2b and interferon alpha2a were administered subsequently but continuously since 1984 for hairy cell leukemia. Since early 2000, left-sided hemi-hypesthesia occurred and the patient developed gait disturbance, proximal weakness of the lower limbs, bilateral stocking-type sensory disturbances, and restless leg syndrome. Repeated cerebral magnetic resonance images showed multifocal T2-hyperintense white matter lesions supratentorially. The nerve conduction velocity of the peroneal and sural nerve was reduced. After exclusion of various differential diagnoses of leukoencephalopathy and application of a screening program for polyneuropathy, central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities were attributed to the long-lasting interferon alpha therapy. In single patients abnormally long-lasting interferon alpha therapy may cause multifocal white matter lesions supratentorially and sensory-motor polyneuropathy.

### Ranirestat for the management of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy [^2cb7d7be]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) are potential disease modifiers for diabetes complications. We aimed to determine whether ranirestat, an ARI, could slow or reverse the course of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSP).

Research Design and Methods

A total of 549 patients with DSP were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or 10, 20, or 40 mg/day ranirestat for 52 weeks in this multicenter, double-blind study. Efficacy was evaluated by nerve conduction studies, the modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (mTCNS), and quantitative sensory tests (QSTs).

Results

At week 52, the summed sensory (bilateral sural plus proximal median sensory) nerve conduction velocity (NCV) did not show significant changes from baseline (2.0 m/s for placebo compared with 3.2–3.8 m/s for ranirestat). Significant improvement in the summed motor (peroneal, tibial, and median) NCV was observed with 20 and 40 mg/day ranirestat treatment at week 12 (P ≤ 0.05) and at weeks 24 and 36 and in peroneal motor NCV at weeks 36 and 52 (P ≤ 0.05) for the 20 mg/day ranirestat group. The mTCNS and QST results did not differ among the groups during the study. Ranirestat was well tolerated with no pertinent differences in drug-related adverse events or in effects on clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, or electrocardiograms among the four groups.

Conclusions

Treatment with ranirestat appears to have an effect on motor nerve function in mild to moderate DSP, but the results of this study failed to show a statistically significant difference in sensory nerve function relative to placebo.

### The clinical approach to small fibre neuropathy and painful channelopathy [^fdc8ddfb]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Microneurography in humans: microneurography is an electrophysiological technique to record action potentials from individual peripheral nerve axons in humans. Technical basis (left). (A) Microneurography setting. A tungsten microelectrode (1) is inserted intraneurally in a peripheral nerve; in this case the superﬁcial peroneal nerve at the dorsum of the foot. A subcutaneous reference electrode (2) is inserted in the skin outside the nerve trunk. The innervation territory of the nerve is electrically stimulated with a pair of needle electrodes (3). In this example, conduction distance between stimulating electrodes and an active microneurography electrode is 100 mm. (B) Electrophysiological recording of responses. Electrical stimulation of the receptive field evokes multiple action potentials in the sweep. Latencies of these action potentials allow segregation of units between a group of thinly myelinated, Aδ units (latencies ≈ 10 ms; conduction velocity ≈ 10 m/s) and a group of unmyelinated C-units (latencies ≈ 100 ms; conduction velocities ≈ 1 m/s). Superposition of the individual sweeps in a cascade mode demonstrates reproducibility of the responses. (C) Raster plot of latencies. The individual sweeps displayed in a cascade mode in B can also be displayed as a raster plot of latencies, with latency as the y-axes and elapsed time as the x-axes. In this example, three C-units at approximate latencies of 140, 155 and 180 ms at min 40 are displayed. Unmyelinated C axons change their conduction velocity (and hence their latency) depending on the stimulation frequency, a phenomenon called 'activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity'. For example, baseline stimulation at 0.25 Hz can be interrupted (open bar) or increased to 2 Hz (filled bar). This induces changes in latency with different profiles. (D) Profiles of activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity. Different subpopulations of peripheral unmyelinated axons display different profiles of conduction slowing. For example, C-nociceptors have characteristic 'shark fin' profiles. Pathological findings (right). (A) Neuropathic pain. Peripheral nerve damage, such as an axonal polyneuropathy (left) or a posterior tibial nerve damage (right) frequently induce positive sensory phenomena. Burning or deep aching pain, due to activity arising from C-nociceptors, is a frequent complaint in neuropathic pain patients. (B) Spontaneous discharges in C-nociceptors. Damaged C-nociceptors frequently engage in ongoing, spontaneous activity. Spontaneous discharges are indicated by abrupt increases in latency (black arrows) between successive electrical stimuli delivered at 0.25 Hz, giving rise to a characteristic 'saw-tooth' profile of the raster plot. (C) Peripheral sensitisation in C-nociceptors. Example of mechanically evoked activity in a normally mechano-insensitive C-nociceptor recorded from a patient suffering from small-fibre neuropathy. Spontaneous discharges are evoked by pressing with a von Frey hair exerting a force of 128 mN (arrow). (D) Double spike in pathological C-nociceptor. Under normal conditions, single electrical shocks into the receptive field of C-nociceptors induce single action potentials. In neuropathy, with frequent dying-back and regeneration attempts, extensive, abnormal branchings may induce 'unidirectional blocks' in the terminal arborisation of the units, and induce multiple spikes (arrows signal beginning and end of the double spike), thus amplifying peripheral input. Double and triple spikes may contribute to hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain.

### Effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation on neurologic and cognitive function in older people: a randomized controlled trial [^55ac097c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Assessment of neurologic function

At baseline and after 12 mo, a single physician (KM) assessed clinical measures of neurologic function (presence or absence of knee and ankle jerks and of joint position sense and vibration sense in the great toe) and conducted a standard battery of peripheral nerve-conduction tests (including motor and sensory nerve conduction in the right superficial peroneal, sural, common peroneal, and tibial nerves), and central motor conduction tests. Skin temperature of the dorsum of the foot was measured, which allowed for correction for temperature differences between first and second visits. The sensory action potential (SAP) 8 amplitude (maximum deviation of the electrical response) and conduction velocity (distance divided by onset latency) were measured. Common peroneal, tibial, and ulnar motor conduction were measured by recording from extensor digitorum brevis, abductor hallucis (AH), and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles, respectively. Nerves were stimulated supramaximally at proximal and distal sites, and conduction velocity was calculated. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, distal motor latency, and F-wave latency (a measure of conduction time from the distal stimulation site to the spinal cord) were also measured.

Central motor conduction in the corticospinal tract was measured by using transcranial magnetic stimulation, which painlessly and noninvasively excites the motor cortex. A 13-cm diameter circular coil connected to a magnetic stimulator that provided a monophasic pulse was centered over the vertex to excite the hand area of the left motor cortex. The threshold for excitation was determined by using a standard technique. With the right ADM muscle partially activated voluntarily, 8 stimuli at 1.2 times the threshold were delivered to evoke motor evoked potentials (MEPs), the mean amplitude and minimal latency of which were measured. The time to response in a given muscle was subtracted from an estimate of the peripheral nerve conduction time to calculate the central motor conduction time. Similarly, by using a double cone coil, the leg area of motor cortex was excited to measure MEPs evoked in AHs. Each participant received a maximum of 70 brain stimuli. Any individuals shown to have significant neurologic deficit were referred to their general practitioners for additional assessment.

### Long-term effects of pancreatic islet transplantation on polyneuropathy in patients with brittle diabetes: a single-center experience [^3caf4ad0]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Pancreatic islet transplantation (ITx) is increasingly used in patients with brittle type 1 diabetes (T1D). If successful, ITx results in insulin-free euglycemia, but its application is limited by a need for lifelong immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effects of ITx on the occurrence and course of polyneuropathy in a cohort of patients with brittle T1D.

Methods

In this prospective, single-center study, 13 patients (4 males and 9 females) with brittle T1D had a baseline neurological exam with the calculation of Utah Neuropathy Scale (UNS) and a limited nerve conduction study before ITx, and about yearly after in the patients who achieved insulin independence.

Results

Patients were followed for a period of 17 to 133months. There was no significant difference between UNS and nerve conduction study parameters at baseline and at the end of follow-up, except for significant decreases in peroneal (50.34 ± 6.12 vs. 52.42 ± 6.47ms, P = 0.005) and ulnar (27.5 ± 2.15 vs. 29.45 ± 2.10ms, P = 0.009) F-wave latencies and an increase in ulnar sensory nerve conduction velocity (49.98 ± 6.27 vs. 47.19 ± 5.36m/s, P = 0.04).

Discussion

If successful, ITx has a good long-term safety profile for peripheral nerve toxicity, and a favorable effect on diabetic neuropathy.

### A systematic review of outcomes measured in interventional trials in people with diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy [^e4f89bd9]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common assessor‐reported measuring tool was NCS, which remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of DSPN and serves as a strong predictor for complications such as diabetic foot ulceration and mortality.NCS measurements are also significantly correlated with clinical diagnostic scores such as the Diabetic Neuropathy Examination (DNE), reliably reflecting the general clinical status of an individual with DSPN. Despite their advantages, NCS are labour intensive, time‐consuming and expensive. Additionally, determining which nerve and parameter to measure when using NCS to assess DSPN is challenging. This review found that the peroneal motor nerve and sural sensory nerve were the most frequently measured nerves for primary outcomes. In terms of parameter, nerve conduction velocity was the most common primary and secondary outcome. This is consistent with the Rochester Diabetic Neuropathy Study, which stated that the peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity and sural sensory nerve conduction velocity were the two most sensitive parameters of NCS, with more than a quarter of people with DSPN displaying abnormal readings for these outcomes. However, NCS are vulnerable to interobserver variability, which can impact the results of interventional DSPN trials. Therefore, it is recommended to standardise the performance of operators, where possible. Including F‐wave latency in NCS may improve sensitivity, as it detects early nerve dysfunction more precisely than conduction velocities. Despite its potential, only one study in this review used it, and it should be more widely adopted. Additionally, since nerve conduction changes take time, trials using NCS as a primary endpoint should last at least 12 weeks to capture treatment effects.

### Effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation on neurologic and cognitive function in older people: a randomized controlled trial [^3fb71f65]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of the trial was the posterior tibial CMAP amplitude evoked by distal stimulation. The negative peak amplitude of the peripherally evoked CMAP reflects the number of motor axons that can be accessed by an electrical stimulus, which, in turn, reflects muscle strength. Of 10 secondary neurologic outcomes, 3 outcomes assessed motor nerve conduction (posterior tibial conduction velocity, common peroneal CMAP amplitude, and common peroneal conduction velocity), 4 outcomes assessed sensory nerve conduction (sural SAP amplitude, sural conduction velocity, superficial peroneal SAP amplitude, and superficial peroneal conduction velocity), and 3 outcomes assessed central nerve conduction (mean right ADM MEP amplitude, central motor conduction time to the right ADM, and central motor conduction time to the right AH).

Assessment of cognitive function

At baseline and after 12 mo, the study manager (KW) administered a range of cognitive function tests. In accordance with international guidance, the main cognitive outcome was a test of memory, i.e. a 16-item word list from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). The sum of words recalled after each of 3 repeats and the number of words recalled after a 20-min delay formed the main cognitive outcome. The identical version of the CVLT was used at baseline and after 12 mo. Other cognitive outcomes were as follows: processing speed assessed by using the oral version of the symbol letter modality test for which the outcome was the number correct in 90 s; simple and choice reaction time assessed by using an electronic reaction timer that provided 20 single (simple reaction time) or 40 multiple (choice reaction time) challenges; and executive-function assessed by using a verbal fluency test (animal naming) over 60 s.

### NSE, a potential biomarker, is closely connected to diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^0190dd3d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Nerve conduction velocity tests

Ulnar, median, sural, and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) were performed on the right side of each subject using EMG (key point, medronet 4, Minneapolis, MN). All stimulations were performed supramaximally. The threshold for the slowed NCV was set at > 2.5 SD of the control NCV. When two or more nerves were tested abnormal, nerve conduction (NC) was considered abnormal. Local skin temperature was kept constant (32–33°C). Variables such as age, height, sex, and weight were also measured and accounted for when reporting an NCV as normal or abnormal as described previously.

Cardiac autonomic neuropathy tests

Testing was carried out based on standard procedures. The resting heart rate was measured after a 20-min supine rest. The Valsalva maneuver was performed three times. The mean value was the ratio of the longest R-R interval to the shortest R-R interval after breathing against a resistance of 40 mmHg for 15 s. The expiration-inspiration ratio was the ratio of the mean of the three longest R-R intervals on expiration to the mean of the three shortest R-R intervals on inspiration during 1 min of deep breathing at six breaths per minute. The lying-to-standing ratio was the ratio of the longest R-R interval around the 30th beat after standing to the shortest R-R interval around the 15th beat after standing. The blood pressure response was tested. The blood pressure was measured in the supine position at 1 min after standing up and at 1-min intervals thereafter for a 5-min period. A decrease in systolic pressure of more than at least 20 mmHg was considered abnormal. The results were evaluated using age-related reference values. Two or more abnormal tests were required for a confirmed diagnosis of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN).

### Low peripheral nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes are strongly related to diabetic microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes: the EURODIAB prospective complications study [^84b451ac]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

We present cross-sectional analyses from the EPCS follow up visit. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software (version 11; StataCorp, College Station, TX). Characteristics of patients who did and did not participate in the NCSs were compared with the use of the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate. In the case of unequal variances, means were compared by approximate inference based on the t distribution.

Multivariate linear regression models were used to describe the associations among cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric measures, the presence/severity of complications, and ulnar, sural, and peroneal nerve conduction, which are reported as unstandardized β coefficients. Data were collected as crude data from each center; therefore, models for nerve conduction measures were adjusted for age, sex, height, diabetes duration, A1C, center, skin temperature, and distance between electrodes into the model. These covariates were prespecified as factors that may affect nerve conduction based on previously published evidence. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and nerve conduction amplitude (NCA) for the three nerves were standardized and summarized per individual in a total z score, which was used as an additional outcome in a separate regression model. A slow/low nerve conduction measure was defined as being in the lowest tertile of ulnar, sural, and peroneal NCV or NCA, and odds ratios (ORs) for being in this group were calculated using a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for the sample variables as mentioned above. β coefficients and ORs are given with 95% CIs. Methods for the supplementary multiple imputation analyses are described in an online appendix.

### Biological and electrophysiologic effects of poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on regenerating peripheral nerve fibers [^9c5db337]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uninjured peripheral nerves in upper-limb amputees represent attractive sites for connectivity with neuroprostheses because their predictable internal topography allows for precise sorting of motor and sensory signals. The inclusion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) reduces impedance and improves charge transfer at the biotic-abiotic interface. This study evaluates the in vivo performance of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated interpositional decellularized nerve grafts across a critical nerve conduction gap, and examines the long-term effects of two different poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) formulations on regenerating peripheral nerve fibers.

Methods

In 48 rats, a 15-mm gap in the common peroneal nerve was repaired using a nerve graft of equivalent length, including (1) decellularized nerve chemically polymerized with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (dry); (2) decellularized nerve electrochemically polymerized with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (wet); (3) intact nerve; (4) autogenous nerve graft; (5) decellularized nerve alone; and (6) unrepaired nerve gap controls. All groups underwent electrophysiologic characterization at 3 months, and nerves were harvested for histomorphometric analysis.

Results

Conduction velocity was significantly faster in the dry poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) group compared with the sham, decellularized nerve, and wet poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) groups. Maximum specific force for the dry poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) group was more similar to sham than were decellularized nerve controls. Evident neural regeneration was demonstrated in both dry and wet poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) groups by the presence of normal regenerating axons on histologic cross-section.

Conclusions

Both poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) formulations were compatible with peripheral nerve regeneration at 3 months. This study supports poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) as a promising adjunct for peripheral nerve interfaces for prosthetic control and other biomedical applications because of its recognized ionic-to-electronic coupling potential.

### Low peripheral nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes are strongly related to diabetic microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes: the EURODIAB prospective complications study [^ea7c7502]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Slow nerve conduction velocity and reduction in response amplitude are objective hallmarks of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Because subjective or clinical indicators of neuropathy do not always match well with the presence of abnormal nerve physiology tests, we evaluated associations to nerve conduction in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Nerve conduction studies were performed in the distal sural and ulnar sensory nerves and the peroneal motor nerve in 456 individuals with type 1 diabetes who participated in the follow-up visit of the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study (EPCS). We used multivariate regression models to describe associations to decreased nerve conduction measures.

Results

In addition to an effect of duration of diabetes and A1C, which were both associated with low nerve conduction velocity and response amplitude, we found that the presence of nephropathy, retinopathy, or a clinical diagnosis of neuropathy was associated with low nerve conduction velocity and amplitude. In the case of nonproliferative retinopathy, the odds ratio (OR) for being in lowest tertile was 2.30 (95% CI 1.13–4.67) for nerve conduction velocity. A similar OR was found for each 2% difference in A1C (2.39 [1.68–3.41]).

Conclusions

We show that the presence of other microvascular diabetes complications, together with diabetes duration and A1C, are associated with low nerve conduction velocity and amplitude response and that cardiovascular disease or risk factors do not seem to be associated with these measures.

### Explore the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound on pain relief in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a pilot randomized trial [^4d761fa1]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in alleviating pain in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN).

Methods

Between November 2022 and January 2024, a total of 50 participants diagnosed with PDPN were randomly assigned to either LIFU therapy or placebo therapy. Pain levels were assessed using the numeric pain rating scale (NRS), while neuropathic symptoms and signs were evaluated using the neuropathy symptom score (NSS) and neuropathy deficit score (NDS), respectively. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were measured via electromyography (EMG).

Results

After 7days of treatment, both groups exhibited a reduction in NRS compared to baseline; however, the LIFU group demonstrated significantly lower NRS scores than the placebo group (3.96 ± 1.07 versus 2.76 ± 1.79, P < .05). Additionally, significant improvements in neuropathic symptoms, as measured by NSS, were observed in the LIFU group post-treatment. Notably, LIFU therapy did not alter the conduction velocities or amplitudes of the bilateral peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves.

Conclusions

LIFU therapy was effective in reducing pain and improving neuropathic symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate PDPN. Future studies should further investigate the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of this novel therapeutic approach across diverse patient populations.

### Statin therapy and neuropathy in type 1 diabetes: a cross-sectional study [^82c4526f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This is the first large study to conduct a detailed assessment of both neuropathic symptoms and objective functional and structural measures of large and small fibre neuropathy. We show that older, heavier patients with a longer duration of T1DM and therefore with major risk factors for DPN treated with statins have a comparable degree of neuropathy to patients with T1DM who are younger, weigh less and have a shorter duration of diabetes. Statin use has been associated with a reduced odds for developing idiopathic sensory neuropathy. Indeed, Hernández‐Ojeda et al. showed an improvement in neuropathic symptoms and peroneal nerve conduction velocity in patients with DPN after treatment with Rosuvastatin. Additionally, a population‐based study from Denmark reported a lower cumulative incidence of DPN or gangrene of the foot in statin users compared to non‐users. Furthermore, regression analysis in our study has revealed that age and BMI were significantly associated with a higher odds ratio of patients developing DPN, while statin use was associated with a reduced risk of DPN.

A key limitation of this study is its cross‐sectional design, which restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the long‐term effects of statin therapy on the development or progression of neuropathy. Although the study was sufficiently powered for primary outcomes, such as corneal nerve fibre density (CNFD), it may have been underpowered to detect smaller or subgroup‐specific differences across other measures. In addition, although we documented the type and duration of statin use, the sample sizes for individual statins were too small to allow for meaningful subgroup analyses. As such, we were unable to explore potential differences in neuropathy outcomes between specific statins. Given the lack of consistent evidence in the literature regarding statin‐specific effects on nerve function, we treated statin use as a single exposure variable. Nevertheless, future studies with larger and more balanced groups may be better positioned to investigate whether different statins exert distinct effects on peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.

### Changes over 10 years in peripheral nerve function in people with well-controlled type 2 diabetes and those with normal glucose tolerance [^e27a99a5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There is a lack of knowledge on the changes in peripheral nerve function in people with well-controlled, recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). In this study, we aimed to investigate the natural course of the function of lower extremity small and large nerve fibers in people with NGT and its decline in those with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This prospective observational study assessed changes in nerve function in participants of the German Diabetes Study with recently diagnosed (≤ 1 year) type 2 diabetes and age-matched and sex-matched individuals with NGT after 5 years and in a larger group of participants with type 2 diabetes after 5 and 10 years. Reference tests of lower extremity peripheral nerve function included peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), malleolar vibration perception threshold (VPT), and thermal detection thresholds (TDTs). Data were analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regression analyses.

Results

At baseline, all 5 nerve function measures showed impairment in the 52 individuals in the diabetes group (33% female, median age 51.7 years) compared with the 52 individuals in the matched NGT group (33% female, median age 51.4 years). After 5 years, 2 nerve indices declined in the diabetes group (peroneal MNCV and VPT) and 3 in the NGT group (peroneal MNCV, VPT, and TDT for cold), with similar 5-year declines observed in both groups after adjustment for baseline values and pairwise matching. In addition, the Neuropathy Disability Score increased in the NGT group but not in the diabetes group. Comparable patterns of decline after 5 and 10 years were found in the larger diabetes cohort of 141 individuals (39% female, median baseline age 53.6 years). The observed 10-year prevalence of abnormal NCVs closely matched estimates based on natural aging-related decline (14.2% vs 12.8% for peroneal MNCV and 30.2% vs 31.0% for sural SNCV).

Discussion

These findings suggest that nerve function deterioration in well-controlled type 2 diabetes is primarily influenced by nerve function status at diagnosis and physiologic aging, rather than diabetes-related progression.

### Conduction slowing in diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy [^e199369f]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Defining criteria for detection of conduction slowing in DSP patients

Patients were categorized as having axonal or conduction slowing DSP based on a combination of latency, conduction velocity, and amplitude parameters, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Although four groups can be identified using the different combinations, the first and third groups were combined because only one patient qualified for the third group and both were defined as axonal neuropathy.

Figure 1
Schematic of four groups used to categorize patients as having axonal, conduction slowing, or combined DSP based on a combination of NCS amplitude and latency and conduction velocity parameters. Axonal injury is measured by amplitude, and demyelinating injury is measured by latency and conduction velocity. Demyelinating features are as follows: peroneal F-wave latency ≥ 61.6 ms, peroneal distal latency ≥ 6.7 ms, peroneal conduction velocity ≤ 37.5 m/s, sural distal latency ≥ 3.7 ms, and sural conduction velocity ≤ 36.0 m/s. SNAP, sensory nerve action potential.

Based on our observations in routine clinical practice, we defined patients as having evidence of conduction slowing (group D) if amplitudes were preserved and at least two parameters showed slowed conduction as suggested by the European Federation of Neurological Societies criteria for CIDP. Specifically, preservation of the peroneal CMAP amplitude or the sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude to ≥ 90% of the lower limit of normal was required for the group D classification. In addition, group D classification required at least two of the following changes: prolonged F-wave latencies or distal motor or sensory latencies ≥ 110% of the upper limit of normal, or motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities ≤ 90% of the lower limit of normal. If no abnormalities or one demyelinating abnormality was noted, then the patient was classified as axonal (group A), regardless of the degree of abnormality in the motor and sensory amplitudes. If two or more demyelinating features were present but the sural sensory nerve action potential and peroneal CMAP responses were both reduced to < 90% of lower limit of normal, then the patient was classified as having combined DSP (group C).

### Genetic variation in the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor protein encoding region is associated with higher heart rate variability, but not with neurodegeneration of the brain, retina, and peripheral nerves: the maastricht study [^78f31fe8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Peripheral nerve conduction velocity

Peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves conduction velocities (in m/s) were assessed with a Medelec Synergy electromyography apparatus (version 15.0, Viasys Healthcare, UK) using surface electrodes. To ensure skin temperature was > 32 °C (measured on the dorsal surface of the foot), feet and lower legs were warmed in warm water (38 °C) for a minimum duration of 10 min before conducting tests. Motor peroneal and tibial nerves and sensory sural nerve were examined at supra-maximal stimulation. Peroneal nerve function was recorded on the right leg, at the digitorum brevis muscle. Stimulations were given at the ankle (8 cm proximal from the recording site). Tibial nerve function was recorded on the left leg, at the abductor hallucis muscle. Stimulations were given at the ankle and in the popliteal fossa. Sural nerve function was recorded on the left leg between the lateral malleolus and the Achilles tendon. Stimulation was given 12 cm proximal to the recording site. Z-scores for peroneal, tibial, and sural nerve conduction velocities were calculated and averaged into a peripheral nerve conduction velocity composite score. This composite z-score was then re-standardized.

Covariates

Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) and HbA1c (mmol/mol) were measured in fasting venous blood samples. Diabetes and prediabetes status were based on levels of fasting plasma glucose and 2-h post load glucose (determined from a standardized seven-point oral glucose tolerance test), in accordance with the World Health Organization 2006 criteria. All participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test except those who were on insulin or had a fasting plasma glucose concentration above 11.0 mmol/L.

### Exercise training can modify the natural history of diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^8910ca07]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is the most important cause of peripheral neuropathy (DPN). No definitive treatment for DPN has been established, and very few data on the role of exercise training on DPN have been reported.

Aim Of The Study

We sought to examine the effects of long-term exercise training on the development of DPN in both Types 1 and 2 diabetic patients.

Participants and Methods

Seventy-eight diabetic patients without signs and symptoms of peripheral DPN were enrolled, randomized, and subdivided in two groups: 31 diabetic participants [15 f, 16 m; 49 ± 15.5 years old; body mass index (BMI) = 27.9 ± 4.7], who performed a prescribed and supervised 4 h/week brisk walking on a treadmill at 50% to 85% of the heart rate reserve (exercise group: EXE), and a control group of 47 diabetic participants (CON; 24 f, 23 m; 52.9 ± 13.4 years old; BMI = 30.9 ± 8.4). Vibration perception threshold (VPT), nerve distal latency (DL), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and nerve action potential amplitude (NAPA) in the lower limbs were measured.

Results

We found significant differences on Delta (delta) in NCV for both peroneal and sural motor nerve between the EXE and CON groups during the study period (P < .001, for both). The percentage of diabetic patients that developed motor neuropathy and sensory neuropathy during the 4 years of the study was significantly higher in the CON than the EXE group (17% vs. 0.0%, P < .05, and 29.8% vs. 6.45%, P < .05, respectively). In addition, the percentage of diabetic patients who developed increased VPT (25 V) during the study was significantly higher in the CON than the EXE group (21.3% vs. 12.9%, P < .05). Change on Hallux VPT from baseline to the end of the study was significantly different between the EXE and CON groups (P < .05); no significant change in Malleolus VPT between the two groups occurred.

Conclusions

This study suggests, for the first time, that long-term aerobic exercise training can prevent the onset or modify the natural history of DPN.

### Bortezomib-induced neuropathy in multiple myeloma manifesting as foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy [^5882df84]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

After medical neurology consultation, a nerve conduction study was performed, and it showed absent motor conduction in the right peroneal nerve and prolonged distal latency in bilateral median nerves. Compound muscle action potential was reduced in bilateral peroneal and median nerves. The conduction velocity was reduced in bilateral median nerves; F waves showed an absent response in bilateral peroneal nerves. Sensory conduction showed an absent response in bilateral superficial peroneal and bilateral median nerves. The final impression of the nerve conduction study was axonopathy in bilateral peroneal nerves and a demyelinating pattern in bilateral median nerves suggestive of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Electrodiagnostic reference values for upper and lower limb nerve conduction studies in adult populations [^187877b3]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Medium credibility.

Fibular (peroneal) and tibial motor nerve normative data — normal segmental drops and accessory deep fibular motor nerve prevalence are summarized. Conduction velocity slowing from below elbow to across elbow were 15m/s or 23%. The upper limit (at the 97th percentile) of normal drop in velocity from the lower leg to the across-knee segment was 6 m/s or 12%, and the upper limit of normal drop in amplitudes from below to above the fibular head was 25%. The fibular motor nerve review identified 161 studies and selected 1 article with 242 subjects, which noted that increasing height correlated with decreasing conduction velocity and increasing age with decreases in both conduction velocity and amplitude. One study in 200 subjects reported prevalence of the accessory deep fibular (peroneal) motor nerve (ADPN) in normal individuals of 13.5%. For the tibial motor nerve, 359 studies were initially identified and 2 met all NDTF criteria; one article of 250 subjects was selected.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with nonparalytic poliomyelitis [^aa425ef1]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine patients with previous nonparalytic poliomyelitis in search of muscle atrophy, weakness, and other late symptoms of poliomyelitis.

Design

A mailed questionnaire followed up with neurologic and neurophysiologic examinations of respondents who reported symptoms possibly related to the late sequelae of polio.

Setting

Neurology department at a university hospital.

Participants

Thirty-nine of 47 patients diagnosed with nonparalytic poliomyelitis and hospitalized at a Norwegian hospital between 1950 and 1954, during the Norwegian polio epidemic.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Electromyography to determine function of the anterior tibialis, vastus lateralis, and biceps brachii muscles; nerve conduction studies of the sural, peroneal, and tibial nerves; motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, and compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials, and distal latencies.

Results

Twenty-five of 47 patients (53.2%) reported symptoms possibly related to the late sequelae of poliomyelitis. Eight of 20 examined symptomatic patients had normal neurologic and neurophysiologic findings, whereas 9 others had other medical conditions that could explain the symptoms. Three patients (6.7%) had neurologic and neurophysiologic findings and development of symptoms consistent with motoneuron damage.

Conclusion

Some nonparalytic patients may have subclinical acute motoneuron damage with subsequent development and manifestation of motor weakness and neuromuscular symptoms many years later. These symptoms should be considered a differential diagnosis in patients who have a history of nonparalytic poliomyelitis.

### Early electrophysiological abnormalities and clinical neuropathy: a prospective study in patients with type 1 diabetes [^b9f2ac04]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The control group at follow-up comprised healthy volunteers (43 males and 57 females) 38 ± 9.8 years (range 21–55 years) of age and with a body height of 182 ± 7.2 cm (range 164–196 cm) for males and 168 ± 6.8 cm (range 150–181 cm) for females. Control subjects underwent a clinical examination and responded to a questionnaire. Exclusion criteria were 1) heredity of neurological disease, 2) presence of neurologic or metabolic disease, 3) treatment with medicine known to influence nerve function, or 4) signs of peripheral neuropathy, such as lack of tendon reflexes or decreased vibration sense.

There was no significant difference between patients examined at follow-up (n = 59) and patients who were not (n = 43). Variables compared were age at onset of diabetes, duration of diabetes, long-term HbA lc at baseline, peroneal MCV, peroneal CMAP, sural SCV, and sural SNAP (Mann-Whitney U test, data not shown).

Clinical neuropathy

The presence of diabetic neuropathy was determined by a staged approach according to established criteria (i.e. stage 0 = no nerve conduction abnormality; 1a = nerve conduction abnormality only; 1b = nerve conduction abnormality + signs; 2a = nerve conduction + signs + symptoms; and 2b = nerve conduction abnormality + symptoms + more severe signs [i.e. > 50% weakness of ankle dorsiflexion]). Nerve conduction abnormality was defined as more than one abnormal attribute in two separate nerves. An abnormal attribute with regard to nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was defined as < −2.33 SDS (first percentile or less) for the peroneal nerve (MCV and/or CMAP) and for the sural nerve (SCV and/or SNAP).

Metabolic control

Medical records were retrieved, and all HbA 1c values were extracted and converted to Mono S calibration (upper reference value < 5.3%). Long-term metabolic control at baseline and follow-up was estimated by calculating a weighted mean HbA 1c for each patient by dividing the total HbA 1c area under the curve by time elapsed. Long-term metabolic control will be mentioned and abbreviated as HbA 1c herein.

### Differential aging of median and ulnar sensory nerve parameters [^4ad8fb7c]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nerve conduction velocity slows and amplitude declines with aging.

Methods

Median and ulnar sensory nerves were tested at the annual meetings of the American Dental Association. Seven hundred four subjects had at least two observations. The rate of change in the nerve parameters was estimated while controlling for gender, age, change in hand temperature, baseline body mass index (BMI), and change in BMI.

Results

Amplitudes of the median sensory nerve action potentials decreased by 0.58 μV per year, whereas conduction velocity decreased at a rate of 0.41 m/s per year. Corresponding values for the ulnar nerve were 0.89 μV and 0.29 m/s per year. The rates of change in amplitudes did not differ, but the median nerve demonstrated a more rapid loss of conduction velocity.

Conclusions

The rate of change for the median conduction velocity was higher than previously reported. The rate of change of median conduction velocity was significantly greater than for the ulnar nerve.

### Inherited prion disease caused by a novel frameshift mutation ofresulting in protein truncation at codon 157 [^2b4a5a5c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Nerve conduction studies (NCS) revealed a length-dependent sensory axonal neuropathy restricted to his lower limbs. There were unobtainable sympathetic skin responses in the right foot and unobtainable sensory responses on left superficial peroneal nerve stimulation, with small sensory nerve action potentials on right superficial peroneal nerve stimulation (3.1 µV, normal range ≥ 4 µV) and bilaterally on sural nerve stimulation (right 3.6 µV, left 2.6 µV, normal range ≥ 7µV) with normal conduction velocities (right superficial peroneal nerve 42.0 m/s, right sural nerve 41.4 m/s, left sural nerve 39.9 m/s, normal range ≥ 40 m/s). Sensory responses were of normal amplitude in the upper limbs (right radialis 29.6 µV, normal range ≥ 15 µV, conduction velocity 54.1 m/s, normal range ≥ 50 m/s) with normal motor studies (recorded from peroneal, tibial and ulnar motor nerves). MRI brain showed normal cerebral volume for age, and no diffusion-weighted imaging changes were seen. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and electroencephalogram (EEG) were not done.

### Efficacy of long-term remote ischemic conditioning on vascular and neuronal function in type 2 diabetes patients with peripheral arterial disease [^2d1a5d9c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Tertiary outcome variables were unaffected by RIC. Central autonomic variables assessed by cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests and indices of heart rate variability were unaffected as were peripheral autonomic variables assessed by electrochemical skin conductance. Peripheral nerve function was not affected by RIC when assessed by sural nerve conduction velocity and action potential, vibration sensation threshold and light touch sensation or when small fiber nerve function was assessed by 40‐g pin‐prick induced pain (Tables 3 and 4). RIC did not elicit significant changes in the mean score of the MNSI questionnaire (Tables 3 and 4).

As a significant between‐group difference in mean sural nerve conductance velocity was seen at baseline (Table 2), models for vascular outcomes were additionally adjusted for this possible confounder for patients with baseline measure of the confounder. A treatment effect was seen as a reduction in transcutaneous oxygen tension on the right foot at week 4 and week 12 of 0.36 mm Hg (95% CI −0.59; −0.13) (P = 0.003) and 0.09 mm Hg (95% CI −0.17; −0.01) P = 0.037, respectively. No other treatment effects were seen in models adjusted for nerve conduction velocity (Table S1). A borderline significant group difference was seen for MNSI score (Table 2). When models for vascular outcomes were adjusted for this possible confounder for patients with baseline measure of the confounder a treatment effect was seen as an increase in transcutaneous oxygen tension on the right foot and mean values for both feet at week 1 with an estimate of 1.08 mm Hg (95% CI 0.26; 1.89) (P = 0.016) and 0.95 mm Hg (95% CI 0.2; 1.69) (P = 0.019), respectively. No other treatment effects were seen in models adjusted for nerve conduction velocity (Table S2). We did not adjust tertiary neuropathy outcomes further for nerve conductance velocity or MNSI score as these analyses were adjusted for baseline measures of the specific measure of nerve function.

### Conduction slowing in diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy [^84d50d07]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Another limitation of the study is the lack of confirmatory pathological documentation of demyelination causing conduction slowing, as might be observed in nerve biopsy specimens. However, sural nerve biopsy would be required, and this invasive procedure would not be well tolerated by most patients; furthermore, it is not considered essential for the accurate diagnosis of CIDP. Of course, slowing of conduction velocity might be attributable to loss of ion channels in the internodal region or other factors without true demyelination. Finally, we did not use the rigorous American Academy of Neurology criteria for the presence of demyelination in chronic inflammatory neuropathies. Those criteria are highly specific but lack sensitivity, so many other criteria have been developed to help diagnose CIDP. Instead, we used those limits for NCS parameters that trigger our suspicion for possible demyelinating neuropathy in the clinic and applied these criteria a priori to our DSP population; therefore, the results of this study are independent of cut point selection bias.

Despite that the conduction slowing DSP group is separate from patients with CIDP, the mechanism of nerve fiber injury may have similarities. This hypothesis is in keeping with prevailing views that type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated disorder, so disordered immune activity may be operative in both CIDP and conduction slowing DSP. The discovery in this analysis of a substantial subset of subjects with evidence of an electrophysiological pattern of isolated conduction slowing, seen more prominently and in association with worse glycemic control in those with type 1 diabetes, suggests that evidence of mild demyelination may result from higher glycemic exposure or may result from exaggerated autoimmunity to β-cells and nerves alike. In contrast, a similar relationship is not found in type 2 diabetic patients, suggesting that the pathophysiology differs in this form of diabetes. This also may be one explanation for the differences in neuropathy outcomes in long-term studies of patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and DSP.

The presence of poor glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients with evidence of conduction slowing indicates that this stage in the evolution of DSP may be amenable to treatment, in contrast to axonal and combined pathologies, which may be more resistant to therapy. This observation offers a window of opportunity to improve DSP via improved glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### A novel cause of CIDP: homozygous hotspot mutation, C.793 C > T in CASP8 gene [^7806913a]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

At 18 months of age, nerve conduction study showed prolonged distal onset motor latency (DML) (L median: 12.8 ms; L ulnar: 13.6 ms) and absent F-wave (FW) potential with slow nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the demyelinating range, associated with decreased compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and temporal dispersion in the left median (L: 0.4 mV) and ulnar motor nerves (L: 1.0 mV). Left median and ulnar sensory nerves showed no response. Prolonged DML (L peroneal: 10 ms; R peroneal: 18.8 ms; L post tibial: 9.6 ms; R post tibial: 13.6 ms) in the demyelinating range, no FW potentials and slow NCV in the demyelinating range were associated with temporal dispersion and decreasing CMAP in bilateral peroneal motor and posterior tibial motor nerves. Bilateral sural sensory nerves showed no response. Bilateral peroneal sensory nerves were not evaluated.

Muscle biopsy showed neurogenic atrophy and sural nerve biopsy showed inflammatory features with endoneurial mononuclear cells and demyelination with onion bulb formation consistent with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Immunohistochemical studies showed frequent scattered individual endoneurial cells, multiple endoneurial perivascular, and occasional epineurial perivascular collections of cells with CD-45 (leukocyte common antigen) staining. Cells showed reactivity to a macrophage (CD-68) preparation. There was a small endoneurial perivascular collection of inflammatory cells which was pan-positive for CD-3, CD-4, CD-8, and CD-20. An additional small endoneurial perivascular collection was present which was predominantly CD-3 positive with CD-8 positivity as well but essentially no staining for CD-4 or CD-20. Immunohistochemical staining of individual cells scattered throughout the endoneurium was strongly positive for CD-3, less positive for CD-8, and essentially negative for CD-4 or CD-20.

### Effects of prolonged repetitive stimulation of median, ulnar and peroneal nerves [^76ba94e2]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

It is important to know the effects of prolonged repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) when it is used in neurophysiological studies. RNS with up to 100 supramaximal stimuli was given to the median, ulnar, and peroneal nerves of normal subjects and the ulnar nerves of subjects with early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), recording evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). In all nerves, there was a decline in the CMAP area and a decrease in CMAP duration. For the peroneal nerve there was a decline in the CMAP amplitude, but a similar decline was not seen in the median or ulnar nerves. Cooling of the muscles resulted in decrement of both the amplitude and area with RNS. In ALS subjects, CMAP amplitude and area both declined after RNS of the ulnar nerve. In this study we describe the changes in CMAP with prolonged RNS among commonly tested normal nerves. Our findings have important implications with regard to RNS.

### Lateral meniscal cyst diagnosed after acute onset of common peroneal nerve palsy [^bd5132ee]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 38-year-old man had experienced swelling in his right lateral knee for 1 year, occasionally accompanied by pain. However, as the symptoms were tolerable, he did not initially seek medical attention. The patient had no history of prior injury that could have caused a meniscal tear. A week before his visit, he began experiencing progressive pain in the swollen area, along with numbness extending from the lateral lower leg to the foot. He consulted a local orthopaedic clinic and was referred to our department for additional evaluation and treatment. Within 1 week of waiting for his appointment, he developed difficulty with dorsiflexion of the ankle.

On initial examination, a tense, elastic mass approximately 3 cm in size was palpated on the lateral aspect of his right knee (Figure 1, A). A positive Tinel sign was observed at the site of the identified mass lesion, radiating pain along the lateral aspect of the lower leg in the area innervated by the superficial peroneal nerve. In addition, there were signs of deep peroneal nerve palsy (Manual Muscle Testing [MMT]: tibialis anterior [TA] 2, extensor hallucis longus [EHL] 0 to 1, and extensor digitorum longus [EDL] 0 to 1). The range of motion of the knee was 0° to 140°, which is within the normal range and showed no limitations. Owing to concerns about exacerbating the peroneal nerve palsy, the McMurray test was not done. Radiographs of the knee showed no significant findings, but MRI revealed a radial tear near the posterior segment in the lateral meniscus, with a cystic lesion contiguous with the lateral meniscus (Figure 1, B–E). The nerve conduction velocity test showed reduced amplitude and slowed conduction velocity of the peroneal nerve distal to the knee (Rt 40.5, Lt 54.7 m/s, Figure 2). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with common peroneal nerve palsy secondary to a lateral meniscal cyst. Given the nerve conduction velocity test results, it was determined that the common peroneal nerve palsy was not complete. The patient underwent emergency surgery under spinal anesthesia the day after his initial visit.

### Reference values for peroneal nerve motor conduction to the tibialis anterior and for peroneal vs. tibial latencies [^0a7fd8fb]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To generate a large normative database for the peroneal study to the tibialis anterior and to analyze differences between the peroneal latency to the extensor digitorum brevis and the tibial latency to the abductor hallucis.

Design

A total of 244 asymptomatic subjects without risk factors for neuropathy were tested for latency, amplitude, area, duration, and nerve conduction velocity to the tibialis anterior. For the peroneal/tibial analysis, 221 subjects were included. Temperature control was used, and demographic characteristics were recorded.

Results

Latency to the tibialis anterior increased and nerve conduction velocity decreased with increasing height. Amplitudes, area, and nerve conduction velocity were lower in older persons. The upper limits of normal (97th percentile) were 4.9 msec (latency) and 15.0 msec (duration). The lower limits of normal (3rd percentile) were 1.7 mV (amplitude), 6.8 microV/sec (area), and 43 m/sec (nerve conduction velocity). The upper limits of normal side-to-side difference was 1.2 msec (latency), 6.3 msec (duration), 50% (amplitude), 47% (area), and 20% (nerve conduction velocity). The upper limits of normal drop from below- to above-fibular-head stimulation was 36% (amplitude) and 43% (area). For the peroneal/tibial comparison, the upper limits of normal latency increase of peroneal over tibial was 1.8 msec and tibial over peroneal was 1.5 msec.

Conclusion

A large normative database was collected. Upper and lower limits of normal were calculated, and side-to-side differences were analyzed. For the peroneal/tibial comparison, an upper limits of normal difference was described.

### Medial dorsal superficial peroneal nerve studies in patients with polyneuropathy and normal sural responses [^01c631aa]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

We studied medial dorsal superficial peroneal (MDSP) nerves in 52 patients with clinical evidence of mild chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy and normal sural nerve responses, in order to assess the diagnostic sensitivity and usefulness of MDSP nerve testing in electrodiagnostic practice. To determine the effect of age on MDSP nerve parameters, 98 normal subjects were also examined. Electrodiagnostic evaluation involved studies of motor nerve conduction in tibial, peroneal, and median nerves; sensory nerve conduction in sural, MDSP, median, and radial nerves; tibial and peroneal nerve F waves; H reflexes from the soleus muscles; and needle electromyography of gastrocnemius and abductor hallucis muscles. Among the patients, 49% had low-amplitude sensory responses in MDSP nerves and 57% had either slowing of sensory conduction velocity or no sensory responses on proximal stimulation. MDSP nerve amplitude, tibial nerve motor velocity, and H reflexes were the most sensitive for detection of mild chronic symmetrical axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. MDSP nerve testing should be included in the routine electrodiagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected polyneuropathy and normal sural nerve responses.

### Effects of voluntary activity on the excitability of motor axons in the peroneal nerve [^5d639bca]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

To investigate whether there are inter-nerve differences in the extent and pattern of axonal excitability changes produced by voluntary contractions of tibialis anterior (TA) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB), threshold tracking was used to measure axonal excitability parameters [threshold, supernormality and strength-duration time constant (tauSD)] of peroneal and median motor axons in 11 healthy subjects. Maximal contractions for 1 min resulted in an increase in threshold, an increase in supernormality, a decrease in tauSD and an increase in latency, all of which indicate axonal hyperpolarization. The increase in threshold was less in peroneal axons (18 ± 4%) than median axons (37 ± 6%, mean ± SEM, P < 0.001), and was accompanied by smaller absolute changes in latency, supernormality, and tauSD. Peroneal axons had less supernormality at rest but a greater change in supernormality for the change in threshold. There were major contraction-induced changes in the compound muscle action potential of TA but not that of APB. Voluntary contractions depress axonal excitability, but the changes are quantitatively different for motor axons innervating different muscles. There are three clinical implications. First, weakness and fatigue due to activity-dependent conduction block may vary for different muscles, independent of disease severity, and therapeutic strategies to overcome activity-dependent conduction block may not be equally effective for different muscles. Second, in motor control studies using the H reflex to document motoneuron excitability, a constant stimulus will not produce a constant neural volley if the stimulated axons have been activated by, for example, a voluntary contraction. Third, TA is probably not optimal for testing for activity-dependent conduction block.

### Length-dependent weakness and electrophysiological signs of secondary axonal loss in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [^ffdc2a3c]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

In chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) the pathophysiology underlying permanent muscle weakness and sensory loss was studied in 22 stabilized long-term CIDP patients clinically characterized using isokinetic dynamometry, quantitative sensory testing, and neuropathy scores. Conduction velocity (CV), distal latency (DLAT), minimal F-wave latency (FLAT), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and amplitude decay between distal and proximal stimulation sites were determined in the median, ulnar, peroneal, and tibial motor nerves and sensory CV and nerve action potentials in the median and sural nerves. Amplitude of CMAP and the DLAT were related to quantitative muscle strength, whereas CV, FLAT, amplitude decay, and dispersion were not consistently related to strength. Furthermore, CMAP and muscle strength were significantly more reduced distally than proximally. In conclusion, the electrophysiological signs of axonal loss and the associated length-dependent muscle weakness suggest secondary axonal loss in addition to primary demyelination in CIDP.

### Distal sensory nerve conduction of the superficial peroneal nerve: new method and its clinical application [^a330a1e2]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

The superficial peroneal nerve subserves sensation on the entire surface of the dorsum of the foot, except in small areas. All previously reported techniques for evaluating nerve conduction along this nerve tested a proximal portion of the nerve. We report a new method for evaluating sensory nerve conduction of the four branches of the distal superficial peroneal nerve. Two branches to the second and third toes of the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve and two branches to the fourth and fifth toes of the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve were studied orthodromically and antidromically in 37 feet of 21 normal volunteers using surface stimulating and recording electrodes and with a distance of 10 cm between the stimulating and recording electrodes. Maximum nerve conduction velocities (NCV) ranged from 41.8 to 46.9 m/s, and mean response amplitude ranged from 6.5 to 7.6 microV with the orthodromic technique. Values for NCV were almost identical when elicited by antidromic and orthodromic techniques, but response amplitudes were higher with the antidromic technique. Mean amplitudes of the distal superficial peroneal nerve were about 50% of the proximal superficial peroneal, and the conduction velocity in the distal superficial peroneal was slower than that in the proximal superficial peroneal nerve, by 8–14 m/s. In seven cases, distal superficial peroneal neuropathy was confirmed with this technique: two with proper digital neuropathy, two with medial dorsal cutaneous neuropathy, and three with intermediate dorsal cutaneous neuropathy.

### Peripheral nerve function and lower extremity muscle power in older men [^cace2ad3]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether sensorimotor peripheral nerve function is associated with muscle power in community-dwelling older men.

Design

Longitudinal cohort study with 2.3 ± 0.3 years of follow-up.

Setting

One clinical site.

Participants

Participants (n = 372; mean age ± SD, 77.2 ± 5.1y; 99.5% white; body mass index, 27.9 ± 3.7kg/m(2); power, 1.88 ± 0.6W/kg) at 1 site of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (N = 5994).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

A nerve function ancillary study was performed 4.6 ± 0.4 years after baseline. Muscle power was measured using a power rig. Peroneal motor nerve conduction amplitude, distal motor latency, and mean f-wave latency were measured. Sensory nerve function was assessed using 10-g and 1.4-g monofilaments and sural sensory nerve conduction amplitude and distal latency. Peripheral neuropathy symptoms at the leg and feet were assessed by self-report.

Results

After adjustments for age, height, and total body lean and fat mass, 1 SD lower motor (β = -.07, P < .05) and sensory amplitude (β = -.09, P < .05) and 1.4-g (β = -.11, P < .05) and 10-g monofilament insensitivity (β = -.17, P < .05) were associated with lower muscle power/kg. Compared with the effect of age on muscle power (β per year, -.05; P < .001), this was equivalent to aging 1.4 years for motor amplitude, 1.8 years for sensory amplitude, 2.2 years for 1.4-g monofilament detection, and 3.4 years for 10-g detection. Baseline 1.4-g monofilament detection predicted a greater decline in muscle power/kg. Short-term change in nerve function was not associated with concurrent short-term change in muscle power/kg.

Conclusions

Worse sensory and motor nerve function were associated with lower muscle power/kg and are likely important for impaired muscle function in older men. Monofilament sensitivity was associated with a greater decline in muscle power/kg, and screening may identify an early risk for muscle function decline in late life, which has implications for disability.

### Amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy in a geriatric patient [^72e57194]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Investigations

Laboratory investigations showed unremarkable haematology and routine biochemistry. Creatine kinase and C-reactive protein levels were normal. CT of the lumbar spine showed no lytic lesions, but severe bone demineralisation. MRI of the lumbar spine showed scoliosis with degenerative disc disease and mild central canal stenosis at L1/L2 and L2/L3. Severe central canal stenosis was seen at L3/L4 and L4/L5. The Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service performed electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Only the left lower extremity was tested because EMG and nerve conduction studies were terminated prematurely due to bleeding in the context of anticoagulation. Her studies showed no response on superficial peroneal and sural sensory testing, severely reduced amplitude but normal conduction velocity of the extensor digitorum brevis, slightly reduced amplitude of the tibialis anterior and borderline normal amplitude but reduced conduction velocity on tibial motor testing. The overall impression was that the patient had an axonal length-dependent polyneuropathy of the left lower extremity, sensory greater than motor, and this was graded as severe. There was evidence of myopathic changes to the left iliopsoas muscle without frank denervation.

### Utility and practice of electrodiagnostic testing in the pediatric population: an AANEM consensus statement [^cab35b32]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric electrodiagnostic testing — technical and temperature considerations — notes that subcutaneous fat, particularly in younger children (< 2 years old), can pose technical challenges and can make it difficult to elicit sural or superficial peroneal sensory nerve responses consistently, and medial and lateral plantar responses may be measured orthodromically in such younger children to overcome this challenge. As in adults, effects of temperature must be carefully considered in the pediatric age group, and a 1°C decrease in local temperature results in a 1.2 to 2.4 m/s decrease in motor and sensory conduction velocities; infants may be more susceptible to cooling and overly anxious children may have cooler limbs due to the autonomic nervous system shunting blood.

### Differential impact of short-term and long-term glycemic variability on peripheral nerve function in type 2 diabetes: a 5-year cohort study [^9491da64]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Several studies have demonstrated the association between glycemic variability (GV) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). However, none has compared the effects of short-term and long-term GV on DPN in a cohort. This study evaluates the association between short-term and long-term GV and peripheral nerve function in a cohort of outpatients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Overall, 230 patients who had continuously attended the outpatient hospital for 5 years were enrolled. Short-term GV was assessed using continuous glucose monitoring (FreeStyle Libre Pro®), focusing on metrics such as the glucose levels" standard deviation and time in range. Long-term GV was evaluated by using visit-to-visit variability in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), including the HbA1c standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Nerve conduction was assessed using DPNCheck™ by measuring sural nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude and sensory conduction velocity (SCV). Multiple regression models were built to determine independent associations of GV and HbA1c variability metrics with SCV and SNAP amplitude.

Results

Most short-term GV indices were not associated with SNAP amplitude but significantly correlated with SCV; these associations were not evident after adjusting for HbA1c. Long-term GV showed minimal correlation with SCV, while strong associations with SNAP amplitude persisted after adjusting for the 5-year mean HbA1c.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that short-term and long-term GVs have differential impacts on peripheral nerve function in outpatients with type 2 diabetes; with short-term GV associated with SCV and long-term with SNAP amplitude.

### F-waves of peroneal and tibial nerves in the differential diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of L5 and S1 radiculopathies [^85c97d94]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate F-wave as a method to identify a specific root lesion of L5 or S1 and to quantitatively evaluate the severity and progression of motor root lesions in lumbosacral radiculopathies (LR).

Methods

Both peroneal and tibial F-waves were performed bilaterally in 142 patients with unilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathies and 37 controls along with Medical Research Council (MRC) evaluation, and soleus H-reflexes were tested bilaterally in 78 of these 142 cases. Both F-wave and MRC were re-evaluated approximately 1 year after initial examination in 65 patients.

Results

Abnormal peroneal F-waves were found in 34 patients with L5 radiculopathy (34/67, 50.7%) along with normal tibial F-waves and soleus H-reflexes in all tested cases. By contrast, 27 patients with S1 radiculopathy presented abnormal tibial F-waves (27/76, 36.0%) along with normal peroneal F-waves in all 76 cases and abnormal soleus H-reflexes in 38 of 47 (80.9%) cases. There were significant differences in involved side F-duration among different MRC scales in both radiculopathy groups (P < 0.05). Follow-up analysis demonstrated slow progression of both F-wave abnormalities and muscle weakness in patients undergoing conservative treatment (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Comparisons of F-waves between the same nerve on both sides and between peroneal and tibial nerves in the same leg may clearly increase the validity of F-waves for evaluating a specific motor root lesion of L5 or S1. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of F-waves may provide additional information on the severity of individual root lesions and their progression even in the early stages of disease. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### Axonal neuropathy in chronic peripheral arterial occlusive disease [^c2dec2ce]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic peripheral arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs may cause tissue damage. Type and extent of peripheral nerve involvement is controversial. We examined 25 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease in various grades of severity and 37 age-matched healthy controls using conventional angiography and motor and sensory nerve conduction tests. Subjects with confounding factors for peripheral neuropathies were excluded. We found prolongation of distal motor latencies, decrease of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, and reduction in amplitude of the compound muscle action potential. Amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials were lower in patients with pain at rest than in patients with intermittent claudication and decreased with increasing neurological disability score. Sural nerve conduction velocity, peroneal nerve F-wave chronodispersion, and tibial nerve F-wave persistence were the most frequent abnormal findings. Therefore we concluded that chronic peripheral arterial occlusive disease causes axonal degeneration, resulting in axonal polyneuropathy.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: a definition for clinical research: report of the American Academy of Neurology, the American association of electrodiagnostic medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [^35a4606b]. Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — nerve conduction study protocol for clinical research specifies that "The following set of sensory and motor NCSs should be performed if patients are entering a clinical research trial in which NCSs will be tracked longitudinally", including unilateral studies of "sural sensory, ulnar sensory, and median sensory nerves, and peroneal, tibial, median, and ulnar motor nerves with F waves", while "Other NCSs may be necessary as determined by clinical judgment". The minimum electrodiagnostic case-definition criterion is "an abnormality (≥ 99th or ≤ 1st percentile) of any attribute of nerve conduction in two separate nerves, one of which must be the sural nerve", and studies "should follow rigorous guidelines such as those set by the AAEM" with "Variables such as skin temperature, age, height, sex, and weight" measured and accounted for when reporting normal or abnormal results.

### Compound nerve action potential of common peroneal nerve recorded at fibular neck: its clinical usefulness [^ceeb8241]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the clinical usefulness of the compound nerve action potential of the common peroneal nerve recorded immediately distal to or at the fibular neck, at the same time stimulating the common peroneal nerve laterally at the posterior knee.

Design

For recording the compound nerve action potential of the common peroneal nerve, the active recording electrode was secured just distal to or at the fibular neck area, whereas the stimulating electrode was placed on the medial border of the lateral hamstring tendon at the level of the popliteal crease. To reduce shock artifacts, a biphasic stimulation was used.

Results

In 35 adults (n = 19 men), 70 nerves were tested. The compound nerve action potential from each individual was recorded. The compound nerve action potential amplitude of a baseline-to-negative peak and conduction velocity were measured on both sides. For comparisons of the side-to-side amplitude and conduction velocity, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was applied.

Conclusion

This approach of recording the compound nerve action potential of the common peroneal nerve, in addition to conventional methods, may enhance the process of determining the precise localization of peroneal nerve lesion in the knee.

### Don't use electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction… [^77d98734]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are measures of nerve and muscle function. They may be indicated when there is concern for a neurologic injury or disorder, such as the presence of leg or arm pain, numbness or weakness associated with compression of a spinal nerve. As spinal nerve injury is not a cause of neck, mid back, or low back pain, EMG/NCS have not been found to be helpful in diagnosing the underlying causes of axial lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine pain.

### Regeneration of peripheral nerve gaps with a polyglycolic acid-collagen tube [^b5abcbb1]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to report by means of objective methods on the effectiveness of a nerve reconstruction procedure using a bioresorbable tube in two patients. Our previous successes in regenerating canine peripheral nerves across long distances (80-mm gaps) using a bioabsorbable tube have led us to investigate the value of such a tube for the treatment of human patients with chronic nerve injuries.

Methods

The device was made from a cylindrically woven polyglycolic acid tube filled with a collagen sponge. It was designed to be resorbed after nerve regeneration. Peripheral sensory nerve defects in two patients with neuroma and pain were reconstructed using this tube. Patient 1 (a 62-year-old man) had a 20-mm defect of the proper digital nerve, and Patient 2 (a 56-year-old woman) had a 65-mm defect of the superficial peroneal nerve.

Results

After surgery, both patients recovered from the unpleasant sensations and intolerable pain. In Patient 1, functional recovery was objectively identified at 2 months, and conduction velocity of the nerve recovered to 49.1 m/s. In Patient 2, conduction velocity of the nerve was determined to be 16.9 m/s at 5 months. Current perception threshold testing indicated that sensory nerve function had been recovered by 65 days after surgery.

Conclusion

This work represents the first precise clinical evaluation, performed under objective evaluation criteria, of sensory recovery achieved using a nerve tube, suggesting that the use of a polyglycolic acid-collagen tube has the potential to become a viable alternative to conventional autografting for the repair of peripheral nerve defects.

### The diagnostic criteria for small fibre neuropathy: from symptoms to neuropathology [^960b0885]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Neurophysiological tests

Patients underwent motor and sensory NCS using surface recording electrodes with standard placement. Normal lower values for ulnar and median sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude and conduction velocity (antidromic technique from fifth to second finger) were > 20 μV and > 50 m/s, whereas those for sural SNAP amplitude and conduction velocity were > 6 μV and > 42 m/s. Compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and conduction velocity of peroneal, tibial, ulnar and median nerves were examined. A difference of at least 50% in SNAP and CMAP amplitude was required to define a significant asymmetry between sides. When appropriate, F -wave examination of the same nerves was carried out by delivering 20 random stimuli and minimal latency was corrected by height. Electromyography was performed with standard concentric needle in at least one proximal and one distal muscle of the extremities. A minimum of at least three areas with fibrillation potentials and/or positive sharp waves was required to identify a muscle as having spontaneous activity at rest. Motor unit potential changes and maximal recruitment pattern were evaluated with a semiquantitative recording.

In all patients who had already undergone NCS in other hospitals, we analysed the traces in order to verify the reliability of the examination and referred to the report signed by the neurophysiologist. When the traces were not available or the quality of the recording did not appear reliable or the test had been performed more than 3 months before, we repeated the examination.

### Electrodiagnostic reference values for upper and lower limb nerve conduction studies in adult populations [^113e1822]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Medium credibility.

AANEM Normative Data Task Force — study identification and selection for adult nerve conduction study reference values states that electrodiagnostic (EDx) testing is used extensively to diagnose neuromuscular disorders but a universal standard for nerve conduction studies (NCS) is not available, and the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) formed the Normative Data Task Force (NDTF) to establish a set of evidence-based criteria to screen the peer-reviewed published literature. Methods included a literature search of studies published from 1990 to 2012 using "nerve conduction" or "nerve conduction studies" and the names of the 11 sensory and motor nerves routinely tested in the upper and lower extremities in the databases PubMed/Medline; EMBASE; Web of Science; and Scopus, with specific nerve terms including "radial sensory", "median sensory", "ulnar sensory", "median motor", "ulnar motor", "medial antebrachial cutaneous", "lateral antebrachial cutaneous", "sural", "superficial peroneal", "peroneal motor", and "tibial motor". Initial screening assessed whether studies had a sample size of > 100 healthy subjects.

Partial conduction block — reference normal limits over distance and study thresholds indicate the magnitude of change compatible with normal variability and with block claims. For the median and ulnar nerves with comparison of elbow to wrist stimulation, the normal range at least extends to an increase in duration of 25%, a decrease in amplitude of 25%, and a decrease in area of 20%. For the peroneal nerve with comparison of knee to ankle stimulation, the limits of normal at least permit an increase in duration of 30%, a decrease in amplitude of 30%, and a decrease in area of 25%. For the tibial nerve with comparison of knee to ankle stimulation, the normal range at least extends to an increase in duration of 30%, a decrease in amplitude of 50%, and a decrease in area of 30%. With older patients the increase in duration and decrease in amplitude (and, to a lesser extent, decrease in area) are more prominent than in young patients. The degree of amplitude and area reduction that has been required to support partial conduction block in clinical studies has ranged from 20% to 50% for amplitude and 20% to 40% for area, and in a computer simulation study amplitude reduction of 65% and area reduction of 50% was achieved with temporal dispersion as conduction distance approached 50 cm.

### Diabetic neuropathy: a cross-sectional study of the relationships among tests of neurophysiology [^dec555b2]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Quantitative sensory testing

Thermal testing was performed using a Medoc TSA-II thermal and vibratory analyzer (WR Medical Electronics, Stillwater, MN). The method of limits was used for detection of 1) warmth, 2) cool, 3) heat pain, 4) cold pain on the right thenar eminence of the hand and dorsum of the foot, and 5) vibration detection on the right thumb and right great toe. In brief, three repetitions of the same stimulus were applied with standard instructions with maximal heat stimulation of 50°C and cold of 0°C to avoid cutaneous injury. If response variability was > 10%, subjects were given a break before retesting.

Nerve conduction studies

Nerve conduction studies were performed using a Viking IIIP electromyograph (Viasys Healthcare, Madison, WI) by the same trained technician for all patients. Peroneal and sural nerve conduction studies were performed on the left leg using standard methodologies. Results of the peroneal motor conduction velocity, peroneal compound muscle action potential, sural sensory conduction velocity, and sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) were reported for all individuals. Individuals without recordable responses were assigned amplitudes of 0 and the lowest measured velocity and longest distal latency of any subject.

Autonomic testing

Subjects had continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure and electrocardiography monitoring during autonomic testing. Cardiovagal function was assessed by the heart rate response to deep respiration and the heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver. Sympathetic adrenergic function was measured by the blood pressure response during phase 2 and phase 4 of the Valsalva maneuver, and the hemodynamic response to passive 60° upright tilt for 10 min.

Laser Doppler flowmetry

After 20 min of adjustment to the ambient temperature (23–24°C), the blood flow responses to iontophoresis of 1% acetylcholine chloride solution were assessed at the volar surface of the forearm and at the dorsum of the foot with two single point laser Doppler probes and a DRT4 laser Doppler blood flow monitor (Moor Instruments, Millwey, Devon, U.K.) using standard protocols. The baseline blood flow was measured for 40 s, followed by 60 s of iontophoresis at 200 μA. The vasodilatory response was measured for 90 s after iontophoresis in endothelial-dependent (direct blood flow) and -independent (axon reflex–mediated blood flow) regions.

### Early electrophysiological abnormalities and clinical neuropathy: a prospective study in patients with type 1 diabetes [^e62126f6]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Subjects

Unselected patients with type 1 diabetes (N = 102) examined on at least one previous occasion with nerve conduction tests were included in the current study. Table 1 shows the background data at baseline and follow-up of the 59 patients who agreed to participate. All patients had been receiving intensive therapy from disease onset, which involved the administration of insulin four to seven times daily by either injection or an external subcutaneous infusion pump. All subjects gave their informed consent before participation. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Research Ethics Committee, Linköping.

Table 1
Background data and electrophysiological results for 59 patients with type 1 diabetes examined at baseline and follow-up

Baseline examination

At baseline, no patient had a history of neurological or metabolic disease besides diabetes, of alcohol abuse, or of taking medicine known to influence peripheral nerve function. A direct inquiry, modified from Dyck et al. was made about typical symptoms of neuropathy. The tendon reflexes were examined bilaterally in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius, and vibratory sense was tested in the first metatarsal bilaterally with a 128-Hz tuning fork. Patients were asymptomatic, and tendon reflexes and vibration sense were present in all patients.

The baseline neurophysiological examination included bilateral measurements of the peroneal and median motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and the sural and median sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP). All amplitudes (i.e. CMAPs, SNAPs) were measured from peak to peak, and sensory nerves were studied with orthodromic recording of SNAPs. The results of the baseline examination have been published as well as a description of the controls (n = 128).

### Electrodiagnostic assessment of peri-procedural iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries and rehabilitation [^cd17f815]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1 Mechanical Insults

Mild injuries most often are associated with mechanical stress and result in microcirculation disruption and focal inflammation. These mild PPNI usually present with transient weakness and/or dysesthesias without permanent nerve fiber damage and are the result of physiological abnormalities that resolve after pressure is released. Sensorimotor symptoms may resolve within minutes of micro‐stress cessation because there is no physical nerve or VN damage. When compression leads to transient myelin distortion, subsequent neural symptoms may last minutes to days following removal of compression.

Neural stretch injuries can transition from micro‐ to macro‐trauma due to increases in duration or force severity. Consequences of this trauma include increased intraneural venous pressure, endoneurial edema, and focal saltatory conduction disruption due to localized mechanical myelin disruption. In the setting of localized myelin disruption, measurable conduction block (CB) or slowing for a period of days to six weeks may be observed, with the potential for full neurological recovery. Compression type nerve injuries frequently present for EDX evaluation as mild injuries with partial sensory dysesthesias and motor weakness primarily associated with neurapraxia (focal CB). Crush injuries are colloquially considered severe compression type injuries. However, crush injury severity is dependent on the amount and duration of pressure upon neural structures, thus a range of compressive neuronal injury is observed.

### Retrospective study of a TTR FAP cohort to modify NIS + 7 for therapeutic trials [^48fa4142]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Protein stabilization and oligonucleotide therapies are being tested in transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR FAP) trials. From retrospective analysis of 97 untreated TTR FAP patients, we test the adequacy of Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 tests (NIS+7) and modifications to comprehensively score impairments for use in such therapeutic trials. Our data confirms that TTR FAP usually is a sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic features which usually is symmetric, length dependent, lower limb predominant and progressive. NIS+7 adequately assesses weakness and muscle stretch reflexes without ceiling effects but not sensation loss, autonomic dysfunction or nerve conduction abnormalities. Three modifications of NIS+7 are suggested: 1) use of Smart Somatotopic Quantitative Sensation Testing (S ST QSTing); 2) choice of new autonomic assessments, e.g., sudomotor testing of distributed anatomical sites; and 3) use of only compound muscle action potential amplitudes (of ulnar, peroneal and tibial nerves) and sensory nerve action potentials of ulnar and sural nerve - than the previously recommended attributes suggested for the sensitive detection of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy. These modifications of NIS+7 if used in therapeutic trials should improve characterization and quantification of sensation and autonomic impairment in TTR FAP and provide better nerve conduction tests.

### Persistent neuromuscular and neurophysiologic abnormalities in long-term survivors of prolonged critical illness [^4818dbc0]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and electrophysiologic features of residual neuromuscular dysfunction after prolonged critical illness.

Design

Prospective follow-up study of survivors of prolonged critical illness.

Setting

A university hospital and two district general hospitals in the UK.

Patients

The study occurred for a period of 5 yrs. All patients during that time who were in the intensive care unit for > 28 days were entered in the study.

Measurements and Main Results

At follow-up, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were recorded from the case notes. A clinical history was obtained, a Barthel Index disability score was calculated, and a full neurologic examination was performed. Nerve conduction studies, needle electromyography, single-fiber electromyography and thermal thresholds were performed. A total of 195 patients were identified. There were 86 survivors, of whom 47 could be contacted and 22 consented to be studied. The median time from intensive care unit discharge to follow-up was 43 months (range, 12–57 months). All gave a clear history of severe weakness and functional impairment after hospital discharge and, in all, recovery was prolonged. Motor or sensory deficits were present on clinical examination in 59% of the patients studied. Common peroneal nerve palsy was present in two patients. A total of 21 of 22 (95%) patients had electromyographic evidence of chronic partial denervation at follow-up, findings indicative of a preceding axonal neuropathy. The single-fiber electromyographic studies were also consistent with a preceding motor neuropathy.

Conclusion

Severe weakness requiring prolonged rehabilitation and abnormal clinical neurologic findings are extremely common in survivors of protracted critical illness. Neurophysiologic evidence of chronic partial denervation of muscle consistent with previous critical illness polyneuropathy is almost invariable and can be found up to 5 yrs after intensive care unit discharge in > 90% of these long-stay patients. Evidence of myopathy is unusual. These findings have important implications for the management and rehabilitation of intensive care survivors.

### Late-onset sensory-motor axonal neuropathy, a novel SLC12A6-related phenotype [^2ff54464]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Patients and clinical assessments

The patients lived in different regions in Norway and were seemingly not related. The families were referred to Neurological Departments on suspicion of polyneuropathy. After confirmation of the diagnosis, a genetic test for peripheral neuropathies was ordered. Additional family members were invited for a neurologic consultation and DNA analysis.

Clinical investigations were performed by a neurologist. Cranial nerves, muscle weakness, reflexes and sensation were scored according to the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS). Strength is scored linearly from 0 to 4, normal strength is scored 0, paralysis is scored 4 and 25% muscle weakness, 50% muscle weakness and 75% muscle weakness are scored 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Movement against gravity, movement with gravity eliminated and muscle flicker without movement are scored 3.25, 3.5 and 3.75, respectively. Sensory deficits and reduces tendon reflexes are scored from 0 to 2 with normal findings graded 0, mildly/moderately affected modality graded 1 and severely affected modality graded 2. Ankle reflexes were scored according to the NIS guidelines: For patients 50–69 years old, ankle reflexes which are decreased are graded 0 and when absent graded 1. For patients aged ≥ 70 years, absent ankle reflexes are graded 0. Right and left limb are scored individually.

The study was approved by the local data protection officer and patients gave their written informed consent.

Nerve conduction studies and EMG

These tests were performed in different hospitals in Norway over a time period of several years, and the protocols differed to some extent. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed in at least one leg and one arm in most patients. Surface electrodes were used for stimulation and registration. Motor NCS included the median, ulnar, peroneal and tibial nerves, and sensory NCS the median, ulnar, radial and sural nerves and in some patients also the superficial peroneal and medial plantar nerves. The results were compared with normal values if available by the manufacturer where the degree of abnormalities is expressed as Z- scores (number of standard deviations between obtained and expected value dependent on age and height). Z -scores of amplitudes and conduction velocities are abnormal if ≤ −2.0. Concentric needle EMG were performed in at least one distal and often one proximal lower limb muscle on at least one side (often the tibial anterior muscle and lateral vastus muscle).

### Utility and practice of electrodiagnostic testing in the pediatric population: an AANEM consensus statement [^98a0bb1c]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric nerve conduction study (NCS) normative expectations are outlined, emphasizing maturation effects and key velocity benchmarks. Axon diameter and myelination increase until adult values are attained at 4–5 years of age. For ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity, a healthy adult is > 52 m/s, whereas values for a healthy full-term newborn are expected to be 20–36 m/s, and for a premature infant at 25 weeks gestational age velocities are < 15 m/s. In preterm infants, serial NCSs show gradual increases in conduction velocities toward term values during the third trimester. Interpretation should also account for body size, as height should be taken into account for children because nerve conduction velocity is inversely proportional to an individual's height.

### Bupivacaine hydrochloride in dextrose (bupivacaine) [^b2196be1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Bupivacaine blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone.

### Improvements in diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy after bariatric surgery: a prospective cohort study [^0eeeae8c]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

This study shows an improvement in the neuropathy symptom profile, which takes into account sensory, motor and autonomic symptoms, in keeping with the results of the DiaSurg1 study. The DiaSurg1 study also found an improvement in the neuropathy disability score, driven by changes in vibration perception and Achilles reflexes, implying large fibre benefits. However, in the present study, we found no improvement in the neuropathy disability score, vibration perception threshold or nerve conduction studies. This confirms the study by Miras et al. which also found no significant improvement in radial, sural and peroneal nerve conduction velocities or amplitudes after bariatric surgery.

In the DiaSurg1 study, there was no change in temperature perception or pinprick thresholds, suggesting no impact on small fibres. Whilst we also found no improvement in cold and warm temperature thresholds or deep breathing heart rate variability, there was a significant improvement in corneal nerve morphology. CCM has previously been used to show corneal nerve fibre repair, despite no change in neuropathy symptoms and deficits, neurophysiology, quantitative sensory testing and skin biopsy in patients with type 1 diabetes following simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation. A novel first-in-class peptide ARA290 (Cibinetide) which blocks inflammation has been shown to improve corneal nerve fibre density and length in patients with sarcoidosis-related neuropathy and T2DM, which was paralleled by an improvement in pain scores and functional outcomes. In a 12-month trial of seal oil omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in patients with T1DM, there was a 29% increase in CNFL, with no change in nerve conduction velocity and sensory function.

### Hypertension contributes to neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes [^3823e0e0]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantitative sensory testing

Quantitative sensory testing included measurement of vibration perception threshold (VPT) on the tip of the large toe using the Neurothesiometer (Horwell, Scientific Laboratory Supplies, Nottingham, UK) and warm and cold perception thresholds on the dorsum of the left foot using the method of limits with the MEDOC TSA II (Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel).

Nerve conduction

Electrodiagnostic studies were undertaken using a Dantec "Keypoint" system (Dantec Dynamics, Bristol, UK) equipped with a DISA temperature regulator to keep lower limb temperature constantly between 32 and 35 o C. Sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), sural nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), tibial compound motor action potential (TCMAP), tibial motor nerve conduction velocity (TMNCV), peroneal compound motor action potential (PCMAP), and peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (PMNCV) were assessed in the right lower limb by a consultant neurophysiologist. Sural sensory responses were measured using a bipolar bar electrode (interelectrode distance 3cm) attached over the sural nerve at the lateral malleolus. Stimulation was performed 140 mm proximal to the active recording electrode in the calf. Abnormal nerve conduction was defined based on 2 abnormal nerve conduction velocities of either SNCV, TMNCV, or PMNCV. The cutoff values of the nerve conduction velocities were defined on the - 2 SD from the mean based on our control population.

### Ten-year follow-up of peripheral nerve function in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy after liver transplantation [^7ce19530]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The electrophysiological long-term effects of liver transplantation on peripheral nerve function in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) have not been evaluated.

Methods

Eight FAP patients with a proven ATTRVal30Met gene were observed for 10 years after liver transplantation. We performed repeated measurement of maximal motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV), distal latency, size of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and maximal sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) in both the ulnar and tibial nerves. We also recorded the coefficients of variance in the R-R interval on the electrocardiogram (CV(R-R)).

Results

Some autonomic symptoms subsided but motor and sensory symptoms 10 years after transplantation were either slightly improved or almost the same as before surgery in 7 of 8 patients. These 7 have returned to their previous social lives including their jobs. The MCV of the tibial nerve slightly improved, and other parameters of motor and sensory nerve function and CV(R-R) did not show any deterioration during the 10-year observation period.

Conclusions

Liver transplantation can halt the progression of peripheral neuropathy in FAP patients.

### Ultraconformable cuff implants for long-term bidirectional interfacing of peripheral nerves at sub-nerve resolutions [^29f63459]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The nerve cuffs were also able to extract conduction velocity and direction from nerve recordings from awake freely-moving animals, a feature which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. Action potential conduction through axons occurs at velocities ranging from approximately 0.4 to 120 m/s, with different types of axon fibres having different conduction velocities. As different nerve fibre populations are associated with different physiological and pathological roles, a method to selectively identify the activity of specific velocities is a highly valuable research and clinical tool. Methods to sort recorded nerve activity based on conduction velocity and direction have long existedand have mostly been used and validated in animals under anaesthesia to analyse the velocity of electrically-evoked compound action potentials. However, the lack of implantable devices with high quality recordings and precise electrode positioning has prevented their translation to more physiologically-relevant awake models. The high interface quality and compact design of the cuffs developed in this work allowed us to implement this feature. Our devices recorded action potential conduction velocities in the expected physiological range. Earlier velocity analysis methods often relied on the addition of individual action potentials with varying amounts of delay, producing as a readout the maximum amplitude of the delay-and-add trace. This method was not well suited for velocity sorting of large volumes of bidirectionally transmitted spikes from awake animals, leading us to develop two new analysis methods. Although the experimental design and behavioural setup of our study precluded the selective manipulation of specific nerve fibre populations, the consistency between the outcomes of both analysis methods and their alignment with established velocities of known fibre populationssupport the efficacy of the velocity sorting capabilities of our cuffs.

### Microscale electrode implantation during nerve repair: effects on nerve morphology, electromyography, and recovery of muscle contractile function [^a6e208d8]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The authors' goal is to develop a peripheral nerve electrode with long-term stability and fidelity for use in nerve/machine interfaces. Microelectromechanical systems use silicon probes that contain multichannel actuators, sensors, and electronics. The authors tested the null hypothesis that implantation of microelectromechanical systems probes does not have a detrimental effect on peripheral nerve function or regeneration.

Methods

A rat hind-limb, peroneal nerve model was used in all experimental groups: intact nerve (control group, n = 10); nerve division and repair (repair group, n = 9); and nerve division, insertion of microelectromechanical systems probe, and repair (repair plus probe group, n = 9). Nerve morphology, nerve to compound muscle action potential studies, walking tracks, and extensor digitorum longus muscle function tests were evaluated following an 80-day recovery.

Results

Repair and repair plus probe showed no differences in axon count, axon size, percentage nonneural area, compound muscle action potential amplitude, latency, muscle mass, muscle force, or walking track scores. Although there was some local fibrosis around each microelectromechanical systems probe, this did not lead to measurable detrimental effects in any anatomical or functional outcome measurements.

Conclusion

The absence of a significant difference between the repair and the repair plus probe groups regarding histology, compound muscle action potential, walking tracks, and muscle force suggests that microelectromechanical systems electrodes are compatible with regenerating axons and show promise for establishing chemical and electrical interfaces with peripheral nerves.

### Simplified electrophysiological evaluation of peripheral nerves in critically ill patients: the Italian multi-centre CRIMYNE study [^a1fbc757]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

CIP and CIM are frequent complications in ICU patients and are responsible for prolonged disability after ICU discharge. Clinical diagnosis is often unreliable in the ICU, and therefore electrophysiological studies must be used. Complete electrophysiological investigations are, however, time-consuming, and therefore CIP and CIM are rarely systematically investigated in the ICU, except for research purposes. In the present study, we found that a simplified electrophysiological investigation assessment is accurate and can be started early after ICU admission and used in daily routine. The simplified electrophysiological test we used consisted of conduction velocity and amplitude of the sural SNAP and peroneal CMAP in one leg; however, unilateral testing of peroneal CMAP had the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. This is an important finding because the SNAP amplitude is 1,000 times lower than CMAP amplitude and is therefore more difficult to measure accurately, particularly if oedema is present, and is more prone to misinterpretation. Although not formally assessed, the time needed to measure a peroneal CMAP in one leg can be estimated to be 5 to 10 minutes, which is substantially lower than the 45 to 90 minutes needed for a complete electrophysiological investigation.

A 25% reduction of the peroneal CMAP was as sensitive as a reduction of more than two SDs in diagnosing CRIMYNE. This first test, however, had a lower specificity (the true-negative rate) and in order to be calculated needed a baseline evaluation of the peroneal CMAP amplitude at ICU admission. The second test proved to be not only more accurate but also more efficient, needing to be compared with normal values and not with baseline peroneal CMAP. According to Marciniak and coworkers, the possible sources of normal values of electrodiagnostic studies which will permit a report of an abnormal result to be considered reliable include (a) values obtained in a normal group (according to the reference standard) enrolled specifically for the article, (b) normal values established in normal control subjects tested in the same laboratory, and (c) normal values established in normal control subjects using the same electrodiagnostic techniques, even if obtained in another laboratory.

### Effect of interelectrode distance on sural nerve action potential parameters [^cd785c2f]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess differences in amplitude, latency, and duration, using a 3-cm vs. 4-cm distance between the active and reference electrodes when performing sural nerve conduction studies (NCS). Current normative data in lower-limb studies are generally based on 3-cm interelectrode differences, although 4-cm differences have been reported to be optimal in the upper limb.

Design

Prospective study comparing the onset latency, peak latency, duration, and amplitude for the sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) recording at two interelectrode distances in adult volunteers.

Results

Forty-three sural nerves were studied in 22 normal subjects. Peak latencies recorded with a 4-cm interelectrode distance were significantly longer than those recorded with a 3-cm distance (mean difference = 0.06 msecs [SD = 0.09, P = 0.0073]). Duration was significantly longer (mean difference = 0.03 msecs [SD = 0.07, P = 0.0270]), conduction velocities were significantly slower (mean difference = -0.7 msecs [SD 1.0, P = 0.0012]), and onset latency and amplitude were not found to differ significantly. Average differences in peak latencies, duration, velocity, onset latency, and amplitude were not correlated with gender, age, or BMI.

Conclusions

In contrast to studies of upper-limb sensory NCS, sural SNAP parameters obtained with 3- and 4-cm interelectrode distances did not differ for onset latencies and amplitude. Peak latencies, duration, and conduction velocity differences, though statistically significant, were of insufficient magnitude to be clinically meaningful. By using a 4-cm instead of a 3-cm interelectrode difference for sural nerve studies, the small prolongation of 0.06 msecs in peak latency and tiny increment of 0.27 muV observed in our investigation is unlikely to influence the electrodiagnostician's interpretation of the study.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^4eb40ba2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

In conjunction with a neurophysiologist, a neurologist or peripheral nerve surgeon can advise on further clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and tissue investigations. Patients with suspected PUN should be investigated for previously undiagnosed diabetes and other common causes of peripheral neuropathy, such as B12 deficiency and thyroid dysfunction. Electrodiagnostic studies (nerve conduction studies and needle motor and sensory EMG) are used to determine the site of the nerve lesion and estimate its severity, but their timing, execution, and interpretation are beyond the scope of this review. Bilateral nerve conduction testing should be undertaken, as the contralateral (unaffected) nerve will, in 85% of cases, display slowing of conduction, suggesting a predisposition to the neuropathy. The contralateral nerve cannot be considered a true 'control' because it will have been exposed to at least some of the same conditions of anaesthesia and surgery as the affected nerve; however, it is known that many patients with PUN have a pre-existing subclinical neuropathy that is brought to clinical attention by perioperative events. The timing of electrodiagnostic studies is a complex area with no definitive guidance available to anaesthetists. EMG performed immediately postoperatively may assist in determining whether any neurological deficit was present before anaesthesia and surgery, as signs of denervation take more than 2 weeks to appear; however, tests undertaken within 7–10 days of presentation can be falsely reassuring, as the processes of nerve degeneration will not yet manifest. Electrodiagnostic testing is often deferred until 3–4 weeks after injury because, by that time, a temporary neuropraxia will have resolved, and the studies will usually provide diagnostic and prognostic information. MRI of the brachial plexus can provide useful information on anatomical abnormalities at the level of roots, trunks, and cords to account for a patient's symptoms. Imaging can also usefully exclude the presence of neuroma in cases manifesting later in the postoperative period. Nerve biopsy can be undertaken on the advice of specialist neurological input to exclude an inflammatory component to the injury pattern. Serial electrodiagnostic testing, conducted every 3 months, is most useful to document the recovery of nerve function.

### Clinical nerve conduction and needle electromyography studies [^50019dd9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

The electrodiagnostic study, consisting of nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography, is a useful adjunct to the clinical examination of the peripheral nervous system. The three types of nerve conduction study are motor, sensory, and mixed, of which motor is the least sensitive. Electromyography records the intrinsic electrical activity of muscle fibers, thus providing the physiologic status of muscle function. To interpret the electrodiagnostic study results, the clinician must understand the anatomic and physiologic basis of the studies. Peripheral nerve entrapment initially results in focal demyelination; thus, nerve conduction velocity slows across the site. However, with radiculopathy and nerve root compression, the nerve conduction study may be normal. Both nerve trauma and polyneuropathy show marked differences in their effect on the results of electrodiagnostic studies.

### Acute isovolemic anemia does not impair peripheral or central nerve conduction [^24d858d5]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have found subtle slowing of responses in tests of addition and digit-symbol substitution during acute severe isovolemic anemia to a hemoglobin concentration of 5 g/dl in healthy unmedicated humans. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that such changes relate to the slowing of afferent neural traffic.

Methods

The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist in seven healthy unmedicated volunteers before and after induction of acute isovolemic anemia to a nadir hemoglobin concentration of 5.1 ± 0.3 g/dl (mean ± SD). Times for neural impulses to travel from the stimulus site to the brachial plexus, cervical spinal cord, and cerebral cortex were measured using somatosensory evoked potentials. Tests were repeated during acute anemia with the subject breathing oxygen. As a control for time and intrasubject variation, the testing was repeated on a separate day when anemia was not produced at times equivalent to those on the experimental day.

Results

Induced acute severe isovolemic anemia decreased nerve conduction latencies from the wrist to the contralateral cerebral cortex (i.e., to the N20 peak) by 2.3 ± 1.6% compared with values at a mean hemoglobin concentration of 12.7 g/dl (P < 0.01). These decreased latencies were due solely to an increased peripheral conduction velocity, from the wrist to the brachial plexus (P < 0.05), and were not altered when subjects breathed oxygen (P > 0.05). Conduction velocity from the brachial plexus or cervical spinal cord to the cerebral cortex did not change with acute anemia (P > 0.05). Latencies did not differ on the control day among the times of testing (all P > 0.05), nor did they differ at baseline between the control and experimental days (all P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Somatosensory evoked potential latencies were not increased by acute severe isovolemic anemia, making it unlikely that the afferent portion of the neural system is responsible for slowing of cognitive responses previously observed during acute anemia. Because severe isovolemic anemia did not increase somatosensory evoked potential latencies, etiologies other than anemia should be sought if latencies are increased during intraoperative monitoring.

### Lessons from injury: how nerve injury studies reveal basic biological mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities for peripheral nerve diseases [^12fe7ff4]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Basic Biology of Injury-Induced Axon Degeneration

Today's detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanism of programmed axon death stems from the discovery in 1989 of an overtly normal strain of mice in which a spontaneous mutation delayed the axon degeneration distal to a nerve injury by tenfold. Instead of the normal latent phase of around 36 h, during which substantial Schwann cell morphological responses discussed below begin, the distal stump remains intact for 2–3 weeks. Both PNS and CNS axons of these Wallerian degeneration slow (WLD S mice are protected; they remain functionally competent for much of their extended survival time if an action potential is artificially evoked in the distal stump, and the molecular mechanism is clearly distinct from programmed cell death by apoptosis. However, the principle of a self-destructive mechanism blocked by upstream regulators and activated by multiple, diverse stimuli does indeed mirror that of apoptosis. Why it should be evolutionarily beneficial to have a self-destruct mechanism for rapid axon loss remains unclear but possible explanations including preventing spread of pathogens around the nervous system by axonal transport and promoting subsequent nerve repair. This seems consistent with the slower degeneration in the mammalian CNS, although there are indications that this mostly reflects slower removal of myelin debris, while axon degeneration itself is only marginally slower.

### NaV1.7 and pain: contribution of peripheral nerves [^e028ffde]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

The sodium channel NaV1.7 contributes to action potential (AP) generation and propagation. Loss-of-function mutations in patients lead to congenital indifference to pain, though it remains unclear where on the way from sensory terminals to central nervous system the signalling is disrupted. We confirm that conditional deletion of NaV1.7 in advillin-expressing sensory neurons leads to impaired heat and mechanical nociception in behavioural tests. With single-fiber recordings from isolated skin, we found (1) a significantly lower prevalence of heat responsiveness to normally mechanosensitive C-fibers, although (2) the rare heat responses seemed quite vigorous, and (3) heat-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide release was normal. In biophysical respects, although electrical excitability, rheobase, and chronaxy were normal, (4) axonal conduction velocity was 20% slower than in congenic wild-type mice (5) and when challenged with double pulses (< 100 milliseconds interval), the second AP showed more pronounced latency increase (6). On prolonged electrical stimulation at 2 Hz, (7) activity-dependent slowing of nerve fiber conduction was markedly less, and (8) was less likely to result in conduction failure of the mutant single fibers. Finally, recording of compound APs from the whole saphenous nerve confirmed slower conduction and less activity-dependent slowing as well as the functional absence of a large subpopulation of C-fibers (9) in conditional NaV1.7 knockouts. In conclusion, the clear deficits in somatic primary afferent functions shown in our study may be complemented by previously reported synaptic dysfunction and opioidergic inhibition, together accounting for the complete insensitivity to pain in the human mutants lacking NaV1.7.

### Axonal loss at time of diagnosis as biomarker for long-term disability in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^47f3d471]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

In the median and fibular (or tibial) motor nerves, the variables included: amplitudes of the CMAPs evoked at distal and proximal stimulus sites; ratio of CMAP at proximal/distal stimulation sites (P/D ratio); distal motor latency (DML); motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCV) between stimulation sites; and the shortest F‐wave latency in 20 responses.

In the median nerve, ortodromic sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) evoked by digital ring electrodes were recorded at the wrist using surface or near‐nerve needle electrodes, and, when recorded by needle electrodes, at the elbow as well. In the fibular nerve, SNAPs were recorded through needle electrodes at the fibular head after stimulation at the superior retinaculum, and, in the sural nerve, SNAPs were recorded through needle electrodes at midcalf after stimulation at the lateral malleolus. When recorded with surface electrodes from the sural nerve, the antidromic SNAP was recorded at the lateral malleolus after stimulation at midcalf. Peak‐to‐peak amplitudes were measured and sensory nerve conduction velocities (SNCVs) were calculated to the first positive phase.

The amplitudes of the logarithmically transformed CMAPs and SNAPs, DMLs, F‐wave latencies, MNCVs, and SNCVs were compared with age‐matched normal values from our laboratory. The P/D ratio as a function of the conduction distance between elbow and wrist was compared with the findings from 18 control nerves.

For each patient, we calculated combined Z scores for axonal loss and demyelination (see Supplementary Material). Due to the more marked motor than sensory deficits in CIDP and the importance of motor conduction properties in the electrodiagnostic criteria of CIDP, we calculated combined Z scores, giving greater weight to motor than sensory recordings (ratio 2:1; Supplementary Material).

Tibial motor nerve amplitude drop and demographic correlates are described, noting that increasing height was found to correlate with decreasing conduction velocity and increasing age was found to correlate with decreases in velocity and amplitude, and the upper limit of normal drop in amplitude from the ankle to the knee was 10.3 mV, or 71%.

Table 1
Medical Research Council sum score

Some other potentially interesting methods to evaluate the neuromuscular function include the use of handheld dynamometry and handgrip strength. Both are reproducible in the ICU. Preliminary data suggest that handgrip strength relates to outcome but these data need further confirmation. Muscle ultrasound allows detection of atrophy as well as architectural changes and fasciculation. Ultrasound findings in the ICU setting, in contrast to other settings, did not, however, correlate with muscle function or outcomes in the few studies that are available. Preliminary data showed that reduced abductor polices strength following ulnar nerve stimulation in critically ill patients but the relationship with global strength or outcome was not studied.

Respiratory muscle strength can be measured in the ICU using the maximal inspiratory pressure recorded following a volitional maneuver starting from the functional residual capacity. This may be difficult, however, in ICU patients who are not cooperative. For such patients, a nonvolitional method using a one-way valve is a good alternative. More sophisticated methods, such as measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure following magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation, is cumbersome and therefore not suited to daily practice.

Electrophysiological testing

Because of the shortcomings of the MRC sum score, the interest in alternative diagnostic tools remains. Full electrophysiological testing, including nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), is cumbersome, not readily available in many ICUs, time consuming, and costly. NCS typically reveal reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); in the case of (coexistent) CIP, sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) may be reduced, and nerve conduction velocity is normal or only slightly reduced. In both CIP and CIM, spontaneous electrical activity may be present on EMG. SNAPs in critically ill patients may also be reduced due to edema. Voluntary muscle contraction, which requires a cooperative patient, or alternatively more complex electrophysiological methods such as direct muscle stimulation can be used to differentiate between CIP and CIM. Simplified electrophysiological screening using the peroneal nerve CMAP, potentially supplemented by the sural nerve amplitude, may be used to identify patients who require more extensive testing. However, correlation between electrophysiological abnormalities and muscle weakness has not been studied in large patient populations; in particular, the importance of electrophysiological abnormalities in the absence of weakness is unclear.

Assessment

For the purposes of this study, peripheral nerve involvement was defined as having an abnormal nerve conduction or skin biopsy result and/or having been prescribed medication for neuropathic symptoms. Cardiac involvement was defined as having an interventricular septum > 1.1 cm, a positive pyrophosphate (PYP) scan, or positive endomyocardial biopsy. GI involvement was defined as daily diarrhea or frequent constipation that represented a consequential change for the patient and required treatment and/or behavioral modifications. Patients were classified by their initial testing leading to diagnosis of ATTRv, including cardiac testing (positive PYP scan or cardiac biopsy) or neurologic testing (abnormal nerve conduction velocity [NCV] or intraepidermal nerve fiber density [IENFD] or genetic testing inspired by neuropathic symptoms). The year of symptom onset for each system involved was defined as the earliest abnormal test result or earliest reported symptoms from chart review. Onset of median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome, CTS) was defined as the year of diagnosis with CTS or 1 year before carpal tunnel release surgery if date of diagnosis was unknown. If disease manifestation for multiple systems began within 1 year of each other, onset was defined as simultaneous. Neuropathic symptom duration was calculated as the number of years from patient-reported PN symptom onset to initial presentation to the neurologist. Rate of neuropathy progression was calculated by dividing the patient's first visit neuropathic impairment score (NIS) by their neuropathic symptom duration value.

Limbs were warmed to 31°C for NCV studies. Sural and radial sensory nerve responses were measured antidromically stimulating at the calf 11 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus and stimulating at the forearm while recording at the lateral malleolus and first metacarpal, respectively. Ulnar and median sensory nerve responses were measured orthodromically stimulating at the finger and recording at the wrist. Peroneal, ulnar, and median motor nerve responses were obtained when recording from the extensor digitorum brevis, abductor polis brevis, and abductor digiti minimi while stimulating at the distal leg and wrist.

Patients were determined to have lumbar stenosis if they were diagnosed by a neurologist or neurosurgeon, and there was supporting imaging. For Romberg assessment, patients were asked to stand straight with feet together and arms at their side. They were then instructed to close their eyes. If they were not able to maintain balance, staggered, and opened their eyes, the test was determined to be positive. Gentle swaying was not characterized as a positive test.

### Guidelines in electrodiagnostic medicine. consensus criteria for the diagnosis of partial conduction block [^39218f94]. Muscle & Nerve: Supplement (1999). Medium credibility.

Consensus criteria for the diagnosis of partial conduction block — key definitions and diagnostic scope are outlined as follows: Conduction block of an intact motor axon prevents transmission from the anterior horn cell to the muscle, and in intact peripheral sensory axons prevents transmission from the sensory receptor to the dorsal root ganglion cell body. Partial conduction block produces motor or sensory deficits if enough axons are affected, but can only be reliably assessed in motor axons; if it persists for more than a week it is diagnostic of focal demyelination, though it may not be relevant to symptom pathophysiology. Temporal dispersion has not been established to produce motor or sensory deficits; pathophysiological temporal dispersion results from an abnormally increased range of conduction velocities among individual axons and, when focal and to a major degree, is diagnostic of focal demyelination, though it may not be relevant to symptom pathophysiology. The consensus aims to develop definitions by which partial conduction block can be diagnosed with a high level of confidence (definite partial or complete conduction block) or inferred with a moderate level of confidence (probable partial conduction block).

### Very early and early neurophysiological abnormalities in Guillain-Barrésyndrome: a 4-year retrospective study [^33a478fc]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of patients admitted to our Neurology Unit with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS from January 2016 to January 2020. Data were collected from patients who had undergone a nerve conduction study within 15 days of symptom onset; patients with chronic radiculopathies, mononeuropathies, or polyneuropathies were excluded. The study sample was divided into two subgroups according to the interval between symptom onset and time of neurophysiological examination: within 7 days (very early group) and within 7–15 days (early group). All electrophysiological examinations were performed in the same laboratory according to a standardized protocol with skin temperature > 32°C. Motor nerve conduction (MNC) of the upper limbs was performed using pregelled surface electrodes in a belly tendon montage, stimulating the median and the ulnar nerve at the wrist and the forearm; the motor response was recorded at the abductor pollicis brevis and the abductor digiti minimi, respectively; similarly, MNC of the lower limbs was performed by stimulating the peroneal and the tibial nerve at the ankle and the knee and recording the motor response at the extensor digitorum brevis and the abductor hallucis muscles, respectively.

Distal motor latency (DML), distal compound motor action potential (CMAP) peak‐to‐peak amplitude, distal CMAP negative peak duration, motor conduction velocity (MCV), and F wave abnormalities (absence or increased minimum latency) were measured. The presence of definite partial CBs was evaluated according to American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine criteria only in the distal segments: across the elbow and in the forearm segment for the upper limbs and across the knee and in the leg segment for the lower limbs. Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were obtained using an antidromic technique: at the upper limbs by stimulating the median and the ulnar nerve at the wrist and recording from the third and fifth finger, respectively; at the lower limbs by stimulating the sural and the superficial peroneal nerves of both sides according to Squintani and coworkers' antidromic technique. Peak‐to‐peak amplitude and sensory conduction velocity (SCV) were measured using pregelled surface electrodes applied to the upper limbs and needle recording at the legs. When the sural nerve SNAP was normal, we searched for the "sural‐sparing" pattern (normal sural nerve amplitude with a concomitant reduction in ulnar nerve SNAP).

### European Academy of Neurology / Peripheral Nerve Society guideline on diagnosis and treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy: report of a joint task force-second revision [^1f87bbac]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, EAN/PNS 2021 guidelines recommend to regard the following motor nerve conduction criteria as strongly supportive of demyelination:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Motor distal latency|- Motor distal latency prolongation ≥ 50% above ULN in 2 nerves (excluding median neuropathy at the wrist from carpal tunnel syndrome)|
|Motor conduction velocity|- Reduction of motor conduction velocity ≥ 30% below LLN in 2 nerves|
|F-wave latency|- Prolongation of F-wave latency ≥ 20% above ULN in 2 nerves (≥ 50% if amplitude of distal negative peak compound muscle action potential < 80% of LLN)|
|Absence of F-waves|- Absence of F-waves in 2 nerves (if these nerves have distal negative peak compound muscle action potential amplitudes ≥ 20% of LLN) plus ≥ 1 other demyelinating parameter in ≥ 1 other nerve|
|Motor conduction block|- ≥ 30% reduction of the proximal relative to distal negative peak compound muscle action potential amplitude, excluding the tibial nerve, and distal negative peak compound muscle action potential amplitude ≥ 20% of LLN in 2 nerves < br > - ≥ 30% reduction of the proximal relative to distal negative peak compound muscle action potential amplitude, excluding the tibial nerve, and distal negative peak compound muscle action potential amplitude ≥ 20% of LLN in o1e nerve plus ≥ 1 other demyelinating parameter except absence of F-waves in ≥ 1 other nerve|
|Abnormal temporal dispersion|- > 30% duration increase between the proximal and distal negative peak compound muscle action potential (at least 100% in the tibial nerve) in ≥ 2 nerves|
|Compound muscle action potential duration|- Distal compound muscle action potential duration prolongation in ≥ 1 nerve plus ≥ 1 other demyelinating parameter in ≥ 1 other nerve.|

### Quantitative MRI assessment using variable echo time imaging of peripheral nerve injury in ATTRv amyloidosis patients [^12463548]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients underwent detailed assessment by two neurologists (E.V. and A.C. with 5 and 10 years of experience, respectively), including demographic records, past medical history, and full neurologic examination. Patients were rated using the Polyneuropathy Disability scoring system (PND‐score), Neurologic Impairment Score (NIS), and NIS for the Lower Limbs (NIS‐LL). PND score was graded as follows: PND = 1 (sensory disturbances with preserved walking capability), PND = 2 (sensory‐motor symptoms with unassisted gait), PND = 3 (sensory‐motor symptoms with assisted gait), and PND = 4 (wheelchair‐bound or bedridden). ATTRv‐PNP patients were defined as symptomatic when PND scored ≥ 1.

Based on the individual NIS‐LL (NIS‐LL Grade), PNP severity was further classified as mild (NIS‐LL 1–20), moderate (NIS‐LL 21–61), or severe (NIS‐LL 62–88). A subset of 14 patients underwent nerve NCS at the same time as MRI, and motor conduction of the tibial and peroneal nerves (i.e. distal motor latency, nerve conduction velocity, NCV, and compound muscle action potential, CMAP) together with sensory conduction of the sural nerve (SNAP) was evaluated in all cases. The patients were classified into two groups based on NCS findings: axonal and axonal with reduced conduction velocity.

2.2 Acquisition

All participants underwent MRI scanning on a Siemens 3 T Skyra scanner using either an 8‐channel surface coil or a 32‐channel spine coil. Our protocol included a 3D monopolar dual echo vTE sequence, previously validated in a cohort of healthy subjects (TE 1 /TE 2 = 1.05/5.37 ms, TR = 19 ms, flip angle = 10°, Field‐of‐view = 290 mm × 236 mm, voxel size = 0.6 × 0.6 × 5.0 mm 3, number of slices = 12, acquisition time = 5 min 40 s). The longitudinal coverage of the sciatic nerve was 6 cm. Binomial excitation was used to suppress the fat signal. The first echo image was acquired with an asymmetric variable echo time, while the second was fully sampled. The two echoes are sensitive to long T2✱ species; however, short T2✱ species are sampled mainly by the first echo and their signal reduces considerably at the time of the second echo.

### Electroneurography index based on nerve conduction study data: method and findings in control subjects [^b9a1aaef]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

We developed a summary score of data obtained from nerve conduction studies (NCS). The principle of such approach is that when a nonrandom trend to lower amplitudes or conduction velocities is present, it may be revealed by a summary nerve conduction score. In a group of normal subjects, peroneal, sural, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves were studied; age- and height-related F-wave and soleus H-reflex latencies were also examined. Z-scores of distal latencies, amplitudes, conduction velocities, F-wave latencies, and H-index were averaged in order to obtain three electroneurography (ENG) indices: a simple arithmetic (ENG index 1) and two weighted means (index 2 and index 3), assigning a double or triple weight to lower limb z-scores. Reference limits were established using multiple regression equations of ENG indices against age and height. This technique could be useful in providing a better cut-off between normal and diseased populations and in improving test-retest variability of NCS when follow-up studies are required.

### Electrochemical skin conductance to detect sudomotor dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy and the risk of foot ulceration among Saudi patients with diabetes mellitus [^b85f853f]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Neurophysiological assessment

Nerve conduction study was performed in 222 participants using Nicolet Viking Quest, VIASYS Healthcare Inc Neurocare Group USA. Right and left sural sensory amplitude and conduction velocity and peroneal and tibial motor amplitudes, latencies and conduction velocities were measured. Results were compared to age specific normal values to determine nerve conduction study abnormality. Participants were then classified as having normal, subclinical (ie nerve conduction abnormality but without symptoms or signs of DPN) or confirmed DPN as described by Tesfaye S et al 2010. Confirmed DPN was present if the participant had at least one symptom or sign of DPN and one or more abnormal nerve conduction test in both sural (sensory) and peroneal or tibial (motor) nerves in accordance with the case definition of DPN described by the American Academy of Neurology.

Sudomotor assessment

Measurement of ESC of both hands and feet was performed using Sudoscan. Participants placed their hands and feet on two sets of large-stainless-steel electrodes which were connected to a computer for recording and data management. Electrochemical skin conductance is the ratio of the current measured over the constant power applied expressed in micro-Simens (μS) for the hands and feet (right and left sides). Through reverse iontophoresis, the device generates voltage to the cathode and a current (intensity of around 0.2 mA) occur between the anode and cathode proportional to sweat chloride concentration. At low voltage (< 10 V) the stratum corneum is electrically insulating and only sweat gland ducts are conductive. Sudomotor dysfunction is absent if measured hands-ESC is ≥ 60μS or feet-ESC ≥ 70μS. Moderate SMD is present if measured hands-ESC is ≥ 40 but < 60 μS or feet-ESC is ≥ 50 but < 70 μS. Severe SMD is present if measured hands-ESC is < 40μS or feet-ESC is < 50μS. These thresholds have been defined based on previous studies. The test lasts less than 3 min and is painless.

### Lower serum extracellular superoxide dismutase levels are associated with polyneuropathy in recent-onset diabetes [^1b9b96ed]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Peripheral nerve function and neurological examination

Peripheral nerve function tests were performed as previously described. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was measured in the median, ulnar and peroneal nerves, while sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was determined in the median, ulnar and sural nerves at a skin temperature of 33–34 °C using surface electrodes (Nicolet VikingQuest, Natus Medical, San Carlos, CA, USA). Quantitative sensory testing was evaluated by vibration perception threshold (VPT) at the second metacarpal bone and medial malleolus using the method of limits (Vibrameter, Somedic, Stockholm, Sweden) and by thermal detection thresholds (TDT) including warm and cold thresholds at the thenar eminence and dorsum of the foot using the method of limits (TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer, Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel). Neurological examination was performed using the Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS) and Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS).

Stages of DSPN were defined according to modified Toronto Consensus criteria. Subclinical DSPN (Stage 1a): NDS ≤ 2 points, NSS ≤ 2 points, and peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) < 2.5th percentile and sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and/or sural sensory nerve amplitude (SNAP) < 2.5th percentile; confirmed asymptomatic DSPN (Stage 1b): NDS⩾3 points and NSS ≤ 2 points and peroneal MNCV < 2.5th percentile and sural SNCV < 2.5th percentile and/or sural SNAP < 2.5th percentile; confirmed symptomatic DSPN (Stage 2): NSS⩾3 points and peroneal MNCV < 2.5th percentile and sural SNCV < 2.5th percentile and/or sural SNAP < 2.5th percentile.

### Which combined nerve conduction study scores are best suited for polyneuropathy in diabetic patients? [^e7b11bb6]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are widely used in diagnosing diabetic polyneuropathy. Combining the Z scores of several measures (Z-compounds) may improve diagnostics by grading abnormality. We aimed to determine which combination of nerves and measures is best suited for studies of diabetic polyneuropathy.

Methods

Sixty-eight patients with type 1 diabetes and 35 controls were included in this study. NCS measurements were taken from commonly investigated nerves in one arm and both legs. Different Z-compounds were calculated and compared with reference material to assess abnormality. A sensitivity proxy, the accuracy index (AI), and Cohen's d were calculated.

Results

Z-compounds with the highest AI consisted of the tibial and peroneal motor, and the sural, superficial peroneal, and tibial medial plantar sensory nerves in one or two legs. All Z-compounds were able to discriminate between diabetic subjects and nondiabetic controls (mean Cohen's d = 1.42 [range, 1.03–1.63]). The association between AI and number of measures was best explained logarithmically (R² = 0.401), with diminishing returns above approximately 14 or 15 measures. F-wave inclusion may increase the AI of the Z compounds. Although often clinically useful among the non-elderly, the additional inclusion of medial plantar NCS into Z-compounds in general did not improve AI.

Discussion

Performing unilateral NCS in several motor and sensory lower extremity nerves is suited for the evaluation of polyneuropathy in diabetic patients. The use of Z-compounds may improve diagnostic accuracy in diabetic polyneuropathy and may be particularly useful for follow-up research studies as single summary measures of NCS abnormality development over time.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — simplified NCS protocol states that "Sural sensory and peroneal motor NCSs are performed in one lower extremity" and "If both studies are normal, there is no evidence of typical distal symmetric polyneuropathy. In such a situation, no further NCSs are necessary". If either is abnormal, "the performance of additional NCSs is recommended", which "should include NCS of at least the ulnar sensory, median sensory, and ulnar motor nerves in one upper extremity", and "A contralateral sural sensory and one tibial motor NCS may also be performed according to the discretion of the examiner", noting "Caution is warranted when interpreting median and ulnar studies since there is a possibility of abnormality due to compression of these nerves at the wrist or ulnar neuropathy at the elbow". Additionally, "If a response is absent for any of the nerves studied (sensory or motor), a NCS of the contralateral nerve should be performed", and "If a peroneal motor response is absent, an ipsilateral tibial motor NCS should be performed".

### Axonal changes in spinal cord injured patients distal to the site of injury [^0d7ae1e2]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

It is generally assumed that the peripheral nervous system remains intact following a spinal injury. Accordingly, the electrical thresholds of motor axons in a peripheral nerve below the lesion should be similar to those in intact subjects. Yet in attempts to enter the common peroneal nerve with microelectrodes in 24 quadriplegic or paraplegic individuals it was often found that electrical stimulation over or within the nerve failed to elicit contractions in the pre-tibial flexors. To investigate whether consistent changes in axonal physiology occurred distal to the site of injury in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), motor nerve excitability was formally tested in 15 of these patients. Threshold tracking techniques were used to measure axonal excitability parameters (stimulus-response curves, strength-duration properties, threshold electrotonus, a current-threshold relationship and the recovery cycle) of motor axons in the median and common peroneal nerves. In these patients motor axons were uniformly of high threshold and consequently, stimulus-response curves were shifted to the right. In some SCI patients, axons were completely inexcitable. Amplitudes of compound motor action potentials were reduced, consistent with axonal loss and strength-duration time constant was significantly reduced in SCI patients (SCI 0.13 ± 0.02 ms, controls 0.43 ± 0.02 ms, mean ± SE, P < 0.0001). Excitability changes were more prominent the more clinically severe the injury, with progressive deterioration over time since the original injury. While compression and traction sustained during the original injury or subsequent hospital rehabilitation may contribute in part to some of these changes, it is difficult to attribute these findings solely to such processes. Changes in axonal structure and ion channel function, but perhaps more critically decentralization and consequent inactivity, are likely to underlie the complex changes observed in axonal excitability in SCI patients.

### Symmetry of nerve conduction studies in different stages of diabetic polyneuropathy [^c56ccd9c]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Nerve conduction studies (NCS) in diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSP) are sensitive, noninvasive, and associated with small coefficients of variation, and correlate well with underlying peripheral nerve morphological change. For these reasons, the current reference standard for DSP involves multivariate instruments that emphasize NCS results. However, the interside symmetry of NCS findings in different stages of DSP are unknown, although requirement for symmetry has been suggested in clinical trials of DSP. We therefore aimed to determine the degree of symmetry of NCS findings in DSP of differing severity stages. A cohort of diabetic patients, including patients without neuropathy and those with mild to severe DSP, was studied. We also studied a series of nondiabetic, healthy subjects. A variation of stratified sampling by means of a clinical neuropathy score ensured that a broad spectrum of neuropathy was studied. A total of 478 subjects was ascertained; patient accrual was discontinued when the smallest clinical group consisted of 50 subjects. Nerve conduction studies were conducted prospectively and in a blinded fashion using surface recordings, averaging for sensory action potentials, control of limb temperature, and standardized techniques. Median and ulnar motor and sensory, peroneal and tibial motor, and sural NCS were performed. Interside symmetry, independent of neuropathy severity, was observed for all investigated nerves, except for the median sensory nerve action potential amplitude, which was lower on the right side. These results confirm that abnormal NCS findings consistent with DSP are reliably symmetrical with the exception of the amplitude of the median sensory nerve action potential. Thus, unilateral evaluation of NCS in DSP is sufficient as a reference standard in clinical trials. We also conclude that great degrees of asymmetry in NCS results are reason to question inclusion of DSP patients in clinical trials.

### Digoxin [^cf088f72]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

All of digoxin's actions are mediated through its effects on Na-K ATPase. This enzyme, the "sodium pump", is responsible for maintaining the intracellular milieu throughout the body by moving sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells. By inhibiting Na-K ATPase, digoxin

causes increased availability of intracellular calcium in the myocardium and conduction system, with consequent increased inotropy, increased automaticity, and reduced conduction velocity
indirectly causes parasympathetic stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, with consequent effects on the sino-atrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes
reduces catecholamine reuptake at nerve terminals, rendering blood vessels more sensitive to endogenous or exogenous catecholamines
increases baroreceptor sensitization, with consequent increased carotid sinus nerve activity and enhanced sympathetic withdrawal for any given increment in mean arterial pressure
increases (at higher concentrations) sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to both cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves
allows (at higher concentrations) progressive efflux of intracellular potassium, with consequent increase in serum potassium levels.

The cardiologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action), a slowing of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), decreased conduction velocity through the AV node, and a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The times to onset of pharmacologic effect and to peak effect of preparations of digoxin are shown in Table 7.

Hemodynamic Effects: Short- and long-term therapy with the drug increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance in patients with heart failure. These hemodynamic effects are accompanied by an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions.

ECG Changes: The use of therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause prolongation of the PR interval and depression of the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. Digoxin may produce false positive ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram during exercise testing. These electrophysiologic effects are not indicative of toxicity. Digoxin does not significantly reduce heart rate during exercise.
