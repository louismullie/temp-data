## Question

What do you monitor for in the weekly blood draws with Clozapine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what should be monitored in the weekly blood draws during clozapine treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory context and whether weekly monitoring is still required. Then, I should verify exactly which laboratory parameter is the target of weekly testing. Next, I will review the rationale for weekly monitoring and the risk timeline. After that, I need to check whether any additional labs are recommended during the weekly phase. Finally, I will consider special populations and how recent regulatory changes affect practice, before synthesizing a concise, clinically actionable answer.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory context, because I need to ensure I'm not over- or under-stating requirements. Historically, the FDA mandated weekly hematologic monitoring for the first 6 months via the REMS program, but in February 2025 the FDA eliminated the REMS requirement, even though the current prescribing information still describes the legacy weekly→biweekly→monthly schedule; the FDA explicitly states prescribers should continue to monitor ANC according to the prescribing information while the labels are updated, so weekly monitoring remains the de facto standard during the first 6 months [^90b1226a] [^66b6b514] [^60ac3c96].

> Wait, let me verify the exact laboratory target of the weekly draws. I initially thought "complete blood count", but hold on, I should verify whether WBC or ANC is the critical value. The FDA labeling and REMS materials specify that absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is the only accepted parameter for neutropenia monitoring in the program, and prescribers should obtain and act on ANC rather than WBC alone, so the weekly test is an ANC from a CBC with differential, with WBC used to calculate ANC rather than as a standalone decision metric [^b9772091].

> I need to check the rationale and timing of risk to ensure the weekly cadence makes sense. The risk of severe neutropenia is greatest in the first 18 weeks and declines thereafter, with most serious events clustering early; this is why the weekly schedule is front-loaded for the first 6 months, after which frequency can be reduced if ANC remains acceptable, aligning with both FDA labeling and large epidemiologic datasets showing early risk concentration and very low late risk [^95d0702d] [^ef378fda].

> Next, I should review whether any additional labs are recommended during the weekly phase. Let me consider cardiometabolic and inflammatory risks that emerge early. Several high-credibility guidelines recommend adding troponin and C-reactive protein at baseline and weekly for at least the first month to detect early myocarditis, and some programs also track clozapine plasma levels during titration to guide dosing and safety; these are not universally mandated but are reasonable adjuncts during the high-risk initiation window, especially when available [^928a692b] [^03156217] [^e3462e1a].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations because thresholds differ. For patients with benign ethnic neutropenia, the FDA provides a separate algorithm with lower baseline ANC requirements and adjusted discontinuation thresholds; this affects both baseline eligibility and how we interpret weekly results, so I need to ensure I'm applying the correct table when counseling and deciding on continuation or interruption [^60ac3c96] [^36ad5831].

> Let me synthesize the answer succinctly. During the weekly blood draws for clozapine, the primary parameter is the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) from a complete blood count with differential. The weekly cadence is required for the first 6 months of treatment, after which frequency can be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months and then monthly if ANC remains at or above 1500/μL, with separate, lower thresholds for patients with benign ethnic neutropenia. Many clinicians also add troponin and CRP weekly for the first month to screen for myocarditis, and some programs include clozapine plasma level monitoring during titration to optimize dosing and safety, though these are adjunctive rather than core hematology requirements [^b0c773e5] [^60ac3c96] [^928a692b] [^03156217] [^e3462e1a].

Weekly clozapine monitoring centers on the **absolute neutrophil count (ANC)** [^b9772091] from a CBC with differential, because clozapine can cause severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/μL) [^95d0702d], which is most common in the first 18 weeks [^ef378fda]. The ANC is the **only accepted parameter** for REMS and must be reported before dispensing [^b0c773e5]. WBC is not used for decisions, but the differential helps calculate ANC and detect other cytopenias [^b9772091]. Baseline ANC must be ≥ 1500/μL (≥ 1000/μL if BEN) [^60ac3c96]; if ANC drops below 1000/μL, interrupt clozapine and follow the REMS algorithm [^2bfefd8d]. Early detection via weekly ANC allows prompt action to prevent infections and agranulocytosis [^66b6b514].

---

## Primary parameter: absolute neutrophil count (ANC)

- **Definition**: ANC is the primary measure of neutrophils, the WBCs most critical for infection defense [^b9772091].
- **Risk**: Clozapine can cause severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/μL), increasing infection risk, including agranulocytosis [^95d0702d].
- **Timing**: Risk is highest in the first 18 weeks and declines thereafter [^ef378fda].
- **REMS**: ANC is the only accepted parameter; results must be reported before dispensing [^b0c773e5].

---

## Secondary parameter: white blood cell (WBC) count

- **Role**: WBC is not used for REMS decisions but helps detect other cytopenias and contextualize ANC [^b9772091].
- **Calculation**: ANC = WBC × (% neutrophils + % bands) [^b9772091].
- **Clinical utility**: Helps identify leukopenia or other hematologic issues beyond neutropenia.

---

## Baseline ANC requirements

Before starting clozapine, obtain a baseline ANC: **≥ 1500/μL** for the general population and **≥ 1000/μL** for patients with benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) [^60ac3c96] [^36ad5831].

---

## ANC thresholds and actions

| **ANC level** | **Action required** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 1500/μL (≥ 1000/μL if BEN) | Continue clozapine; routine monitoring |
| 1000–1499/μL (500–999/μL if BEN) | Interrupt clozapine; increase monitoring frequency |
| < 1000/μL (< 500/μL if BEN) | Discontinue clozapine immediately; do not rechallenge |

---

## Clinical implications of weekly monitoring

Weekly ANC monitoring enables **early detection** of neutropenia, allowing timely interruption or discontinuation to prevent agranulocytosis and serious infections [^66b6b514]. It also supports **continued safety** by ensuring ongoing vigilance during the highest-risk period [^ef378fda].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Patients should be educated to **recognize infection symptoms** (fever, sore throat, fatigue) and seek immediate care if they occur [^db8e850b]. Adherence to weekly monitoring is essential for safe clozapine use and early detection of neutropenia [^66b6b514].

---

Weekly clozapine monitoring focuses on the **ANC** from a CBC with differential, with WBC as a secondary check. This approach aligns with REMS and supports early detection of neutropenia, enabling prompt action to prevent serious complications [^b0c773e5].

### The FDA has ended required blood monitoring for clozapine use-will this impact the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis? [^ce1f690e]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

What ShouldClinicians Do?

Now that the FDA has lifted requirements for ANC monitoring, the prescription and utilization of clozapine have potentially become much more feasible. When considering the use of clozapine in PD, it is important to recognize that PD patients differ from those with schizophrenia in several key respects. PD patients are typically older and more likely to have comorbid dementia, although the implication of these differences remains unclear. Further complicating the extrapolation from findings in schizophrenia to PD is the substantial difference in dosing. Clozapine is generally prescribed at much lower doses in PD (6.25–50 mg daily in clinical trials), compared with the recommended daily range used in schizophrenia (300–900 mg daily), although clinically dosages up to 150 mg daily have been reported. Nonetheless, the risk of agranulocytosis may be dose‐independent, indicating that this adverse effect could occur as commonly at low doses. Finally, in one large study, women were disproportionately affected, and PD is more common in men, but again, the clinical implication of this finding for PD patients is unclear.

Based on research in PD and assuming a pooled incidence rate of 0.1% for agranulocytosis over the medium term (6 months), weekly blood drawing for 1,000 PD patients over this time frame would yield just one positive result out of approximately 26,000 blood tests. Even if the incidence rate was higher, at 1%, only 1 out of every 2600 tests would be positive. Moreover, a significant percentage of patients developing agranulocytosis are not captured by weekly blood monitoring, as the mean time for progression from a normal ANC count to agranulocytosis is approximately 1 week. These figures raise important questions about the cost‐effectiveness and clinical utility of the weekly ANC monitoring previously mandated by the REMS program, given that clozapine is affordable, easily prescribed, and efficacious for PD psychosis, and that untreated psychosis in PD may be associated with numerous adverse outcomes, including mortality.

### FDA modifies monitoring for neutropenia associated with… [^b0c773e5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety Announcement The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is making changes to the requirements for monitoring, prescribing, dispensing, and receiving the schizophrenia medicine clozapine, to address continuing safety concerns and current knowledge about a serious blood condition called severe neutropenia. Severe neutropenia is a dangerously low number of neutrophils, white blood cells that help fight infections. Severe neutropenia can be life-threatening. The monitoring recommendations for neutropenia caused by clozapine treatment have changed. Clozapine can decrease the number of neutrophils in the blood, in some cases causing severe neutropenia. As described in the revised clozapine prescribing information, and in the Clozapine REMS Program, neutropenia will be monitored by the absolute neutrophil count only, rather than in conjunction with the white blood cell count.

Additional Information for Patients and Caregivers
- FDA is making changes to the way patients treated with the schizophrenia medicine clozapine are monitored. These changes are being made to address continuing concerns and current knowledge about severe neutropenia, a serious blood condition associated with clozapine.
- Starting October 12, 2015, clozapine will be available only through the Clozapine REMS Program. Your prescriber and pharmacy must be certified to prescribe and dispense clozapine.
- Important changes to the neutropenia monitoring recommendations and treatment algorithm for clozapine include:

- Absolute neutrophil count is the only test result accepted in the Clozapine REMS Program to monitor for neutropenia:

- If the patient is an outpatient, the ANC must be reported to the Clozapine REMS Program before clozapine is dispensed.
- If the patient is an inpatient, the ANC must be reported within 7 days of the most recent blood sample.
- Patients with benign ethnic neutropenia can now be treated with clozapine.
- **There are two ANC monitoring algorithms**:
- All patients listed in the NNRMF will be automatically transferred to the Clozapine REMS Program and clearly identified.
- Absolute neutrophil count is the only test result accepted in the Clozapine REMS Program to monitor for neutropenia:

- Prescriber Certification in the Clozapine REMS Program.

Recent Development inRegulations for Clozapine Use

Clozapine is currently the only effective antipsychotic (AP) for treatment‐resistant schizophrenia, having been approved for this indication by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. At that time, due to the known risk of developing agranulocytosis (also known as severe neutropenia and typically defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 500/mm³ or μL), routine white blood cell monitoring was mandated for its use. Initially, the Clozaril Patient Management System (CPMS)required indefinite weekly blood draws. However, as evidence emerged showing that the highest risk for neutropenia occurs within the first 3 (84% of agranulocytosis cases) to 6 (96% of cases) months of treatment, the requirements evolved. In 2005, the FDA changed the requirements to weekly ANC monitoring for the first 6 months, biweekly from 6 to 12 months, and monthly thereafter. Starting in 2015, CPMS was subsumed under the Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program.

In February 2025, the FDA lifted the requirement to use the REMS program in conjunction with clozapine prescribing in the United States, aiming to simplify its prescription and increase utilization. Although various groups around the world have proposed alternative, less‐restrictive hematological monitoring over the years, this shift in regulatory requirements introduces uncertainty. Specifically, prescribers are now solely responsible for determining what, if any, hematological monitoring to perform. Further complicating matters, the FDA‐approved package insert for clozapine remains unchanged for the time being, continuing to require the monitoring schedule that the REMS program put in place. Additionally, beyond the United States, global guidelines vary considerably with respect to monitoring frequency, discontinuation thresholds, and criteria for rechallenge, with some countries having no monitoring protocols at all.

### Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia [^57d026ef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotics has limitations: 25 to 33% of patients have illnesses that are treatment-resistant. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer motor adverse effects than typical drugs for people with treatment-resistant illnesses. Clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders, which necessitates mandatory weekly blood monitoring at least during the first months of treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of clozapine compared with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia.

Search Strategy

For the current update of this review (March 2006) we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We have included 42 trials (3950 participants) in this review. Twenty-eight of the included studies are less than 13 weeks in duration, and, overall, trials were at significant risk of bias. We found no significant difference in the effects of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs for broad outcomes such as mortality, ability to work or suitability for discharge at the end of the study. Clinical improvements were seen more frequently in those taking clozapine (n = 1119, 14 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Also, participants given clozapine had fewer relapses than those on typical antipsychotic drugs (n = 1303, RR 0.62 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 21 CI 15 to 49). BPRS scores showed a greater reduction of symptoms in clozapine-treated patients, (n = 1145, 16 RCTs, WMD -4.22 CI -5.4 to -3.1), although the data were heterogeneous (χ² 0.0001, I² 66%). Short-term data from the SANS negative symptom scores favoured clozapine (n = 196, 5 RCTs, WMD -5.92 CI -7.8 to -4.1). We found clozapine to be more acceptable in long-term treatment than conventional antipsychotic drugs (n = 982, 16 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 15 CI 12 to 20). Blood problems occurred more frequently in participants receiving clozapine (3.2%) compared with those given typical antipsychotics (0%) (n = 1031, 13 RCTs, RR 7.09 CI 2.0 to 25.6). Clozapine participants experienced more drowsiness, hypersalivation, or temperature increase, than those given conventional neuroleptics. However, clozapine patients experienced fewer motor adverse effects (n = 1433, 18 RCTs, RR 0.58 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6). The clinical effects of clozapine were more pronounced in participants resistant to typical neuroleptics in terms of clinical improvement (n = 370, 4 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 3 to 6) and symptom reduction. Thirty-four per cent of treatment-resistant participants had a clinical improvement with clozapine treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Clozapine may be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, producing clinically meaningful improvements and postponing relapse, than typical antipsychotic drugs - but data are weak and prone to bias. Participants were more satisfied with clozapine treatment than with typical neuroleptic treatment. The clinical effect of clozapine, however, is, at least in the short term, not reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The short-term benefits of clozapine have to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle-age. The existing trials have largely neglected to assess the views of participants and their families on clozapine. More community-based long-term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of clozapine on global and social functioning as trials in special groups such as people with learning disabilities.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^346ed482]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clozapine for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with suicidality — we suggest clozapine to reduce the risk of suicide attempts for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and either suicidal ideation or a history of suicide attempt(s). This is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low with limitations including a small sample size; the benefits slightly outweighed potential harms such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities, sialorrhea, somnolence, and the rarely occurring but serious adverse events of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Monitoring and infrastructure burdens are emphasized: the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) mandates frequent visits to monitor laboratory results before refills, requires capacities to meet FDA regulatory requirements including laboratory tests to monitor neutrophil levels, training for pharmacies and prescribers, registration of pharmacies, prescribers, and patients, and reporting of episodes of neutropenia. Patients may be unwilling to commit to repeated weekly blood draws over six months, and clozapine is often used as the antipsychotic of last resort due to risks such as agranulocytosis.

### Cost-effectiveness of HLA-DQB1 / HLA-B pharmacogenetic-guided treatment and blood monitoring in US patients taking clozapine [^b8e1bb5e]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is a highly disabling psychiatric disease that affects approximately one-third of psychotic patients over the course of their illness. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is available as a generic drug, has significant therapeutic efficacy, and produces desirable quality-of-life outcomes. These benefits must be weighed against potential hematologic or metabolic adverse effects, and a network meta-analysis found little evidence of superior efficacy of clozapine relative to other second-generation antipsychotics in subgroups of patients with TRS. Clozapine treatment remains restricted to a small proportion of patients with TRS who did not previously improve after treatment with two or more antipsychotics. A primary reason for the limited use of clozapine is the potential risk for severe clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA), a blood dyscrasia affecting polymorphonuclear leukocytes; additionally, the associated long-term blood monitoring burden deters clinicians and patients from clozapine therapy. However, approximately 80% of CIA cases occur within 18 weeks of the introduction of clozapine; after one year of clozapine therapy, the incidence of CIA decreases to 0.07% or less. Nonetheless, clozapine administration remains subject to long-term absolute neutrophil count monitoring (ANCM) and, in certain countries (e.g. the US, the UK, and Australia), to registry-based prescribing systems. ANCM schedules differ significantly across countries, and their utility has been debated. After the first six months of clozapine treatment, the Netherlands Clozapine Collaboration Group permits a reduction in monitoring frequency to four times per year. In the US, where the requirements are stringent, weekly ANCM is maintained during the first six months of treatment (weeks 1–26), followed by ANCM every two weeks (weeks 26–52) and monthly ANCM after one year of treatment. In most European countries, ANCM is performed throughout the first 18 weeks, followed by monthly monitoring. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new shared risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to provide guidance for all medicines containing clozapine.

### Establishing the characteristics of an effective pharmacogenetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^1c1afc63]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

To prevent agranulocytosis by detecting a fall in ANC, patients treated with clozapine are subject to compulsory haematological monitoring. In Europe, the full white blood cell count and ANC are monitored weekly for the first 18 weeks of treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter for the duration of the treatment. If at any time during treatment the white blood cell count falls below 3000 cells mm⁻³ or the ANC below 1500 cells mm⁻³, clozapine should be discontinued immediately and these patients should not be treated with clozapine again except in a controlled setting. Although the obligatory monitoring has the benefit of regular contact with a health-care professional, it is an invasive procedure and can be a burden for the patient. Moreover, some patients decline to take clozapine because of the monitoring requirement.

As agranulocytosis can develop within 2–5 days, even weekly monitoring cannot guarantee timely detection in all cases. The incidence of agranulocytosis induced by clozapine varies between 0.38 and 0.8%, with approximately 80% of cases occurring within the first 18 weeks. The incidence of agranulocytosis decreases from 0.7% in the first year, to 0.07% or lower in the second year of treatment. Few cases occur later in the course of treatment, but the risk does not fully disappear. In 2–4% of patients, agranulocytosis is fatal, which corresponds to an overall mortality rate of about 1–3 in 10 000 patients on clozapine. However, most patients recover completely from agranulocytosis with no haematological consequences.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^502f62ec]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Increased test frequency inherently increases the chance of detecting abnormalities, and we caution against conflating more frequent testing with a higher incidence of clozapine-induced abnormalities, especially given the diminishing risk of neutropenia with prolonged clozapine use. While the number of tests affects the probability of detection abnormalities, it does not necessarily indicate a higher occurrence of abnormalities due to clozapine alone. Clozapine monitoring regimens should therefore be optimized for safety and practicality using protocols that are sensitive enough to detect abnormalities and specific enough to discern their cause.

Additionally, post-hoc testing increase may have also contributed to the observed positive relationship between testing frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities When a patient undergoing monthly monitoring receives a "yellow" test result, the standard response is to increase the frequency of testing to weekly or biweekly until stability is reestablished. These additional tests, while increasing the total number of tests conducted, are a direct response to the initial indication of a potential abnormality rather than preemptive measures.

This mechanism underscores the important distinction that the increase in testing frequency is a consequence of detecting an abnormality, not the cause of its detection. This iterative approach to monitoring, which adapts to risks by increasing testing frequency, acts as a self-correcting mechanism. It ensures that any developing hematological issues are closely tracked and managed, thus reinforcing the safety of extending monitoring intervals under certain conditions.

### A commentary on improving clozapine accessibility and reducing treatment cost [^c7578966]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Clozapine is vastly underutilized in the United States and many other countries. The most commonly cited reason for this is the requirement for frequent blood monitoring, which continues for the duration of treatment. Despite the notoriety clozapine achieved early in its development, accumulated evidence has demonstrated that close blood monitoring beyond the first year of treatment yields minimal safety benefits. Many health care systems have relaxed clozapine blood monitoring requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic for practical reasons, and this presents an opportunity to implement permanent, long overdue changes in mandated monitoring that reflect what has been learned about the real risk for blood dyscrasias with clozapine.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^1288dba8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Extended hematological monitoring intervals did not adversely affect the detection of hematologic abnormalities among patients taking clozapine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unexpected shifts in blood monitoring frequency during the pandemic prompted a reevaluation of existing clozapine monitoring guidelines in Canada, and our findings support the potential adjustment of clozapine monitoring protocols to reduce the frequency of required blood tests. While our results are encouraging, we advocate for continued research in other populations of patients taking clozapine.

### Monitoring white blood cell count in adult patients with schizophrenia who are taking clozapine: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^0ebb2f4e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term monitoring of white blood cell count is compulsory in patients taking clozapine, although the incidence of drug-induced agranulocytosis is lower than previously expected. The cost-effectiveness of this monitoring is unknown. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of various strategies to monitor white blood cell count in adult patients with schizophrenia taking clozapine.

Methods

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of four strategies for monitoring white blood cell count (national strategies used in the UK, USA, and European countries, and a hypothetical 8-week strategy) compared with that of no monitoring. We used a semi-Markov model to do the cost-utility analysis from a health-care perspective with a 3-year time horizon, assuming a probability of 0.7% that a patient would develop agranulocytosis. Clinical and resource parameters were based on data from national registries of patients treated with clozapine, study cohorts, and a pharmacovigilance database; we derived estimates of health-related quality of life and mortality from the scientific literature. We assessed model uncertainty, including time horizon, with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Findings

Compared with no monitoring, all four monitoring strategies increased quality-adjusted survival by less than 1 day per patient; more than 5000 patients would need to be monitored to avoid one death. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were at least US$970000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for all four strategies compared with no monitoring. The ICERs were highest in the strategies with highest frequencies and longest durations of monitoring. The results remained robust in the one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, suggesting that no monitoring had the highest probability of being cost effective.

Interpretation

Existing strategies for monitoring white blood cell count in patients taking clozapine, based on divergent national requirements, do not seem to be cost effective. This finding should be taken into account by public health authorities and policy makers in the revision of guidance for clozapine prescription.

### Frequently asked questions | Clozapine REMS modification… [^90b1226a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Latest Update February 24, 2025
- Beginning today, FDA does not expect prescribers, pharmacies, and patients to participate in the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies program for clozapine or to report results of absolute neutrophil count blood tests before pharmacies dispense clozapine. FDA still recommends that prescribers monitor patients' ANC according to the monitoring frequencies described in the prescribing information. Information about severe neutropenia will remain in the prescribing information for all clozapine medicines, including in the existing Boxed Warnings. FDA has notified the manufacturers that the clozapine REMS must be eliminated. FDA has instructed the clozapine manufacturers to formally submit a modification to eliminate the Clozapine REMS and to update the prescribing information, including removing mandatory reporting of ANC blood tests to the REMS program.

In the coming months, FDA will work with the clozapine manufacturers to update the prescribing information and eliminate the Clozapine REMS. As part of this reevaluation, FDA has funded a study by Brigham and Women's Hospital that includes an analysis of clozapine utilization, adherence to the REMS requirement for monitoring of absolute neutrophil count, and clinical outcomes. In addition, FDA is conducting a study in collaboration with the Veterans Health Administration to better understand the incidence and severity of neutropenia in patients taking clozapine, and the Agency is conducting a study using the Sentinel System to better understand adherence to the monitoring requirements. On July 29, 2021, FDA approved modifications to the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risk of severe neutropenia. The Clozapine REMS is a shared system REMS for all approved clozapine products.

The Clozapine REMS ensures appropriate patient monitoring for and management of clozapine-induced severe neutropenia and provides a centralized system for prescribers and pharmacists in managing patient risk, regardless of which clozapine product is being used. Prior to the approval of the Clozapine REMS Program, individual clozapine manufacturers operated separate patient registries. Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, a blood condition that can lead to severe infections, clozapine is only available through the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^28362983]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To date, clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by positive (eg, hallucinations, delusions), negative (eg, anhedonia, avolition), and cognitive (eg, impairment in executive functioning) symptoms. Over recent decades, second-generation antipsychotics (eg, risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine) have emerged as effective treatments by blocking 5HT2A and D2 receptors. Prescription of second-generation antipsychotics has surged since their approval in Canada in the 1990s, largely due to their lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects. However, a major reported barrier to clozapine's broader use is the stringent blood monitoring protocol due to a 1% estimated risk of severe neutropenia, known as agranulocytosis.

Recent research reporting that the risk of agranulocytosis with clozapine treatment is less than 1% has intensified debate surrounding the necessity of current blood monitoring protocols. In Canada, patients on clozapine must undergo weekly monitoring during the first 26 weeks, biweekly for the next 26 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. This requirement was established 30 years ago when robust data on the long-term risk of agranulocytosis and mortality associated with clozapine were lacking. Since then, many studieshave estimated that the risk of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis falls between 0.3% and 0.8%, which is comparable to rates for other medications that have no monitoring requirements, such as typical antipsychotics (0.1–1.4/1000 patient-years) and Mianserin (0.66/1000 patient-years). Moreover, the estimated mortality rate from clozapine without bloodwork monitoring ranges between 0.02 and 0.38/1000 patient-years, which aligns with mortality rates from sudden death associated with typical antipsychotics (1.0–1.5/1000 patient-years) and Mianserin (0.01/1000 patient-years). Despite these findings, blood monitoring frequency for clozapine varies internationally, and meta-analytic data indicate no significant difference in rates of severe clozapine-induced neutropenia across 5 continents. The stringent hematological requirements may reduce clozapine use, potentially leaving many patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia without effective treatment. Thus, it is crucial to find a balance between the benefits of frequent bloodwork frequency against the risk that these requirements might limit access to effective treatment.

Clozapine‐Associated Agranulocytosis: Historical Risk and Comparative Evidence

The primary rationale behind the stringent blood monitoring protocols is the risk for neutropenia, and subsequently agranulocytosis, associated with clozapine use, with potential for significant morbidity and even mortality. Early data from Europe in the 1970s suggested that up to 2% of patients taking clozapine developed agranulocytosis, contributing to several patient deaths.

Following clozapine's introduction in the United States, a study was conducted to evaluate clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis among 11,555 patients who initiated treatment post‐marketing. The cumulative incidence was 0.8% at 12 months, but with very few incident cases after 6 months. Risk of agranulocytosis was independent of dose, although these data were based on patients treated for primary psychiatric disorders (i.e. schizophrenia) at usual doses. Higher age and female sex appeared to have an increased risk. A more recent, larger review confirmed the risk of agranulocytosis to be approximately 0.7%, with only 25% of those with mild neutropenia progressing to severe neutropenia. About 2% of clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis cases were fatal.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^a3d0dcfa]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders in youth — a clinical standard: A trial of clozapine should be considered for youth with treatment resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders [CS]. Before using clozapine, it is important to review the child's clinical status and treatment history to ensure that the presentation accurately reflects treatment refractory schizophrenia, and for complicated cases or the apparent diagnosis of schizophrenia in a younger child (e.g., < 12 years), a diagnostic second opinion may be warranted. When using clozapine, systematic monitoring of side effects, including following established protocols for blood count monitoring, is required; white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts are obtained at baseline and weekly for the first 6 months to monitor the risk for agranulocytosis, and protocols require a coordinated effort among the pharmacy, laboratory, and physician to ensure that the blood count parameters are being monitored concurrently with prescriptions.

### Risk of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis and mandatory white blood cell monitoring: can the regulations be relaxed? [^7d50072e]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

After the introduction of clozapine eight Finnish patients died after developing agranulocytosis. Clozapine was withdrawn from the market and only reintroduced with strict mandatory white blood cell monitoring as long as treatment lasts and thresholds at which clozapine must be discontinued definitively. The fear of agranulocytosis and the need for intensive blood monitoring is the single most important barrier for prescribers and patients alike and leads to underprescription of the only effective and approved medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We summarize evidence that the risk of agranulocytosis is smaller than perceived at the time of reintroduction, is concentrated in the first 18 weeks of treatment, is not greater than with other antipsychotics thereafter and that frequent blood monitoring has not demonstrably decreased the rate of agranulocytosis. Therefore we propose 1) mandatory monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exclusively during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment, 2) that thereafter the prescriber and the well-informed patient decide together about further monitoring frequency, 3) that clozapine treatment must be stopped if the ANC falls below 1.0 × 10⁹/L. Continuation of clozapine or a rechallenge are possible if prescriber and patient determine that the benefits outweigh the risks. 4) National registries which control the haematologic monitoring are unnecessary and do not help to reduce clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. They should at least be restricted to the first 18 weeks of clozapine use.

### Clozapine [^60ac3c96]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.

Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2)

Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient's ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.

Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3)

Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than "standard" laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^03156217]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

White blood cell (WBC) monitoring has reduced clozapine-treated patient deaths associated with agranulocytosis to a rarity. However, clozapine protocols and package inserts worldwide provide no instructions for preventing myocarditis or pneumonia during clozapine titrations. Prescribers worldwide are largely unaware of that. Meanwhile, as they worry about agranulocytosis, their clozapine-treated patients are at risk of dying from pneumonia or myocarditis. Consequently, an international guideline with 104 authors from 50 countries/regions was recently published to provide personalised clozapine titration schedules for adult inpatients. This forum article reviews pneumonia and myocarditis occurring during clozapine titration, as well as the three most innovative aspects of this new guideline: (1) personalised titration, (2) C reactive protein (CRP) measures, and (3) dose predictions based on blood levels. Clozapine metabolism is influenced by 3 levels of complexity: (1) ancestry groups, (2) sex-smoking subgroups, and (3) presence/absence of poor metabolizer status. These 3 groups of variables should determine the maintenance dose and speed of clozapine titration; they are summarised in a table in the full-text. The international clozapine titration guideline recommends measuring CRP levels simultaneously with WBC, at baseline and weekly at least for the first 4 weeks of titration, the highest risk period for clozapine-induced myocarditis.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^621b8a7e]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

These observations have considerable importance when we consider rules relating to the use of clozpine. The UK haematological monitoring guidelines for patients on clozapine recommend a weekly ANC and WCC for the first 18 weeks, 2-weekly for weeks 19 to 52 and 4-weekly after 1 year of ongoing treatment with stable blood counts. Clozapine treatment is discontinued if the WCC drops < 3×10⁹/L and/or neutrophil count < 1.5×10⁹/L, which is termed a "red" result and treatment must be stopped. For patients with benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) this threshold is lower by 0.5, and treatment is discontinued when WCC drops < 2.5×10⁹/L or ANC < 1×10⁹/L. Following two "red" results the patient is classed as non-re-challengeableand may not receive clozapine again. In the US the threshold for clozapine treatment interruption was reduced to < 1×10⁹/L in 2015. For patients with BEN this threshold was reduced to ANC < 0.5×10⁹/L. The US changes simplify clozapine monitoring and enable more patients to initiate and continue treatment without endangering their health. A lower threshold of 0.5 × 10⁹/L also is the most cost-effective method of blood monitoring with clozapine, in the absence of genetic testing. Alignment of the UK guidelines with the revised US Food and Drug Administration monitoring guidelines would have a similar positive impact on improving the use of clozapine without compromising safety. Notably, nonetheless, although sequential falls in ANC may be reported to prescribers, both US and UK regulations classify clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia somewhat crudely according to predefined threshold counts, rather than the identification of a pathological pattern of decline in neutrophils that clearly indicates clozapine as the cause.

### The FDA has ended required blood monitoring for clozapine use-will this impact the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis? [^627b8bdd]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although clozapine carries well‐documented risks, evidence suggests that the risk for agranulocytosis is very low, with almost all cases occurring within the first 6 months of treatment, and with the risk for mortality higher for cardiac events compared with agranulocytosis. Whether agranulocytosis occurs more commonly in clozapine compared with other commonly prescribed medications, or whether routine hematological monitoring improves detection or outcomes, is still unclear. It is also important to acknowledge that other psychiatric medications used in PD may carry uncommon but significant health risks, yet these are still being routinely prescribed without increased monitoring or documentation. A summary of some of the pros and cons of continuing routine blood monitoring with clozapine use in PD is listed in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Pros and cons of continuing routine blood monitoring with clozapine use in Parkinson's disease (PD)

Clozapine is one of two known efficacious treatments for PD psychosis — with perhaps a more robust and rapid response compared with pimavanserin — and for some patients it may be the only viable option to lessen symptoms and improve function and quality of life. Although the FDA's recent regulatory change introduces a level of uncertainty, it also offers an opportunity to expand access to a treatment that has been underutilized in PD for far too long. Through patient education and staying vigilant for signs and symptoms of agranulocytosis, perhaps in conjunction with reduced or no hematological monitoring, clinicians may now be better positioned to offer clozapine as a first‐ or second‐line treatment option to PD patients.

### Physician experiences with and perspectives on clozapine prescribing [^cc126389]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In 1989, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clozapine (Clozaril; Novartis) for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Preapproval testing demonstrated clozapine's marked efficacy, and subsequent observational studies confirmed its marked effectiveness. Yet clozapine use has been modest in the US. Although an estimated 30% of people with schizophrenia have the treatment-resistant form, by the late 2000s, fewer than 10% of people with schizophrenia were treated with clozapine in 44 states.

A key reason for low clozapine use has been its perceived safety, specifically concern over its risk of agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count < 500/μL of blood [to convert to ×10⁹/L, multiply by 0.001]). Shortly after clozapine launched in Finland in 1979, 18 of 2000 patients (0.9%) taking it developed agranulocytosis, resulting in 8 deaths. To secure FDA approval, clozapine's manufacturer developed the Clozaril Patient Management System, in which patients had to obtain a white blood cell count (WBC) and a blood differential prior to initiation and to undergo weekly blood testing (WBC count monitoring) while receiving treatment and for 4 weeks following treatment.

In September 2015, under the authority granted by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, the FDA approved a new centralized monitoring program for all manufacturers called the clozapine risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which included the need for prescriber certification in addition to a safe use requirement (blood testing). As part of the certification process, prescribers received educational materials about the risk of agranulocytosis and the requirements of the clozapine REMS program, completed a knowledge assessment, and were asked to attest on the prescriber enrollment form that they had reviewed the educational materials and successfully completed the knowledge assessment. In 2021, the REMS was modified and required prescribers to submit monthly patient status forms, pharmacies had to verify the safe use condition via a website or call center, and prescribers and pharmacies had to complete a one-time recertification.

### Cost-effectiveness of HLA-DQB1 / HLA-B pharmacogenetic-guided treatment and blood monitoring in US patients taking clozapine [^18bdbfaf]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Cost optimization through pharmacogenetic-guided treatments will permit the use of more efficient monitoring interventions for the management of patients taking antipsychotics, such as electrocardiographic screening to reduce drug-induced arrhythmias (i.e. Torsades-de-Pointe) and sudden cardiac death. The rate of death from clozapine due to agranulocytosis was 0.1–0.2 per 1000 patient-years, which is much lower than the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients taking antipsychotic medications. Furthermore, relieving the burden of the current ANCM will facilitate the use of clozapine, which has clinical and economic benefits for the treatment of TRS. Stringent systematic requirements for weekly blood samplings can delay the initiation of clozapine and can impede patient recovery and unnecessarily prolong suffering.

According to our results, the pharmacogenetic testing was cost-effective up to a cost of $700 per patient. From a probabilistic approach, and given a WTP of $50 000 per QALY, there is a higher than 99% chance that HLA allele genotyping is cost-effective if HLA test costs remain under $700. This estimate is plausible because pharmacogenetic testing based on genotyping for the two aforementioned allelic variants of HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B (126Q and 158T) is a routine procedure in laboratories that test for HLA histocompatibility. Moreover, precise epitope determination could be established by designing adequate primers that can be used for simple PCR amplification at a very low cost.

The association of HLA alleles with an increased risk of agranulocytosis suggests an immune-mediated mechanism. The combination of genetic factors with clinical predictors of CIA, such as older age, sex, and the concomitant administration of other myelotoxic medications (e.g. propylthiouracil, azathioprine, metamizole) could help narrow the group of patients with HLA alleles of susceptibility for long-term ANCM. Although there is no convincing evidence of the direct toxicity of the parent compound or its stable metabolites (demethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide), myeloid precursors are the affected target cells. Indeed, various HLA specific alleles have been demonstrated to be directly involved in drug toxicities, such as HLA-B✱57:01 with the abacavir-induced hypersensitivity reaction, HLA-B✱15:02 with carbamazepine-induced Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis with high test sensitivity.

### Clozapine [^47e25c24]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy

Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/μL for the general population, and at least 1000/μL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Dosing Information

The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

2.3 Maintenance Treatment

Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode.

2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment

Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient's last ANC:

See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.
Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.
For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is ≥ 1500/μL and for BEN patients until their ANC is ≥ 1000/μL or above their baseline.
Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5°C or 101.3°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### Longitudinal changes in DNA methylation associated with clozapine use in treatment-resistant schizophrenia from two international cohorts [^592ff148]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We report the most extensive study of DNA methylation changes associated with clozapine use, profiling sequential blood samples from two cohorts of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia over the course of 6 months exposure to clozapine. We identify within-participant changes in derived cell proportion estimates and find differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with duration of clozapine use. While many of these DMPs were not individually statistically significant in our limited sample size, by comparing our results with those from a previous large EWAS meta-analysis of schizophrenia, we demonstrate the value these longitudinal clozapine-exposure data have for interpreting previous case-control analyses of psychiatric disorders. Our analyses clarify and build upon the findings reported by Hannon and colleagues that many differences identified in blood EWAS analyses of schizophrenia are likely driven by data from patients prescribed clozapine, and therefore likely attributable to medication effects rather than the diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia per se.

A prominent clinical concern regarding clozapine treatment is the risk of agranulocytosis, whereby white blood cells are dramatically reduced. In light of this, the changes we report in estimated cellular composition are interesting. It might have been expected that we would see changes in the proportion of granulocytes, however clozapine-induced life-threatening agranulocytosis is very rare, and mandatory weekly blood monitoring means that any clinically significant drop in neutrophils would have been identified, and led to clozapine discontinuation and withdrawal from the study. Instead of changes in granulocytes, we report a small but significant acute change in the proportion of estimated B cells in our cohorts, with an average initial decrease and subsequent increase at 14 weeks back to baseline levels by 28 weeks. Interestingly, a separate analysis of the participants in the KCL cohort reported that clozapine exposure was associated with a reduction in participants' immunoglobulin levels at 12 and 24 weeks (and that greater reductions were associated with improved response to clozapine). Hannon and colleagues also reported changes in cellular composition in patients prescribed clozapine, although these associations were with proportions of other cell types, namely increases in the proportion of monocytes and granulocytes and decreases in the proportion of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. These differences may be explained by the limitations of derived cellular proportions, such as changes in the proportion of one cell type being a consequence of the abundance of another cell type changing or that different cell types are estimated with differing degrees of accuracy and thus are associated with variable sensitivity to detect differences. Additionally, differences in study population and duration of clozapine exposure may also contribute the reported inconsistencies.

### The FDA has ended required blood monitoring for clozapine use-will this impact the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis? [^9df76e8f]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although prescribers in the United States are no longer obligated to follow monitoring guidelines, they may put themselves in medicolegal jeopardy by prescribing off‐label if they choose to forgo following them and agranulocytosis with complications occurs. In making decisions regarding ANC monitoring (e.g. whether to monitor, how frequently, and which patients to prioritize), it is essential for patients and clinicians to remain vigilant for signs of agranulocytosis. Symptoms reported with agranulocytosis include malaise, fever, and oral cavity lesions or infections, which can be communicated to patients and their care partners at the time of treatment initiation. Occurrence of any of these symptoms would warrant immediate blood testing. If agranulocytosis is present, clozapine needs to be stopped immediately, necessary supportive measures, or treatment introduced, with recovery in neutrophil counts taking 1–3 weeks.

PD treatment providers already have experience with increased, potentially significant, risk with psychotropic medication use in PD without routine documentation or monitoring. For example, combining monoamine oxidase‐B (MAO‐B) inhibitors with antidepressants — particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — may increase the risk for serotonin syndrome, a potentially life‐threatening condition. Despite this, MAO‐B inhibitors and SSRIs are commonly coprescribed in PD, and anecdotal evidence is that the risk of serotonin syndrome is rarely discussed or documented. Additionally, as noted earlier, the use of APs in PD is off‐label (except for pimavanserin) and has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity risks, as well as potentially prolonged QTc interval. Yet, anecdotally, these issues are rarely discussed or monitored when considering AP treatment in PD.

mitigate this risk and maintain a positive benefit/risk profile. ANC monitoring can help identify neutropenia early to allow for timely intervention. Therefore, prescribers should continue to monitor patients' ANC according to the monitoring frequencies described in the prescribing information. Eliminating the REMS is expected to improve access to clozapine and decrease the burden on the health. Information about severe neutropenia is in the prescribing information for all clozapine medicines, including in a Boxed Warning and a new Medication Guide.

ANC monitoring can help identify neutropenia early to allow for timely. severe neutropenia, the risk appears to be greatest in the first several months of clozapine treatment, but the risk never goes away.

### Physician experiences with and perspectives on clozapine prescribing [^c0a5e634]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Most physicians surveyed also agreed that the blood testing requirement often caused a delay in patients receiving their medication. The ramifications of such interruptions in treatment can be stark. Discontinuation of clozapine among responders is associated with relapse, hospitalization, and persistent psychosis.

Owing to awareness of potential harms in interruptions in treatment from the rollout of the modified clozapine REMS program that was launched on November 15, 2021, the FDA has taken several steps to protect patient and public health. In November 2021, the FDA announced that it would not object to pharmacists dispensing clozapine without REMS authorization or to wholesalers shipping clozapine to pharmacies and other health care settings without confirming enrollment in the REMS. In March 2023, the FDA opened a public docket requesting feedback on factors the agency should consider when reviewing proposed changes to REMS administrators. In September 2023, the FDA announced it would conduct a full reevaluation of the clozapine REMS program.

In considering possible reforms to create the optimal balance of safety and access, a global comparison of policies governing clozapine use would be instructive. In contrast to many other countries, the US permits nonpsychiatrist prescribing and retail dispensing of clozapine. Several countries had a shorter duration of weekly testing and ended monitoring requirements after the first few months. Long-term outcomes of clozapine initiators in these countries should be compared.

Limitations

This study has limitations. As with all surveys, our study was subject to participation, recall, and response biases. Specifically, it is possible that physicians who did not feel strongly about the clozapine REMS program were less likely to participate, that respondents' memory of the certification process was poor, and that respondents felt pressured to respond in certain ways. We sought to reduce this bias by inviting a random sample of physician prescribers, limiting participation to physicians who had prescribed clozapine in 2021 or 2022, and ensuring the confidentiality of responses. Responses were also affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency, during which time the FDA exercised enforcement discretion as to REMS-required testing. Additionally, the views of nonprescribers were not included, which may have overestimated the positive perceptions of the program reported in our survey because some physicians with highly negative perceptions may avoid prescribing the drug altogether.

### Treatment-resistant schizophrenia: definition, predictors, and therapy options [^03513f56]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

T reatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) represents a major clinical challenge. The broad definition of TRS requires nonresponse to at least 2 sequential antipsychotic trials of sufficient dose, duration, and adherence. Several demographic, clinical, and neurologic predictors are associated with TRS. Primary (or early) TRS is present from the beginning of therapy, while patients with secondary (or later-onset) TRS initially respond to antipsychotics but become resistant over time, often after relapses. Guidelines worldwide recognize clozapine as the most effective treatment option for TRS, but clozapine is underused due to various barriers. Importantly, studies indicate that response rates are higher when clozapine is initiated earlier in the treatment course. Side effects are common with clozapine, particularly in the first few weeks, but can mostly be managed without discontinuation; they do require proactive assessment, intervention, and reassurance for patients. Furthermore, plasma leucocyte and granulocyte levels must be monitored weekly during the first 18–26 weeks of treatment, and regularly thereafter, according to country regulations. Therapeutic drug monitoring of clozapine trough plasma levels is helpful to guide dosing, with greatest efficacy at plasma clozapine levels ≥ 350 µg/L, although this level is not universal. Notably, plasma clozapine levels are generally greater at lower doses in nonsmokers, patients with heavy caffeine consumption, in women, in obese people, in those with inflammation (including COVID-19 infection), and in older individuals. Earlier and broader use of clozapine in patients with TRS is an important measure to improve outcomes of patients with this most severe form of the illness.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^58934172]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite meticulous tracking by mandated registries such as the Clozaril Support and Assistance Network (CSAN), patients on clozapine may still miss or delay their bloodwork. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario and other provinces enforced restrictions that ostensibly limited access to blood monitoring and clozapine prescription for many patients. Health Canada subsequently advised physicians to use their best clinical judgment when weighing the benefits and risks of continuing clozapine in the absence of regularly scheduled hematological testing. They also advised that patients should continue to have white blood cell (WBC) counts and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) testing as per their regular schedule for hematologic monitoring when possible. The COVID-19 pandemic therefore provided an unprecedented opportunity to explore the effects of reduced hematological monitoring frequency on hematological adverse events in a Canadian population.

Accordingly, the present chart review study used the CSAN registry to assess the impact of reduced hematologic monitoring frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic on occurrences of hematologic abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia who were taking clozapine. We hypothesized that less frequent blood monitoring during the pandemic (March 17, 2020 to March 16, 2021) would not significantly impact the likelihood of detecting hematological abnormalities compared with the standard, more frequent CSAN blood monitoring schedules.

Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection.
Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.12, 5.14)].
Inform patients and caregivers clozapine is available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows:
Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months.
An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy,
An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy.
Clozapine is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product (www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

### Pharmacogenomics of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^721a270c]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Existing strategies for regular long-term hematological monitoring in patients taking clozapine have been previously criticized for not being cost-effective, especially given that roughly 80% of CIA cases occur within 18 weeks of clozapine initiation, and after one year of clozapine treatment, incidence of CIA decreases to 0.07% or less. One study reported that frequent and long-term monitoring of white blood cell counts increased quality-adjusted survival by less than one day per patient and was more costly compared to no monitoring. The additional physical burden of regular blood monitoring and its related costs further discourages both patients and clinicians from choosing clozapine and may, in part, account for the suboptimal use of clozapine in clinical practice.

To broaden the usage of clozapine and improve outcomes for patients with TRS, researchers have focused on identifying predictive biomarkers for CIA that could be used to identify individuals most at risk. Although the pathophysiology of CIA remains unclear, twin studies have indicated a genetic component contributing to its development. Numerous genetic association studies have been performed to identify genetic factors that increase the susceptibility to CIA. This is because the discovery of reliable genetic markers for CIA could contribute to the development of a predictive pharmacogenomic test to stratify patients based on risk. Patients identified as low risk will be less susceptible to developing CIA and can safely use clozapine with relaxed hematological monitoring, whereas those identified as high risk for developing CIA can undergo close, routine hematological monitoring or be considered for alternate treatments. The development of such a clinical decision-making tool could minimize the risk and incidence of CIA, reduce costs associated with frequent hematological monitoring, and optimize treatment outcomes for TRS patients.

Therefore, the purpose of the current review and meta-analysis is to review existing pharmacogenomic studies for CIA in patients with TRS, conduct meta-analyses on alleles reported to be associated with CIA, and discuss the development of a predictive pharmacogenomic test based on alleles significantly associated with CIA for use within clinical practice.

### Low-frequency monitoring for community clozapine initiations: a comparative study relative to standard frequency assessments [^fcde4e4e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Clozapine is currently the only licensed medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In the UK, the importance of early access to clozapine treatment has been recognised nationally. Benefits of initiating clozapine in the community include reductions in symptom severity, frequency of healthcare use, and medical costs. However, during initiation of clozapine, there are risks of side effects including orthostatic hypotension, sedation, constipation, hypersalivation, symptomatic tachycardia, and fever, as well as more rare but serious adverse effects such as myocarditis and agranulocytosis. Consequently, treatment guidelines recommend frequent monitoring of postural blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate during the initial 4 weeks of clozapine initiation. This monitoring is considered essential to detect and manage potential side effects, and to reduce early discontinuation of treatment.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of patients and staff being exposed to, or transmitting SARS-CoV-2 required face-to-face contact to be minimised where feasible and appropriate. In this context, an international consensus statement recommended reduced frequency of blood monitoring for patients stable on clozapine treatment for over 1 year. However, strategies to reduce face-to-face contact in patients initiating clozapine during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been reported. To maintain access to clozapine treatment whilst minimising face-to-face contact, we developed a low-frequency physical monitoring protocol which reduced in-person contact by approximately 40% during the first 3 weeks of community clozapine initiations (seefor overview). Current guidelines recommend in-person reviews 5 days/week for physical observations during Weeks 1–2, followed by 3 days/week for Week 3. In contrast, our protocol reduced in-person reviews to 3 days/week during Weeks 1–2, and 2 days/week for Week 3. The frequency of physical monitoring did not differ between protocols after Week 3.

### Low awareness of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in a mixed-method survey of 354 patients and carers [^f84905ce]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders are chronic, severe mental health conditions, estimated to affect 0.7–4% of the global population. For approximately one-third of individuals experiencing an acute episode of psychosis, conventional antipsychotic treatments fail to provide adequate symptom reduction, a condition known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Clinical guidelines recommend clozapine in these cases, as it is regarded as more effective than other antipsychotic medications. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) is a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) persistently below 0.5 × 10⁹/L, increasing susceptibility to potentially life-threatening infections. The standard preventative protocols for CIA in most countries include ongoing haematological monitoring and a heightened awareness of any newly emerging physical alterations or symptoms that may suggest an infection, including fever, sore throat, or other flu-like manifestations.

Epidemiological research has consistently shown that CIA occurs predominantly within the first few months of treatment, with recent data estimating an incidence of 0.9% that drops significantly after two years –. This reduced risk is further supported by observational studies suggesting it is safe to reduce blood monitoring to every three months once the initial high-risk period has passed. The analysis of likely cases of CIA indicates a rapid decline in neutrophils over a week, casting doubt on the utility of ongoing mandatory fortnightly or monthly monitoring. Furthermore, recent observational data suggests that 70% of CIA cases transition from a 'normal count' (ANC > 2.0 × 10⁹/L) immediately to agranulocytosis (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) predominantly within the early stages of treatment. While monitoring systems are undoubtedly effective, this body of evidence highlights their limitations and supports calls for a revision of haematological monitoring requirements after the early treatment phase to enhance patient access to clozapine.

If monitoring requirements were to be revised, patient education on identifying and responding to CIA (by seeking medical care when suspected) is plausibly the most essential safeguards against potential complications associated with CIA. Despite current concerns, there have been no attempts to explore patient and family/carers understanding around clozapine's association with agranulocytosis, its identification and action it warrants when suspected. Understanding this may assist care providers and policymakers to provide optimal support and resources for patients and key others in their networks. Therefore, our aim was to explore how informed people with lived experience of clozapine treatment, their family and carers, are about the potential signs and symptoms of CIA and what actions they should take.

### Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios correlate with increased clozapine concentration-to-dose ratios during titration [^088a5b8d]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, the present study showed that the fixed effect of NLR on the C/D ratio significantly decreased over time. This fact may suggest that subclinical inflammation is likely to occur early after the start of clozapine (weeks 1–3), i.e. the NLR and C/D ratio are likely to increase at this time. However, the frequency and onset time of inflammation may be affected by titration speed.

Our results suggest that subclinical inflammation during clozapine titration can increase blood clozapine levels more than expected and underscore the importance of CRP monitoring in detecting subclinical inflammation during clozapine titration. As international guidelines recommend measuring CRP and clozapine blood levels weekly after starting clozapine, clinicians should monitor CRP and clozapine blood levels. CRP levels were markedly higher than the reference range in all samples during fever (Table 1; n = 5). Considering that the median NLR was significantly higher in patients with fever than in those without (Table 2), CRP, NLR, and C/D ratio may be correlated. However, although CRP and NLR are both inflammatory biomarkers, there may be differences in the timing and degree of elevation between CRP and NLR, and further studies are needed regarding their clinical applicability.

The results of this study show that clinicians can estimate inflammation and elevated clozapine blood levels using neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, which are routinely measured in clinical practice during clozapine titration. By monitoring CRP levels and NLR during clozapine titration, clinicians can detect subclinical inflammation early and take measures such as temporarily halting titration, thereby preventing the progression of clozapine-induced life-threatening conditions such as myocarditis, pneumonia, and DRESS syndrome.

In this cohort, the median clozapine dose at week 4 was 75 mg/day, and the median clozapine blood level at week 4 was 116 ng/mL. In a study of 1408 Korean inpatients, the average clozapine dose was ~200 mg/day after 4–8 weeks of initiation, and the average C/D ratio was 1.23 ng/mL per mg/day. International guidelines recommend the slowest titration for non-smoking Asian women, with 175 mg/day for normal metabolizers and 75 mg/day for poor metabolizers at week 4 after starting clozapine. Naturalistic observations may indicate that Asian populations tolerate clozapine at lower doses than European populations.

### Pharmacogenomics of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1d2b556a]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The reasons for underuse and delay in clozapine initiation could be attributed to several factors, including highly variable and difficult to predict clinical outcomes. For example, roughly 40–70% of patients on clozapine experience persistent symptoms and remain treatment-resistant. Further, side effects in patients taking clozapine vary greatly, ranging from none or mild to life-threatening side effects. Particularly of concern is the development of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA), which is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500 cells/mm³. CIA is a severe and potentially fatal neutropenia with an overall prevalence of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.3%, 0.6%) and fatality rate of 0.05% (95% CI: 0.03%, 0.09%). The World Health Organization's (WHO) Pharmacovigilance global database, VigiBase, containing more than 140,000 clinician reports of clozapine adverse drug reactions (ADRs) classified in over 5,000 ADR categories, showed that the "broad agranulocytosis" category is the third major cause of fatal outcomes after "broad pneumonia" and "sudden death and cardiac arrests". Although CIA is a rare hematological condition that represents only 2% of reported fatal outcomes within the VigiBase database, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) along with the majority of global health authorities have mandated that patients taking clozapine receive regular blood draws to monitor neutrophil count. These authorities also require enrollment in the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program in order to reduce the risk of clozapine-induced neutropenia.

### Evaluating the effect of the changes in FDA guidelines for clozapine monitoring [^3277c13b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns exist that clozapine is underutilized in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Although a 2015 change in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitoring recommendations lowered the threshold of the absolute neutrophil count for treatment interruption from 1,500/μL to 1,000/μL and removed white blood cell count thresholds from the monitoring algorithm, the implications of this policy change on clozapine interruptions remain unknown.

Methods

We analyzed outpatient prescribing records for antipsychotic medications in the Veterans Integrated Service Network 7 (VISN 7) database between 1999 and 2012 to assess the potential impact of the recent changes in FDA neutropenia monitoring recommendations on clozapine treatment discontinuation. We evaluated results of complete blood count monitoring to compare percentages of patients who developed or would have developed ≥ 1 hematologic event under the previous and current FDA guidelines in the first year following initiation of clozapine.

Results

From a cohort of 14,620 patients with schizophrenia (ICD-9-295.x), 246 patients received clozapine treatment (1.7%). No agranulocytosis was observed during the study period. Under the former recommendations, 5 patients in the clozapine initiation cohort (n = 160, 3.1%; 95% CI, 0.43–5.83) qualified for treatment interruption during the first year of clozapine treatment, while only 1 patient (0.6%) qualified under the current recommendations. Under the former recommendations, hematologic events occurred at a similar rate for individuals taking and not taking clozapine.

Conclusions

While clozapine remains an underused medication, the new FDA monitoring guidelines are likely to substantially reduce the percentage of patients who meet criteria for clozapine-associated hematologic events requiring treatment interruption. This decrease may reduce the clinical burden of managing patients on clozapine and therefore increase the number of individuals treated with this uniquely effective medication. However, prospective studies of individuals treated under the new guidelines are needed to fully assess safety of the FDA's change.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^685935db]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Hypothesis

In response to Health Canada's March 2020 directive, patients on clozapine for over 12 months were allowed to extend hematological testing intervals from 4 to 8 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that this change would not affect the timely detection of hematological abnormalities in patients with severe mental illness.

Study Design

A chart review was conducted of patients at the Royal Ottawa who were prescribed clozapine from March 2019 to March 2021. We analyzed clinical and hematological data from electronic health records and Clozaril Support and Assistance Network database to compare occurrences of hematological abnormalities [leukopenia (white blood cell count < 3.5×10⁹/L) and agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5×10⁹/L)] from March 17, 2020 to March 16, 2021, between standard and extended monitoring protocols using binomial logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions.

Study Results

Of 621 patients, 196 were on extended blood monitoring, and 425 followed standard blood monitoring. Clozapine dose did not differ between groups (standard: 370 ± 201 mg; extended: 352 ± 172 mg; P = 0.14, d s = 0.10). Clozapine treatment duration up to March 2021 was 12.6 ± 8.3 years, with the extended group (10 ± 7.9 years) having a significantly (P < .01, d s = 0.50) shorter duration than the standard (14 ± 8.2 years). Extended monitoring did not significantly impact likelihood of detecting hematological abnormalities (OR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.58,1.41], P = 0.55) after controlling for age, sex, total bloodwork, and other psychotropics associated with neutrophil counts (ie, valproate, olanzapine). No patient on the extended regimen developed agranulocytosis.

Conclusions

Reducing blood monitoring frequency in patients on clozapine for more than 12 months did not compromise detection of hematological abnormalities.

Antipsychotic adverse effects — metabolic risk stratification and clozapine monitoring are highlighted: Metabolic adverse effects "are common, especially with second-generation, 'atypical' antipsychotics", and "Antipsychotics vary in their metabolic adverse effects, with the highest risk associated with clozapine and olanzapine, an intermediate risk with quetiapine, risperidone, and chlorpromazine, and the lowest risk with haloperidol, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole". Clozapine-specific hematologic toxicity is noted: "Agranulocytosis is a potential adverse effect of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine", and "Patients on clozapine regularly have complete blood cell counts performed, usually weekly or monthly, to monitor for this adverse effect". Additional adverse effects reported include "somnolence, anxiety, agitation, oral hypoesthesia, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and tremor".

### White blood cell monitoring during long-term clozapine treatment [^70200759]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Late-onset agranulocytosis is rare during treatment with clozapine, especially in monotherapy. The authors describe a case of agranulocytosis that emerged after 19 years of continuous clozapine monotherapy. The discovery of the agranulocytosis was due to the lifelong white blood cell counts that are now required for clozapine treatment. Despite the fact that this requirement probably saved the life of this patient, this monitoring is not evidence-based because the incidence of agranulocytosis does not exceed that of conventional antipsychotic drugs, for which no such requirement exists. For mentally competent and adequately informed patients, the Netherlands Clozapine Collaboration Group now permits quarterly monitoring after the first 6 months of clozapine treatment.

### Sudden late onset of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^22c8cb19]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a patient who suddenly developed agranulocytosis after long-term clozapine therapy.

Case Summary

A 41-year-old white man suddenly developed agranulocytosis after 89 months of nearly continuous clozapine therapy. During this time, which included the addition of risperidone to the treatment regimen, his white blood cell (WBC) and granulocyte counts remained stable. One week after having stable hematologic counts, the patient suddenly developed agranulocytosis. WBC and granulocyte counts returned to baseline shortly after discontinuation of all medications and administration of sargramostim.

Discussion

The main factor limiting the use of clozapine as a first-line agent in mentally ill patients is the risk of agranulocytosis. Although the greatest risk of developing this adverse reaction is during the initial 6-month exposure, clozapine-induced agranulocytosis continues to pose a risk after years of exposure. Current product labeling requires weekly WBC and granulocyte monitoring for the first 6 months of treatment with clozapine, which may be decreased to biweekly monitoring after 6 months. Based on the sudden and late onset of agranulocytosis in our patient, clinicians may consider opting for weekly monitoring of hematologic function for patients on long-term clozapine therapy. The likelihood that clozapine was the cause of the agranulocytosis was rated possible according to the Naranjo probability scale.

Conclusions

Clinicians must remain vigilant to trends in WBC and granulocyte counts and may wish to consider weekly hematologic monitoring regardless of duration of clozapine therapy. Patient and treatment system compliance with the registries' protocol regarding WBC monitoring is instrumental in reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with clozapine use.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^a0cc351b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Records of hematological variables were extracted from the HLS database from March 2019 to March 2021. This included a cumulative history of hematological tests and their outcomes. In the CSAN registry, hematological results that alerted as "yellow" were defined as WBC < 3.5×10⁹/L and ≥ 2.0×10⁹/L and ANC < 2.0×10⁹/L and ≥ 1.5×10⁹/L, whereas "red" were defined as WBC < 2.0×10⁹/L and ANC < 1.5×10⁹/L, and agranulocytosis was defined as < 0.5×10⁹/L. Mild to moderate Leukopenia was defined as WBC between 2000 and ≤ 3.5×10⁹/L, severe leukopenia was defined as WBC between 1000 and < 2000, and neutropenia was defined as an ANC between 0.5×10⁹/L and ≤ 1.5×10⁹/L. Hematological abnormalities encompassed any blood result categorized as "yellow", "red", agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or neutropenia. Clinical decision-making determined whether a patient was on a normal or extended blood monitoring schedules. Although data were collected from pre-pandemic (March 17, 2019 to March 16, 2020), only data during the pandemic (March 17, 2020 to March 16, 2021) was used to compare standard and extended blood monitoring schedules. Patients across both blood monitoring groups were on clozapine for over 12 months. The standard blood monitoring group included patients who underwent monthly testing. The extended group included patients who underwent testing every 1–3 months, aligning with the Health Canada directive, which allowed for a maximum interval of 12 weeks.

Demographic and clinical variables for the 621 patients were collected by 1 author (T.H.) via a review of the EHR for each patient. Extracted clinical variables included psychiatric diagnoses, hospitalization days, medical comorbidities, smoking status, clozapine doses, relevant side effects, and psychotropic medications excluding clozapine. The data collection process did not involve any direct patient contact. This study received approval from the research ethics board of the Institute of Mental Health Research (#2020010).

### Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios correlate with increased clozapine concentration-to-dose ratios during titration [^65bb84d1]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study participants

The present study is a reanalysis of data from our previous publication, in which clozapine levels were measured weekly for 6 weeks after starting treatment. This study is a secondary analysis of this dataset. Briefly, we retrospectively investigated the medical records of all patients at Nozoe Hills Hospital who met the following criteria: 1) patients with schizophrenia who were first treated with clozapine between April 2020 and July 2024 and 2) patients for whom clozapine blood levels were measured for at least two consecutive weeks after the start of clozapine treatment. Schizophrenia was diagnosed based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision. Because this retrospective study used anonymized data, an opt-out form was displayed on the hospital's bulletin board before data collection. Individuals who did not express their intent for exclusion were included in the study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nozoe Hills Hospital (Approval ID: 2024–6).

Measurement of clozapine blood levels

All blood concentration measurements were performed in an inpatient setting and the vital signs and medication adherence of the patients were monitored by a nurse. Smoking was prohibited at the hospital. The details of concomitant medications at the start of clozapine treatment have been described previously, and there was no concomitant use of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors. Blood clozapine levels within 6 weeks of starting clozapine treatment were included in this study. Clozapine levels were measured simultaneously with weekly blood tests for white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as required in Japan, after starting clozapine. In most patients, blood was collected ~12 h after the last clozapine dose. Blood clozapine levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at the Department of Clinical Pharmacotherapy, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan, as previously reported. Blood clozapine levels measured while the temperature of the patient exceeded 38 °C until it dropped below 37 °C were classified as measurements taken during fever.

Assessment of C/D ratio and NLR

The average clozapine dose up to 5 days before the blood clozapine level measurements was used to calculate the C/D ratios for each patient. This is because the clozapine dose changed during titration, and steady-state blood concentration measurements were not available. Generally, ~95% of the steady-state concentration is achieved in five half-lives, and 99% is achieved in seven half-lives. Assuming a half-life of 24 h for repeated doses of clozapine, a steady state can be achieved in five days.

The NLR or neutrophil counts/lymphocyte counts were calculated simultaneously with the blood clozapine concentration measurement.

### Cost-effectiveness of HLA-DQB1 / HLA-B pharmacogenetic-guided treatment and blood monitoring in US patients taking clozapine [^b4757de6]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Less than 1% of adult patients with schizophrenia taking clozapine develop agranulocytosis, and most of these cases occur within the first weeks of treatment. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region has been associated with genetic susceptibility to clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (single amino acid changes in HLA-DQB1 (126Q) and HLA-B (158T)). The current study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from a healthcare provider's perspective, of an HLA genotype-guided approach in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who were taking clozapine and to compare the results with the current absolute neutrophil count monitoring (ANCM) schemes used in the USA. A semi-Markovian model was developed to simulate the progress of a cohort of adult men and women who received clozapine as a third-line antipsychotic medication. We compared current practices using two genotype-guided strategies: (1) HLA genotyping followed by clozapine, with ANCM only for patients who tested positive for one or both alleles (genotype-guided blood sampling); (2) HLA genotyping followed by clozapine for low-risk patients and alternative antipsychotics for patients who tested positive (clozapine substitution scheme). Up to a decision threshold of $3.9 million per quality-adjusted life-year (90-fold the US gross domestic product per capita), the base-case results indicate that compared with current ANCM, genotype-guided blood sampling prior to clozapine initiation appeared cost-effective for targeted blood monitoring only in patients with HLA susceptibility alleles. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that at a cost of genotype testing of up to USD700, HLA genotype-guided blood monitoring remained a cost-effective strategy compared with either current ANCM or clozapine substitution.

### The FDA has ended required blood monitoring for clozapine use-will this impact the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis? [^6a8deb33]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychosis and Clozapine Use in

Psychosis occurs in 50%–60% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients over the long term. Despite this, only about half of the patients with PD psychosis are treated with APs. This may be due to a combination of factors, including concerns about worsening parkinsonism and other problematic adverse events (e.g. sedation and orthostatic hypotension) associated with many atypical and typical APs. Additionally, AP use in PD may carry increased risks of mortalityand morbidity, similar to what has been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease.

Although popular press has only mentioned schizophrenia when discussing the recent FDA decision, clozapine has a long history of study and use in PD. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency for PD psychosis in France and Italy in 2002, subsequently in England, but remains unapproved in the United States. Currently, the only APs that have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of PD psychosis in placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, randomized controlled trials are clozapine, and pimavanserin, although the latter is only available in the United States. Nevertheless, both of these drugs continue to be underutilized (clozapine represents only < 2% of all AP prescriptions in PD). Conversely, the most commonly prescribed AP by far is quetiapine, despite a lack of evidence for efficacy and concerns about tolerability in PD.

It is likely that the underutilization of clozapine in PD also stems from the associated risks and requirements for hematological monitoring included in the FDA‐issued "black box" warning. However, a recent review of published studies on clozapine use in PD reported that the risk of severe neutropenia and agranulocytosis over a medium term (i.e. up to 6 months) was 0.1%, and 0.2% over a longer term, suggesting that although the risk is present, it may be less common than currently perceived and even less common than in non‐PD populations, although publication bias may have led to an underestimate of true risk. The risk of cardiac arrest or sudden death with clozapine use actually appears higher than the risk for agranulocytosis, but routine cardiac screening or electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring with clozapine use is not routinely done.

### Non-prescribing of clozapine for outpatients with schizophrenia in real-world settings: the clinicians' perspectives [^81c7bedc]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Real-world clozapine eligibility criteria seem to differ from guideline criteria, which, in practice, reduces the number of clozapine-eligible patients as well as the timeliness of clozapine commencements. Adherence to treatment guidelines with a timely trial of clozapine should be strived for, especially in the early stages of psychosis treatment, to avoid treatment stagnation on suboptimal response levels by premature APP prescribing and delayed clozapine prescribing.

Blood sampling was not the main psychiatrist-perceived barrier to clozapine prescribing and the implementation of POC devices for hematological monitoring was not perceived to be an important enabler of clozapine prescribing in most cases. Thus, initiatives aiming at facilitating blood sampling may have less of an impact on clozapine prescribing than previously assumed, if not concurrently combined with other initiatives.

Knowledge deficiencies regarding clozapine treatment were observed amongst both prescribers and non-prescribers, as were organizational constraints affecting the perceived safety of clozapine prescribing for outpatients. To address both of these issues, organizations should ensure that their clinicians (care providers as well as prescribers) are adequately trained in providing clozapine treatment so that clozapine eligibility is recognized in a timely manner and treatment offered promptly. Previous evidencehas shown that targeted training has the potential to increase clozapine prescription rates substantially in outpatient settings. Organizations should furthermore structure treatment facilities in terms of equipment and distribution of tasks to ensure that patients in need of clozapine treatment can receive it in practice. A way to promote this could be by implementing e.g. POC devices for both hematological and cardiac monitoring and distributing some of the responsibilities with clozapine-monitoring (e.g. blood sampling, ECG recordings, screening for side effects), to the care providers. Such interventions could make the prescribers more prone to give clozapine a chance.

### Absolute neutrophil count and adverse drug reaction monitoring during clozapine treatment: consensus guidelines from a global Delphi panel [^76dede37]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Despite its superior effectiveness for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine has a high burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which require monitoring and treatment. This global Delphi study has established consensus guidelines for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) thresholds for consideration of clozapine cessation and provided monitoring protocols for ADR management. Recommendations include lowering ANC cessation thresholds to 1.0×10 9 cells per L (0.5×10 9 cells per L for Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines-null individuals) and discontinuing routine ANC monitoring after 2 years. Comprehensive ADR monitoring every 3 months should address the metabolic syndrome, constipation, gastro-oesophageal reflux, sialorrhea, nocturnal enuresis, tachycardia, sleep apnoea, sedation, and other ADRs. Consumer representatives underscored the need for shared decision-making, streamlined monitoring, and accessible patient education. Although barriers persist, these findings support updating global policies to reduce burden on patients, enhance adherence, and optimise clinical outcomes. Incorporating evidence-based guidelines into practice could transform clozapine care, balancing safety with practicality to improve the lives of those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

### Cost-effectiveness of HLA-DQB1 / HLA-B pharmacogenetic-guided treatment and blood monitoring in US patients taking clozapine [^94884110]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of US ANCM requirements using two alternative strategies based on pharmacogenetic testing of two single HLA alleles. We considered the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B alleles in schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine to prevent agranulocytosis either by restricting ANCM to patients with the alleles of susceptibility (GGS) or by foregoing ANCM in all patients and selecting an alternative antipsychotic drug instead for patients with HLA alleles of susceptibility (CSS strategy). The results indicated the GGS was cost-effective to a WTP threshold of $3.9 million per QALY, although the results were sensitive to changes in the costs of genetic testing, CIA prevalence, and infection-related death rates.

Although translation processes and clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics, including proof of cost-effectiveness, have been emphasized, these results expand current knowledge for the Choosing Wisely campaign and may encourage physicians to improve the efficiency of health care when applying empirical procedures. In 2015, the FDA made changes to the requirements for monitoring, prescribing, and dispensing clozapine in line with the recent REMS guidance (and replacing the six existing clozapine registries). Other important changes include prescribing clozapine for patients with benign neutropenia, as well as using specific ANCM algorithms for these patients and those who previously benefited from clozapine but developed severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis.

### Blood levels to optimize antipsychotic treatment in clinical practice: a joint consensus statement of the American society of clinical psychopharmacology and the therapeutic drug monitoring task force of the arbeitsgemeinschaft für neuropsychopharmakologie und pharmakopsychiatrie [^e3462e1a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The quantification of antipsychotic levels in blood, also known as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is a potentially useful tool of modern personalized therapy that can be applied to augment antipsychotic use and dosing decisions. The application of TDM for antipsychotics can be helpful in numerous challenging clinical scenarios, such as lack of therapeutic response, relapse, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to antipsychotic treatment. The benefits of TDM may be particularly evident in the treatment of highly vulnerable patient subgroups, such as children, adolescents, pregnant women, and the elderly. The main aim of this article is to aid clinicians who routinely prescribe antipsychotics to successfully apply TDM in routine clinical practice in order to help optimize the efficacy and safety of those antipsychotics.

Participants

Participants were clinicians and researchers, members of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology, and the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Task Force of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (Association of Neuropsychopharmacology and Pharmacopsychiatry).

Evidence

TDM literature on antipsychotics was critically reviewed to provide a condensed clinical decision-making algorithm with therapeutic reference ranges for blood antipsychotic levels, within which patients are most likely to respond and tolerate treatment, although TDM is not equally recommended/supported for all antipsychotics.

Consensus Process

A preliminary draft was prepared and circulated to the writing group members. Consensus was achieved in all cases, and resulting recommendations focused on following areas: steady-state and sampling time, levels of recommendations, indications, therapeutic reference ranges and laboratory alert levels, practical issues, and interpretation, as well as limitations.

Conclusions

The utilization of TDM as a tool for problem solving in antipsychotic treatment offers a unique method to improve safety and efficacy. This consensus statement summarizes essential information on the routine use of TDM for antipsychotics and encourages clinicians to perform TDM with the appropriate indications as part of the clinical decision-making process.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^28e42178]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results and other cases reported in the literature indicate that clozapine-associated LTA is an all-or-nothing event — a rapidly emerging absence or near absence of circulating neutrophils caused by their almost total chemical or immunological destruction or by the disabling of all neutrophil production by some means (the biological half-life of neutrophils in the blood is 7–9 h). LTA associated with clozapine has a distinct pattern, which involves a precipitous and continuous fall in neutrophil counts to zero or near zero and their slow recovery after several days, with or without GCSF. The speed at which LTA develops is such that monitoring at intervals longer than 1 or 2 weeks is unlikely to help identify cases. Indeed, evidence is now emerging that longer-than-normal monitoring intervals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic may not have led to adverse consequences. We further contend that single episodes of reductions in neutrophil counts — even at or those below 0.5×10⁹/L officially registering as agranulocytosis — are highly unlikely to be clozapine-related or life-threatening. Likewise, it does not seem likely that clozapine causes benign, non-progressive neutropenia. These episodes can be seen as being an artefact of the intensive blood monitoring programme, which exposes naturally occurring low neutrophils counts which are likely to be seen in any population.

We conclude that clozapine-related blood toxicity should be identified on the basis of the temporal pattern of change of neutrophil counts, not by the attainment of an arbitrary threshold neutrophil count. The value of blood monitoring at intervals of four weeks should be reconsidered because of the low probability of detecting true clozapine-related agranulocytosis (which develops over a period of 2 weeks or less).

Clozapine management — patient education/consent, Clozapine REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) registration, indications confirmation, hematologic and myocarditis monitoring, and adverse effect prevention are specified as follows: Provide the patient (and, where appropriate, the family) education about the benefits and risks of clozapine and ensure their understanding and consent; ensure that the prescriber and the pharmacy are registered with Clozapine REMS and register the patient with Clozapine REMS; confirm indications for clozapine: treatment-resistant schizophrenia; schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with suicidality; or, possibly, schizophrenia with persistent aggressive behavior; consider whether the patient might have BEN (benign ethnic neutropenia) as defined by Clozapine REMS; obtain and provide Clozapine REMS with a within-range absolute neutrophil count before prescribing and dispensing and monitor absolute neutrophil counts weekly for six months, then once every two weeks for six months, then monthly, thereafter, reporting results to Clozapine REMS; follow Clozapine REMS protocols for below-threshold absolute neutrophil counts indicating neutropenia or agranulocytosis; prescribe clozapine starting at low doses with gradual titration to therapeutic doses and blood levels; obtain troponin and c-reactive protein levels at baseline and monitor them weekly for at least the first month of treatment to support the early identification of myocarditis as an adverse effect; and consider prescribing bowel regimens to prevent clozapine-related gastrointestinal hypomotility and ileus, especially when the patient is also receiving other anticholinergic medications.

### Mediation and longitudinal analysis to interpret the association between clozapine pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, and absolute neutrophil count [^4556494e]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Regular blood monitoring is a requirement of clozapine prescription both in the UK and in many other countries to reduce the risks of progression from low neutrophil count to formal agranulocytosis. Nevertheless, despite the superiority of clozapine for managing treatment-resistant schizophrenia in comparison to standard first-line antipsychotics, concerns about ADR risk and monitoring requirements are primary contributors to this drug being underutilised worldwide. For this reason, identifying factors that are predictive of low neutrophil counts in an otherwise healthy sample of clozapine users could help clinicians to improve clozapine use while supporting patient safety and wellbeing. For example, if clozapine users susceptible to increased risk for infections could be identified, potential harm might be mitigated by prioritising them for seasonal vaccinations or making changes to their blood monitoring regime.

While the extremely low ANCs indicating agranulocytosis and neutropenia are considered independent from both clozapine dose and concentration, it is not yet clear whether immune cell populations experience any gradual alterations in the presence of clozapine or its metabolites. Past research – explored associations between ANC and daily clozapine dose as well as plasma concentrations of clozapine and norclozapine. Generally, higher plasma clozapine concentration has been found to be associated with lower ANC, whereas higher plasma norclozapine concentration has been reported to be associated with higher neutrophil counts. However, as highlighted in a recent review, there is inconsistency in the literature regarding both the direction and magnitude of effects observed. While this could be in part due to differences in statistical methodology and the use of small samples, it could equally reflect the idiosyncrasy of the ADR leading to ANC decline, alongside the challenges of disentangling the impact of clozapine and its related variables from genetic, demographic, or lifestyle factors that may also influence neutrophil counts.

The present research aims to replicate and extend these previous studies by exploring predictors of ANC in a large, UK-based sample of clozapine users with TRS in whom longitudinal measures were available for both pharmacokinetic variables and full blood counts. Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) were used to explore associations between pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic variables and ANC, while accounting for between- and within-individual variability. Following this, a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) framework was used to further disentangle the contributions of clozapine dose, from plasma clozapine and plasma norclozapine levels. Genetic predictors relating to clozapine and norclozapine metabolism, as well as baseline variation in ANC were also investigated to determine whether they influenced neutrophil counts in our sample.

### Metabolic monitoring among patients with psychotic disorders taking antipsychotics: results of a quality improvement project to address this challenging guideline-practice gap [^274f6faf]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

The sample was representative of an outpatient programme for adults with chronic psychotic disorders, with a mean age of 45.5 years in 2020, 68.7% male, and more than 90% were in STEP for 2 years or more. In year one, 42.2% of individuals were on two or more antipsychotics, and a large number were on clozapine or long-acting injectables (LAIs). Overall metabolic monitoring was low prior to the MMF, with fewer than 5% of patients meeting guideline-recommended care in 2020 (table 1). Unfortunately, the MMF resulted in no appreciable change in monitoring, with the exception of a modest increase among individuals on LAIs.

Table 1
Antipsychotic use and metabolic monitoring pre- and post-MMF (N = 64)

We consider these findings to be illustrative of the challenges identified in the scholarly discourse on this problem. This organisational tool was implemented without significant consideration of contextual factors that could impede or be leveraged to affect the likelihood of success. Despite direction for change at the programme level, 13% of selected charts did not even contain the tool. Additionally, factors such as psychiatrist workload, time constraints and prioritisation of other patient needs may have deterred screening efforts. Patient-level factors like the severity of mental illness and lack of support may have also prohibited follow-through for bloodwork. It may also be difficult to comply with certain requirements, such as fasting for bloodwork, as patients with severe mental illness may not be able to abstain from eating for the required hours. Clozapine monitoring was likely prioritised because it is mandated by haematological monitoring guidelines by the Gen-Clozapine Access Network. Contextually, the absence of a primary care provider within STEP or an on-site laboratory to facilitate monitoring in conjunction with clinic appointments may be a significant limitation. Given that the study occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, when virtual care was prevalent, a lack of in-person attendance in the clinic may have also been a factor. Furthermore, monitoring is an annual occurrence in this setting. We examined by year and did not assess improvement over time, which may have yielded notable trends.

### Non-prescribing of clozapine for outpatients with schizophrenia in real-world settings: the clinicians' perspectives [^68309b31]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

4.a. Blood sampling as a barrier and/or facilitator of clozapine prescribing

When exploring the psychiatrists' perspectives on blood sampling in relation to clozapine prescribing, one overarching theme was identified: Blood sampling as the occasional main barrier and facilitator (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Thematic map on "Blood sampling as a barrier to clozapine prescribing".

The map shows the psychiatrists' perspectives on blood sampling as a barrier to clozapine prescribing. The figure shows one overarching theme, "Blood sampling as an occasional barrier" and two subthemes.

Several psychiatrists spontaneously recalled patients whom they considered eligible for clozapine therapy, but to whom they could not prescribe it due to the patients' unwillingness or inability to have blood drawn regularly. However, the majority of psychiatrists confirmed the survey results suggesting that blood sampling is not the usual main barrier:

"There are some patients, where I have refrained from clozapine because… I know that this person will never have a blood test taken. Like never. They just won't. But, it's very few (patients)" (TRP09).

When blood sampling was mentioned as a barrier, the concern was solely related to compliance with the guideline-defined frequency of sampling. Adverse hematological effects, on the other hand, seemed to be a minor concern to the psychiatrists:

"No, it's not really a concern (adverse hematological effects)… I don't think I've ever seen a clozapine-induced neutropenia. But I've seen it with other antipsychotics" (TRP10).

Which barrier each psychiatrist perceived to be the most common one preventing them from clozapine prescribing differed substantially. Some psychiatrists stated that it was the risk of cardiac toxicity combined with the expected non-compliance with ECG monitoring and difficulties in obtaining home ECG recordings. Others stated that it was the expected non-compliance with clozapine itself and/or the subsequent re-titration regimen, the patient's cognitive deficit and lack of understanding of the clozapine treatment in general, the burden of adverse effects (weight gain in particular) and/or burden of frequent blood samplings, stability in the patient's illness or the prescribers' sparse experience with clozapine treatment.

### Risk of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis and mandatory white blood cell monitoring [^f8722a82]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide information for physicians and patients on which to base a decision as to whether to stop mandatory blood testing.

Data Sources

Articles on drug-induced blood dyscrasias were identified by searches of MEDLINE (1966-September 2005) and review of their bibliographies. Novartis was asked to provide additional data on clozapine, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and suicidality.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Data on the chance of clozapine-induced leukopenia and agranulocytosis were combined with data about possible fatality and compared with the risks associated with other medications and with life in general.

Data Synthesis

The chance of clozapine-induced leukopenia or agranulocytosis decreases exponentially over time. In the US, the chance in the second 6 months of treatment is 0.70/1000 patient-years and, after the first year, 0.39/1000 patient-years. The case fatality rate of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis is estimated as 4.2–16%, depending on whether a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is used. Nevertheless, treatment with clozapine reduces overall mortality, probably because it reduces suicidality.

Conclusions

After at least 6 months' treatment with clozapine, the mortality involved in stopping white blood cell monitoring is about the same as the mortality associated with other medications, such as mianserin or phenylbutazone, and with life in general (traffic or occupational accident). If the patient has been well informed and wishes to stop the monitoring, it is a medically justifiable option to do so and is preferable to stopping treatment with clozapine since this drug reduces overall mortality.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^796e6f8d]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia — augmentation of clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) is addressed as follows: "The evidence suggests augmenting clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic medication", and it is "categorized as Reviewed, New-added". The Work Group's "confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low", and "for clozapine-resistant, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, the benefits of augmenting treatment with clozapine by adding a second-generation antipsychotic slightly outweighed the potential harms of adverse events or worsened symptoms". Cautions include that "discontinuation and consideration of other avenues of treatment, such as a different antipsychotic medication or procedural treatments (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]), might be prudent", and that "caution and careful consideration of patient goals and side effect profiles should be considered". Burden and acceptability are noted: "The use of clozapine alone can be burdensome because of the Clozapine REMS requirement of blood draws for monitoring the risk arising from the presence of dangerous neutropenia and cardiomyopathy", and "for some individuals, adding an SGA to augment clozapine for residual symptoms of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia might not represent an increased burden", whereas "for some patients, acceptability implications might be a factor when adding an SGA to clozapine because of the increased burden of side effects". "Patient values and preferences varied because some individuals might express concern over treatment with additional medications". Recommendation: "We suggest augmenting clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic medication for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have not experienced an adequate response to clozapine".

### Low awareness of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in a mixed-method survey of 354 patients and carers [^adc67212]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Haematological monitoring is essential for the early detection and prevention of potential CIA. However, the duration of monitoring and the criteria for discontinuation are poorly defined, presenting a significant barrier to treatment access. Current literature overwhelmingly indicates that most cases of life-threatening agranulocytosis occur within the first few years of treatment. As such, the current stringent approach of indefinite monitoring has been described as impractical from a patient or service perspective. Instead, as proposed by others, policymakers should consider restricting monitoring to the highest-risk period. To achieve this, it is imperative that patients and carers are well informed of the risks and the actions to take to prevent mortality from CIA. Moreover, encouraging patients to request an urgent FBC if they have potential symptoms of CIA, such as fever or sore throat, will likely help prevent fatalities even when haematological monitoring is in force. This recommendation is supported by the understanding that individuals with fatal agranulocytosis typically present initially with signs of infection, including febrile or upper respiratory symptoms. Educational initiatives for the public regarding clozapine treatment and the risks are limited. Given the findings from our survey, policymakers should prioritise effective education for patients and their family members to make clozapine a safer treatment. Patient and carer education should be delivered before treatment initiation and reinforced routinely at each scheduled haematological consultation. While the effectiveness of patient and caregiver education in preventing complications associated with CIA is yet to be established, patient and carer empowerment is increasingly endorsed by healthcare professionals in other medical specialties. Recognition of agranulocytosis symptoms is a key component of the safe use of clozapine when blood monitoring intervals exceed the typical time course for the development of agranulocytosis. A potential solution, as used in other conditions such as epilepsy, may be the use of electronic alert cards to remind patients and carers of symptoms related to CIA and other potentially serious adverse effects, such as clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility (CIGH). These e-cards may also be useful to non-psychiatric healthcare providers who may have limited knowledge of clozapine and its risks. This approach is particularly important given our data showing that many patients or carers would first consult their GP or community pharmacist if CIA is suspected. Alternatively, home-based ANC testing could be explored, particularly considering respondents reporting a preference for self-management or hesitance to seek medical care. Future research is warranted to investigate patient and carer awareness of other potentially serious adverse effects, such as CIGH, which carries a higher mortality rate than CIA. Educational materials for individuals taking clozapine should emphasise the importance of early recognition and timely medical intervention given the potential severity.

### Point-of-care measurement of clozapine concentration using a finger-stick blood sample [^f0febb80]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of clozapine demands regular monitoring of clozapine plasma concentrations and of white blood cell parameters. The delay between sending blood samples for analysis and receiving the results hinders clinical care. Point-of-care testing (POCT) can provide drug assay results within a few minutes.

Aim

This study aimed to investigate the utility of a novel point-of-care device that can measure clozapine concentrations using capillary blood samples collected via a finger stick.

Method

During a five-week period starting in June 2019 eligible patients were asked to provide a finger-stick capillary sample in addition to their usual venous blood sample. Samples were analysed by the novel point-of-care device and by the standard laboratory method. Capillary blood samples were tested by the MyCare™ Insite POCT analyser, and a quantitative measurement of clozapine concentration was provided within six minutes.

Results

A total of 309 patients agreed to measurements by the two methods. Analysis revealed clozapine concentrations in venous blood as determined by the laboratory method ranged from 20 to 1310ng/mL and by POCT from 7 to 1425ng/mL. There was a strong positive correlation (R = 0.89) between the results from the venous and the capillary sample methods. The slope of the association between standard assay and MyCare™ Insite was 1.0 with an intercept of -21ng/mL, indicating minimal bias.

Conclusion

Clozapine concentrations can be accurately measured at the point of care using capillary blood samples collected via a finger stick. This approach may be more acceptable than venous sampling to patients and, with almost instant results available, more useful to clinicians.

### A retrospective study on clozapine-induced blood dyscrasias in the first 20 weeks of therapy [^d52ffc66]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clozapine (CZP) is not commonly prescribed mainly because of the risk of serious adverse effects, particularly neutropenia. It can also cause blood disorders, ranging from mild to severe, affecting different blood cell types. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of hematological abnormalities in a Pakistani cohort of patients treated with antipsychotics using a comprehensive hematological monitoring program.

Methods

The study included 288 patients categorized into three clinical groups based on antipsychotic treatment: Group TA (typical antipsychotics), Group AA (atypical antipsychotics), and Group CZP. During the initial 20-week treatment period, patients were regularly monitored hematological to assess changes in their blood profiles. The occurrence of various hematological abnormalities was investigated and analyzed using statistical models.

Results

Blood dyscrasias were observed more frequently in patients in the CZP group than in the other groups. Specifically, neutropenia was seen in a few patients in group CZP. Notably, a positive clinical response to CZP treatment was significantly correlated with transient leukocytosis, transient neutrophilia, and persistent anemia. In contrast, poor clinical response to CZP medication was associated with transient leukopenia.

Conclusion

CZP treatment resulted in more blood disorders than TA or AA treatments. While blood abnormalities were common with CZP, severe neutropenia was rare. Certain blood changes were linked to better treatment outcomes. Therefore, regular blood monitoring is recommended to optimize treatment effectiveness and manage side effects.

### Non-prescribing of clozapine for outpatients with schizophrenia in real-world settings: the clinicians' perspectives [^5b1d73e3]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

The major concerns seemed to be loss of drug compliance, expected difficulties in obtaining ECG recordings, or the patient's current overweight.

Most psychiatrists acknowledged during the interview that POC devices for finger-prick blood sampling would make hematological monitoring easier on both patients and clinicians and that it in some cases probably could facilitate clozapine treatment:

" Well, in some cases, if the patient is afraid of needles, they might be persuaded to a tiny prick on the finger… yes, I think, in some cases, it could definitely make a difference" (TRP05).

However, all psychiatrists agreed that capillary monitoring alone, or other isolated interventions to facilitate blood sampling, would not dramatically increase clozapine prescribing:

" No, I think that, for most patients, it doesn't matter, because blood sampling is not the problem " (TRP01).

To increase clozapine utility several simultaneous changes were perceived necessary: e.g. educational initiatives, political prioritizing and audit on clozapine treatment, more liberal blood monitoring requirements, longer admissions and/or easy access to home-ECG recordings, aided drug-compliance and weight reduction, and more time per outpatient for follow-up and management of side effects.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^c138923e]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline — clozapine safety, monitoring, and practical requirements: Safe and effective use of clozapine requires 'laboratory tests to monitor neutrophil levels; training for both pharmacies and prescribers; registration of pharmacies, prescribers, and patients; and reporting of episodes of neutropenia', as well as 'the need for increased clinical contacts… starting at very low doses and increasing gradually'. Access barriers related to benign ethnic neutropenia were addressed through 'modifications in the Clozapine REMS protocols for blood testing in people with BEN'. Both systematic reviews note 'clinically useful associations exist between plasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites and clinical responses', and 'speculations have occurred that titrating doses to adjust plasma levels could enhance therapeutic benefits'. Additional findings 'suggest that smoking increases the rate of clozapine metabolism', with smoking cessation or reduction on a constant dose increasing blood levels and toxicity, while starting or restarting smoking can decrease levels and reduce effectiveness; aging 'decreases the rate of clozapine metabolism' and 'physiological changes related to aging increase the risks of several adverse effects'. Therefore, 'safe, effective use of clozapine might require the availability of laboratory resources to evaluate blood levels and providers who have the training and knowledge required to interpret them'.

### Evaluating the epidemiology of clozapine-associated neutropenia among people on clozapine across Australia and aotearoa new zealand: a retrospective cohort study [^ef378fda]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

Clozapine is associated with the risk of serious neutropenia. However, this risk might decrease over time, meaning that indefinite absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitoring could be unnecessary. We aimed to determine the epidemiology and timing of clozapine-associated neutropenia outcomes, to investigate variables that might contribute to the odds of neutropenia, and to determine risk of competing neutropenic events during clozapine treatment.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of the Australian and New Zealand Viatris Pharmacovigilance system (one of two monitoring databases for these two countries) between June 6, 1990, and Oct 25, 2022. Patients were excluded from analysis if they commenced clozapine before 1990, did not have a haematology test within 2 weeks of commencement date, or had no follow-up. We measured minor neutropenia (ANC 1.0–1.5×10⁹ per L) and serious neutropenia (ANC < 1.0×10⁹ per L) leading to cessation of clozapine within 6 weeks of the neutropenic event. We determined the rates of minor and serious neutropenia and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the likelihood of neutropenia leading to cessation. For serious neutropenia leading to cessation, we used time-to-event to calculate rolling weekly averages and to perform competing risk analysis of outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models and a Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards regression model. For the subset of data where information on previous clozapine use was available, we did an analysis for participants who did and did not have previous clozapine exposure.

Findings

We included 26630 people, with 2.6 million ANC values. Within the total cohort, 17585 people (66%) were male, 9025 (33.9%) female, and 20 (0.1%) other gender, and the mean age was 36.1 years (SD 13.7). We did not have data on race or ethnicity. Of the 26630 people taking clozapine, 1146 (4.3%) had minor neutropenia, 313 (1.2%) had serious neutropenia leading to cessation, and 223 (0.8%) had serious neutropenia unrelated to clozapine without cessation. In people with no previous exposure to clozapine (n = 15973), the cumulative incidence of serious neutropenia leading to cessation was 0.9% at 18 weeks and 1.4% at 2 years; the weekly incidence rate for serious neutropenia leading to cessation peaked at 9 weeks (0.128%) and fell to a rolling average weekly incidence of 0.001% by 2 years. For minor neutropenia, the cumulative incidence was 1.7% at 18 weeks and 3.5% at 2 years; the weekly incidence rate peaked at 9 weeks (0.218%) and fell to a stable rolling average of 0.01%. The median time to a serious neutropenic event leading to cessation was 17 weeks (IQR 9.96–102). Previous clozapine exposure reduced the risk of serious neutropenia leading to cessation (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.12–0.31; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Most serious neutropenia leading to clozapine cessation occurs within 18 weeks of treatment and becomes negligible after 2 years. Weekly haematological monitoring after the first 18 weeks could be safely reduced to once every 4 weeks and ceased after 2 years unless clinically indicated. Clozapine retrial after interruption with 2 cumulative years of unremarkable testing might not require further haematological monitoring. A serious neutropenia ANC threshold of ≤ 1.0×10⁹/L could be used in more jurisdictions.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^4d754ec6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Upon monograph recommendations, clozapine requires mandatory hematological surveillance to prevent agranulocytosis and further complications. In Canada, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1.5 × 10⁹/L warrants for clozapine cessation and forbids its rechallenge. In some patients, lowering hematological threshold is possible (e.g. benign ethnic neutropenia), but clozapine cessation may still be required upon reaching ANC value below the adjusted threshold. In such situations, clozapine abrupt cessation is associated with an increased risk of sudden psychotic relapse, jeopardizing recovery. In some cases, seeking ways to reintroduce clozapine despite hematological caveats may provide the last chance of re-achieving recovery.

A brief review of the literature has highlighted two different off-label pharmacological strategies in Canada, used to re-expose a patient to clozapine. These strategies include the use of lithium to induce leukocytosis and the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate leukopoiesis. These strategies may sometimes be used concomitantly, although it remains unknown whether such practice is superior to the use of both agents used separately. Furthermore, even though the use of G-CSF for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is well documented, data regarding the use of G-CSF and lithium for clozapine-induced blood dyscrasias are scarce and are mainly based on case reports. For this latter purpose, G-CSF is either used "as-needed", giving doses until neutrophil normalization only if an ANC result is below a prespecified threshold, or used as a "prophylactic strategy", giving doses weekly on a regular basis independently of ANC values. In two recent systematic reviews, clozapine rechallenge using G-CSF showed a 75–76% success rate and an "as-needed" strategy seemed to be the most promising.

### Clozapine rechallenge or continuation despite neutropenia or agranulocytosis using colony-stimulating factor: a systematic review [^97c53b2d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on available data, it is not yet possible to establish the superiority of any specific CSF administration protocol.concluded, respectively, that 70% of patients who received prophylactic CSF were still on CLZ at the end of follow-up, compared with 100% of patients who received it on an "as-needed" basis. Meanwhile, also reported on a 70% effectiveness rate for CSF prophylactic use, compared with 89% for the "as-needed" strategy. However, these high success rates relied only on a small number of cases, that is, seven and nine cases, respectively. Such a clear-cut distinction between these two approaches was not evidenced in this present review, as CSF prophylactic use was successful in 80% of the cases (n = 20), compared with a success rate of 81% for the "as-needed" strategy (n = 21). This difference is partly driven by a recent consecutive case series in which there were four unsuccessful cases associated with the "as-needed" CSF administration scheme. A less ambiguous finding from this present review is that G-CSFs are preferred over GM-CSFs and that the short-acting formulation of filgrastim has been most widely used in this particular setting. Considering that many patients do not require prolonged CSF use, it would seem most adequate to administer single doses of filgrastim 300 μg whenever ANC values drop below a prespecified threshold, such as 1.0 × 10⁹ cells/L, at least during the first few weeks following CLZ rechallenge. This would prevent unnecessary utilization of CSF, since human recombinant CSFs remain costly despite the availability of less expensive biosimilar versions, while not jeopardizing patients' safety. Indeed, should neutropenia reoccur following rechallenge, it should be caught earlier on provided that blood monitoring is done weekly for at least the first 6 months. In the event of recurrent neutropenia requiring multiple CSF doses, a prophylactic strategy could be initiated with once to thrice weekly administrations of filgrastim. In any case, hematologists should be actively involved whenever a CLZ rechallenge is undertaken following blood dyscrasia.

### Guidelines versus practice in screening and monitoring of cardiometabolic risks in patients taking antipsychotic medications: where do we stand? [^44b43405]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Practical challenges in antipsychotic therapy and cardiometabolic monitoring

The patients' response to antipsychotic therapy has been the ultimate goal since the introduction of antipsychotic medications. Issues associated with antipsychotic treatment, such as treatment failure, may shift the attention entirely towards the efficacy of the antipsychotics. In clinical practice, the dose and course of antipsychotic therapy vary between patients, depending on patients' factors, including the acuity and course of the psychotic illness. Selecting antipsychotic medications can be challenging for many prescribers since the therapeutic response primarily drives the decision. However, such decision must balance their benefits and the associated cardiometabolic risks. Selecting an initial agent with a favourable cardiometabolic profile is considered the best approach for those with or at higher risk of CVDs. Guidelines recommend using new antipsychotics as initial therapy, though such an option may be inconvenient for many patients. As the antipsychotic efficacy of both antipsychotic classes (first and second generation antipsychotics) has been shown to be comparable, routine clinical decisions should be based on individual therapeutic response and tolerability, which can vary between individuals.

The risk of relapse of psychotic illness represents an additional obstacle for dose or drug alteration. Likewise, resistance to antipsychotic therapy remains a significant issue that continues to provoke debate over its clinical management. To date, clozapine is the only approved agent for refractory conditions, and the role of augmented antipsychotic therapy is less advocated as routine practice. Not surprisingly, these obstacles in antipsychotic therapy can often deviate clinical decisions away from the adverse outcomes profile, as they direct the attention more toward treatment efficacy and less to treatment safety, resulting in suboptimal monitoring.

### Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios correlate with increased clozapine concentration-to-dose ratios during titration [^58c83efa]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study's main finding was identifying a positive correlation between NLR and C/D ratio during clozapine titration. Although the relationship between inflammation and increased blood clozapine levels has been demonstrated in numerous case reports, only a few cohort studies have been conducted under well-controlled conditions. In a cohort of 131 Chinese patients, inflammation/infection was observed on 2% of the total monitored days (482/24,789), occurring in 18 episodes across 16 patients. Eleven percent of the infection episodes did not show any clinically relevant effect (no increase in white blood cells or CRP levels). In 61% of the infection episodes, it was recommended to reduce the clozapine dose by half, and in 28% of the infection episodes, it was recommended to reduce the clozapine dose by one-third. In a cohort of 65 hospitalized Chinese patients, the clozapine C/D ratios during infection were significantly higher than at baseline, and a significant positive correlation was found between the C/D ratios and white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Recently, Smith et al. showed in a retrospective study of 126 patients that the C/D ratio was three times higher in non-smokers with high CRP levels (CRP > 50 mg/L) than in those with low CRP levels (CRP < 5 mg/L).

The strength of the current study is that blood clozapine levels and NLR were measured under well-controlled conditions every week for 6 weeks after clozapine initiation during hospitalization. Furthermore, even when the six patients who had fever during clozapine titration were excluded, a significant correlation was observed between the clozapine C/D ratio and the NLR, suggesting that blood clozapine levels increased when the NLR, a marker of inflammation, was high, even when the patient was clinically asymptomatic. The reference range for NLR is 1 to 2, and values higher than 3 are considered pathological. The linear mixed model of this study showed that when the NLR increased by 1%, the C/D ratio increased by 0.70%. In weeks 1–3, the median NLR was significantly higher in patients with fever than in those without, exceeding 3, and the median C/D ratio was also significantly higher in patients with fever than in those without in weeks 1 and 2 (Table 2). Therefore, although no clear threshold for NLR was identified in the present study, the possibility of unexpectedly high blood levels of clozapine may be considered when the NLR exceeds 3.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^d0754a21]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of clozapine levels during titration

The international guideline was developed for countries with varying levels of resources. Ideally, in the fourth week after reaching a target dose and waiting for at least 5 days (1 week is better) for a steady-state concentration, the clozapine prescriber can use that concentration to predict the therapeutic dose needed to reach at least 350 ng/mL clozapine concentration. The already published supplemental table S2 of the international guidelinecan help clinicians estimate therapeutic doses for specific patients based on their clozapine concentration in the fourth week. At therapeutic doses and in the absence of inhibitors/inducers or inflammation, clozapine follows linear kinetics. This means that the relationship between the dose and the plasma concentration is a constant (if the patient in the fourth week on 100 mg/day has a clozapine plasma concentration of 175 ng/mL, this patient needs at least 200 mg/day to reach 350 ng/mL).

If the clozapine prescriber cannot access clozapine levels, table 1 provides a rough estimation of the approximated maintenance doses according to the patient's characteristics. Lithium prescribers worldwide routinely use lithium levels to determine safe doses; similarly, clozapine prescribers worldwide should ideally use clozapine levels. In some countries, measuring clozapine levels is easy and relatively affordable, and new point-devices may provide concentrations quickly. The guideline titrations mention that obtaining a trough level on the day next to the end of the week (days 8, 15, and 22) may be an additional safety measure for identifying clozapine PMs. The problem with these levels is that if the dosage has not been stable for at least 5 days (or better 1 week), the concentration has not reached a steady state. Table 1 provides alert numbers indicating which non-steady-state concentrations may be a concern for each titration week.

### Mediation and longitudinal analysis to interpret the association between clozapine pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, and absolute neutrophil count [^4f263d22]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

This work adds to a body of research aiming towards a complete understanding of the factors that influence ANC in clozapine users, which could have value in improving access to this gold-standard medication. Currently, there is reluctance amongst some clinicians to prescribe clozapine to patients with schizophrenia. This is primarily due to the risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis, and the accompanying need for therapeutic blood monitoring to ensure patient safety. While effective at reducing deaths from clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in the UK, haematological monitoring is time-consuming both from the perspective of the patient, and the clinician. Appropriately interpreting the effects of pharmacokinetic and genetic variables that influence neutrophil loss might allow the design of stratification strategies for clozapine users based on their likelihood of immune-related ADRs, with appropriate adjustments of prescription and monitoring. This could also inform preventative interventions targeting those most likely to experience neutrophil loss, and subsequent immune decline, which may help to prevent serious illness over the duration of clozapine use. Some examples of this might include encouraging at-risk patients to take up offers of seasonal vaccinations, particularly given evidence of reduced vaccine uptake in people with psychiatric disorders; testing markers of inflammation and adjusting treatment, or introducing further mitigations accordingly. Knowledge of these variables could act as an additional layer of information to guide clinical decision-making and ultimately help to widen access to clozapine via a two-pronged approach: enhancing safety for those at highest risk while reducing obstacles to treatment used for those at the lowest risk.

### Dried blood spot analysis for therapeutic drug monitoring of clozapine [^aa4a7f1c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 0.4%-1% of the population worldwide. Diagnosis of schizophrenia is based primarily on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug that is mainly used in the treatment of schizophrenia patients who are refractory or intolerant to at least 2 other antipsychotics. Due to the high variability in pharmacokinetics of clozapine, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is highly recommended for clozapine therapy.

Objective

To develop and clinically validate a novel sampling method using dried blood spot (DBS) to support TDM of clozapine and norclozapine.

Methods

From June 2014 to September 2014, 15 schizophrenia patients (18–55 years) treated with clozapine were included. Plasma, DBS samples made from venous samples (VDBS), and finger prick DBS (DBS) samples were obtained before administration and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after clozapine intake. The study was repeated in 6 Russian patients for external validation. Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the DBS, VDBS, and plasma results for clozapine and norclozapine.

Results

The DBS validation results showed good linearity over the concentration time curve measured for clozapine and norclozapine. The accuracy and between- and within-day precision variation values were within accepted ranges. Different blood spot volumes and hematocrit values had no significant influence on the results. The DBS samples were stable at 20°C and 37°C for 2 weeks and at -20°C for 2 years. The mean clozapine and norclozapine DBS/plasma ratios were, respectively, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.85) and 1.063 (95% CI, 1.027 to 1.099) in Dutch patients. The mean clozapine DBS/DPS ratio in Russian patients was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.76).

Conclusion

DBS analysis is a reliable tool for blood sampling and performing TDM of clozapine and norclozapine in daily practice and substantially extends the opportunities for TDM of clozapine.

### Establishing the characteristics of an effective pharmacogenetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^b77d2dfa]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Clozapine is the only evidence-based therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it induces agranulocytosis, a rare but potentially fatal haematological adverse reaction, in less than 1% of users. To improve safety, the drug is subject to mandatory haematological monitoring throughout the course of treatment, which is burdensome for the patient and one of the main reasons clozapine is underused. Therefore, a pharmacogenetic test is clinically useful if it identifies a group of patients for whom the agranulocytosis risk is low enough to alleviate monitoring requirements. Assuming a genotypic marker stratifies patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group, we explore the relationship between test sensitivity, group size and agranulocytosis risk. High sensitivity minimizes the agranulocytosis risk in the low-risk group and is essential for clinical utility, in particular in combination with a small high-risk group.

### Efficacy and safety of clozapine in psychotic disorders-a systematic quantitative meta-review [^02f2a968]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine — considered the most effective antipsychotic — was introduced in the early 1970s for the treatment of schizophrenia. First, clozapine was believed to have not only superior efficacy but also to have overall better tolerability compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) due to a low risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). However, in 1975, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn since 17 out of 2660 (0.7%) patients treated with clozapine in Finland developed agranulocytosis and eight patients subsequently died. In 1988, Kane et al. confirmed clozapine's safety and superiority vs. chlorpromazine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), and subsequently, the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) and other health authorities approved its re-introduction for the indication of TRS with regular hematological monitoring.

Evidence-based treatment guidelines for the management of difficult-to-treat schizophrenia currently recommend clozapine. Nevertheless, definitions of TRS, typically involving two failed trials of different non-clozapine antipsychotics, differ significantly across guidelines as do criteria for TRS in clinical trials: if TRS is operationalized at all, it differs in up to 95% of trials. A lack of consensus is also represented in the extent and frequency of mandatory safety monitoring procedures beyond hematological monitoring during clozapine treatment according to the respective national regulations. Further indications or recommendations, when clozapine can be applied in clinical practice, are poorly harmonized: in certain European countries, (e.g. Germany, the Netherlands) clozapine is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), whereas in the US it was given a Level B recommendation by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) for this indication. Furthermore, the FDA approved clozapine as the first agent indicated for suicidality in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Furthermore, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recommends (1B) that patients with TRS be treated with clozapine and recommends (1B) patients with schizophrenia be treated with clozapine if the risk for suicide attempts or suicide remains substantial despite other treatments and suggests (2C) that patients with schizophrenia be treated with clozapine if the risk for aggressive behavior remains substantial despite other treatments. Of note, clozapine is recommended in some clinical guidelines for treatment-refractory bipolar disorder with an uncertain body of evidence suggesting beneficial effects on e.g. mania, depression, rapid cycling and psychotic symptoms.

### Reasons for discontinuing clozapine: a cohort study of patients commencing treatment [^3ba1d2e0]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that many discontinuations due to other ADRs could be avoided, although the appropriateness of any given reason was not assessed in this study. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that prompt identification and appropriate management of ADRs has the potential to improve continuation of clozapine treatment.

Consistent with earlier reports, discontinuation due primarily to an inadequate response to clozapine was rare, occurring in only 2.5% of patients. Given that non-response to clozapine has been estimated between 40 and 70%, this result is unlikely to reflect the true rates of non-response to clozapine but rather that non-response is seldom recorded as the primary reason to discontinue treatment. A patient (or clinician) may be more likely to tolerate an ADR and be willing to persevere with clozapine if they are experiencing a good clinical response to clozapine, but might instead discontinue clozapine, citing adverse effects, in the absence of a clinical response. Nevertheless, the small percentage of patients who discontinue primarily due to inadequate response is striking. It could be driven partly by concern over risk of further relapse upon cessation and partly by a lack of any other evidence-based treatment options.

An interesting and novel insight was the observation that discontinuation of clozapine due to a dislike of blood monitoring was reported in 3.5% of patients. This raises the question of whether rates would be higher in all those eligible for clozapine, an important issue given that low rates of clozapine prescription have been attributed to the burden of blood monitoring. In this cohort of patients initiating clozapine, three patients died (2% of discontinuations) during the follow-up period. This is in contrast with cross sectional studies of clozapine discontinuation, which reported death as accounting for 13% of clozapine discontinuations.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^456a992d]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

As already stated, it is highly likely that standard monitoring thresholds overestimate the proportion of patients who have true clozapine-related LTA. Indeed, it has been shown that the majority of those on the UK non-rechallenge database can be safely re-prescribed clozapine. A substantial fraction of apparent clozapine-related neutropenia (and even agranulocytosis) is actually a manifestation of benign neutropenia, in which successful rechallenge is possible.

There are two major consequences to this overdiagnosis. First, many people are unnecessarily precluded from receiving clozapine because of an assumed clozapine-related blood toxicity. Second, genetic association studies are compromised by the inclusion of cases of neutropenia and agranulocytosis that are neither related to clozapine nor of clinical consequence. The highest sensitivity value ever obtained for a genetic test for clozapine-related agranulocytosis is 54%. However, all studies so far conducted defined agranulocytosis as any measurement of ANC ≤ 0.5 × 10⁹/L and so inevitably included in their study samples a proportion of people with a nominal and inconsequential agranulocytosis. Higher sensitivity values are unlikely to be attained without refining case-selection in line with the findings presented here.

### Beyond white blood cell monitoring: screening in the initial phase of clozapine therapy [^566ed51f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Clozapine is the preferred option for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, since 1975, clozapine has been known to cause agranulocytosis. In the clozapine screening guidelines, white blood cell count is mandatory. In the past 20 years, after its reintroduction, 3 other serious side effects, namely, diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal hypomotility, and myocarditis have been documented but have so far failed to be incorporated in the screening guidelines. The objective of this review is to determine whether an update of the screening guidelines for serious side effects with clozapine is evidence based.

Data Sources

The English-language literature, available via MEDLINE or PubMed, on the incidence of 4 clozapine-related side effects, using clozapine, agranulocytosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and gastrointestinal hypomotility as keywords, that have been published over the period 1976–2010, was collected.

Study Selection

16 studies that provided incidence rates or data from which these rates could be calculated were included.

Data Extraction

We compared 1-year incidence rates, mortality rates in the whole study population and in the affected cases. When rates reflected longer periods of observation, the given rate was recalculated to obtain a 1-year incidence rate.

Results

The incidence of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis varies between 3.8‰-8.0‰. The mortality rate is 0.1‰-0.3‰, and the case-fatality rate is 2.2‰-4.2‰. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the incidence was calculated at 1.2‰-3.1‰, and the case-fatality rate was 20%-31%. In gastrointestinal hypomotility, the incidence was 4‰-8‰, and the case-fatality rate was 15%-27.5%. The discrepancy in incidence rates between Australia (7‰-34‰) and the rest of the world (0.07‰-0.6‰) impairs a general approach of this side effect.

Conclusions

In 2 of the 3 studied side effects, diabetic ketoacidosis and gastrointestinal hypomotility, reduction of mortality to the level of agranulocytosis is both necessary and feasible. In order to obtain this outcome, the screening guidelines need to be modified; early detection of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia, that might-via diabetes mellitus-develop into diabetic ketoacidosis, requires obligatory monthly measurement of fasting plasma glucose. To prevent gastrohypomotility, and complications therefrom, the clinician should be required to choose between either weekly monitoring or standard coprescription of laxatives for prevention. The reported incidence of myocarditis (high in Australia, low in the rest of the world) is too divergent to allow for an overall recommendation outside Australia.

### Haematological point of care testing for clozapine monitoring [^44321451]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clozapine treatment requires regular full blood counts (FBC) because of the risk of agranulocytosis. Traditionally, FBCs use venous blood samples but the need for frequent venepuncture adversely affects adherence. We investigated the utility of a point of care testing (POCT) finger prick method for clozapine patients.

Method

Patients being treated with clozapine, who were having a venous blood sample taken for haematological monitoring, also provided a fingerprick capillary blood sample. The PixCell HemoScreen® POCT analyser was used to test both the capillary and venous samples, and the venous sample was also tested using a standard laboratory method.

Results

We completed FBCs on 226 patients. We found strong correlations between the results from the standard laboratory venous method and the POCT capillary and venous assays for WBC (R = 0.96 & R = 0.99), neutrophils (R = 0.96 & R = 0.97) and eosinophils (R = 0.94 & R = 0.94). Compared with the standard laboratory venous blood method, mean biases for capillary blood POCT method were -0.56 × 10⁹/L for WBC, -0.39 × 10⁹/L for neutrophils, and -0.01 × 10⁹/L for eosinophils. Mean biases for venous blood POCT method were -0.004 × 10⁹/L for WBC, -0.28 × 10⁹/L for neutrophils, and 0.01 × 10⁹/L for eosinophils. Of the 226 patients tested, 10 (4.4%) had levels below clozapine monitoring thresholds (WBC < 3.5 × 10⁹/L and Neutrophils < 1.5 × 10⁹/L) by capillary blood, and 4 (1.8%) by venous blood by POCT. The standard laboratory method showed 3 of these to be sub-threshold. All cases of neutropenia were identified by capillary and venous POCT.

Conclusion

The PixCell HemoScreen® POCT analyser provided results that were comparable with those from a standard venous blood laboratory method for WBC, neutrophil and eosinophil counts. The availability of an accurate capillary monitoring method may result in increased clozapine uptake and better clozapine adherence.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^0d6fa165]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis is a rare eventand its pathogenesis is not fully understood. The formation of reactive clozapine metabolites may be directly toxic to neutrophils. Studies also suggest immunomodulatory effects resulting in transient changes in neutrophil counts after treatment initiation. Spikes in WCC and neutrophils from the first week of treatment, stabilising by week 10 have been reported. Re-challenge may result in rapid recurrence and more dramatic dyscrasia, an observation which supports an immune-mediated reaction. Genetic association with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis suggests immune mechanism involving human leucocyte antigen genes.

Distinct mechanisms and risk factors may underlie clozapine-associated benign neutropenia and clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Based on incidence figures, at least two thirds of cases of neutropenia identified in people on clozapine do not "progress" to agranulocytosis. As already mentioned, these cases of neutropenia may be neither clozapine-related nor pathogenic and so may have no mechanism to speak of. In a US general population studythe prevalence of neutropenia was 4.5% in black participants and 0.78% in white participants. These cases appear to be naturally occurring episodes of low neutrophil counts that may have no clinical significance. The repeated blood testing required for clozapine use undoubtedly increases the chances of finding cases of neutropenia, which may then be inappropriately linked to the use of clozapine. A meta-analysis of twenty studies reporting rates of neutropenia with clozapine and an active comparator, found no elevated risk for clozapine. In a more recent study in Iceland(where clozapine blood monitoring is less frequent than elsewhere), the incidence of neutropenia was no greater with clozapine than with other antipsychotics and, of 34 neutropenia cases identified in people on clozapine, only one progressed to LTA.

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^95d0702d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

CLOZARIL has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of CLOZARIL-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of CLOZARIL treatment. The mechanism by which CLOZARIL causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating CLOZARIL treatment or during treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout CLOZARIL treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during CLOZARIL treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia.

### Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in Finland, 1982–2007: long-term monitoring of patients is still warranted [^9b18b9e9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent studies suggest that restrictions on the use of clozapine should be reassessed considering the risk-benefit ratio. We analyzed all cases of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis reported to the Finnish National Agency for Medicines between 1982 and 2007.

Method

In this retrospective longitudinal study, we defined agranulocytosis as a neutrophil count below 0.5 × 10⁹/L and, accordingly, identified a total of 163 patients with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. We collected all available information on patient demography, as well as on daily clozapine doses, treatment duration, concomitant medication prior to the onset of agranulocytosis, and infections during the adverse event. The amount of clozapine used annually in Finland was estimated on the basis of the defined daily dose, and the frequency of agranulocytosis was calculated from the absolute number of cases in relation to the defined daily dose each year, as reported by the Finnish National Agency for Medicines.

Results

In 10.3% of cases, agranulocytosis occurred after the second treatment year, and, in some patients, agranulocytosis occurred even after 13, 14, and 22 years of clozapine treatment. Strikingly, a total of 40% of all patients and 80% of those with fatal agranulocytosis had received, concomitantly with clozapine, other medication associated with agranulocytosis.

Conclusions

Some restrictions and long-term blood monitoring during the use of clozapine are still needed. In addition, we raise the question of whether guidelines for concomitant use of drugs associated with agranulocytosis during clozapine therapy are warranted.

Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.
ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management.
Consider hematology consultation.
See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17).

Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia)

For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine or a clozapine product.

If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient's medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode.

Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia

It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy.

### Severe neutropenia unrelated to clozapine in patients receiving clozapine [^ebcf6af0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clozapine is known to cause agranulocytosis. Mandatory monitoring schemes are aimed at reducing the risk of agranulocytosis and of the consequences of agranulocytosis. All cases of agranulocytosis occurring in people prescribed clozapine are assumed to be caused by clozapine.

Methods

In a previous study, we examined a cohort of patients listed on our hospital database as having had clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and applied specific criteria to identify those with confirmed clozapine-related, life-threatening agranulocytosis. In this study, we examine the cases not meeting these specific criteria.

Results

In the original study, 9 of 23 cases met the criteria for clozapine-induced, life-threatening agranulocytosis. Of the 13 remaining cases for whom data were available, 5 were probably caused by clozapine but were not life-threatening. Three cases were the result of concomitant cancer chemotherapy. Three were anomalous results probably related to measurement error. For the remaining two cases, the cause was not identified.

Conclusion

Not all cases of agranulocytosis occurring in people taking clozapine are caused by clozapine. The widely used threshold criterion-based diagnosis overestimates the risk of agranulocytosis. True clozapine-related agranulocytosis is best identified by pattern-based criteria: rapid fall in neutrophil counts over around 2 weeks to below 0.5 × 10⁹/L for two consecutive days (unless clozapine is stopped very early or granulocyte colony stimulating factor is given) where other possible causes (benign ethnic neutropenia, cancer chemotherapy) can be ruled out.

Antipsychotic side effects and toxicity in dementia highlight that antipsychotic agents are associated with a risk of serious complications; tardive dyskinesia risk may be as high as 30% for elderly patients with significant exposure to first-generation agents, while in a risperidone cohort the cumulative incidence was 2.6% in 330 patients with dementia at a mean dosage of about 1 mg/day for a mean period of 273 days; neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially lethal adverse effect that occurs less frequently with second-generation than with first-generation agents but has been reported with both types; clozapine is associated with risk of agranulocytosis (about 1%), and regular monitoring of blood counts is required.

### Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis: 20 years of clinical observations [^fa52d3a1]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

No available tests are recognized as being of value in identifying those patients at risk of developing deferiprone‐induced agranulocytosis. Four episodes of agranulocytosis in CT were preceded by signs of infection or immune reactions. It is unclear whether those events may have played a role on the development of agranulocytosis. However, there would be merit in considering the potential contribution of a preceding infection along with other factors such as tolerance of alternative chelators in evaluating risk:benefit for rechallenge. Given the general clinical experience of precipitous drop in ANC in various cases, weekly monitoring of the neutrophil count has not been shown to be a reliable predictor of agranulocytosis. However, the concomitant use of medications known to be associated with neutropenia or agranulocytosis may increase the risk of developing agranulocytosis, as has been reported for clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis 33. A retrospective analysis suggested that exposure to interferon for treatment of hepatitis C infection increases the risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis during deferiprone therapy 34.

### Clozapine (Versacloz) [^406ef8fa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

VERSACLOZ has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of VERSACLOZ-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of VERSACLOZ treatment. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating VERSACLOZ treatment or during

treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating VERSACLOZ treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. VERSACLOZ initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout VERSACLOZ treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during VERSACLOZ treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia.

### Reasons for discontinuing clozapine: a cohort study of patients commencing treatment [^1232441f]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

2.3 Outcome measure

The timing and the reasons for clozapine discontinuation were assessed in a case note review for all patients who stopped treatment within 24 months of initiation. The date of clozapine initiation was defined as the date the patient took their first dose of clozapine. The date of discontinuation was defined as the date the patient was last known to take clozapine, where this was followed by at least three consecutive months without clozapine treatment.

Reasons for discontinuation were obtained from descriptive case notes when explicitly stated by the patient's clinical team. These were categorised into mutually exclusive reasons consistent with the previous literature. If there were multiple reasons that spanned more than one category (of which there were only five instances), the most likely primary reason was inferred after discussion between first and corresponding author (Consultant Psychiatrist). Reasons for discontinuation were coded into categories of; (i) adverse drug reaction (ADR) defined as any unwanted or harmful reaction attributed to clozapine including intolerable side effects, (ii) non-adherence not otherwise specified defined as the patient declining to take medication, not attending for blood monitoring, or missing doses without informing their clinical team and with no reason for doing so stated (iii) inadequate response defined as insufficient improvement in symptoms, (iv) blood monitoring defined as a dislike of either blood tests or burden of frequent clinic visits, (v) belief medication not required defined as a patient belief that clozapine would not help them or that they did not need any medication, (vi) delusional belief held by the patient specifically regarding clozapine, (vii) anticipated non-adherence defined as pre-emptive discontinuation initiated by the clinical team as it was believed the patient would become non-adherent upon discharge from inpatient services, (viii) death, regardless of whether the cause was attributed to clozapine, and (ix) any other reason. If a patient discontinued due to non-adherence but cited a reason for doing so, they were classified under the reason given. To investigate differences in patients that were non-adherent, discontinuations were further classified as a clinician-led decision (defined as a discontinuation that was led by the clinical team, although in most cases this was a consensual decision between the patient and clinical team) or a patient decision (discontinuation due to non-adherence by declining to take medication, not attending for blood monitoring, or missing doses without informing their clinical team).

### Association between olanzapine concentration and metabolic dysfunction in drug-naive and chronic patients: similarities and differences [^1257f5f7]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the assumption that there is a relationship between plasma drug concentrations and clinical effects, researchers have strived to determine the ideal "therapeutic window", which is characterized by maximal effectiveness and maximal safety for antipsychotics. In 2011, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP) guideline strongly recommended the use of therapeutic drug monitoring of antipsychotic therapy because it allows the use of personalized pharmacotherapy by considering the interindividual variability of pharmacokinetics. For olanzapine, the recommended reference range was 20–80 ng/ml, and the alert level was 150 ng/ml. When the AGNP guideline was updated in 2017, the alert level was lowered to 100 ng/ml, considering the high risk of post injection syndrome due to an excessively high concentration of olanzapine pamoate. The American Psychiatric Association, in its latest guideline for schizophrenia, recommended the use of drug monitoring for clozapine in treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that drug levels greater than 350 ng/ml should be used, if well tolerated, to achieve the highest level of efficacy. Similar recommendations for clozapine have been made in the British Association of Psychopharmacology guideline as well. Drug monitoring was recommended to evaluate antipsychotic medication adherence in acute treatment in Canadian Psychiatric Association guidelines for pharmacotherapy in patients with schizophrenia, as clinicians' capacity to accurately identify those who are nonadherent is limited. A recent study from Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness supported the recommendation by suggesting that antipsychotic blood level below the reference range was related to treatment failure, with 50.8% of the participants with drug level under reference range experiencing treatment failure.

### What are the barriers and facilitators of clozapine use in early psychosis? A survey of UK early intervention clinicians [^a1dae7bd]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In our study, the main perceived barriers to clozapine use in EIP services by clinicians are patient concerns and physical health monitoring. National policymakers should consider the development of clinical training, improving access to resources and guidelines, and consider the streamlining of physical health monitoring to minimise barriers and facilitate the use of clozapine within EI services. National policymakers, public health agencies and NHS Trusts should consider these findings to address the underutilisation of clozapine in EIP services across England and internationally to improve patient outcomes in treatment-resistant psychosis.

### Clozapine [^b9772091]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

Background

Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil "segs" plus neutrophil "bands"). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, "severe neutropenia" replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.

Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.

### Low-frequency monitoring for community clozapine initiations: a comparative study relative to standard frequency assessments [^d4df214a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the safety of this low-frequency physical monitoring (LFM) protocol, we carried out a retrospective cohort study comparing clinical outcomes to patients receiving standard-frequency monitoring (SFM) before the pandemic. To test if LFM resulted in poorer detection and management of side effects and ultimately treatment failure, we chose all-cause discontinuation of clozapine as our primary outcome. As secondary outcomes, we compared the incidence of hospitalisation due to clozapine-related side effects, and the incidence of side effects requiring physical monitoring for detection (i.e. hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, and fever). We hypothesised that our LFM protocol would be as safe and effective as SFM in preventing all-cause discontinuation of clozapine.

The study was part of a clinical audit of patients undergoing community clozapine initiations with the Treatment Review and Assessment Team (TREAT) service. We reviewed the medical notes of all 16 patients who initiated clozapine under the LFM protocol between March 2020 to August 2021. A control group was selected from a pool of 70 patients who initiated clozapine under our SFM protocol between June 2011 to November 2019. Controls (n = 16) were selected blind to outcome and individually matched to cases based on sex, age (± 5 years), and smoking status, because these factors may influence clozapine titration by affecting its metabolism. In-person reviews by clinicians involved face-to-face assessments including physical observations (sitting and standing blood pressure, heart rate, SpO2, temperature, and respiratory rate), side-effect and mental state review. The assessment conducted during the in-person reviews were identical between the LFM and SFM protocols (i.e. they only differed in frequency during the first 3-weeks of treatment). For patients who used tobacco, we encouraged them to report any changes in smoking habits during our in-person reviews due to its known impact on plasma clozapine levels. Patients in both groups received concomitant psychotropic medications and medications to manage clozapine-related side effects, where clinically indicated. We extracted data on clinico-demographics, all-cause discontinuation, hospitalisation and side effects requiring physical monitoring for detection. These side effects were defined in line with guidelines as: hypotension = systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg; postural drop = fall in systolic blood pressure of > 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of > 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing; hypertension = systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg; tachycardia = heart rate > 100 per minute; and fever = temperature > 37.5°C. Side effects requiring physical monitoring for detection were assessed and confirmed by clinicians during in-person reviews. We compared outcomes during the first 3 weeks of clozapine initiation, as the frequency of face-to-face monitoring do not differ between protocols after week 3.

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^36ad5831]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to CLOZARIL initiation. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/μL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in CLOZARIL-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during CLOZARIL treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Management of CLOZARIL-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever

For patients who develop a fever during CLOZARIL treatment:

Interrupt CLOZARIL in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 °F (38.5 °C) or greater and obtain an ANC level.
If the ANC is less than 1000/μL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever.

Restarting CLOZARIL in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia

Generally, do not rechallenge patients with CLOZARIL in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their CLOZARIL-related severe neutropenia after stopping CLOZARIL, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting CLOZARIL treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting CLOZARIL (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than CLOZARIL).

Concomitant Use of CLOZARIL with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia

If CLOZARIL is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: a longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^34816d40]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Added value of this study

In this study, we found ancestral effects and genetic variants associated with inter-individual variation in clozapine metabolism. We found that people of sub-Saharan African ancestry were on average fast clozapine metabolisers, and that those of east Asian or southwest Asian ancestry were slow clozapine metabolisers, all in comparison with people of European ancestry. We also showed that genomic predictors of clozapine pharmacokinetics, developed using longitudinal genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score approaches, had associations of similar effects across diverse ancestral backgrounds.

Implications of all the available evidence

Existing clozapine treatment guidelines do not reflect the real-world diversity of potential clozapine users, and default recommendations for titration and maintenance doses are optimised for those of European descent. Our study reinforces that ancestry can contribute to the variability of clozapine metabolism, and it supports the proactive assessment of drug pharmacokinetics (via therapeutic drug monitoring) as part of the standard care for those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. For the development of further research on this topic, our data support the view that pharmacogenomic predictors of clozapine metabolism might be applicable across worldwide populations, which could facilitate the design and implementation of prospective trials to assess the incorporation of genomics to personalised clozapine prescribing.

Health services in many countries mandate haematological monitoring for people receiving clozapine, to prevent the rare but potentially fatal outcome of agranulocytosis, and many other potential adverse reactions are also challenging for clinical management. Some of these reactions, including paralytic ileus and seizures, can be life-threatening and are associated with clozapine metabolism, a complex interplay of biological processes that can also have a role in treatment outcomes. To balance efficacy and the adverse drug reaction risks, guidelines recommend to prescribe clozapine maintenance doses that lead to plasma concentrations of 350–600 ng/mL, which is sometimes referred to as the therapeutic range. However, without regular assessments of clozapine pharmacokinetics (a framework known as therapeutic drug monitoring), the large inter-individual variability in clozapine metabolism makes optimal prescription of safe and efficacious doses of clozapine a trial-and-error exercise. This uncertainty persists even after accounting for robust predictors of drug metabolism (eg, smoking, co-medications, and bodyweight), which can explain up to 50% of the variance in clozapine plasma concentrations in retrospective studies.

### Establishing the characteristics of an effective pharmacogenetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^774c97c2]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have established a framework for assessing the utility of a genetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and explored the characteristics of tests that would reduce agranulocytosis risk to a level that does not require regular haematological monitoring. In particular, we show that high sensitivity is essential and that a small proportion of patients classified as HR further decreases the agranulocytosis risk in the LR group.

High sensitivity is a self-evident characteristic of a clinically useful test, but the finding that a small HR group is favourable might seem counterintuitive. One could reason that to be sure the LR group contains no agranulocytosis cases, the HR group should include all patients who are at the slightest risk of developing agranulocytosis, and that the HR group should thus be large. However, as the number of true agranulocytosis cases is very low, a large HR group would mainly contain false-positive patients. Instead of a large HR group, a useful test relies on high sensitivity to correctly classify the agranulocytosis cases as HR. A small HR group implies few false positives and many true negatives, which in turn minimizes the agranulocytosis risk in the LR group.

### Clozapine [^94c3881b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- **QT Interval Prolongation**: Advise patients to consult their clinician immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness or have signs or symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia. Instruct patients to not take clozapine with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation. Instruct patients to inform their clinicians that they are taking clozapine before any new drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- Metabolic Changes (hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain): Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patients and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginning treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance**: Because clozapine may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)].

### There is life after the UK clozapine central non-rechallenge database [^e9511061]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

In the United Kingdom, patients on clozapine whose hematological parameters fall below certain thresholds are placed on the Central Non-Rechallenge Database (CNRD), meaning that they cannot be prescribed clozapine again except under exceptional circumstances. This practice was discontinued in the United States in 2015 by expanding the hematological monitoring guidelines, allowing more patients to receive clozapine. Our objective was to investigate the implications this policy change would have on clozapine utilization in the United Kingdom.

Methods

This was an observational, retrospective analysis of patients registered on the CNRD in a large mental health trust. The first objective was to compare the number of patients placed on the CNRD under the United Kingdom and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria. The second objective was to explore the hematological and clinical outcomes of CNRD patients. The third objective was to investigate the hematological outcomes of patients rechallenged on clozapine after nonrechallengeable status.

Results

One hundred and fifteen patients were placed on CNRD from 2002 to 2019, of whom 7 (6%) met the equivalent criteria for clozapine discontinuation under the FDA guidelines. Clinical outcomes, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale, were worse 3 months after clozapine cessation than on clozapine (t = -7.4862; P < .001). Sixty-two (54%) patients placed on CNRD were rechallenged. Fifty-nine of those (95%) were successfully rechallenged; 3 patients were placed back on CNRD, only one of which would have had to stop clozapine again under FDA criteria.

Conclusion

Implementation of the updated FDA's monitoring criteria in the United Kingdom would significantly reduce clozapine discontinuation due to hematological reasons. The evidence suggests an urgent need for revising the UK clozapine monitoring guidelines to improve outcomes in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^56b53f6e]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine was the first drug found to possess antipsychotic action without causing extrapyramidal effects. It eventually gained product registration and was marketed in Europe the early 1970s. Clozapine's association with agranulocytosis was first reported in 1975 when Finnish authorities described eight cases occurring in around 2000 patients prescribed clozapine(an incidence of approximately 0.4%). Outside Finland, the risk of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis at that time was estimated to be 0.027%. A later and more complete analysis of the cases occurring in Finland suggested that there were "17 cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis amongst about 3000 patients treated". In fact, there had been ten cases of agranulocytosis (seven of which were fatal) — an incidence of agranulocytosis of 0.33%. Clozapine was withdrawn worldwide and later reintroduced with strict haematological monitoring.

The initial association detected was with fatal or near fatal agranulocytosis. However, the introduction of mandatory haematological monitoring for clozapine suggested that clozapine was associated with both agranulocytosis (defined, in respect to clozapine use, as neutrophils < 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and neutropenia (usually defined as a neutrophil count of < 1.5 × 10⁹/L; sometimes < 2 × 10⁹/L). In patients registered on formal clozapine monitoring schemes, the incidence of neutropenia has been reported to range from 2.5to 5.5%and the incidence of agranulocytosis from 0%, to as much as 1%. Clozapine remains underutilised because of the fear of both neutropenia and agranulocytosis and because of the burden imposed by regular blood testing.

### Information on clozapine… [^52a50961]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Latest Update February 24, 2025
- Beginning today, FDA does not expect prescribers, pharmacies, and patients to participate in the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies program for clozapine or to report results of absolute neutrophil count blood tests before pharmacies dispense clozapine. FDA still recommends that prescribers monitor patients' ANC according to the monitoring frequencies described in the prescribing information. Information about severe neutropenia will remain in the prescribing information for all clozapine medicines, including in the existing Boxed Warnings. Past Updates on Clozapine Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Advisory Committee Meeting 2024. As part of this reevaluation, FDA has funded a study by Brigham and Women's Hospital that includes an analysis of clozapine utilization, adherence to the REMS requirement for monitoring of absolute neutrophil count, and clinical outcomes.

In addition, FDA is conducting a study in collaboration with the Veterans Health Administration to better understand the incidence and severity of neutropenia in patients taking clozapine, and the Agency is conducting a study using the Sentinel System to better understand adherence to the monitoring requirements. While clozapine is beneficial for some patients, there are risks associated with this drug. Specifically, clozapine can decrease the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, that function in the body to fight off infections. When neutrophils are significantly decreased, severe neutropenia may result and the body may become prone to infections. For this reason, patients taking clozapine need to have their absolute neutrophil count monitored on a regular basis. This monitoring requirement serves as the basis for the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.

Clozapine REMS Program The Clozapine REMS Programwas approved in September 2015 and is a "shared-system" program, meaning that it includes all clozapine medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The Clozapine REMS Program ensures optimal patient monitoring for and management of clozapine-induced severe neutropenia, providing a centralized system for prescribers and pharmacists in managing patient risk, regardless of which clozapine product is being used. Prior to the approval of the Clozapine REMS Program, individual clozapine manufacturers operated separate patient registries.
