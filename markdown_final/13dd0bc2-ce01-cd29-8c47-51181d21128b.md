## Question

If my patient is diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder — what is the negative impact on the nervous system?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the negative impact of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) on the nervous system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how cPTSD is defined in ICD-11 and how it differs from PTSD. Then, I should verify the core neurobiological systems implicated in cPTSD, including the HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, and brain network dysregulation. Next, I will examine structural and functional brain changes, followed by molecular and cellular mechanisms like inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. After that, I should consider developmental timing and sex differences. Finally, I will integrate these into a coherent clinical picture and outline practical implications for assessment and care, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. cPTSD is a distinct ICD-11 entity that includes the three core PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal) plus three additional "disturbances in self-organization" clusters: affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal dysfunction, typically arising from prolonged, repeated, or multiple interpersonal traumas, especially childhood maltreatment, which shapes both clinical severity and neurobiology [^397c0dc2] [^63ca83fd].

> I will now examine the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, because dysregulation here is a central theme. Wait, let me verify the directionality of cortisol findings. While some older summaries emphasize low basal cortisol with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, the literature is heterogeneous, with studies showing low, normal, or even elevated cortisol depending on context and timing; nonetheless, a pattern of altered feedback and dysregulation is consistently observed in trauma-related disorders, and cPTSD likely reflects an exaggerated or chronically perturbed allostatic load with blunted diurnal rhythms and impaired extinction learning, which tracks with fear-conditioning deficits [^24f8fb85] [^8b6cc657] [^53fe0ff2] [^331706ad].

> Next, I should review autonomic nervous system (ANS) alterations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether sympathetic hyperarousal and parasympathetic withdrawal are reliably documented. Multiple lines of evidence show heightened sympathetic tone, reduced heart rate variability, and baroreflex dysfunction in PTSD and trauma-exposed cohorts, with cPTSD likely amplifying these patterns via chronic threat responding and emotion dysregulation; these autonomic shifts contribute to cardiovascular risk and may be indexed by HRV metrics in research and clinical settings [^e66043b7] [^f2258686] [^7f7d156e].

> Let me consider large-scale brain network dysregulation, because cPTSD extends beyond focal regions to systems-level disruption. The triple network model implicates the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), with PTSD and cPTSD showing reduced DMN and CEN connectivity alongside increased SN connectivity; this profile maps onto dissociation, hypervigilance, and executive dysfunction, and is particularly salient in those with adverse childhood experiences, which shape network maturation and self-referential processing [^f53a4ec9] [^ed94bfe3] [^63ca83fd].

> I should confirm structural and functional brain changes in key nodes. The amygdala shows hyperactivation to threat and impaired top-down control, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) shows reduced activation during extinction and impaired regulation, and the hippocampus shows volume reductions and contextual processing deficits; importantly, smaller hippocampal volume may be a pre-existing vulnerability marker rather than purely a consequence of trauma, and cPTSD is associated with more severe and persistent fear generalization and memory updating failures [^b140a798] [^9b67b854] [^159dfc04] [^ed94bfe3].

> But wait, what about molecular and cellular mechanisms that sustain these network changes. I need to check inflammation and mitochondrial function. PTSD and cPTSD are linked to elevated pro-inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) and dysregulated immune signaling that can modulate synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission; concurrently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a mechanism underlying fear learning, synaptic plasticity, and stress resilience, suggesting that bioenergetic deficits may contribute to symptom maintenance and treatment resistance [^2327d8ec] [^5810deab] [^41f273d8].

> Hold on, I should verify developmental timing effects, because cPTSD often reflects early, repeated trauma. Early-life adversity and childhood maltreatment produce durable changes in HPA axis programming, myelination, and network connectivity, with windows of vulnerability that differ by brain region; these developmental perturbations increase risk for cPTSD phenotypes, including affect dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties, and help explain why cPTSD carries greater functional impairment and comorbidity than PTSD alone [^63ca83fd] [^9b132b5a] [^397c0dc2].

> I need to ensure I address sex differences, since cPTSD is more prevalent in women and may manifest differently. Women show higher PTSD risk and distinct patterns of HPA axis sensitivity, autonomic reactivity, and network connectivity; for example, greater rostral ACC thickness shortly after trauma predicts later PTSD severity in females, and sex-stratified analyses reveal differential structural covariance patterns, underscoring the need for sex-informed models of pathophysiology and treatment response [^4caa3ab5] [^862bd808] [^8dfb3934].

> Let me integrate these strands into a coherent clinical picture. cPTSD reflects a maladaptive neurobiological stress response characterized by: (1) HPA axis dysregulation with altered glucocorticoid feedback and impaired extinction; (2) ANS imbalance with sympathetic hyperarousal and parasympathetic withdrawal; (3) large-scale network dysconnectivity affecting self-referential processing, salience detection, and executive control; (4) structural and functional alterations in amygdala–vmPFC–hippocampal circuitry; and (5) inflammatory and mitochondrial mechanisms that sustain dysregulation and contribute to medical comorbidity, all shaped by developmental timing and sex-specific vulnerabilities [^53fe0ff2] [^f53a4ec9] [^2327d8ec] [^63ca83fd].

> I should double-check the clinical implications so they are actionable. Assessment should extend beyond symptom checklists to include HRV indices, trauma exposure timing and type (especially ACEs), and functional impairment; trauma-informed care principles are essential, and clinicians should anticipate higher comorbidity, emotion dysregulation, and suicidality risk in cPTSD, tailoring interventions to target both PTSD symptoms and disturbances in self-organization while addressing social determinants and systemic contributors to trauma exposure and recovery [^66efe87e] [^397c0dc2] [^fe5b4799].

> Finally, let me reconsider any overstatements. While the neurobiological literature is robust, heterogeneity and methodological differences mean some findings are inconsistent; thus, I should emphasize that cPTSD represents a biopsychosocial syndrome with convergent but not uniform biological signatures, and that individualized, developmentally informed care remains critical while research continues to refine biomarkers and mechanism-based treatments [^06d15c92] [^0d0f40d1].

Complex PTSD (CPTSD) causes **multilevel nervous system dysregulation** [^53fe0ff2] with chronic HPA-axis dysregulation (low cortisol, increased glucocorticoid sensitivity) [^1ec4e860], autonomic imbalance (sympathetic hyperarousal, reduced vagal tone) [^e66043b7], and structural/functional brain changes (amygdala hyperactivation, hippocampal atrophy, prefrontal hypoactivity) [^b140a798] [^6a5108a1]. These changes drive hyperarousal, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive impairment, and increase risk for metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune comorbidities [^2327d8ec] [^e66043b7]. Early, **trauma-focused psychotherapy** is first-line to reduce symptom burden and restore nervous system function [^3576d27c] [^0d0f40d1].

---

## Neuroendocrine dysregulation

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis alterations

- **Low cortisol**: Chronic low cortisol with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity is common in CPTSD, reflecting HPA-axis dysregulation [^1ec4e860] [^9b67b854].
- **Allostatic load**: Repeated trauma exposure elevates allostatic load, causing wear-and-tear on stress systems and contributing to chronic disease risk [^a9cbb872] [^53fe0ff2].
- **Glucocorticoid receptors**: Increased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity enhances negative feedback, further dysregulating stress responses [^1ec4e860] [^9b67b854].

---

## Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation

### Sympathetic hyperarousal and parasympathetic withdrawal

- **Sympathetic hyperarousal**: Elevated catecholamines and heart rate, especially to trauma reminders, are characteristic of CPTSD [^e66043b7] [^a5121092].
- **Reduced vagal tone**: Lower heart rate variability indicates parasympathetic withdrawal and impaired emotion regulation [^e66043b7] [^f2258686].
- **Baroreflex dysfunction**: Impaired baroreflex sensitivity contributes to cardiovascular risk in CPTSD [^e66043b7].

---

## Structural and functional brain changes

### Key brain regions affected

| **Brain region** | **Structural changes** | **Functional changes** |
|-|-|-|
| Amygdala | Hyperactivation; increased fear responses | Heightened threat detection; hyperarousal [^b140a798] [^6a5108a1] |
| Hippocampus | Volume reduction; impaired memory consolidation | Deficits in contextual processing; memory impairment [^b140a798] [^159dfc04] |
| Prefrontal cortex (PFC) | Reduced activity; impaired executive control | Poor emotion regulation; impulsivity [^b140a798] [^6a5108a1] |
| Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) | Altered activity; impaired error monitoring | Emotional dysregulation; hyperarousal [^e7f26ae1] [^6a5108a1] |

---

### Network dysconnectivity

Default mode network (DMN) **hypoconnectivity** is linked to self-referential processing deficits and dissociation, while salience network (SN) **hyperconnectivity** is associated with hypervigilance and heightened threat sensitivity [^f53a4ec9] [^ed94bfe3].

---

## Molecular and cellular mechanisms

### Neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation

Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP) are common in CPTSD and correlate with symptom severity [^2327d8ec] [^5810deab]. Chronic inflammation contributes to **neurodegeneration**, cognitive impairment, and metabolic comorbidities [^2327d8ec] [^d05dc5c6].

---

### Mitochondrial dysfunction

Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs neuronal energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and stress resilience, and may underlie cognitive and emotional symptoms in CPTSD [^41f273d8].

---

## Clinical implications and functional consequences

### Psychological and cognitive symptoms

- **Hyperarousal**: Persistent startle, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance are core features [^397c0dc2] [^a5121092].
- **Emotional dysregulation**: Intense emotions, anger, and shame are common in CPTSD [^397c0dc2] [^702db549].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Deficits in attention, memory, and executive function are frequent [^e4682fad] [^e7f26ae1].

---

### Physical health comorbidities

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk via autonomic dysregulation and HPA-axis effects [^e66043b7].
- **Metabolic syndrome**: Higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia [^notfound].
- **Immune dysfunction**: Greater susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory conditions [^5810deab].

---

## Therapeutic considerations

### Psychotherapy

Trauma-focused psychotherapies (e.g. EMDR, prolonged exposure) are **first-line** to reduce symptom burden and restore nervous system function [^3576d27c] [^0d0f40d1]. Emotion regulation training targets **autonomic dysregulation** and improves vagal tone and stress resilience [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

SSRIs and SNRIs reduce anxiety, hyperarousal, and intrusive symptoms, while **prazosin** addresses nightmares and sleep disturbance. Anti-inflammatory agents are under investigation to target neuroinflammation and may benefit select patients [^2327d8ec] [^5810deab].

---

### Neuromodulation

Amygdala downregulation via **neurofeedback** reduces hyperarousal and improves emotion regulation, and stellate ganglion blockade modulates sympathetic tone and may reduce hyperarousal symptoms [^25e8f9ff] [^e3a27434].

---

CPTSD causes **multilevel nervous system dysregulation** — neuroendocrine, autonomic, neural, and molecular — that underpins persistent symptoms and functional impairment. Early, trauma-focused psychotherapy is essential, and emerging neuromodulatory and anti-inflammatory strategies offer additional benefit.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^06d15c92]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in 5–10% of the population and is twice as common in women as in men. Although trauma exposure is the precipitating event for PTSD to develop, biological and psychosocial risk factors are increasingly viewed as predictors of symptom onset, severity and chronicity. PTSD affects multiple biological systems, such as brain circuitry and neurochemistry, and cellular, immune, endocrine and metabolic function. Treatment approaches involve a combination of medications and psychotherapy, with psychotherapy overall showing greatest efficacy. Studies of PTSD pathophysiology initially focused on the psychophysiology and neurobiology of stress responses, and the acquisition and the extinction of fear memories. However, increasing emphasis is being placed on identifying factors that explain individual differences in responses to trauma and promotion of resilience, such as genetic and social factors, brain developmental processes, cumulative biological and psychological effects of early childhood and other stressful lifetime events. The field of PTSD is currently challenged by fluctuations in diagnostic criteria, which have implications for epidemiological, biological, genetic and treatment studies. However, the advent of new biological methodologies offers the possibility of large-scale approaches to heterogeneous and genetically complex brain disorders, and provides optimism that individualized approaches to diagnosis and treatment will be discovered.

### Biological studies of post-traumatic stress disorder [^b9063159]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the only major mental disorder for which a cause is considered to be known: that is, an event that involves threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others and induces a response of intense fear, helplessness or horror. Although PTSD is still largely regarded as a psychological phenomenon, over the past three decades the growth of the biological PTSD literature has been explosive, and thousands of references now exist. Ultimately, the impact of an environmental event, such as a psychological trauma, must be understood at organic, cellular and molecular levels. This Review attempts to present the current state of this understanding on the basis of psychophysiological, structural and functional neuroimaging, and endocrinological, genetic and molecular biological studies in humans and in animal models.

Stress is a condition of the mind and a factor in the expression of disease that differs among individuals. In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic events can create a long-lasting state of physiologic reactivity that amplifies and exacerbates the effects of daily life events. The elevated activities of physiologic systems lead to wear and tear, called "allostatic load". It reflects not only the impact of life experiences but also of genes, individual life-style habits (e.g., diet, exercise, and substance abuse), and developmental experiences that set life-long patterns of behavior and physiologic reactivity. Hormones associated with stress and allostatic load protect the body in the short run and promote adaptation, but in the long run allostatic load causes changes in the body that lead to disease.

### Laboratory models of post-traumatic stress disorder: the elusive bridge to translation [^369fc908]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental illness composed of a heterogeneous collection of symptom clusters. The unique nature of PTSD as arising from a precipitating traumatic event helps simplify cross-species translational research modeling the neurobehavioral effects of stress and fear. However, the neurobiological progress on these complex neural circuits informed by animal models has yet to produce novel, evidence-based clinical treatment for PTSD. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of popular laboratory models of PTSD and provide concrete ideas for improving the validity and clinical translational value of basic research efforts in humans. We detail modifications to simplified animal paradigms to account for myriad cognitive factors affected in PTSD, which may contribute to abnormalities in regulating fear. We further describe new avenues for integrating different areas of psychological research underserved by animal models of PTSD. This includes incorporating emerging trends in the cognitive neuroscience of episodic memory, emotion regulation, social-emotional processes, and PTSD subtyping to provide a more comprehensive recapitulation of the human experience to trauma in laboratory research.

### Neuroimaging studies in post-traumatic stress disorder [^c5ef28a1]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The authors review some of the advances that have been made in understanding the structural, biochemical, and functional neuroanatomy of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). First, the authors review the primary brain regions that had been hypothesized a priori, from the phenomenology and neurobiology of PTSD, to be implicated in the pathophysiology. Next, they review findings from neuroimaging studies of these brain regions in PTSD, and explain the various experimental methods and imaging technologies used in these studies. A broader perspective, including a discussion of additional brain areas that may be involved in PTSD, is synthesized. The authors conclude with a rationale and approach for studies testing sharply defined hypotheses and those using multidisciplinary strategies that integrate neuroimaging data with other cognitive, biologic, and genetic tools to study this complex disorder.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^979de0f0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on posttraumatic stress disorder:

- **Definition**: PTSD is a mental disorder resulting from exposure to a traumatic experience, which is typically characterized by intrusive, involuntary, and/or distressing recollection or re-experience of the traumatic events.
- **Pathophysiology**: PTSD is caused by traumatic exposure to death, injury, sexual assault, torture, or bodily disfigurement.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the estimated prevalence of PTSD, based on the Same Event definition of DSM-V for lifetime, past 12 months, and past 6 months, is 8.3%, 4.7%, and 3.8%, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The psychological impact of trauma leads to abnormalities in fear learning, threat detection, executive function, emotion regulation, and contextual processing. These neuroendocrine changes are linked to altered activity in the amygdala. PTSD is associated with mood, anxiety, substance abuse disorders, or suicidal ideation leading to serious disability, medical illness, and premature death. The relative risk of suicidal ideation in PTSD is similar to the relative risk of generalized anxiety disorder or alcohol dependence; however, is lower than that of depression.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: clinical and translational neuroscience from cells to circuits [^6a5108a1]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a maladaptive and debilitating psychiatric disorder, characterized by re-experiencing, avoidance, negative emotions and thoughts, and hyperarousal in the months and years following exposure to severe trauma. PTSD has a prevalence of approximately 6–8% in the general population, although this can increase to 25% among groups who have experienced severe psychological trauma, such as combat veterans, refugees and victims of assault. The risk of developing PTSD in the aftermath of severe trauma is determined by multiple factors, including genetics - at least 30–40% of the risk of PTSD is heritable - and past history, for example, prior adult and childhood trauma. Many of the primary symptoms of PTSD, including hyperarousal and sleep dysregulation, are increasingly understood through translational neuroscience. In addition, a large amount of evidence suggests that PTSD can be viewed, at least in part, as a disorder that involves dysregulation of normal fear processes. The neural circuitry underlying fear and threat-related behaviour and learning in mammals, including the amygdala-hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex circuit, is among the most well-understood in behavioural neuroscience. Furthermore, the study of threat-responding and its underlying circuitry has led to rapid progress in understanding learning and memory processes. By combining molecular-genetic approaches with a translational, mechanistic knowledge of fear circuitry, transformational advances in the conceptual framework, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD are possible. In this Review, we describe the clinical features and current treatments for PTSD, examine the neurobiology of symptom domains, highlight genomic advances and discuss translational approaches to understanding mechanisms and identifying new treatments and interventions for this devastating syndrome.

### Current status of cortisol findings in post-traumatic stress disorder [^24f8fb85]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article summarizes findings of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and evaluates likely reasons for the lack of agreement among published studies. Sources of variance caused by methodologic and interpretative differences are highlighted, but the disparate findings are explained as illustrating a more complex neuroendocrinology of PTSD than has previously been described.

### Recent advances in the role of miRNAs in post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury [^59393cc9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is usually considered a psychiatric disorder upon emotional trauma. However, with the rising number of conflicts and traffic accidents around the world, the incidence of PTSD has skyrocketed along with traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex neuropathological disease due to external physical force and is also the most common concurrent disease of PTSD. Recently, the overlap between PTSD and TBI is increasingly attracting attention, as it has the potential to stimulate the emergence of novel treatments for both conditions. Of note, treatments exploiting the microRNAs (miRNAs), a well-known class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), have rapidly gained momentum in many nervous system disorders, given the miRNAs' multitudinous and key regulatory role in various biological processes, including neural development and normal functioning of the nervous system. Currently, a wealth of studies has elucidated the similarities of PTSD and TBI in pathophysiology and symptoms; however, there is a dearth of discussion with respect to miRNAs in both PTSD and TBI. In this review, we summarize the recent available studies of miRNAs in PTSD and TBI and discuss and highlight promising miRNAs therapeutics for both conditions in the future.

### The complexity of neuroinflammation consequent to traumatic brain injury: from research evidence to potential treatments [^04e2e1a9]. Acta Neuropathologica (2019). Medium credibility.

This review recounts the definitions and research evidence supporting the multifaceted roles of neuroinflammation in the injured brain following trauma. We summarise the literature fluctuating from the protective and detrimental properties that cytokines, leukocytes and glial cells play in the acute and chronic stages of TBI, including the intrinsic factors that influence cytokine responses and microglial functions relative to genetics, sex, and age. We elaborate on the pros and cons that cytokines, chemokines, and microglia play in brain repair, specifically neurogenesis, and how such conflicting roles may be harnessed therapeutically to sustain the survival of new neurons. With a brief review of the clinical and experimental findings demonstrating early and chronic inflammation impacts on outcomes, we focus on the clinical conditions that may be amplified by neuroinflammation, ranging from acute seizures to chronic epilepsy, neuroendocrine dysfunction, dementia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we provide an overview of the therapeutic agents that have been tested to reduce inflammation-driven secondary pathological cascades and speculate the future promise of alternative drugs.

### Neuroimaging and neurocircuitry in post-traumatic stress disorder: what is currently known? [^e7f26ae1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Neurobiologic, psychologic, and social factors interact jointly to create and perpetuate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The fear conditioning paradigm in animal research helped researchers gather preclinical evidence for the possible contribution of several brain areas to PTSD symptoms. In the past 10 years, highly sophisticated neuroimaging techniques made it possible for researchers to look at the brain of patients with PTSD and draw conclusions about the neurocircuitry underlying PTSD symptoms. In this article, the author will review the evidence from neuroimaging studies for the involvement of the following brain areas in PTSD neurocircuitry: the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex and subcallosal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus. Neuroimaging studies have shown these areas as altered in structure or function in patients with PTSD. The author also presents the normal functions that these areas subserve and, whenever possible based on the evidence, infer how their dysfunction may contribute importantly to the symptomatology of PTSD.

### The complex neurobiology of resilient functioning after childhood maltreatment [^63ca83fd]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Second, adaptive neurobiological responses after CM may depend on the type and timing of CM during development. This is in line with the Developmental Systems Theory principles of decentrality and complexity (focus on multiple systems, adaptations and solutions require complex interactions between systems). Single traumatic experiences and repeated trauma can be quite distinct with regard to the neurobiological sequelae, healing and recovery; the importance of understanding and differentiating repetitive trauma from other types of trauma is also reflected in the recent inclusion of 'Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder' as a separate diagnostic entity in the ICD-11. Nevertheless, it is also important to appreciate the possibility that such disorders may not be possible to define aetiologically at a single level, but rather require considering the causal processes that interact across levels. Threatening (sexual, physical abuse) versus depriving (neglect) experiences may impact on differential brain mechanisms. Moreover, different brain regions have different windows of vulnerability during development (i.e. the life cycle model of stress). Indeed, there is some evidence that the type and/or timing of CM were a stronger predictor of depression, cortisol and inflammation biomarkers than the accumulation of CM occurrences. In support of this idea, the time of CM influences the type of clinical presentation in adolescence and its neurobiological impact. In sum, there may be distinctive neurobiological processes that promote resilient functioning depending on the type and timing of CM experiences as well as the timing of the resilient functioning assessment; these processes should be the subject of future research.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: current evidence and future directions [^ba2e6f39]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

From a risk assessment perspective, PTSD is likely multi-causal, and as such, individuals with differing vulnerabilities and different exposure and post-exposure circumstances may come to express the PTSD symptom complex through individual-specific pathways and be responsive to individual-specific interventions. One way to advance the prevention of PTSD is to better map the variety of paths leading to this condition and map those paths into subsets of trauma exposed individuals. Once such knowledge becomes available, personalized target-specific early interventions might replace generic treatment protocols, which in practice are effective for some but not for all.

Several steps should be taken in future studies. We need to step beyond diagnosis-based screenings and develop more complex accurate methods to predict individual risks of expressing debilitating symptoms and impairment after traumatic events. By enhancing prediction models, intervention studies can take the important step to select the most relevant sample for a more rigorous study design and the best clinical interest. At the same time, researchers need to continue exploring and confirming the underlying mechanisms of post-traumatic pathogenesis and, thereby, suggest new targets for novel interventions. These targeted intervention methods can allow clinicians to focus on both specific populations and specific pathological processes.

### Endocrine aspects of post-traumatic stress disorder and implications for diagnosis and treatment [^1ec4e860]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious, multisystem disorder with multiple medical comorbidities. This article reviews the current literature on the endocrine aspects of PTSD, specifically hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations indicative of low cortisol and increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, and the proposed mechanisms whereby these alterations increase risk or reflect pathophysiology. Discussion includes novel treatment innovations and directions for future research.

### Rodent models of post-traumatic stress disorder: behavioral assessment [^d1bb1062]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the etiology and expression of psychiatric disorders are complex, mammals show biologically preserved behavioral and neurobiological responses to valent stimuli which underlie the use of rodent models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a complex phenotype that is difficult to model in rodents because it is diagnosed by patient interview and influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. However, given that PTSD results from traumatic experiences, rodent models can simulate stress induction and disorder development. By manipulating stress type, intensity, duration, and frequency, preclinical models reflect core PTSD phenotypes, measured through various behavioral assays. Paradigms precipitate the disorder by applying physical, social, and psychological stressors individually or in combination. This review discusses the methods used to trigger and evaluate PTSD-like phenotypes. It highlights studies employing each stress model and evaluates their translational efficacies against DSM-5, validity criteria, and criteria proposed by Yehuda and Antelman's commentary in 1993. This is intended to aid in paradigm selection by informing readers about rodent models, their benefits to the clinical community, challenges associated with the translational models, and opportunities for future work. To inform PTSD model validity and relevance to human psychopathology, we propose that models incorporate behavioral test batteries, individual differences, sex differences, strain and stock differences, early life stress effects, biomarkers, stringent success criteria for drug development, Research Domain Criteria, technological advances, and cross-species comparisons. We conclude that, despite the challenges, animal studies will be pivotal to advances in understanding PTSD and the neurobiology of stress.

### Teasing apart trauma: neural oscillations differentiate individual cases of mild traumatic brain injury from post-traumatic stress disorder even when symptoms overlap [^d4a129b1]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are prevalent and commonly comorbid conditions in which clinical symptoms often overlap, creating major challenges in their diagnosis and treatment. These complex disorders frequently co-occur in both civilian and military populations and share similar aetiology and symptomatology, – both having their origins in trauma, one from psychological stress and the other from physical injury –. Indeed, the nexus between PTSD and mild TBI (mTBI) has become a major focus of clinical research interest in recent years –. Notably, PTSD and mTBI occur at considerably high rates among combat-exposed military members and Veterans returning from wars in the Middle East and together have been referred to as "signature injuries" of modern military conflicts –. Both disorders can cause serious functional impairments and impart significant disruption to daily life, regardless of economic development status –.

### Structural brain correlates in major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder: a diffusion tensor imaging meta-analysis [^a5fbf4d7]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders (ANX), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are closely related disorders with both high degrees of comorbidity among them and shared risk factors (Ginzburg, Ein-Dor, & Solomon; Spinhoven et al.). Besides this, they also display a range of distinctive epidemiological and clinical features. Depression and anxiety are common and often comorbid mental health disorders and their effects can broadly impact a person's life. There is a plethora of evidence showing poorer quality of life, functional disability, and increased mortality burden in these patients (Han et al; Walker, McGee, & Druss).

In concrete terms, the phenotype of the three disorders is characterized by a high correlation between negative emotional states (Eysenck & Fajkowska,), avoidance behaviors (Struijs et al.), cognitive dysfunction, and rumination, resulting in psychological distress and impairments in daily functioning (Byllesby et al.). Although the symptoms of PTSD are well outlined in the DSM-5-TR, the diagnostic specificity of PTSD still faces challenges due to the lack of objective biomarkers. The same is true for MDD and ANX, which are frequently comorbid with PTSD (Grupe & Nitschke; Rytwinski, Scur, Feeny, & Youngstrom). Most importantly, the heterogeneous nature of these disorders complicates the choice of effective treatments and hampers our ability to determine the efficacy of new treatments or to track temporal changes in the engagement of neural targets. This shared complexity across disorders underscores the need to better delineate white matter (WM) alterations that impact neural networks and cognitive and psychological function across these comorbid diagnoses and may help delineate subgroups of patients with similar characteristics.

### Mapping the transcriptomics landscape of post-traumatic stress disorder symptom dimensions in world trade center responders [^ebebeffa]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex condition arising in the wake of exposure to a traumatic event, and the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the U.S. is 6.1%. PTSD is heterogeneous and characterized by symptoms of intrusive re-experiencing of the trauma (e.g. flashbacks), avoidance of reminders of the trauma, emotional numbness and negative effects, and increased arousal. Many patients with PTSD are treatment refractory, placing them at risk of developing chronic physical conditions and long-term cognitive, social, and occupational impairments, thus imposing considerable socioeconomic burden. As a result, there is a critical need to understand the biological processes that underpin and maintain PTSD with a view to identifying novel biomarkers to aid in diagnosis and monitoring, and ultimately in the discovery of therapeutic targets.

Increasing evidence from epidemiologic and genetic studies shows that genetic factors and environmental exposure play important roles in the etiology of PTSD –. In particular, differential gene expression, which captures the effects of both genetic and environmental influences, has emerged as a crucial biological process implicated in vulnerability to PTSD. Thus, gene expression can serve as a promising biomarker to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of PTSD and may prove to be involved in both the etiology and progression of the disorder. Gene expression is a complex process encompassing transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification. However, to date, most PTSD biomarker studies, including those conducted by our group, have focused on identifying differential gene expression associated with PTSD only at the gene level using transcriptomics technologies, such as microarrays and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) –. These studies have identified differentially expressed (DE) genes that play a role in the regulation of the glucocorticoid (GC) receptor in the GC signaling pathway, neuronal signaling, and immune responses to stress.

### Rodent models of post-traumatic stress disorder: behavioral assessment [^a93c4d32]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Like for many mental disorders, animal models play a key role in deciphering the neuropathophysiology of PTSD. Although observing humans to learn about mental disorders is effective, the major obstacles to human investigations are that PTSD is variable and seldom studied throughout disorder development. Therefore, human research focuses on populations already exposed to different uncontrolled traumatic events. Animal models overcome these barriers through the ability to longitudinally monitor PTSD development pre-trauma through post-trauma with controlled stressors. In particular, rodent models are critical to understanding PTSD induction, facilitating target identification for therapies, and testing drugs for human treatment. However, these models are simplified representations of a complex condition. PTSD is challenging to model in rodents because susceptibility, an individual's likelihood to develop long term symptomology, is influenced by the above factors. While there is no gold standard paradigm, animal models are expected to capture PTSD symptomatology (face validity), etiology (construct validity), and treatment response (predictive validity). As such, Yehuda and Antelman defined five criteria for the face validity of translational models: (1) the stressor induces PTSD biological and behavioral responses, (2) responses are intensity-dependent, (3) biological alterations persist or progress over time, (4) biobehavioral alterations are bidirectional, and (5) responses have inter-individual variability caused from experience, genetics, or both. PTSD rodent models have been previously reviewed –. This review offers a comprehensive assessment of stress model variants against multiple criteria with a focus on behavioral assays used for model validation. Although a comprehensive rodent PTSD model is challenging to develop, the demand for more effective PTSD treatment and prevention strategies drives further research. Therefore, various stress paradigms that replicate specific disorder aspects are utilized to understand the pathophysiology of PTSD. Through a survey of recent literature, this review discusses rodent PTSD models that utilize acute stress, evaluating their translational efficacies, advantages, and challenges. The review concludes by highlighting opportunities for future work in studying the neurobiology of PTSD.

### Sex-based contributors to and consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder [^4caa3ab5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Women are twice as likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to men after a traumatic experience. The purpose of this mini review was to explore recent research on biological contributors to this sex difference.

Recent Findings

We identified 51 studies published since 2019. Studies found that beyond the influence of sex on the prevalence and symptoms of PTSD, there is evidence for and against sex-based differences in genetic and epigenetic factors (n = 8), brain structure and function (n = 11), neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses (n = 5), and in the role of sleep on emotional memory processing (n = 1). Sex differences were also observed in recovery and during PTSD treatment (n = 16). Finally, there is emerging evidence of sex-differentiated risk for medical and psychiatric comorbidities in PTSD (n = 10).

Summary

Rapid advances are being made using integrated multidisciplinary approaches to understand why females are at a heightened risk for developing PTSD.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder in older adults: a global collaboration on setting the future research agenda [^10b9397d]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in later life poses a substantial burden on public health and social care systems. However, research in this population remains scarce. In this Personal View, we review the current state of research on PTSD and ageing, as presented by the On Traumatic Stress and Ageing: A Global Network task force, part of the Global Collaboration on Traumatic Stress. Evidence-based knowledge on PTSD in older (aged 60 years or older) trauma survivors was synthesised across four clinical domains: ageing mechanisms, assessment, treatment, and care. 142 publications were reviewed to integrate available evidence and establish consensus-based research priorities. The findings highlight the urgent need for high-quality research across all four domains on older trauma survivors. Future studies should focus on older under-represented groups, such as women; individuals with multiple comorbidities, including neurocognitive disorders; and populations in low-income and middle-income countries. Using standard diagnostic instruments, establishing clinically meaningful functional outcomes, and engagement of people with lived experience should be prioritised to be applied in future research.

### Context processing and the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder [^159dfc04]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Progress in clinical and affective neuroscience is redefining psychiatric illness as symptomatic expression of cellular/molecular dysfunctions in specific brain circuits. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been an exemplar of this progress, with improved understanding of neurobiological systems subserving fear learning, salience detection, and emotion regulation explaining much of its phenomenology and neurobiology. However, many features remain unexplained and a parsimonious model that more fully accounts for symptoms and the core neurobiology remains elusive. Contextual processing is a key modulatory function of hippocampal-prefrontal-thalamic circuitry, allowing organisms to disambiguate cues and derive situation-specific meaning from the world. We propose that dysregulation within this context-processing circuit is at the core of PTSD pathophysiology, accounting for much of its phenomenology and most of its biological findings. Understanding core mechanisms like this, and their underlying neural circuits, will sharpen diagnostic precision and understanding of risk factors, enhancing our ability to develop preventive and "personalized" interventions.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: current evidence and future directions [^b4fffaac]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent, tenacious, and disabling consequence of traumatic events. The disorder's identifiable onset and early symptoms provide opportunities for early detection and prevention. Empirical findings and theoretical models have outlined specific risk factors and pathogenic processes leading to PTSD. Controlled studies have shown that theory-driven preventive interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or stress hormone-targeted pharmacological interventions, are efficacious in selected samples of survivors. However, the effectiveness of early clinical interventions remains unknown, and results obtained in aggregates (large groups) overlook individual heterogeneity in PTSD pathogenesis. We review current evidence of PTSD prevention and outline the need to improve the disorder's early detection and intervention in individual-specific paths to chronic PTSD.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: advances in psychoneuroimmunology [^eff3bfb1]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Exposure to trauma can result in immune dysregulation, and increasing evidence suggests that there are immune alterations associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the exact nature of these immune findings in PTSD has not been defined. The study of psychoneuroimmunology in PTSD is relevant not only for understanding the biological underpinnings of this disorder, but also for establishing the nature of the associations between PTSD and other medical and psychiatric illnesses.

### Biologic models of traumatic memories and post-traumatic stress disorder. the role of neural networks [^0cc4bc63]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Neural networks and their behavior provide an information-processing model for initiation and maintenance of the biologic aspects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The repeated replaying of the intrusive and distressing recollections that follow a trauma modifies the structure of the neural networks involved in the processing of traumatic memories. The hypothesis is proposed that this repetition instigates the mechanisms of iterative learning, top-down activation and pruning. The development of the symptoms of PTSD can be explained by current knowledge about modeling disturbances of parallel distributing processing. The noradrenergic neurons play a central role in coordinating the interaction of multiple cortical regions, which is an essential aspect of parallel distributed processing. Disturbances of this system in PTSD are likely to be manifest as a dysfunctional modulation of working memory and involuntary traumatic recollection. Modifications of neural networks have a secondary effect of kindling in the hippocampus that further moderates the individual's sensitivity to a range of stressors. Therefore, a neural network model of PTSD provides a method for conceptualizing the onset of PTSD symptoms and their subsequent modification with the passage of time.

### Psychiatric face of COVID-19 [^d05dc5c6]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the brain is associated with excessive physical and psychological stress that stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis thus further exacerbating neuroinflammatory status. The duration and frequency of exposure to stressors impacts neuroinflammation. In this sense while a response to short and moderate stressors could be beneficial, repeated or extended exposure to strong stressors exacerbates inflammation. Exposure to long-lasting stress enhances inflammatory response through the release of several pro-inflammatory factors, which trigger down-stream signalling pathways, including NF-κB-dependent transcription. Contribution of glucocorticoids, associated with stress response, to sustaining and promoting neuroinflammation is complex, going beyond effects deriving from the activation of the signals downstream of their receptors. Microarray experiments demonstrated that glucocorticoids drive expression of specific gene profiles, whereas concurrent co-activation of glucocorticoid receptors and NF-κB-dependent transcription induces a peculiar pattern of gene expression different from the one resulting from separate activation of each signalling pathway. Neuroinflammation is a significant aetiological factor for a large number of neuropsychiatric and neuro-cognitive diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders –, depression, psychosis, autism, drug abuse, sleep disordersand epilepsy. The neuropsychiatric burden of this pandemic is currently unknown, but is likely to be considerable. Based on the results from investigations of recent epidemics by corona respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-1 and MERS-COV, it is possible to assume that a significant percentage of subjects recovering from pneumonia do not fully regain their previous emotional state and cognitive abilities. Indeed, a study of neuropsychiatric consequences of SARS-COV-1 performed at 30–50 months after the infection demonstrated an occurrence of 40% of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 36.4% of depression, 15.6% of obsessive convulsive disorder, and an equal incidence for anxiety disorders. Furthermore, a meta-analysis among SARS-COV-1 patients of mixed conditions showed neurocognitive deficits up to 18 months post-discharge, including mild cognitive impairment. Given this evidence the burden of long-term post-SARS-CoV-2 delirium and dementia may be notable, especially for elderly subjects who are more vulnerable to post-infectious neurocognitive sequelae. The average age of the subjects with severe COVID-19 is around 63 years, whereas patients under the age of fifty represent only 26% of all clinical cases. The ageing itself is the major risk factor for cognitive pathologies and neurodegeneration; severe systemic diseases as well as stress are known to provoke or accelerate cognitive decline in elderly. In the aged brain the neurogenesis is dwindling, synaptic plasticity deteriorates, metabolism is reduced and overall brain vulnerability to exogenous insults is increased. Ageing of the human brain is also associated with degeneration and atrophy of microglia and astrocytes which diminishes homoeostatic and neuroprotective support and again increases brain susceptibility to pathology –. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 (even in moderate clinical cases) thus promotes cognitive disorders with emergence of delirium, acute psychosis, exacerbation of mild cognitive impairment or with accelerating of dementia associated with various neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conceptually, neuroinflammation contributes to the pathological development of neurodegeneration and often is considered as a common, even unifying feature of neurodegeneration, while brain infection and ischaemic insults by themselves can trigger neurodegenerative process and instigate dementia.

### The value of multimodal neuroimaging in the diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a narrative review [^cfc5e11b]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD

The HPA axis and fear learning and extinction

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a complex system involved in the stress response. In times of stress, the amygdala activates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline, which then activate the HPA axis. Extensive research has demonstrated that PTSD patients frequently exhibit dysregulation of cortisol levels and the HPA axis function, primarily characterized by reduced cortisol concentrations. However, it should be noted that some studies have failed to establish a significant correlation between HPA axis dysregulation and PTSD symptomatology. Despite variations in results, HPA axis dysregulation is widely recognized as a significant factor in PTSD.

Another key mechanism in PTSD involves impaired fear learning and extinction. Fear learning includes conditioning and generalization: trauma-exposed individuals may link neutral stimuli to traumatic responses, triggering acute stress. PTSD patients further generalize fear by associating new neutral stimuli with stress. Fear extinction, a safety learning process, requires recognizing safe environments. Studies show PTSD patients exhibit heightened fear responses, increased dACC activation during fear learning, and reduced vmPFC activation during extinction. Post-extinction, decreased amygdala and vmPFC activation to threats indicate impaired safety learning. Similar patterns occur in PTSD-induced healthy individuals. Neuroimaging highlights the anterior hippocampus (aHPC) in fear processing, with PTSD patients showing fear generalization. A multimodal study (f-GBCr and d-GBCr) found aHPC-PFC connectivity negatively correlates with hypervigilance, suggesting PTSD patients have impaired fear regulation, leading to heightened vigilance.

### Title: "Labels matter: is it stress or is it trauma? " [^98aaf7a5]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

While these textbook descriptions are correct, they often present a misleading oversimplification of what is taking place and miss the essence of the stress response. Too frequently, cortisol is referred to as the 'stress hormone', implying that it is the most significant aspect of the stress response, and reflecting literature's overemphasis of its role in the stress response. Yet, while cortisol is indeed secreted during stress, it takes over ten-to-twenty minutes for cortisol blood levels to rise to their stress-related peak. This is significant since many highly stressful situations, such as predator–prey encounters, normally last only a few minutes, as any National Geographic documentary fan well knows.

In fact, cortisol has a dual role in the stress response: in addition to mobilizing resources to cope with a current stressor, once the threat is over, cortisol is actually responsible for bringing the stress response to its end, via its inhibitory feedback effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. If the threat is still present, the role of cortisol is to shift the stress response into a longer-period response, balancing between the emergency needs for energy for physical responses and the need to maintain the ability to respond for a longer period of time. Furthermore, cortisol is not secreted only in response to stress and is not triggered only by negative challenges or adverse experiences. Pleasurable activities, such as sports and sex, also lead to increased secretion of cortisol.

More recently, there is growing attention to the energy component of the stress response. Cortisol's role as a metabolic hormone is emphasized in this context, because of its effects on increasing blood glucose levels and its capacity to eventually directly affect mitochondrial function. Indeed, an important part of the stress response is metabolic control, as increases in glucocorticoid levels can lead to increases in glucose and modulate adiponectin levels. Furthermore, stress and trauma-related psychopathologies, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or stress-induced mood disorders, are known to have high comorbidity with metabolic dysregulation and metabolic syndromes.

Therefore, the stress response emerges nowadays as a complex and integrative process that involves, among others, neuronal–neuroendocrine-immune interactions and these interactions are also influenced by an individual's genetic background.

### Complex trauma and the unseen: who gets to be a victim? [^c560bfc6]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

The inclusion of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision in January 2022 marks a significant advancement in trauma recognition. However, while cPTSD offers a more inclusive framework, it risks perpetuating trauma hierarchies by reinforcing a division where some trauma responses are attributed to personality disorders (such as borderline personality disorder) and others to external factors (cPTSD). This division echoes one of the oldest themes in victimology-the separation of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' victims-raising broader questions about what is recognised as complex trauma. Survivors often face the danger of being 'unvictimed', where their experiences are dismissed or invalidated either internally or by families, society and institutions. Unvictiming results from trauma ideals that establish an elusive standard of what trauma should look like. While cPTSD broadens psychiatry's role in shaping these ideals, it merely moves the goalposts rather than changing the rules of the game. To prevent the reproduction of a two-tier system, we should adopt transdiagnostic and transmodality approaches, ensuring that complex trauma recognition is accessible to all who find it validating. While systemic changes are essential, we can immediately focus on small acts of trauma recognition within clinical settings, which validate survivors and help expand our collective understanding of trauma.

### Neuropathology of stress [^ad4e059c]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

Environmental challenges are part of daily life for any individual. In fact, stress appears to be increasingly present in our modern, and demanding, industrialized society. Virtually every aspect of our body and brain can be influenced by stress and although its effects are partly mediated by powerful corticosteroid hormones that target the nervous system, relatively little is known about when, and how, the effects of stress shift from being beneficial and protective to becoming deleterious. Decades of stress research have provided valuable insights into whether stress can directly induce dysfunction and/or pathological alterations, which elements of stress exposure are responsible, and which structural substrates are involved. Using a broad definition of pathology, we here review the "neuropathology of stress" and focus on structural consequences of stress exposure for different regions of the rodent, primate and human brain. We discuss cytoarchitectural, neuropathological and structural plasticity measures as well as more recent neuroimaging techniques that allow direct monitoring of the spatiotemporal effects of stress and the role of different CNS structures in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in human brain. We focus on the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, key brain regions that not only modulate emotions and cognition but also the response to stress itself, and discuss disorders like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, Cushing syndrome and dementia.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease [^e66043b7]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular demand

Autonomic balance (i.e. the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity) may be disrupted in PTSD, resulting in increased basal activity and intermittently exaggerated demand on the cardiovascular system.

Sympathetic nervous system activity appears to be exaggerated in PTSD. Patients with PTSD exhibit higher catecholamine levels and higher heart rate relative to those without PTSD, particularly after exposure to reminders of their index traumatic event. Decades of research point to heightened activation of the sympathetic nervous system in PTSD, but most of the evidence comes from laboratory studies showing that trauma reminders cause sympathetic nervous system activation, and large increases in heart rate in particular [i.e. a meta-analysis of lab studies suggests the median heart rate increase associated with trauma reminders is 10 beats per minute]. Short-term increases in heart rate magnify shear stress on the endothelium which, through the rupturing of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, may trigger CVD events. High heart rate is a major risk factor for recurrent cardiac events and mortality in CVD patients.

The parasympathetic nervous system serves to dampen sympathetic reactions to stress and promote calm behavioural states, and parasympathetic nervous system activation appears to be hampered in PTSD. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the most commonly assessed indicator of parasympathetic nervous system activity, and PTSD has been associated with low mean HRV (an index of parasympathetic nervous system withdrawal) on 24-hour Holter monitoring. Further, patients with PTSD have been shown to exhibit a substantial acute decrease in HRV when exposed to trauma cues in the lab, suggesting parasympathetic nervous system withdrawal. More evidence for autonomic dysregulation in PTSD include baroreflex dysfunction and increased QT intervals on ECG. These maladaptive alterations in threat responding may become chronic, and have direct links to CVD risk. Low HRV and reduced baroreflex sensitivity have been linked with carotid atherosclerosis, inflammation and hypercoagulability, – and increased risk of incident and recurrent CVD. Further, increased QT variability is a predictor of sudden cardiac death.

Similarly, alterations in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with PTSD has been documented, including lower basal cortisol levels and lower daily cortisol output, but exaggerated cortisol response to stress. HPA dysregulation has been implicated in the development of heart failure and cardiac ischemia and has been associated with CVD mortality. HPA dysregulation influences blood pressure and coagulation, in part due to hormone secretions that directly effect the heart, blood vessels, and platelet activation. Over time, HPA dysregulation may result in increased negative feedback sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors in the stress-response system, decreased glucocorticoid responsiveness, and lower urinary and plasma cortisol levels.

### Acute stress responses of autonomous nervous system, HPA axis, and inflammatory system in posttraumatic stress disorder [^a432cfc1]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumata play an ever-increasing role in human life, for example as a consequence of military conflicts and natural disasters, and related phenomena such as migration or flight, or through human behavior in personal inter-individual conflicts. Possible consequences after a traumatic event are posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma-associated disorders with a prevalence of 7–12%. In addition to psychological suffering, PTSD is not only associated with comorbid psychiatric or somatic disorders, but also with higher mortality from heart disease and a number of alterations in the function of stress systems, as well as in further dependent or related homeostatic systems. A common characteristic of somatic diseases or physical symptoms comorbid with PTSD is that all of those are related with, or in many cases, stimulated by exaggerated chronic inflammation.

Several current reviews provide an excellent summary of the role of inflammation in the etiology of the most relevant chronic diseases of the industrialized world. In one of these reviews, despite inconsistent findings, Sumner et al. report results indicating that inflammation increases susceptibility to PTSD after trauma or that PTSD can lead to altered inflammatory processes, suggesting that the relationship may be bidirectional. It has therefore been suggested that a possible mechanism linking PTSD with these conditions is dysregulated stress systems, ultimately leading to the disinhibition of inflammatory processes.

### Recent advances in the role of miRNAs in post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury [^8a09dc98]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Connections between TBI and PTSD

TBI is associated with a multitude of neuropsychiatric diseases owing to the convoluted pathophysiological changes that occur following the primary mechanical insults and the ensuing cascades of secondary injuries, causing neuron death, axon disruption, and neural circuits damage. Aside from these cellular and histological changes following TBI, myriads of psychological changes have also happened, therefore spurring strong interests towards TBI in the field of psychiatry. As is frequently accompanied by PTSD, TBI is also a common injury that contributes to the subsequent development of PTSD. Emerging evidence suggests that mild TBI (mTBI) renders the patients at higher risks of PTSD, while moderate-to-severe TBI exerts protective effects. The mTBI may increase the vulnerability to PTSD by inducing damage to the white matter structures that are involved in networks that negatively regulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, especially the uncinate fasciculus and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The abnormal ANS in PTSD patients can therefore elicit a cluster of hyperarousal symptoms, including sleep disturbance, exaggerated startle, hypervigilance, and explosive behaviors. Patients who sustained moderate to severe TBI can still develop PTSD, but less frequently. Such protective effects are possibly via disrupting traumatic memories formation, which underlies PTSD. Compared with mTBI, moderate to severe TBI causes an overt structural brain injury, which leaves the patient with chronic functional and cognitive deficits and is associated with an increased risk for dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) later on in life. Generally speaking, PTSD and TBI share a breadth of overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms and can be partially explained by the common underlying pathophysiological processes.

### Autonomic dysregulation and the window of tolerance model of the effects of complex emotional trauma [^5bea920f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the Window of Tolerance model of the long-term effects of the severe emotional trauma associated with childhood abuse, a model which can also be applied to adult trauma of sufficient severity to cause post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic dysthymic disorders and chronic anxiety disorders. Dysfunctional behaviours such as deliberate self-harm and substance abuse are seen as efforts to regulate an autonomic nervous system which is readily triggered into extreme states by reminders of the original traumatic events. While midbrain areas such as the periaqueductal gray mediate instant defence responses to traumatic events and their memory triggers it is proposed that ascending monoaminergic tracts are implicated in longer-term changes in mood and arousal. An imbalance of ascending dopaminergic tracts may drive rapid fluctuations in level of arousal and in the associated mood, drive and motivation. Animal models of depression frequently use traumatic experiences of pain, isolation or social defeat to induce changes in mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems which may alter prefrontal cortical control of midbrain defence responses. A focus on the pharmacology of the Window of Tolerance could provide advances in drug treatments for promoting emotional regulation in those who are suffering from the chronic sequelae of traumatic experiences.

Recent studies have also linked traumatic memory in PTSD to functional and structural abnormalities in the sensorimotor network (SMN). PTSD patients often fail to update memory representations with new information, a process dependent on the SMN and its coordination with other networks. Extreme and unpredictable stress can activate limbic regions such as the amygdala, triggering defensive responses. However, ineffective or absent defensive actions disrupt sensorimotor feedback, generating prediction errors that impair subcortical metabolism and function. This disrupts the transfer of information between sensorimotor and associative cortices, leading to hyperconnectivity within the SMN and preventing memory updating. As a result, traumatic memories are re-experienced as sensory and behavioral fragments. A multimodal meta-analysis found reduced SMN connectivity, impairing the perception of the "here and now", while hyperconnectivity between the SMN and DMN was associated with memory re-experiencing, blurring temporal perception and contributing to traumatic re-experiencing. Overall, PTSD involves large-scale functional and structural dysregulation within and between multiple brain networks, collectively influencing symptom development and progression.

The HPA axis-fear learning/extinction model and the multiple network theory provide complementary insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms of PTSD, drawing from psychiatric neuroimaging (Fig. 1). Multimodal neuroimaging has been crucial in advancing these perspectives by allowing for the simultaneous study of functional and structural connectivity to uncover dysregulation within and between networks. Compared to using just one type of imaging, multimodal approaches offer a more comprehensive understanding of how intricate brain networks contribute to PTSD symptoms and severity. Therefore, multimodal neuroimaging should continue to be a key component in future research on the neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD.

Fig. 1
Neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD.

a Due to the overwhelming intensity of traumatic experiences, neutral stimuli can elicit fear conditioning and activate the amygdala and HPA axis without requiring repeated pairing with aversive stimuli. This recurrent activation induces ventromedial prefrontal cortex habituation, impairing its regulatory control over the HPA axis and limbic system. The resulting cortisol feedback enhancement and HPA axis dysregulation underlie PTSD patients' heightened fear responses and impaired extinction. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) modulates these processes, showing increased activation during fear responses and deactivation during extinction. b PTSD reflects widespread brain network dysregulation. Intra-network alterations include reduced connectivity in CEN, DMN, and SMN, alongside increased SN connectivity and visual network hyperactivation. Inter-network alterations are characterized by enhanced CEN-SN and CEN-DMN connectivity, decreased DMN-SN coupling, DMN-SMN hyperconnectivity, and reduced DMN-visual system connectivity, collectively reflecting extensive neural network impairment in PTSD.

### No evidence for differential dose effects of hydrocortisone on intrusive memories in female patients with complex post-traumatic stress disorder – a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study [^0642e085]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder is characterized by intrusive traumatic memories. Presently, a controversial debate is ongoing regarding whether reduced cortisol secretion in post-traumatic stress disorder promotes an automatic retrieval of trauma-associated memories. Hence, a pharmacological elevation of cortisol was proposed to decrease post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, particularly intrusions. The present study investigated the impact of two different doses of hydrocortisone on automatic memory retrieval using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 30 inpatients with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Methods

All participants were female and received various psychotropic medications. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups within a crossover design: they received either 1 week placebo followed by 1 week hydrocortisone 10/d, followed by 1 week placebo, followed by hydrocortisone 30 mg/d (15 participants) or 1 week hydrocortisone 30 mg/d, followed by 1 week placebo, followed by 1 week hydrocortisone 10 mg/d, followed by 1 week placebo (15 participants). The outcome measures were the frequency and the intensity of intrusions, the overall symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder and the general psychopathology.

Results

We did not find any differences in the frequency and the intensity of post-traumatic stress disorder-related intrusions between the 10 mg hydrocortisone, the 30 mg hydrocortisone and the placebo condition. All effect sizes for the hydrocortisone condition vs. placebo were very small. Additionally, the overall symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder and the general psychopathology did not differ between the hydrocortisone therapies and placebo.

Conclusions

Our results do not show any effect of the hydrocortisone administration on intrusions in complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

### The value of multimodal neuroimaging in the diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a narrative review [^331706ad]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The activation of the HPA axis is modulated by limbic system structures, particularly the amygdala, which plays a crucial role in fear conditioning and extinction processes. Furthermore, cortisol has been shown to facilitate fear extinction learning, thereby establishing a neurobiological link between HPA axis function and the mechanisms underlying fear acquisition and extinction. Studies show that individuals with PTSD have heightened amygdala activation in response to fear stimuli, with increased fear responses linked to higher plasma ACTH levels. This suggests that HPA axis dysregulation is associated with impaired fear inhibition. Exposure to severe trauma activates the amygdala, triggering the HPA axis and causing stress responses. Severe trauma can lead to fear conditioning without repeated pairing with neutral stimuli. As a result, related neutral stimuli can repeatedly activate relevant brain regions, potentially leading to neural habituation in the prefrontal areas. This reduces the prefrontal cortex's control over the limbic system and HPA axis, enhancing HPA feedback mechanisms and causing dysregulation. This dysregulation may result in exaggerated responses to certain neutral stimuli, increased fear, and difficulties in fear extinction and regulation. These neurophysiological mechanisms may contribute to the development and progression of PTSD.

### Neuroimaging studies in post-traumatic stress disorder [^b140a798]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen a rapid advance in understanding of the neural circuits of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has largely been due to the application of neuroimaging to the study of this disorder. Based on studies in animals of the effects of stress on the brain, dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala have been hypothesized to underlie symptoms of PTSD. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD have been consistent with these hypotheses, with the most replicated findings showing decreased medial prefrontal cortical function in PTSD. Other replicated findings include decreased inferior frontal gyrus function, decreased hippocampal function, increased posterior cingulate function, and, in some behavioral paradigms, increased amygdala function. Several studies have now shown changes in structure (smaller volume) of the hippocampus in PTSD. These studies are beginning to map out a neural circuitry of PTSD that may have future implications for diagnosis and treatment.

### Cross-lagged panel networks of distinct complex post-traumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories among young adults with adverse childhood experiences [^397c0dc2]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

The eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11,) classifies complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) under the category of stress-associated disorders. CPTSD consists of three PTSD clusters: (1) re-experiencing (RE) the trauma in the here and now, (2) avoidance (AV) of traumatic reminders, and (3) a persistent sense of current threat (TH) that is manifested by exaggerated startle response and hypervigilance, as well as three additional clusters that reflect "disturbances in self-organization" (DSO): (1) affective dysregulation (AD), (2) negative self-concept (NSC), and (3) disturbances in relationships. CPTSD often arises from prolonged, repetitive, or multiple forms of trauma exposure, especially interpersonal traumas. The trauma leading to CPTSD under the ICD-11 framework can be triggered by a traumatic event or series of traumatic events. Kira categorizes trauma into three types: Type I trauma involves a single, isolated event, such as a car accident. Type II traumas are a series of related events that occurred over a period and then ceased, such as ACEs in adulthood. Type III traumas (continuous traumatic stress) involve ongoing exposure, such as current abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Individuals exposed to Types II and III traumas often cannot escape during the events, and repeated, interpersonal traumas are recognized as particularly potent contributors to CPTSD. While CPTSD may result from various traumatic experiences, childhood maltreatment is uniquely impactful due to its early disruption of emotional, cognitive, and relational development. Empirical studies have demonstrated that CPTSD is associated with greater functional impairment, higher comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders, and poorer treatment response compared to PTSD. In addition, CPTSD is associated with more severe trauma-related symptoms and adverse outcomes, including addictive behaviors, psychotic-like experiences such as auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and passivity phenomena, and suicidal behaviors. Therefore, focusing on individuals with ACEs offers unique theoretical and clinical insights into the development and expression of CPTSD.

Introduction

Our choice of labels and metaphors for the information we observe in the world impacts the way we process and understand it. This is true also in science, where choice of terminology is often influenced by hidden assumptions and predispositions, which in turn may affect not only research directions, but also the conclusions drawn from the results. Taking the time, every now and then, to reflect on customary terminology and on the potential benefit of considering alternative terminology is important for any field of research. It is certainly relevant for the field of the neurobiology of stress to reflect and consider hidden biases related with the use of the term Stress.

Stress has a negative connotation. Particularly because of its known potential to trigger or exacerbate pathologies. Yet both humans and animals demonstrate surprisingly high resilience to it, indicating that resilience is the rule and stress-related pathology the exception. Indeed, the physiological stress response has been selected throughout evolution as an important survival reaction. Thus, it seems likely that the neural mechanisms associated with trauma-related psychopathology are different from the neural mechanisms that are triggered by stressful experiences that do not lead to trauma-related psychopathology. This likely distinction, emphasizes the importance of differentiating between the terms 'stress' and ' trauma'. In order to differentiate between neural mechanisms that are associated with the pathology and those actually associated with stress resilience, it is critical to be able to differentiate between individuals who were exposed to a significant emotional challenge but did not develop pathology and those who did.

Understanding the stress-response: from simplistic text-book descriptions to a complex integrative view

The stress-response system is often described as a combined neuroendocrine response, with a bias toward emphasizing its endocrinological arm: an encounter with a stressful challenge activates simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. This response, often referred to as 'the' stress response system, comprises two stages: first, a fast response, in which the SNS is activated to trigger a myriad of peripheral actions, both through direct action of sympathetic nerves and through the release of adrenaline from the core of the adrenal gland. Second, a slower response, known as HPA axis response, in which the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus induces the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland, which in turn triggers the release of cortisol (or corticosterone) from the adrenal cortex.

### Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) and suicide risk: a multigroup mediation analysis exploring the role of post-traumatic symptomatology on hopelessness [^fe5b4799]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) is a clinical condition that features not only PTSD symptoms, but also disturbances in self-organization. Patients with cPTSD have a higher incidence of psychiatric comorbidities, including suicidality. A key construct tightly related to suicidality is hopelessness, described as a feeling of despair, with a state of mind giving low or negative expectancies regarding one's future. Since there is a paucity of studies investigating the link between cPTSD and hopelessness as a risk factor for suicidality, the aim of this study was to examine the role of post-traumatic symptomatology as the primary driver of suicidality, as measured by hopelessness. 211 patients were enrolled and divided into two groups: PTSD (143 patients) and cPTSD (78 patients). A set of standardized measures was administered to study post-traumatic symptomatology, depression, and hopelessness. The results showed that compared to PTSD, cPTSD patients experienced more severe symptoms in all clinical outcomes (p < 0.001). The mediation analysis revealed a significant positive association between post-traumatic symptomatology and hopelessness in the cPTSD group, which was not significant in the PTSD group. Among PTSD patients, depression mediated 43.37% of the impact of post-traumatic symptomatology on suicidal ideation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of complex post-traumatic symptomatology, further highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of suicidality. Hence, these findings have important clinical implications, suggesting that targeted, trauma-focused interventions might effectively prevent hopelessness and therefore suicide risk in patients with cPTSD.

### Multi-domain potential biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in recent trauma survivors [^5ec26c6d]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite promising indications, however, these objective cognitive and neural measures have not been integrated as a routine assessment and management plan of post-traumatic psychopathology. One obstacle in the clinical translation of these findings is a poor understanding of how these indicators cluster together into PTSD clinical subtypes and thereby may better inform the use of potential interventions. Moreover, most studies associating objective biomarkers with PTSD have used the disorder's symptom-based diagnostics as the main outcome measure, thereby overlooking the richness of phenotypical features associated with post-traumatic psychopathology such as depression and anxiety, and imposing an extraneous construct (PTSD diagnosis) as the only outcome of interest.

The limitations mentioned above call for the use of advanced computational and statistical methods that can co-evaluate wide arrays of potential biomarkers, disorder indicators, and clinical manifestations in PTSD. Machine learning methods are particularly well-suited to address such computational challenges, as they can account for the intricate interrelation of many relevant factors. Indeed, the last decade has shown an exponential increase in the use of machine learning for the study of post-traumatic stress, including both supervised and unsupervised approaches. While both approaches have shown varying success, supervised methods are limited by the accuracy of the prior knowledge they rely on, and unsupervised methods are limited in that subpopulations are not tied to specific questions of interest. As a result, neither approaches typically discovers novel biomarkers tied to the investigator's questions of interest. A possible solution is the use of hybrid analytic methods that combine both supervised and unsupervised approaches, which may yield more accurate disorder categories by identifying novel combinations of potential biomarkers for specific disorders.

### Psychiatric face of COVID-19 [^ba542463]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a severe multiorgan pathology which, besides cardio-respiratory manifestations, affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similarly to other coronaviruses demonstrate neurotropism; the viral infection of the brain stem may complicate the course of the disease through damaging central cardio-respiratory control. The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 represent serious clinical challenge that has to be considered for future complex therapies.

### Psychophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder [^a5121092]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

In general, the results of psychophysiologic research on PTSD support the presence of a variety of autonomic, sensory, and cognitive processing differences between individuals with and without the disorder. The findings are diverse and include heightened responsiveness to trauma reminders; exaggerated startle; increased conditionability and autonomic responsiveness to aversive, high-intensity stimuli; and elevated tonic or baseline physiologic activity. Increased sensitivity of the central nervous system is suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a failure to habituate to redundant information, over-responsiveness to novel information, and reduced cortical responsiveness to overstimulation. Cognitive processing abnormalities are suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a reduced ability to attend to task-relevant information and increased attention to task-irrelevant, trauma-related information in individuals with PTSD. Some findings, such as the heightened physiologic and P300 response amplitude responses to trauma-related stimuli and increased HR response to loud tones, have been highly replicable and appear to be as reliable as any biologic finding in the psychiatric literature. Other findings, such as increased eye-blink startle responses and tonic or baseline physiologic activity, have been less consistently replicated and have led investigators to explore how stressful or threatening experimental contexts might produce phasic alterations in the psychophysiology of individuals with PTSD. We hope that the broad range of psychophysiologic investigations and findings in PTSD will inspire others to consider possible applications of these methodologies to their own clinical and research endeavors.

### The role of suboptimal mitochondrial function in vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder [^41f273d8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder remains the most significant psychiatric condition associated with exposure to a traumatic event, though rates of traumatic event exposure far outstrip incidence of PTSD. Mitochondrial dysfunction and suboptimal mitochondrial function have been increasingly implicated in several psychopathologies, and recent genetic studies have similarly suggested a pathogenic role of mitochondria in PTSD. Mitochondria play a central role in several physiologic processes underlying PTSD symptomatology, including abnormal fear learning, brain network activation, synaptic plasticity, steroidogenesis, and inflammation. Here we outline several potential mechanisms by which inherited (genetic) or acquired (environmental) mitochondrial dysfunction or suboptimal mitochondrial function, may contribute to PTSD symptomatology and increase susceptibility to PTSD. The proposed pathogenic role of mitochondria in the pathophysiology of PTSD has important implications for prevention and therapy, as antidepressants commonly prescribed for patients with PTSD have been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function, while alternative therapies shown to improve mitochondrial function may prove more efficacious.

### The value of multimodal neuroimaging in the diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a narrative review [^f53a4ec9]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysregulation of multiple brain networks

Recent advancements in neuroimaging have shown that brain regions do not work in isolation but rather interactively, especially during complex cognitive tasks that require coordinated activity across networks. In the case of PTSD, there has been a shift towards studying brain network abnormalities, particularly focusing on the triple network model which includes the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). The DMN, which involves the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, plays a role in self-referential cognition, emotional regulation, and memory retrieval. PTSD patients often exhibit reduced DMN connectivity and altered topological properties, such as decreased nodal degrees (except in the precuneus), though pediatric PTSD patients exhibit increased degree centrality. Multimodal neuroimaging studies have shown hyperconnectivity between the right medial prefrontal cortex and right inferior temporal cortex in PTSD patients with adverse childhood experiences (ACE). Additionally, functional changes in the precuneus and structural alterations in regions like the precuneus, inferior parietal lobule, and cingulate cortices have been identified through multimodal neuroimaging studies using DTI, fMRI, and sMRI. PTSD patients show impaired connectivity in the DMN, leading to reduced integration and increased segregation. This can contribute to changes in self-concept, disrupted self-referential processing, and dissociative symptoms. The Salience Network, which includes the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, is involved in monitoring internal and external stimuli and switching between the DMN and Central Executive Network (CEN). In PTSD, there is enhanced connectivity in the SN, potentially causing increased vigilance and somatic symptoms. The CEN, which includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, is important for executive functions. In PTSD, there is reduced connectivity in the CEN, particularly in cases related to ACE with hypoconnectivity in the lateral prefrontal cortex and white matter, leading to cognitive impairments.

### The role of the immune system in posttraumatic stress disorder [^2327d8ec]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by re-experiencing of trauma, avoidance of trauma reminders, and hyperarousal symptoms that cause negative alterations in cognition, mood, and physiologic health. PTSD is unique among other psychiatric disorders, as it requires trauma exposure to develop. Although over 70% of the population is exposed to at least one traumatic event during their lifespan, it is not clear why only some individuals develop PTSD. Given the high comorbidities of inflammatory and metabolic disorders with PTSD, some studies have focused on the potential for an immune-related or inflammatory etiology for PTSD, whilst others suggest that PTSD promotes inflammation or that a bidirectional relation between PTSD and inflammation exists.

In this review, we first summarize potential mechanisms connecting PTSD and the immune system. We describe studies of peripheral immune markers and mechanisms through which immune alterations affect neurotransmitter systems and brain regions that contribute to PTSD symptomatology. We also highlight the contribution of chronic inflammation in conditions often co-morbid with PTSD. Finally, we explore plausible therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system, based on its interaction with PTSD.

### Psychobiology of the acute stress response and its relationship to the psychobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder [^3fc93d61]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The literature to date that examines the biology of the acute stress reactions suggests that relatively lower baseline cortisol is associated with the development of PTSD. This is particularly informative because of the ongoing controversy surrounding baseline cortisol in PTSD. Studies have found low baseline cortisol, normal range, and elevated baseline cortisol in chronic PTSD, and it has been unclear whether this reflects methodologic differences across studies or true heterogeneity within the disorder. Thus, the few studies to date support the finding of low-normal baseline cortisol in chronic PTSD and suggest that it is a pre-existing functional trait. Whether it plays an etiologic role or is an epiphenomenon of some other process is unclear. What does seem clear, however, is that this characteristic is relatively nonspecific to PTSD, given the fact that low cortisol has been observed in multiple subject populations, including normal individuals under chronic stress as well as chronic medical conditions (for review see [23]). For example, it is possible that reduced baseline cortisol reflects the net result of input to the hypothalamus from cortical and subcortical regions of the brain linked to increased vigilance, sensitization to trauma because of prior traumatic experiences, or genetic factors. For example, primate studies have demonstrated persistent alterations in HPA axis functioning in animals reared by mothers living in moderately stressful conditions [24]. The development of PTSD is associated with sensitization of the startle response. Because the neurobiology of startle is well characterized, this finding implicates a role for specific neurocircuitry in PTSD [25]. Non-habituation of the startle response in PTSD appears related to sensitization specifically to contextual cues (i.e., the environment) that signal the presence of potential threat of danger-related fears [26]. This may be the neurobiological correlate to the over-generalization seen in PTSD that distinguishes the disorder from a simple trauma-induced phobia. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is specifically implicated from preclinical research in the mediation of context-dependent cues [1]. Treatments that result in down-regulation of the BNST are therefore of particular interest in therapeutic models of prevention after trauma. The fact that a number of vulnerability factors associated with increased risk for developing PTSD are also likely to be biologically based (e.g., a genetic component, prior psychiatric history, prior family of history of psychiatric disorder), provides further evidence in support of a role for psychobiological factors in producing PTSD. Nevertheless, the considerable overlap on these measures between those who will develop PTSD, and those who eventually recover spontaneously, belies any attempt to identify any single or pathognomonic biological marker for risk. For now, the standard of care in predicting level of symptomatology and prognosis in the acute setting continues to be based on careful, informed, serial assessments of symptoms and functioning. Because the capacity to learn from and adapt to adverse conditions are essential to the survival of any species, understanding the neurobiological pathways that mediate learning from traumatic experiences in an adaptive way is as important as understanding the etiology of PTSD and other trauma-related maladaptive consequences. Biological models that trace the causal cascade of post-traumatic events in the brain and neuroendocrine systems may offer a multiplicity of possibilities for intervention. It is well established that conditioned responses are robust and persistent. Moreover, the primary mechanism of habituation is overlearning rather than extinction. Interventions that promote overlearning may therefore prove to be the most powerful and efficient preventative treatments. The therapeutics literature supports this hypothesis, in that brief psychosocial interventions based on sophisticated cognitive-behavioral models have proven effective in reducing suffering, symptom severity, and chronicity in individuals presenting with acute PTSD symptoms [27–29]. No acutely administered pharmacologic treatment to date has been shown effective in accelerating the process of recovery or in preventing the development of chronic PTSD. However, pharmacologic interventions that would prevent sensitization of circuits related to context-dependent threat perception, dysregulation of affect, and/or dysregulation of normal circadian rhythms are of theoretical interest and deserve further study.

### The impact of psychosocial adversity on brain and behaviour: an overview of existing knowledge and directions for future research [^53fe0ff2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The interaction between individuals and their environment is a dynamic process, that occurs at multiple levels, including macro and micro-environment. While macroenvironment encompasses broad factors at neighbourhood level, the microenvironment refers to immediate surroundings and contexts in which individuals live their lives. Throughout life, individuals are exposed to multiple adverse events, within their microenvironment, that may create a cumulative burden of adversity, known as allostatic load. When faced with adversity physiological regulatory systems, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the metabolic system as well as the immune system, produce physiological response. While these responses are adaptive in the short term, repeated exposure to adverse events or chronic stress can lead to long-lasting alterations in these systems. This results in a so-called wear-and-tear or allostatic load which is known to significantly contribute to the emergence and maintenance of mental and physical illnesses. According to its systemic cascades, the brain represents one of the critical targets for allostatic load. For example: chronic release of glucocorticoids or inflammatory cytokines can lead to changes in the brain.

### Trauma-informed care [^66efe87e]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Trauma-informed care terminology — acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychiatric diagnoses after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event with persistent symptoms including reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are stressful or traumatic events, including child abuse and neglect, within the primary caregiving relationship that often breach the parent–child relationship. Complex childhood trauma encompasses exposure to multiple interpersonal traumatic events and the broad, pervasive, and predictable impact on the child that can disrupt attachment, development, and sense of self. Developmental trauma disorder (DTD) is a proposed diagnosis for children exposed to complex trauma at risk for severe pervasive disruptions across emotional, physical, attention, cognitive, learning, behavioral, interpersonal, and self domains, and it is sometimes used interchangeably with complex childhood trauma. Pediatric medical traumatic stress (PMTS) refers to distress during hospitalization or a perceived life-threatening diagnosis or while living with or caring for someone with life-altering chronic conditions, often related to the person's subjective experience rather than objective severity and mitigated by SSNRs that promote resilience. Secondary traumatic stress (STS) is a response that may occur in parents, family members, and health care workers exposed to others' suffering and may have many of the same long-term effects on health as trauma in children. Social determinants of health (SDoHs) are conditions in the greater ecology where people live, learn, work and play that affect the neuroendocrine stress response and a wide range of risks and outcomes; they can be mitigated by an SSNR and other protective factors and exacerbated by ACEs and intrafamilial and interpersonal traumas, with examples including poverty, food insecurity, homelessness, lack of access to health care, racism, discrimination, and community violence. Trauma is an event, series of events, or set of circumstances experienced as physically or emotionally harmful with lasting adverse effects on functioning and mental, physical, emotional, or spiritual well-being, and it can occur outside caregiving relationships, within the caregiving relationship, or outside the family (e.g., domestic violence, various forms of abuse or disordered caregiving, racism, bias, discrimination, bullying).

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^ee0d81b8]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) features and management — unique identifying PTSD features may include re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance and numbing symptoms, symptoms of increased arousal, symptoms that last for at least one month, and significant distress or impairment of functioning. PTSD sufferers tend to have abnormal levels of key hormones involved in response to stress, with some studies showing that cortisol levels are lower than normal and epinephrine and norepinephrine levels are higher than normal; when people are in danger, they produce high levels of opiates, and PTSD sufferers continue to produce those higher levels even after the danger has passed. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened even when they're no longer in danger, and the main treatments for people with PTSD are psychotherapy, medications, or both.

Other Biological Factors

Brain Structure and Function

PTSD is often associated with anatomical and functional alterations in three main areas involved in threat neurocircuitry — the amygdala, hippocampus, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including longitudinal prediction of PTSD by lower hippocampal and ACC volumes measured shortly following trauma. We identified eleven recent neuroimaging studies that have examined sex differences in brain structure and function due to PTSD.

A single recent longitudinal study examined PTSD risk based on brain structure in females versus males (total n = 94). Intriguingly, results indicated that greater right rostral ACC thickness 1-month post-trauma predicted PTSD symptom severity at 6 months in females, an effect not found in males. This effect was attenuated but still significant when adjusting for PTSD symptoms at the time of scan, trauma type, and exposure to prior traumatic events. Follow-up analyses showed that right rostral ACC was positively correlated with avoidance symptoms in females (r (27) = 0.37, p = 0.04) but not males (r (44) = 0.04, p = 0.79).

Two cross-sectional studies examined sex differences in cortical thickness in relation to PTSD. First, in a large multicentre study from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Consortium (total n = 3397), no PTSD diagnosis x sex interactions were detected in relation to cortical thickness. In a follow-up study by the same group, it was suggested that it may be important to examine cortical regions within the context of structural networks and that cortical regions are affected, albeit not significantly, in a coordinated manner by PTSD. Females with PTSD had a greater mean structural covariance in cortical thickness based atrophic networks, indicating that regions most affected by PTSD are modified in a systematic way in females only.

Structural MRI in combination with machine learning was used to examine the possible effect of PTSD on brain predicted age difference (brain PAD; brain age − chronological age). Analysis of data from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Consortium (n = 2229; aged 18–69 years) revealed that males, but not females, with PTSD exhibited higher brain PAD, indicative of accelerated brain aging. However, this effect was further qualified by age, with PTSD being associated with higher brain-PAD relative to controls in younger males. Among older males, control versus PTSD status was unexpectedly associated with relatively higher brain aging. Given evidence that PTSD is associated with reduced lifespan, such observations warrant further examination.

### Stress controversies: post-traumatic stress disorder, hippocampal volume, gastroduodenal ulceration* [^8b6cc657]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Stress in mammals triggers a neuroendocrine response mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system. Increased activity of these two systems induces behavioural, cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic cascades that enable the individual to fight or flee and cope with the stress. Our understanding of stress and stress-response mechanisms is generally robust. Here, however, we review three themes that remain controversial and perhaps deserve further scrutiny and investigation before they achieve canonical status. The themes are, first, hypocortisolaemia in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A reduction rather than a stress-induced increase in adrenal glucocorticoid levels, as seen in major depressive disorder (MDD), is puzzling and furthermore is not a consistent feature of PTSD. Overall, studies on PTSD show that glucocorticoid levels may be normal or higher or lower than normal. The second theme concerns the reduction in volume of the hippocampus in MDD attributed to the neurotoxicity of hypercortisolaemia. Again, as for hypocortisolaemia in PTSD, reduced hippocampal volume in MDD has been found in some but not all studies. Third, the discovery of a causal association between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcers apparently brought to an end the long-held view that peptic ulceration was caused predominantly by stress. However, recent studies suggest that stress can cause peptic ulceration in the absence of H. pylori. Predictably, the aetiological pendulum of gastric and duodenal ulceration has swung from 'all stress' to 'all bacteria' followed by a sober realisation that both factors may play a role. This raises the question as to whether stress and H. pylori interact, and if so how? All three controversies are of clinical significance, pose fundamental questions about stress mechanisms and offer important areas for future research.

### Neurobiology and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder [^0d0f40d1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The recent worldwide surge of warfare and hostilities exposes increasingly large numbers of individuals to traumatic events, placing them at risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and challenging both clinicians and service delivery systems. This overview summarizes and updates the core knowledge of the genetic, molecular, and neural circuit features of the neurobiology of PTSD and advances in evidence-based psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation, and digital treatments. While the complexity of the neurobiology and the biological and clinical heterogeneity of PTSD have challenged clinicians and researchers, there is an emerging consensus concerning the underlying mechanisms and approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PTSD. This update addresses PTSD diagnosis, prevalence, course, risk factors, neurobiological mechanisms, current standard of care, and innovations in next-generation treatment and prevention strategies. It provides a comprehensive summary and concludes with areas of research for integrating advances in the neurobiology of the disorder with novel treatment and prevention targets.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder: a state-of-the-science review [^d74804b0]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

This article reviews the state-of-the-art research in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from several perspectives: (1) Sex differences: PTSD is more frequent among women, who tend to have different types of precipitating traumas and higher rates of comorbid panic disorder and agoraphobia than do men. (2) Risk and resilience: The presence of Group C symptoms after exposure to a disaster or act of terrorism may predict the development of PTSD as well as comorbid diagnoses. (3) Impact of trauma in early life: Persistent increases in CRF concentration are associated with early life trauma and PTSD, and may be reversed with paroxetine treatment. (4) Imaging studies: Intriguing findings in treated and untreated depressed patients may serve as a paradigm of failed brain adaptation to chronic emotional stress and anxiety disorders. (5) Neural circuits and memory: Hippocampal volume appears to be selectively decreased and hippocampal function impaired among PTSD patients. (6) Cognitive behavioral approaches: Prolonged exposure therapy, a readily disseminated treatment modality, is effective in modifying the negative cognitions that are frequent among PTSD patients. In the future, it would be useful to assess the validity of the PTSD construct, elucidate genetic and experiential contributing factors (and their complex interrelationships), clarify the mechanisms of action for different treatments used in PTSD, discover ways to predict which treatments (or treatment combinations) will be successful for a given individual, develop an operational definition of remission in PTSD, and explore ways to disseminate effective evidence-based treatments for this condition.

### Polygenic risk associated with post-traumatic stress disorder onset and severity [^c2f59d92]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Second, future polygenic risk prediction models, in addition to common single-nucleotide variants studied in this article, can incorporate rare and low frequency variants, and other complex structural polymorphisms (for example, copy number variations that have been shown to be important for psychiatric disorders). Given the rapidly evolving technological developments in whole genome and exome sequencing, this is an avenue that will become possible in the very near future. Once identified, these rare variants are likely to have larger effect-sizes (negative selection), and have potential to substantially improve prediction accuracy. Integrating other modalities, including neuroimaging biomarkers and other omics panels such as epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, is also promising.

Third, the PRS predicted phenotype is an important factor to consider for future studies. PTSD is characterized by a heterogeneous set of distinct symptoms. PTSD-PRS, as applied in the current study, attempts to predict genetic influences on the overall diagnosis, ignoring heterogeneity in the clinical presentation. As larger genotyped samples that are more deeply phenotyped become available, it will be possible to create genetic scores for clinical subtypes (for example, dissociative and depressive subtypes) and sub-phenotypes (for example, the four symptom clusters of PTSD) as well as specific traits, some of which might be shared with other disorders. This is particularly valuable for PTSD, and psychiatric illnesses in general, where comorbidity is prevalent and the boundaries around symptom-based diagnostic criteria are a moving target. This approach may also unearth pleiotropic patterns and help explain the widespread genetic correlations among psychiatric disorders and behavioral traits.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^3576d27c]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research — effect size calculation and comparative effectiveness synthesis: The Panel recommends that individual clinical trial researchers and systematic review authors consistently calculate pre-post effect sizes and relative effect sizes and provide the equations that were used to perform the calculations. The Panel recommends that systematic reviews and future guideline development panels carefully consider how best to meaningfully aggregate comparative effectiveness data, specifically across superiority, equivalence, and noninferiority trials, and define a priori under what specific circumstances efficacy can be inferred from comparative effectiveness data, especially in the absence of or limited number of efficacy trials. The Panel recommends standardizing the definition of "quality of life". It also recommends standardizing other important outcomes where there were gaps in the systematic reviews that served as the underlying evidence for treatment recommendations (e.g., complex PTSD outcomes, substance use, affect dysregulation, suicidality, ideation, dissociation).

### Factors promoting vulnerability to dysregulated stress reactivity and stress-related disease [^c2cda168]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Effective coordination of the biological stress response is integral for the behavioural well-being of an organism. Stress reactivity is coordinated by an interplay of the neuroendocrine system and the sympathetic nervous system. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a key role in orchestrating the bodily responses to stress, and the activity of the axis can be modified by a wide range of experiential events. This review focuses on several factors that influence subsequent HPA axis reactivity. Some of these factors include early-life adversity, exposure to chronic stress, immune activation and traumatic brain injury. The central premise is that each of these experiences serves as a general vulnerability factor that accelerates future HPA axis reactivity in ways that make individuals more sensitive to stress challenges, therefore feeding forward into the exacerbation of ongoing (or greater susceptibility toward) future stress-related disease states, especially as they pertain to negative affect and overall brain health.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex stress-related psychiatric disorder. Symptoms of PTSD include persistent intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal, and negative alterations in cognition and mood. PTSD has also been linked to increased risk of health issues such as cardiorespiratory disease, immunological disorders, and worse physical functioning. Moreover, comorbidity with other mental health issues such as depression and substance use is common. PTSD has consistently been observed to be more common among women, and the past-year prevalence rates in the US are 5.2% in women and 1.8% in men. Considerable studies investigating sex differences in PTSD have revealed two major categories of explanations for sex differences in PTSD: (1) social factors including trauma exposure differences and social expectations, and (2) biological factors including sex hormones and cognitive processing differences. In the current study, we will compare the effect of an important sex hormone, testosterone, on PTSD symptoms in males and females.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system which regulates response to external stress. Typically, when a stressor is encountered, a chain reaction known as the "HPA axis stress response cascade" is activated, releasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticoid hormone (ACTH), and glucocorticoids (cortisol). As the brain senses the increase in cortisol, a negative feedback loop connected to the glucocorticoid receptor in the hypothalamus works to reestablish homeostasis. The acute activation of the HPA response is beneficial in threatening situations, but constant activation caused by chronic stress may lead to dysregulation of this process, in turn contributing to psychiatric disorders, especially PTSD. One potential explanation of dysregulation in patients with PTSD is decreased plasma cortisol levels, increased CRH activity, and increased sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptors in PTSD patients as compared to controls, though results have been mixed. Testosterone has also been reported to interact with HPA axis activity. Viau and colleagues found higher levels of testosterone in rats were associated with restrained release of ACTH and corticosterone after stress, suggesting a suppressive effect of testosterone on stress response. In human studies, experimentally increased testosterone levels have been reported to lower stress response through inhibition of CRH-released cortisol levels. Thus, evidence suggests that higher testosterone could dampen stress responses, thereby reducing likelihood of developing PTSD.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder in parents following their child's single-event trauma: a meta-analysis of prevalence rates and risk factor correlates [^6f6795b2]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Psychological reactions to traumatic events have been studied in adults and children for decades, with the diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) being introduced to the 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1980 (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association). Early research into the development of PTSD acknowledged that exposure to trauma alone was not sufficient to explain the complexity of this response (e.g. Yehuda & McFarlane). Much research recognises the idiosyncratic nature of responses to trauma for both adults and children in which personal demographics, cognitive, behavioural and environmental factors all play a role (Brewin et al; Cox et al; Trickey et al.).

Whilst it is recognised that parents are also at risk of developing secondary PTSD following their child's trauma, whether or not they are involved in the incident themselves (Landolt et al; Hiller et al.), parental PTSD is less researched compared to adult and child populations. Kazak et al. present an integrative model of paediatric medical traumatic stress in which they highlight that child trauma exposure impacts the family system much more widely than just the child. They suggest the need for a systemic approach across all trauma types, in which assessing and understanding how trauma affects families as a whole is fundamental. Consistent with the results from meta-analyses of risk factors for the development of PTSD in adults (Brewin et al.) and children (Trickey et al.), the systemic model considers the impact of trauma across three phases; the traumatic incident itself, and any pre-existing factors related to the individual or family; the immediate systemic aftermath of the trauma; and the longer-term systemic psychological effects of the trauma.

### Response variation following trauma: a translational neuroscience approach to understanding PTSD [^1cdab3d2]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Exposure to traumatic stress is a requirement for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, because the majority of trauma-exposed persons do not develop PTSD, examination of the typical effects of a stressor will not identify the critical components of PTSD risk or pathogenesis. Rather, PTSD represents a specific phenotype associated with a failure to recover from the normal effects of trauma. Thus, research must focus on identifying pre- and posttraumatic risk factors that explain the development of the disorder and the failure to reinstate physiological homeostasis. In this review, we summarize what is known about the clinical and biological characteristics of PTSD and articulate some of the gaps in knowledge that can be addressed by basic neuroscience research. We emphasize how knowledge about individual differences related to genetic and epigenetic factors in behavioral and brain responses to stress offers the hope of a deeper understanding of PTSD.

### The familiar dialectic between overclaiming and moral outrage over brain biology: disconnected from what matters [^40b1ccb8]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

I was baffled by Scull's seemingly reductive, dualist views in his treatment of the term 'biology' in psychiatry. Properly understood, genetics and neurobiology cannot be set in opposition to societal influence, lived experience, or other environmental exposures. Lived experiences, such as grinding poverty, the experience of imprisonment, or other sources of traumatization are processed both consciously and unconsciously by our brains (and other organs as well) and may set the stage, in the context of genetic and developmental susceptibility, for such conditions as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders, hypertension, and metabolic derangements, among others. What neurobiology teaches is that ideas and lived experience are encoded and exert their effects on mental states, physiology, behavior, and risk of mental illness as a result of information processing and plasticity within synaptic networks. As non-dualists, neurobiologists recognize that these synaptic networks integrate experience, ideas, and trains of thought with effects of genes, developmental signals, drugs, and disease. The scientific paths to understanding our most complex organ in health and in illness will be long, multifarious, and characterized by many setbacks, but I would ask the hucksters and the critics alike: what alternatives do you propose?

### Amygdala downregulation training using fMRI neurofeedback in post-traumatic stress disorder: a randomized, double-blind trial [^25e8f9ff]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD) is a debilitating disorder with a high lifetime prevalence worldwide. Individuals with PTSD typically experience symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, alterations in cognition and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity.

With its neurobiology extensively studied in rodents and humans, although far from perfectly understood, PTSD fear responses are considered to be one of the better understood neural mechanisms underlying the disorder. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD have highlighted neuroplastic changes in brain structures including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala. Given its role in fear conditioning and processing of negative emotions, the amygdala is an area of particular interest for PTSD. Indeed, hyperactivation in the amygdala complex is a prominent brain marker of the disorder. Clinical studies using psychotherapy have reported symptom reductions associated with decreases in amygdala activity following treatment. Furthermore, successful MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) treatments appear to facilitate healthy trauma recall by decreasing amygdala activity and preliminary deep brain stimulation (DBS) studies targeting amygdala activity have reported promising findings of this neuromodulation technique in reducing PTSD symptoms. These findings together suggested that suppressing fearful amygdala response in PTSD is a promising avenue for treatment.

In recent decades, there has been encouraging progress in developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback training as an intervention for treating mental illnesses including PTSD. A number of these studies have focused on normalizing amygdala activity with the goal of enhancing emotion regulation. As PTSD symptoms stem from individual traumatic experiences, we aimed to train participants to reduce amygdala activity following personal trauma recall using fMRI neurofeedback. Our pilot study in treatment-refractory PTSD suggested this approach could lead to meaningful symptom reduction. In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial we examined whether our amygdala neurofeedback training protocol could help patients with PTSD to control their amygdala activity following trauma recall and thereby improve symptoms.

### Pathophysiological bases of comorbidity: traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder [^09c32c5d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

The high rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses encountered in recent years by the United States Veterans Affairs Healthcare System have increased public awareness and research investigation into these conditions. In this review, we analyze the neural mechanisms underlying the TBI/PTSD comorbidity. TBI and PTSD present with common neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, irritability, insomnia, personality changes, and memory problems, and this overlap complicates diagnostic differentiation. Interestingly, both TBI and PTSD can be produced by overlapping pathophysiological changes that disrupt neural connections termed the "connectome". The neural disruptions shared by PTSD and TBI and the comorbid condition include asymmetrical white matter tract abnormalities and gray matter changes in the basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. These neural circuitry dysfunctions result in behavioral changes that include executive function and memory impairments, fear retention, fear extinction deficiencies, and other disturbances. Pathophysiological etiologies can be identified using experimental models of TBI, such as fluid percussion or blast injuries, and for PTSD, using models of fear conditioning, retention, and extinction. In both TBI and PTSD, there are discernible signs of neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative damage. These disturbances produce neuronal death and degeneration, axonal injury, and dendritic spine dysregulation and changes in neuronal morphology. In laboratory studies, various forms of pharmacological or psychological treatments are capable of reversing these detrimental processes and promoting axonal repair, dendritic remodeling, and neurocircuitry reorganization, resulting in behavioral and cognitive functional enhancements. Based on these mechanisms, novel neurorestorative therapeutics using anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticonvulsant agents may promote better outcomes for comorbid TBI and PTSD.

Introduction

Trauma- and stress-related disorders can result from one or more stressful events. Most people recover without specific intervention, but in some patients even a single traumatic experience can lead to psychiatric diseases, as in the case of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A large- scale study has recently shown that a diagnosis of a stress-related disorder is associated with a higher risk of death, including the one from unnatural causes, particularly suicide. Improving mental health and suicide prevention is currently an international priority, in a way that the World Health Organization has set the ambitious goal of reducing global suicide mortality by one-third until 2030. Deepening our knowledge of the neurobiology of stress-related disorders is a critical step towards achieving this goal. In this context, a thorough understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of resilience and vulnerability to stress is still lacking.

### Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of ICD-11 in youths with childhood maltreatment: associations with age of exposure and clinical outcomes [^9b132b5a]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) increases the risk of psychiatric morbidity in youths. The new Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) diagnosis captures the heterogeneity and complexity of clinical outcomes observed in youths exposed to CM. This study explores CPTSD symptomatology and its association with clinical outcomes, considering the impact of CM subtypes and age of exposure.

Methods

Exposure to CM and clinical outcomes were evaluated in 187 youths aged 7–17 (116 with psychiatric disorder; 71 healthy controls) following the Tools for Assessing the Severity of Situations in which Children are Vulnerable (TASSCV) structured interview criteria. CPTSD symptomatology was explored by confirmatory factor analysis, considering four subdomains: post-traumatic stress symptoms, emotion dysregulation, negative self-concept and interpersonal problems.

Results

Youths exposed to CM (with or without psychiatric disorders) showed greater internalizing, externalizing and other symptomatology, worse premorbid adjustment and poorer overall functioning. Youth with psychiatric disorder and exposed to CM reported more CPTSD symptomatology, psychiatric comorbidity and polypharmacy and earlier onset of cannabis use. Different subtypes of CM and the developmental stage of exposure differentially impact CPTSD subdomains.

Limitations

Small percentage of resilient youths was studied. It was not possible to explore specific interactions between diagnostic categories and CM. Direct inference cannot be assumed.

Conclusions

Gathering information on type and age of exposure to CM is clinically useful to understand the complexity of psychiatric symptoms observed in youths. Inclusion of the CPTSD diagnosis should increase the implementation of early specific interventions, improving youths' functioning and reducing the severity of clinical outcomes.

### Heart rate variability during a cognitive reappraisal task in female patients with borderline personality disorder: the role of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and dissociation [^0d969855]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

HF-HRV

Despite similar self-appraisals in both BPD groups, only patients with comorbid PTSD showed significant HF-HRV alterations during the ER task. Again, group differences were independent of instruction and picture valence: HF-HRV levels were significantly lower in BPD + PTSD than in HC and (as a trend) in BPD across all conditions. When excluding medicated patients, this pattern remained significant. Extending previous research (Meyer et al.), our findings indicate a significant impact of comorbid PTSD on HF-HRV, not only under baseline conditions but also during an ER task in BPD, pointing to complex interactions between (post)traumatic stress and autonomic nervous system functioning (Pechtel and Pizzagalli; Sammito et al.). Other variables that may affect HF-HRV, such as depressive symptoms, BPD symptom severity, and comorbidities other than PTSD did not differ between the patient groups, rendering it unlikely that they accounted for the observed group differences in HF-HRV.

### The role of the immune system in posttraumatic stress disorder [^5810deab]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in a subset of individuals upon exposure to traumatic stress. In addition to well-defined psychological and behavioral symptoms, some individuals with PTSD also exhibit elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, PTSD is often co-morbid with immune-related conditions, such as cardiometabolic and autoimmune disorders. Numerous factors, including lifetime trauma burden, biological sex, genetic background, metabolic conditions, and gut microbiota, may contribute to inflammation in PTSD. Importantly, inflammation can influence neural circuits and neurotransmitter signaling in regions of the brain relevant to fear, anxiety, and emotion regulation. Given the link between PTSD and the immune system, current studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments in those with PTSD. Understanding the complex interactions between PTSD and the immune system is essential for future discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

### Complex trauma in adolescents and adults: effects and treatment [^702db549]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Complex trauma involves multiple exposures to adverse events over the lifespan. Such experiences are associated with a variety of psychological outcomes, including a decreased threshold for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder as well as self-capacity problems and dysfunctional behaviors. Psychological interventions that increase affect regulation, support titrated processing of memories and cognitions, and emphasize the therapeutic relationship seem to be most helpful for complex trauma effects. Pharmacologic treatments have some efficacy in the treatment of the posttraumatic stress components of complex posttraumatic outcomes but are generally less successful in reducing self-related problems and symptoms.

Despite these limitations, this work identifies the substantive role of cortisol and the broader neuroendocrine response in predictive modeling of post-traumatic stress responses. Further, this work identifies subpopulations for which the cortisol response following trauma is most relevant. Together, results indicate that the neuroendocrine response to trauma should be both utilized as a biomarker in predictive tools and should be considered as a target for intervention that is most relevant to a subpopulation. Further, this work provides a methodology that is relevant across psychiatry and other behavioral sciences that transcend the limitations of commonly utilized data analytic tools to match the complexity of the current state of theory in these fields.

### Multi-domain potential biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in recent trauma survivors [^e4682fad]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are commonly observed shortly after exposure to trauma, and their initial intensity is associated with a high risk of poor-recovery –. PTSD diagnostics and prognostics are currently based on reported symptoms optimally captured by structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). While these psychological assessment tools show good reliability, and both construct and predictive validity, they have notable limitations. The CAPS, for example, does not capture symptoms frequently co-expressed with PTSD, such as depression and anxiety. It is also only weakly linked objectively measured cognitive performance and other putative biological features –. Additionally, the CAPS solely relies on subjective interpersonal reporting precluding objective indication of the clinical status. These limitations may be responsible for the temporal instability of PTSD diagnosisand for its sub-optimal performance as a guide for long-term individualized clinical management.

Cognitive functioning is one of many dimensions often overlooked in clinical evaluations of post-traumatic psychopathology. Nonetheless, numerous cognitive deficits have been associated with PTSD, including working memory, information processing speed, verbal learning, short-term and declarative memory, attention and executive functioning, response inhibition and attentional switching (see recent meta-analyses). Adaptive cognitive functioning has been linked with resilience and a reduced likelihood of development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Similarly, several brain structure and function characteristic might underlay PTSD clinical manifestations. including lower hippocampal volume – or altered activity and connectivity amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC); structures known to be involved in threat detection, executive function, emotion regulation, and contextual processing. Other structural and functional abnormalities constitute putative predisposing factors for developing PTSD.

### Metabolomics analysis of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in world trade center responders [^5c1da50e]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Growing evidence links PTSD to a host of systemic illnesses including metabolic syndrome, thus suggesting that dysregulated metabolites may be detected in people with PTSD. The current study used an unbiased approach to profile a large set of metabolites and complex lipids. We found HCER(26:1), a hexosylceramide which belongs to the class of sphingolipids associated with PTSD. Hexosylceramide has been found to be associated with mild traumatic brain injury and PTSD, and the effects are influenced by APOE e4 status. Sphingolipids are an important component of the plasma membrane, are highly enriched in the central nervous system (CNS), play a key role in maintaining neuronal health and mediate the inflammatory process. Plasma sphingolipids have been found to be overexpressed in people with PTSD compared with control individuals. Although HCER(26:1) was the only sphingolipid meeting the FDR threshold in this study, 57 of the 61 sphingolipids analyzed showed higher expression in PTSD, thus suggesting that the link between inflammation and PTSD may be mediated by sphingolipids. The current study did not replicate the findings of metabolites significantly associated with PTSD reported in previous studies, possibly in part because of sample differences in sex, age, race/ethnicity and time since trauma, populations sampled, PTSD measure used, and differences in the clinical profiles of participants (PTSD is a heterogeneous disorder).

### Wired for threat: clinical features of nervous system dysregulation in 80 children [^f66f0bef]. Pediatric Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The negative effect of perceived stress on health has become a cultural epidemic. Despite many health implications, the clinical impact of stress on the nervous system is not well understood. This case series describes the symptom profiles of 80 children with nervous system dysregulation attributed to maladaptive neuroendocrine responses to stress.

Methods

We reviewed of 80 children with nervous system dysregulation identified from a single, tertiary care pediatric neurology clinic. Included patients were between five and 17 years of age, with unexplained medical symptoms lasting three months or longer affecting at least four of six neurological domains: (1) somatization, (2) executive function, (3) autonomic function, (4) digestion, (5) sleep, and (6) emotional regulation. Medical symptoms, diagnoses, and detailed social histories were collected.

Results

Of 80 children, 57 were female (71%), 57 were Caucasian (71%), with median age of 14 years. Symptoms had a mean duration of 32 months, and included: 100% somatic symptoms, 100% emotional dysregulation, 92.5% disrupted sleep, 82.5% autonomic dysregulation, 75% executive dysfunction, and 66% digestive problems. Overall, 94% reported chronic or traumatic stressors; adverse childhood experiences were present in 65%.

Conclusions

Perceived stress impacts many functions of the neuroendocrine system through experience-dependent plasticity, resulting in a constellation of symptoms and functional impairments we describe as nervous system dysregulation. The pathophysiology of these symptoms involves dysregulation of subcortical, hormonal, and autonomic circuits, which remain largely untested. Recognition and understanding of maladaptive neurophysiology in stress-related symptoms has important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and advances in health research.

### Top-down and bottom-up control of stress-coping [^b5b43a40]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

One challenge is therefore to understand how glucocorticoids, as master regulators of the stress response, can facilitate coping and adaptation. Another important quest is to identify the role of glucocorticoids in the mechanism underlying individual differences in coping with stress. The extent to which the stress hormone directs early‐life programming of stress and fear circuitry is a hot topic. Current evidence suggests a role of the pleiotropic glucocorticoids in precipitating vulnerability to stress‐related disorders, although the translation of this basic knowledge to clinical practice has been slow. All of these challenges ultimately lead to a fundamental question in stress research: How can the action of glucocorticoids change from protective to harmful? What is the cause and what are the consequences?

It is a sobering thought, however, that this question was equally important at the launch of Journal of Neuroendocrinology as it is today. Nevertheless, there is hope. Big data, as well as genome‐ and imaging technology, have revealed novel aspects of signalling cascades, circuit connectivity and synaptic plasticity that are at the root of the stress‐coping mechanism in higher brain regions. These regions are targets for the glucocorticoids that can coordinate and integrate the various stages of information processing, from perception and appraisal of a stressor to coping and behavioural adaptation. The naturally occurring glucocorticoids (corticosterone in rodents and cortisol/corticosterone in man) act via activation of two types of receptors: mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which were cloned around 1986, 7 when the function of MR and GR was pharmacologically distinguished. 8 Their properties and neuroanatomical localisation provided the rationale to study stress in the brain from gene to behaviour. 9, 10, 11

Hence, in this 30th anniversary issue review, we use knowledge of MRs and GRs to sketch out how bottom‐up glucocorticoid action affects top‐down information processing in higher brain circuits during stress‐coping and adaptation. These actions exerted by the hormones require energy and, in this respect, we highlight the contribution of the fat‐brain axis 12 (Box 1). We conclude with the possible role of glucocorticoids in vulnerability to post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 13

2 THE EFFECTS OF EARLY LIFE ADVERSITY ON PATIENTS WITH

A review of the literature by Franc et al. (2023)summarised that patients with chronic psychosocial stress were likely to have worsened glycaemic control, as measured by HbA1c and continuous blood glucose monitoring studies. Changes in neurohormonal mechanisms, such as chronic activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) system and increased sensitivity of the sympathetic‐adrenal‐medullary (SAM) system, lead to a state where hormones such as adrenaline, cortisol and ghrelin raise blood glucose higher than for a given stimulus in a less stressed person.

Early life trauma has been associated with aberrant stress reactivity due to changes in neurodevelopmental pathways, potential dysbiosis affecting the gut‐brain axis and a general pro‐inflammatory state due to changes in epigenetics. From this research we can extrapolate that people with significant historical or ongoing trauma are likely to experience worsened glycaemic control due to being more reactive to stress.

Furthermore, people who have experienced trauma may present with challenging behaviours associated with mental illness such as depression, anorexia nervosa, complex post‐traumatic stress disorder (C‐PTSD), personality disorders or substance misuse disorders. Comorbidity with mental health conditions affects compliance with monitoring and management of T1DM. The overlap between the patient's psychological state and their physical well‐being could manifest as diabulimia, but may range from not attending routine appointments to failure to follow insulin therapy regimes. Practical approaches to caring for patients with trauma history will be described at the bottom of this commentary.

### An integrated perspective linking physiological and psychological consequences of mild traumatic brain injury [^5decc898]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, studies so far have suggested that sequelae after mTBI have a complex multifactorial etiology. A better understanding of the interaction between factors is warranted, especially regarding the interaction between acute (neuro)physiological and psychological factors. This understanding is needed to develop tailored psychological or pharmacological interventions in patients with mTBI, which are important future research goals. In our opinion, it is worthwhile to study the influence of acute physiological effects (i.e. cellular damage, inflammation, acute stress) after mTBI on neural networks that are important for emotion regulation, and to examine the possible interactions between these physiological effects and psychological factors such as personality characteristics, coping style, childhood psychotrauma or pre-injury mental distress.

### An integrated perspective linking physiological and psychological consequences of mild traumatic brain injury [^f2258686]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The heart as a biomarker of emotion regulation and stress

So far, it can be concluded that the complex interplay between neural networks that are important for emotion regulation (i.e. executive, default mode, and salience network), the autonomic nervous system, and the HPA-axis, determines an individual's capacity to deal with stressful situations. The neurovisceral integration model (NIM) states that resting-state heart rate variability (HRV), defined as the variability of time between heartbeats, is an indirect marker of the function of these neural networks. The heart is under constant inhibitory control of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagal nerve tone), which dominates the sympathetic nervous system, keeping the heart rhythm in balance. Simplistically stated, high resting-state HRV primarily reflects higher parasympathetic activity, whereas low HRV reflects activity of the sympathetic nervous system. With respect to the NIM, high resting state HRV is considered a marker of high vagal tone and thus of adequate function of the neural networks. Emotion regulation difficulties and psychopathological states, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are related to lower HRV. In addition, higher resting state HRV is associated with better working memory performance in healthy people.

The last few years, several studies have been published that report changes in HRV after traumatic brain injury, both at the severe as well as at the mild end of the TBI spectrum. Among other things, it has been shown that lower HRV is related to anxiety and depression after TBI. However, most of these studies were sub-optimally designed, and to our knowledge, no study so far focused on HRV in the acute phase after injury, or on the relationship between HRV and function of neural networks (as measured with fMRI).

### Neuropathology of stress [^9b67b854]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

Stress-related changes in PTSD

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multisystem disorder with multiple comorbidities. PTSD patients have experienced severe, often life-threatening, episodes of stress that cause flashbacks, nightmares and sleep problems, emotional numbness or emotional outbursts, anhedonia, inappropriate startle reflexes and problems with memory and concentration. Notably, the HPA changes in PTSD indicate low cortisol levels consistent with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity. In one particularly intriguing experimental protocol, 40 pairs of identical twins were studied, one of whom participated in the Vietnam war while the other stayed at home. Of those who experienced combat, 43% developed PTSD. They turned out to have smaller hippocampi, but their stay-at-home twin brother did too. In contrast, those who did not develop PTSD had larger hippocampi, and so did their stay-at-home twin as well. A small hippocampus thus seems to be present already prior to the stressful experience and in fact to infer an increased vulnerability to PTSD. This goes back to the idea of either genetic factors, or life history and shaping events during critical development periods, or an interaction between the two, determining hippocampal volume early in life, and putting the individual on a trajectory for (psycho)pathology.

Thus, it remains elusive whether hypercortisolism is indeed responsible for hippocampal shrinkage, since combat-related PTSD is associated with decreased HPA axis activity and steroid feedback super-sensitivity that often lasts for decades after the initial trauma. It has been presumed that early on in the process the HPA axis may have been strongly activated. This is based on the observation that soldiers who had undergone random bombardments in the Korean war displayed markedly increased levels of cortisol, with the highest levels of cortisol in soldiers who had been in the greatest danger. It has therefore been hypothesized that high levels of cortisol at the time of the stressor would result in damage to the hippocampal neurons that may persist for many years after the original trauma and that could lead to reductions in hippocampal volume and subsequent differences in feedback or stress responsivity. However, those victims of rape or motor vehicle accidents who later developed PTSD appeared to have — already a few hours after the traumatic event — lower cortisol levels than victims who had no subsequent psychiatric disorder, or those who developed major depression. Yet, pituitary and adrenal hyperactivity to exogenous CRH and ACTH has been demonstrated in these patients. An increased sensitivity or up-regulation of GRs in PTSD and a pre-existing smaller hippocampal volume thus seems, at present, the best explanation.

### Sex-based contributors to and consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder [^8dfb3934]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Various sex-related biological factors contribute to the differences in PTSD risk, clinical presentation, comorbidity, treatment response, and retention in care. Over the last 3 years, evidence has emerged on specific biological mechanisms that may be driving sex-related patterns in individuals with PTSD. The majority of studies identified in this review, however, were conducted in high-income countries; biological contributors and consequences of adult PTSD will additionally need to be examined in low-to-middle income country settings. Few studies have also been primarily designed, and statistically powered, to investigate sex differences in PTSD. Future studies should adopt an integrated, multi-level biological system approach to investigate the association of epigenetic, genetic, and gene expression signatures in PTSD (e.g. genes underpinning hypocortisolaemia in PTSD), biochemical assays of circulating sex hormones and other HPA axis markers, coupled with assessments of clinical presentation, course, and treatment response and recovery in females and males. This will be the next step in parsing out functional mechanisms that could represent sex-selective targets for therapeutic interventions in PTSD.

### Trauma timing and its impact on brain activation during flexible emotion regulation in PTSD: insights from functional MRI [^ec351839]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder triggered by exposure to traumatic events such as combat, sexual assault, natural disasters, or other severe accidents. The ramifications of PTSD extend beyond immediate psychological distress and include long‐term consequences. Individuals with PTSD frequently experience persistent symptoms, including intrusive memories, flashbacks, avoidance of trauma‐related stimuli, negative alterations in mood and cognition, and heightened arousal (American Psychiatric Association). These symptoms can significantly impair daily functioning, disrupt relationships, and elevate the risk of comorbid conditions such as depression, substance use disorders, and other anxiety disorders (Sareen et al; Pietrzak et al.). Survival analysis indicates that more than one‐third of those with an initial episode of PTSD do not recover even after many years (Kessler). A meta‐analysis estimates that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general population ranges from 5% to 10% (Ozer et al.). The disorder is associated with substantial healthcare costs and productivity loss (Kessler).

Emotional regulation is a key focus in PTSD research. Individuals with PTSD often struggle to manage their emotional responses, leading to increased emotional reactivity and difficulties in handling distress, and impairments in interpersonal relationships (Tull et al.). Emotion regulation flexibility, the ability to adapt emotion regulation strategies to different situations, is crucial for mental health and well‐being. Studies have shown that greater emotion regulation flexibility is associated with lower levels of negative affect and higher levels of positive affect (Aldao et al.). Attentional processes play a crucial role in emotion regulation by directing cognitive resources toward relevant stimuli and facilitating adaptive responses to environmental challenges. Individuals with PTSD often exhibit alterations in attentional processes, particularly in their ability to shift attention between different stimuli or tasks (Pineles et al.). Previous studies have highlighted deficits in attentional control and attentional bias toward threat‐related stimuli in PTSD. Attentional bias refers to the tendency to selectively attend to threatening or trauma‐related cues while neglecting neutral or positive stimuli (Pineles et al; Bardeen et al.). This bias can heighten emotional arousal and interfere with effective emotion regulation strategies, thereby contributing to the maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Therefore, emotion dysregulation is not only a consequence of PTSD but also a factor that perpetuates and exacerbates its symptoms over time (Eftekhari et al.).

### The complex neurobiology of resilient functioning after childhood maltreatment [^3a5d1f51]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Thus, while the neurodegenerative potential of glucocorticoids has robustly been demonstrated in preclinical studies, the underlying mechanisms have not directly translated to human studies of CM. This suggests a more complex picture and a need to consider multiple biological levels (genetics, personality, behaviour, clinical phenotypes) to make sense of the interplay between neuroendocrine and neural factors. One possible explanation for the difficulty in disentangling the causal effects between such processes is that they are not unidirectional, linear or additive, but rather highly dynamic and bidirectional, likely involving non-linear feedback loops between (sub)components of the systems. This highlights the importance of future studies combining large samples with high temporal resolution of measurements as well as quantitative, complex systems approaches that are able to disentangle this web of reciprocal effects. Below, we highlight several cutting-edge tools that may offer researchers at least some traction on this highly complex and multifaceted problem.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^09767869]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD background — definitions and global burden: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is described in DSM–5, text rev., and in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (11th ed.), which distinguishes between a pared-down PTSD and a complex PTSD diagnosis. PTSD is characterized by exposure to a potentially traumatic event or events with persistence of specific trauma-related symptoms beyond initial reactions (defined as several weeks or one month) and functional impairment. Trauma exposure underlies a worldwide 5.6% lifetime prevalence of PTSD, encompassing over 450 million adults and children.

### Multi-domain potential biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in recent trauma survivors [^92960f5c]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The present study evaluates multi-domain objective measurements' ability to identify clusters, which we hypothesize may represent post-traumatic psychopathology subtypes. The term "subtypes" here accounts for different demographics, clinical sub-scales, or symptom severity. To do so, we applied a recently developed three-stage hybrid analytic methodology, termed 3C (categorize, cluster, and classify), to a dataset obtained in 101 individuals recruited from the emergency room shortly after exposure to a traumatic event. The 3C is a semi-unsupervised method that combines theory- and data-driven approaches, therefore used both subjective symptom-driven clinical knowledge (supervised) with state-of-the-art data-driven methods (unsupervised). Our dataset included objective measures obtained from neuroimaging and cognitive testing of recent trauma survivors, within 1 month following the traumatic incident. We assumed that the 3C hybrid analytic approach would unveil a unique set of potential mechanism-related cognitive and neural biomarkers for PTSD, closely tied to pre-existing diagnostic methods.

### Case series: unilateral amygdala ablation ameliorates post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and biomarkers [^f7e21ea1]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe psychobiological disorder associated with hyperactivity of the amygdala, particularly on the right side. Highly selective laser ablation of the amygdalohippocampal complex is an effective neurosurgical treatment for medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy that minimizes neurocognitive deficits relative to traditional open surgery.

Objective

To examine the impact of amygdalohippocampotomy upon symptoms and biomarkers of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Methods

Two patients with well-documented chronic post-traumatic stress disorder who subsequently developed late-onset epilepsy underwent unilateral laser amygdalohippocampotomy. Prospective clinical and neuropsychological measurements were collected in patient 1. Additional prospective measurements of symptoms and biomarkers were collected pre- and post-surgery in patient 2.

Results

After laser ablation targeting the nondominant (right) amygdala, both patients experienced not only reduced seizures, but also profoundly abated post-traumatic stress symptoms. Prospective evaluation of biomarkers in patient 2 showed robust improvements in hyperarousal symptoms, fear potentiation of the startle reflex, brain functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to fear-inducing stimuli, and emotional declarative memory.

Conclusion

These observations support the emerging hypothesis that the right amygdala particularly perpetuates the signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and suggests that focal unilateral amydalohippocampotomy can provide therapeutic benefit.

### Cross-sectional association between posttraumatic stress and cognition is moderated by pulmonary functioning in world trade center responders [^371680ca]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Elucidating the mechanisms of how the respiratory system moderates the association between higher reporting of PTSD symptomatology and cognitive outcomes is an important gap in knowledge. Chronic inflammation of the lungs can release cytokines into the blood, resulting in neuronal damage to negatively impact cognitive function. – The associations of PTSD and pulmonary function with cognition might also be reflective of shared underlying neurodegenerative mechanisms. While these links are not fully understood, the latency period between WTC exposure and emerging cognitive impairment two decades later, is suggestive of an insidious cascade of underlying mechanisms. Abnormal spirometry and PTSD are thought to operate via the same underlying neurobiological mechanisms that eventually affect cognition. Potential mechanisms include oxidative stress pathways that affect the central nervous systems leading to adverse health outcomes, – inflammatory disease pathways that alter inflammatory processes, such as c-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, and immunological pathways that solicit a chronic immune response which may alter DNA methylation patterns potentially associated with peripheral immune dysregulation. PTSD is thought to operate via several biological pathways, including genes hypothesized to play a role in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system, causing physiological dysregulation of allostasis and high "allostatic load"; pathways regulating synaptic plasticity, oxytocin signaling, altered inflammatory processes, and pathways related to cardiovascular and metabolic disease, the nervous system, and cancer. These hypotheses suggest that PTSD is possibly better defined as an pathological neurobiological stress response that results in psychological symptoms, rather than being defined by the psychological symptoms themselves. Indeed the moderation of better pulmonary function in the presence of worse symptomatology support the notion that possibly prior system integrity, or the tendency for complex systems in the body to respond more efficiently to high "allostatic load", might mitigate consequences of neurobiological stress on cognition, better respond to challenges, and return to equilibrium. Future research will need to elucidate further common mechanisms that might be driving physical and mental health pathways.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters associated with an indicator of heart rate variability: the ADVANCE cohort study [^7f7d156e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart rate variability (HRV) is governed by sympathetic and parasympathetic regulatory systems. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may influence these systems and consequently affect cardiovascular functioning.

Methods

The sample consisted of 860 UK male military personnel approximately half of whom had sustained physical combat injuries in Afghanistan. HRV was measured via Root-Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) in normal heart beats and PTSD using a self-report questionnaire (Posttraumatic Checklist-Civilian version (PCL)). Associations between probable PTSD status (PCL score ≥ 50) and symptom clusters (avoidance behaviours, emotional numbing, hyperarousal and intrusive thoughts) with HRV were examined. Bootstrap inclusion frequencies and model averaging were employed prior to regression modelling to identify the most important symptom clusters associated with RMSSD.

Results

Probable PTSD status was not associated with log RMSSD [-11.6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -22.2%, 4.1%). Increases in severity of emotional numbing were associated with reductions in RMSSD, with a - 1.1% (95%CI -2.1%, -0.2%) decrease in the geometric mean of RMSSD per point increase on the emotional numbing subscale.

Limitations

High levels of comorbidity with depression/anxiety; possible endogeneity/bidirectionality due to PCL including both psychological and physiological symptoms.

Conclusions

Emotional numbing, the symptom cluster including symptoms such as anhedonia, cognitive dysregulation and feeling distant from other people, was associated with lower HRV whilst overall PTSD status was not. These results lend support to the hypothesis that different PTSD symptom clusters may have unique effects on the cardiovascular system, and that particular symptom clusters of PTSD or combinations thereof may be associated with distinctive cardiovascular profiles.

### Reframing postconcussional syndrome as an interface disorder of neurology, psychiatry and psychology [^9265d5e6]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic dizziness is another good example of symptom clustering. The commonest causes following mTBI are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (40%) and vestibular migraine (34%). Vestibular migraine is associated with other migrainous symptoms as discussed above but, perhaps surprisingly, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is also associated with cognitive impairments and heightened anxiety, especially if left untreated.

Relationship to psychiatric disorders

Mild TBI increases the risk of developing a subsequent psychiatric condition nearly threefold. However, trying to distinguish psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder from the effects of a mTBI can be challenging due to symptom overlap, yet has important implications for symptom persistence (Table 3). It is important to remember that symptom overlap can obscure diagnostic clarity, 50% of people with depression who have not had a TBI meet the criteria for moderate to severe PCS. Alongside the psychosocial impact of head injury, it is of course also possible for depression and anxiety to be related to structural brain injury, either as a result of macroscopic damage or triggering of a secondary inflammatory process.

Table 3
Diagnoses and important differentials for persistent symptoms post head injury from DSM-5

There also remains stigma surrounding mental health diagnoses, which results in a higher likelihood of misattributing the cognitive changes to the injury, rather than potentially reversible psychological or psychiatric causes. The unfortunate consequence of this is that appropriate, evidence-based treatment may not be accessed in a timely way, subsequently worsening the treatment responsiveness and prognosis of the psychiatric condition.

Functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder

Functional neurological disorder is characterized by internal inconsistency, typically demonstrated by the complaint of abnormal function in a system that can be demonstrated (usually clinically, but sometimes by investigation) to be capable of normal function. Over 80% of people with functional neurological disorder report a health event near to the onset of functional symptoms. These events, which include accidental injuries, are typically minor and would be expected to improve and not produce lasting symptoms in their own right.

This preceding discussion clearly has relevance for the development of persistent symptoms after mTBI. The immediate and lasting physical and psychological consequences of accidents and injuries causing TBI could undoubtedly act as triggers to the onset of functional neurological disorder and/or somatic symptom disorder in some people, also interacting with pre-morbid risk factors and subsequent behaviours such as fear avoidance. Positive diagnosis of such symptoms is possible within normal clinical practice, and diagnostic explanation according to best practice is typically a positive and empowering experience for patients.

### Multi-domain potential biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in recent trauma survivors [^f97b5387]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study implemented an innovative semi-unsupervised computational approach that unveiled novel variables correlated with the morbidity classification of recent trauma survivors. The method utilized current DSM-based PTSD diagnostic categories and other clinical severity measures of depression and anxiety, as well as a classification of cognitive and neural potential biomarkers. Intriguingly the two subtypes of PTSD severity were also associated with known neurocognitive mechanisms underlying post-traumatic stress symptoms. Our results point to an alternative approach for identifying objective variables linked to PTSD severity subtypes (high and low), based on testing within a single session shortly after exposure to trauma. If successful, this objective computational classification may further guide mechanism-driven diagnosis and interventions for PTSD (e.g. cognitive remediation or neuromodulation treatments). If performed on a broader data set and with more clinical measures and potential biomarkers, this hybrid approach may refine post-traumatic diagnostic subtypes, playing an important role in the clinical management of recent trauma survivors.
