## Question

Hi does cystine-c express renal function

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "cystine-c" directly expresses renal function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the term is actually "cystatin C", not "cystine", because that affects the entire interpretation. Then, I should verify the biological basis linking cystatin C to glomerular filtration. Next, I will review guideline and regulatory positions to anchor clinical relevance. After that, I should examine comparative performance versus creatinine and combined equations. I will then assess prognostic and reclassification data, consider limitations and non-GFR determinants, and finally synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats [^114q3FTC] [^114shjdX].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology first because "cystine" is an amino acid, whereas the renal filtration biomarker is "cystatin C"; the provided sources repeatedly discuss cystatin C in CKD evaluation, so the intended question is about cystatin C as a kidney function marker, not cystine as an amino acid, and I will proceed on that basis while keeping this assumption explicit [^114q3FTC] [^113Z68RZ].

> Let me consider the biological basis next. Cystatin C is produced at a near-constant rate by all nucleated cells, is freely filtered at the glomerulus, and is then almost completely reabsorbed and catabolized in proximal tubules without tubular secretion; accordingly, its serum concentration rises as GFR falls, making it an endogenous filtration marker whose serum level inversely tracks glomerular filtration function [^113KiU9n] [^116jrgJK].

> I should confirm where authoritative guidelines position cystatin C. KDIGO 2024 recommends using cystatin C, when available, together with creatinine to estimate GFR category, and explicitly supports combined creatinine–cystatin C equations for CKD evaluation; contemporary reviews of CKD-EPI equations likewise note the highest reliability for the creatinine–cystatin C combination, especially after removal of race terms, reinforcing its role in clinical staging and decision-making [^114shjdX] [^114q3FTC].

> Next, I should review head-to-head accuracy evidence. Hold on, I should double-check the pivotal data: the NEJM CKD-EPI analysis showed that the combined creatinine–cystatin C equation improved precision and accuracy over equations using either marker alone, reducing the interquartile range of error and increasing the proportion of estimates close to measured GFR, which supports the practice of using both markers when accuracy matters most [^1151ULyu].

> But wait, what about clinical risk reclassification and detection of impairment in real-world populations? In U.S. adults with diabetes, cystatin C–based eGFR identified more individuals with reduced kidney function than creatinine alone and aligned better with vascular complications and mortality signals; similarly, cohort analyses show patients classified as CKD by cystatin C carry higher risks of death and cardiovascular events than those classified by creatinine alone, suggesting cystatin C better captures clinically relevant reductions in filtration in at-risk groups [^114WEiZ8] [^111UZCtE] [^114JnGDr].

> I need to check regulatory acceptance because it reflects operational clinical trust. FDA labeling for several antisense/PMO therapies with nephrotoxicity concerns requires or recommends baseline and on-treatment serum cystatin C, alongside urinalysis, to monitor kidney safety, indicating regulatory recognition of cystatin C as a practical, sensitive index of renal function changes in drug safety monitoring [^1153Cscv] [^112GVmyi] [^1133E75J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing limitations. Cystatin C is primarily a filtration marker, but levels can be modestly influenced by non-GFR factors such as inflammation, thyroid status, obesity, and corticosteroid use; moreover, like creatinine, cystatin C does not directly measure kidney function but reflects it via concentration changes with altered filtration, and both markers can be affected by assay and biologic variability, underscoring why combined equations and clinical context are preferred [^114h6MDC] [^113Z68RZ] [^115iTuYf].

> Hmm, wait a minute — some studies in general populations have found little advantage for cystatin C alone over creatinine, and at the individual level all eGFR equations carry notable imprecision; this strengthens the case for using the creatinine–cystatin C combination when stakes are high and for confirming with measured GFR in edge cases rather than assuming any single marker "perfectly" expresses renal function [^112Ww3US] [^111SjC68].

> Let me now translate this into practice. When muscle mass is atypical, creatinine is unreliable, or eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant, adding cystatin C and using the combined CKD-EPI equation is the recommended path; in drug dosing for narrow therapeutic windows and in hospital settings, cystatin C can improve pharmacokinetic targeting and safety monitoring, which aligns with guideline advice to incorporate cystatin C where available and clinically consequential [^113Z68RZ] [^116EABqS] [^114shjdX].

> In conclusion, I should be precise with wording: cystatin C is a validated endogenous filtration marker whose serum concentration closely and inversely reflects glomerular filtration and thus "expresses" renal filtration function in clinical practice, though it is not a direct measurement of GFR; the strongest accuracy and risk discrimination are achieved when cystatin C is used alongside creatinine in CKD-EPI combined equations, as endorsed by KDIGO and supported by comparative accuracy studies [^114q3FTC] [^114shjdX] [^1151ULyu].

Cystine-C does not express renal function. The correct biomarker is **cystatin C**, which is a validated endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [^1151ULyu] and is recommended by KDIGO 2024 for confirming CKD diagnosis and staging when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant [^114shjdX] [^114q3FTC]. Cystatin C is **less affected by muscle mass, diet, and race** than creatinine [^113Z68RZ], making it especially useful in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when creatinine is unreliable [^113KiU9n] [^116EABqS]. It is not a direct measure of renal function but a surrogate marker that improves accuracy when combined with creatinine [^1151ULyu] [^111SjC68].

---

## Biological basis of cystatin C as a renal function marker

Cystatin C is a 13 kDa cysteine protease inhibitor produced at a constant rate by all nucleated cells [^113Z68RZ]; it is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost completely reabsorbed and catabolized in the proximal tubules, with minimal urinary excretion [^116jrgJK]. Serum levels rise as **GFR declines** [^1151ULyu], making it a sensitive indicator of reduced kidney function.

---

## Clinical utility of cystatin C in renal function assessment

Cystatin C is widely used to **estimate GFR (eGFR)** and is particularly valuable when creatinine is unreliable due to muscle mass, diet, or race. It is recommended to confirm CKD diagnosis and staging when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant [^114shjdX].

---

## Advantages of cystatin C over traditional renal function markers

Cystatin C offers several **advantages over creatinine**:

- **Muscle mass independence**: Less affected by muscle mass, age, sex, or race [^113Z68RZ], improving accuracy in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or chronic illness [^113KiU9n].

- **Early detection**: More sensitive to mild or early kidney dysfunction [^113KiU9n], enabling earlier intervention [^114kUbmq].

- **Prognostic value**: Strongly associated with mortality and cardiovascular events [^112TjbJh], providing additional prognostic information [^1159eA8a].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors in cystatin C measurement

Despite its advantages, cystatin C **has limitations**:

- **Non-renal influences**: Levels can be affected by inflammation, thyroid dysfunction [^113Z68RZ], corticosteroids, smoking, and obesity.

- **Assay variability**: Differences in assays and lack of standardization can affect accuracy and comparability [^114h6MDC] [^113Z68RZ].

- **Cost and availability**: More expensive and less widely available than creatinine, limiting routine use [^113Z68RZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

KDIGO 2024 **recommends cystatin C** to confirm CKD diagnosis and staging when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant [^114shjdX]. It is particularly useful in older adults [^111ouKGC], those with low muscle mass, or when creatinine is unreliable [^113KiU9n] [^116EABqS].

---

## Comparison with other renal function biomarkers

| **Biomarker** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Creatinine | Widely available and inexpensive | Influenced by muscle mass, diet, age, sex, and race [^113Z68RZ], and less sensitive to early kidney dysfunction [^113KiU9n] |
| Cystatin C | - Less influenced by muscle mass, diet, age, sex, race <br/> - More sensitive to early kidney dysfunction <br/> - Strong prognostic value [^112TjbJh] | - Influenced by inflammation, thyroid dysfunction, corticosteroids, smoking, obesity <br/> - More expensive <br/> - Less widely available [^113Z68RZ] |
| Beta-2 microglobulin | Useful in specific clinical scenarios | Limited availability and less commonly used [^113KiU9n] [^115ZeVaX] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where cystatin C is particularly useful

Cystatin C is **especially useful** in:

- **Older adults**: Less influenced by age-related muscle loss [^111ouKGC].

- **Low muscle mass**: More accurate in sarcopenia or chronic illness [^113Z68RZ].

- **Early kidney dysfunction**: More sensitive to mild impairment [^114kUbmq].

- **Unreliable creatinine**: Useful when creatinine is affected by diet, muscle mass, or race.

---

## Conclusion

Cystatin C is a **validated endogenous marker of GFR** [^1151ULyu] and is recommended by KDIGO 2024 to confirm CKD diagnosis and staging when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant [^114shjdX]. It is less affected by muscle mass, diet, and race than creatinine, making it particularly useful in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when creatinine is unreliable [^113Z68RZ]. However, its levels can be influenced by inflammation, thyroid dysfunction, corticosteroids, smoking, and obesity, and testing is more expensive and less widely available than creatinine [^113Z68RZ].

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C [^1151ULyu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine are routinely used; however, they are imprecise, potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C is an alternative filtration marker for estimating GFR.

- **Methods**: Using cross-sectional analyses, we developed estimating equations based on cystatin C alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5,352 participants from 13 studies. These equations were then validated in 1,119 participants from 5 different studies in which GFR had been measured. Cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials.

- **Results**: Mean measured GFRs were 68 and 70 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area in the development and validation data sets, respectively. In the validation data set, the creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations that used creatinine or cystatin C alone. Bias was similar among the three equations, with a median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 3.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the combined equation, compared with 3.7 and 3.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the creatinine equation and the cystatin C equation (P = 0.07 and P = 0.05), respectively. Precision was improved with the combined equation (interquartile range of the difference, 13.4 vs. 15.4 and 16.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m², respectively [P = 0.001 and P 30% of measured GFR, 8.5 vs. 12.8 and 14.1, respectively [P < 0.001]).

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to requirements for laboratories, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of both creatinine and cystatin C in clinical laboratories, depending on available resources.

### Cystatin C as a biomarker for estimating glomerular filtration rate [^113KiU9n]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is rarely measured in clinical practice due to the complexity of the measurement process. As a result, kidney function is typically estimated using validated equations that incorporate easily accessible data such as age, sex, race, and serum creatinine as the filtration marker. Recent research suggests that cystatin C may serve as a superior alternative to creatinine for inclusion in GFR estimating equations. This article aims to evaluate the benefits and limitations of using cystatin C as a filtration biomarker.

Recent findings indicate that cystatin C has fewer non-GFR determinants compared to serum creatinine. The use of serum cystatin C eliminates limitations related to dietary intake and muscle mass, factors that affect serum creatinine levels. Cystatin C may offer a more accurate estimation of GFR and has shown a stronger association with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Cystatin C presents certain advantages over serum creatinine in GFR estimation. Utilizing cystatin C as a confirmatory biomarker could be advantageous in determining medication dosages or as a confirmatory test for patients with an uncertain diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.

### Cystatin C is ready for clinical use [^116EABqS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to raise awareness of clinical scenarios where cystatin C offers clear and immediate benefits as an alternative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) biomarker to supplement creatinine. Another objective is to address the estimated GFR (eGFR) controversy, particularly in medication prescribing for agents with narrow therapeutic windows, where better GFR estimation enhances medical care.

Recent findings suggest that equations including cystatin C predict GFR more accurately than serum creatinine across various age groups, with more significant effects in acutely ill patients. Numerous studies have assessed medication dosing based on either GFR estimate, with vancomycin being the most frequently studied drug. Cystatin C better predicted vancomycin's target levels and elimination. Approaches to medication dosing and monitoring that incorporate cystatin C concentrations have consistently resulted in better achievement of drug trough levels. Additionally, cystatin C eliminates the need for the race coefficient required in creatinine-based eGFR equations, which has been criticized for introducing unnecessary imprecision and assumptions in GFR estimation.

In summary, hospital laboratories must make cystatin C available for clinical care to enhance the safety and efficacy of medications with narrow therapeutic windows.

### Traditions and innovations in assessment of glomerular filtration rate using creatinine to cystatin C [^111SjC68]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best index for kidney function. Estimated GFR (eGFR), calculated from endogenous filtration markers like serum creatinine and cystatin C, is widely used in clinical practice for chronic kidney disease diagnosis and prognostication. This review aims to examine the evolution of GFR estimating equations, the nuances of eGFR interpretation, and the utility of eGFR in drug dosing.

- **Recent findings**: The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) serum creatinine eGFR equation was recently updated to exclude the race variable, and the CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation demonstrated the highest reliability. Although calculated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault has been traditionally used for drug dosing, the use of eGFR is slowly being adapted by the Food and Drug Administration for pharmacokinetic studies. However, the individual-level accuracy of eGFR using the CKD-EPI 2021 equations remains low, with the distribution of measured GFR at a given eGFR value spanning several CKD stages.

- **Summary**: Although methods of estimating GFR have improved in terms of population measures of reliability, all have significant individual-level inaccuracies, which can pose issues when clinical decision-making is contingent on the actual level of GFR. Modern methods of GFR measurements should be made widely available to enhance individualized patient decision-making.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^114DHf8S]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, we initially observed that serum creatinine and cystatin C levels are only correlated in individuals with extremely high levels. We also noted that individuals with correlated serum creatinine and cystatin C levels were enriched for having chronic kidney disease (CKD). Based on these observations, we conducted 60 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for six traits: four estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) formulas, creatinine levels, and cystatin C levels. We stratified individuals by eight different levels of the creatinine biomarker or CKD status (disease, healthy).

The GWAS for all four eGFR formulas across the 10 different individual groups identified overlapping loci with correlated effect sizes. However, the loci effect sizes are most similar between GWAS conducted on individuals in the top creatinine level percentiles and CKD patients, as well as between GWAS conducted on individuals in the bottom creatinine level percentiles and healthy individuals. The GWAS for creatinine and cystatin C levels conducted on individuals in the bottom percentiles and healthy individuals formed two distinct clusters, suggesting that they are respectively composed of genetic loci associated with either creatinine metabolism or cystatin C metabolism. In contrast, the GWAS for creatinine and cystatin C levels conducted on individuals in the top percentiles and CKD patients tended to cluster together.

These observations suggest that GWAS for creatinine and cystatin C conducted in individuals with low percentiles identifies loci associated with the metabolism of the biomarkers, where the GWAS for creatinine and cystatin C levels cond…

### Circulating cystatin C is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular outcomes, development of renal impairment, and long-term mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease: The LIPID study [^1159eA8a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics and cystatin C levels

There were no clinically important differences in baseline risk factors between the 7,863 patients with biomarker measurements and the 1,151 without such assays.

At baseline, patients with higher cystatin C levels were typically older, with a higher proportion of women and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). They more frequently exhibited other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, atrial fibrillation, elevated white blood cell count, as well as measures of angina and dyspnea were prevalent among this group. These factors were associated with the increased use of cardiovascular medications.

Cystatin C levels were significantly correlated with an overall measure of the risk of recurrent coronary heart disease (reCHD) events, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality or myocardial infarction (MI), as estimated by the LIPID risk score (P < 0.001). Importantly, there was no significant difference in baseline cystatin C levels between those randomized to pravastatin or placebo.

### Understanding estimated glomerular filtration rate: Implications for identifying chronic kidney disease [^1174GHm5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be estimated using serum markers such as serum creatinine (SCr) or cystatin C. This review presents new insights into estimated GFR based on theory, validation studies, SCr assay standardization, cystatin C, and longitudinal comparison with measured GFR.

- **Recent findings**: The estimation of GFR by SCr differs in health and in chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to differences in GFR range and in creatinine production between these two populations. Among populations with normal baseline GFR, there is a more rapid decline in measured GFR than in SCr-based estimated GFR. While elevated SCr is specific for CKD, other disease processes may lead to elevated cystatin C. Validation is improved by refitting equation coefficients to compare populations, recognizing the asymmetry between estimated GFR and measured GFR, and using residual plots instead of Bland-Altman plots to assess bias.

- **Summary**: As a screening test, SCr should be interpreted as a marker of CKD probability in the context of the patient's clinical presentation. Measured GFR or creatinine clearance may be helpful in high-risk patients with normal SCr levels. GFR estimating equations should be reserved for patients with identified CKD. Standardized SCr and cystatin C assays are needed.

### Age and cystatin C in healthy adults: a collaborative study [^111HJT6V]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Kidney function declines with age, but a substantial portion of this decline has been attributed to the higher prevalence of risk factors for kidney disease at older ages. The effect of age on kidney function has not been well described in a healthy population across a wide age spectrum.

- **Methods**: The authors pooled individual-level cross-sectional data from 18,253 individuals aged 28–100 years in four studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease cohort. Kidney function was measured by cystatin C. Clinical risk factors for kidney disease included diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and heart failure.

- **Results**: Across the age range, there was a strong, non-linear association of age with cystatin C concentration. This association was substantial among participants free of clinical risk factors for kidney disease; mean cystatin C levels were 46% higher in participants aged 80 and older compared with those under 40 years (1.06 versus 0.72 mg/L, P < 0.001). Participants with one or more risk factors had higher cystatin C concentrations for a given age, and the age association was slightly stronger (P < 0.001 for age and risk factor interaction).

- **Conclusions**: There is a strong, non-linear association of age with kidney function, even in healthy individuals. An important area for research will be to investigate the mechanisms that lead to deterioration of kidney function in older adults.

### Cystatin C- and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate, vascular disease, and mortality in persons with diabetes in the U.S [^114WEiZ8]. Diabetes Care (2014). High credibility.

Serum cystatin C is an alternative to serum creatinine for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as cystatin C is less influenced by age and muscle mass. Among persons with diabetes, we compared the performance of GFR estimated using cystatin C (eGFR cys) with that using creatinine (eGFR cr) for identifying reduced kidney function and its association with diabetes complications.

We analyzed data from adult participants in the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with available cystatin C (N = 4,457). Kidney function was dichotomized as preserved (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) or reduced (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) using the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) cystatin C and the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equations.

Among 778 persons with diabetes, the prevalence of reduced kidney function was 16.5% using eGFR cr and 22.0% using eGFR cys. More persons with diabetes were reclassified from preserved kidney function by eGFR cr to reduced kidney function by eGFR cys than persons without diabetes (odds ratio 3.1 [95% CI 1.9–4.9], P < 0.001). The associations between lower eGFR and higher prevalence of albuminuria, retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary artery disease were robust regardless of filtration marker. Similarly, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with lower eGFR cr and eGFR cys. Only lower eGFR cys was significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality.

More persons with diabetes had reduced kidney function by eGFR.

### Circulating cystatin C is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular outcomes, development of renal impairment, and long-term mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease: The LIPID study [^112Guu5f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Our data also show that in those patients with normal eGFR‐creatinine at baseline, plasma cystatin C was a significant predictor of the development of renal dysfunction, independent of baseline eGFR‐creatinine and other CKD risk factors. This finding is consistent with other studies that have demonstrated plasma cystatin C's ability to predict the onset of CKD and its progression to end‐stage renal disease. However, because this association was no longer significant with eGFR‐creatinine‐cystatin C in the statistical model, the prognostic value of circulating cystatin C appears to be particularly related to its superior estimation of renal function, with no significant effects unrelated to this mechanism.

Numerous cardiovascular biomarkers have been described. In addition to their important role in the diagnosis of MI (cardiac troponins) and heart failure (BNP and NT‐proBNP), biomarkers may have other applications. Our data confirm the possibility of refining risk stratification with the estimation of cystatin C levels. However, the possible incorporation of biomarkers into usual practice mandates other considerations, such as the availability and reliability of the assay and its cost‐effectiveness. The assay for circulating cystatin C is not widely available and is expensive compared with the measurement of creatinine. Although it is recommended in the United Kingdom for possible measurement in those with a creatinine‐GFR 45 to 59 mL/min per 1.73 m² and no albuminuria, general use of eGFR‐cystatin in the primary care setting in the United Kingdom has been shown to be limited.

### Gfr estimating equations: Getting closer to the truth [^111WVSKN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The application of serum creatinine and cystatin C in patients with CKD has been limited to using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Criteria for choosing the best GFR estimating equation include:

- **Accuracy in estimating measured GFR**: The equation should be able to estimate the measured GFR accurately.

- **Optimal discrimination of clinical outcomes**: The equation should effectively differentiate between clinical outcomes.

- **Association with CKD risk factors and outcomes similar to that of measured GFR**: While this criterion is the most important, it has been widely overlooked.

Notably, these criteria are often not in agreement. The primary issue with eGFR is that non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine and cystatin C, along with their surrogates (age, sex, and race), are associated with CKD risk factors and outcomes. This association can lead to a distorted understanding of CKD. Although eGFR based on serum creatinine appears to be less biased than eGFR based on cystatin C, the use of eGFR should be limited to settings where actual GFR knowledge is relevant and where eGFR is more informative about GFR than serum creatinine or cystatin C alone. Such settings include staging CKD severity by GFR and dosing medications cleared by glomerular filtration.

Alternatively, serum creatinine and cystatin C without eGFR can be more effectively applied and interpreted in settings such as the diagnosis of CKD, tracking the longitudinal progression of CKD, and developing prognostic models for CKD.

### Cystatin C and cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or mildly reduced kidney function: Results from the AtheroGene study [^112TjbJh]. European Heart Journal (2009). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cystatin C is a promising marker to reliably reflect renal function. The role of cystatin C in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and normal or mildly reduced kidney function is the subject of investigation.

In 2,162 patients across the full spectrum of CAD, baseline cystatin C concentrations were measured. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≤ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² (n = 295) were excluded. Among those with complete follow-up information (n = 1,827), 66 cardiovascular deaths were documented during a median follow-up of 3.65 years. Logarithmically transformed, standardized cystatin C was associated with cardiovascular death [hazard ratio: 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59–2.37, P < 0.001]. A potential threshold effect was observed; patients in the upper quartile had a 3.87-fold (95% CI: 2.33–6.42; P < 0.001) risk of mortality compared with the pooled lower quartiles. This risk association remained robust after adjustment for potential confounders, including classical risk factors and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. Serum creatinine was not associated with the outcome in this group of patients with normal renal function.

The results of this prospective study indicate that cystatin C is a potent predictor of cardiovascular mortality beyond classical risk factors in patients with CAD and normal or mildly reduced kidney function.

### Vyondys 53 [^1153Cscv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to assess safety**: Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting Vyondys 53. Consider measurement of glomerular filtration rate prior to initiation of Vyondys 53. Monitoring for kidney toxicity during treatment is recommended. Obtain the urine samples prior to infusion of Vyondys 53 or at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Vyondys 53 is 30 milligrams per kilogram administered once weekly as a 35 to 60-minute intravenous infusion via an in-line 0.2 micron filter. If a dose of Vyondys 53 is missed, it may be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled dose.

### Rounding creatinine, cystatin C or both: Impact on discordance group assignment and GFR-estimating equation performance [^115gr1Fw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Accurate estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is integral to routine medical care and clinical decision-making. Guidelines endorse using serum creatinine as the initial test and an estimating equation to derive GFR. If this estimated GFR (eGFR) is considered less accurate, for example, due to lower-than-average muscle mass, confirmatory testing with muscle mass–independent cystatin C is recommended. However, evidence relating to the performance of cystatin C as a GFR marker in real-world settings is lacking and is confined to research settings.

A recent study addressing this knowledge gap found that eGFR based on both creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys) outperforms GFR derived from creatinine (eGFRcr) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) in real-world settings, particularly when eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant. Importantly, this and another recent study presented cystatin C values as integers, a less informative format than the typically used real numbers, especially when rounding from one to zero decimals. However, the impact of rounding levels of kidney function markers on the performance of GFR-estimating equations has never been quantified. This is a crucial area to explore, as rounding may influence the performance of GFR-estimating equations, potentially compromising clinical decision-making and invalidating conclusions from studies.

### The chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation combining creatinine and cystatin C accurately assesses renal function in patients with cirrhosis [^116MPvAk]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal function has a pivotal prognostic value in patients with cirrhosis. Its critical prognostic impact is indicated by the inclusion of serum creatinine (Cr) levels in the widely used MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score, which is an accurate predictor of 3-month mortality in cirrhosis. Consequently, the MELD score is widely used for determining priority for liver transplantation.

An accurate evaluation of renal function is of utmost importance in patients with cirrhosis and those with acute-on-chronic liver failure, especially those being evaluated for transplantation. Although the serum level of Cr is an easily measurable and widely available marker of excretory renal function, it has limitations in assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with cirrhosis. Due to malnutrition, low protein intake, decreased Cr synthesis, and increased tubular secretion, GFR in patients with cirrhosis is overestimated when estimated by serum Cr levels.

The equations that are most frequently used to estimate GFR include Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI); however, these equations require corrections for age, gender, ethnicity, and body weight. Estimated (e)GFR based on serum levels of cystatin C (CysC) has been claimed to be more accurate than Cr-based equations. CysC is a nonglycosylated, low molecular weight protein of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. In renal impairment, its levels increase faster than Cr levels.

### Filtration markers may have prognostic value independent of glomerular filtration rate [^117D2N9J]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum levels of creatinine, cystatin C, or β trace protein allow estimation of GFR, but whether these markers contribute additional prognostic information beyond that reflected in GFR is unknown. Here, we analyzed data from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, which provided baseline levels of these markers for 816 participants with a median follow-up of 16.6 years. We examined associations between the reciprocals of these filtration markers and (125)I iothalamate GFR, expressed per SD, with kidney failure and mortality.

In univariate analysis, lower GFR and higher levels of each filtration marker were associated with a higher risk for all outcomes. After adjustment for GFR in a Cox proportional hazards model:

- **Higher creatinine**: Associated with a higher risk for kidney failure but a lower risk for all-cause mortality.
- **Higher cystatin C and β trace protein**: Associated with a higher risk for both kidney failure and all-cause mortality.

In models including either cystatin C or β trace protein, the association of GFR with all-cause mortality was no longer significant after the addition of the filtration marker, suggesting the possibility of multicollinearity. In summary, after adjustment for GFR, levels of creatinine, cystatin C, and β trace protein remained directly associated with kidney failure but differed with respect to their associations with mortality. These differences may be a result of non-GFR-related associations of filtration markers, residual confounding by GFR, or collinearity between the filtration markers and GFR. β trace protein and cystatin C seem…

### Method of glomerular filtration rate estimation affects prediction of mortality risk [^115Rkm6s]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Decreased kidney function, determined using a serum creatinine-based estimation of GFR, is associated with a higher risk for mortality from cardiovascular disease. Equations incorporating cystatin C improve the estimation of GFR, but whether this improves the prediction of risk for mortality is unknown. We measured cystatin C on 6,942 adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File, including all participants who had high serum creatinine (> 1.2 mg/dL for men; > 1.0 mg/dL for women) or were older than 60 years and a 25% random sample of participants who were younger than 60 years. We estimated GFR using equations that included standardized serum creatinine, cystatin C, or both. Participant data were linked to the National Death Index. A total of 1,573 (22.7%) deaths (713 deaths from cardiovascular disease) occurred during a median of 8 years.

Lower estimated GFR based on cystatin C was strongly associated with higher risk for overall and cardiovascular mortality across the range of normal to moderately decreased estimated GFR. Creatinine-based estimates of GFR resulted in weaker associations, with the association between estimated GFR and all-cause mortality reversed at higher levels of estimated GFR. An equation using both creatinine and cystatin C (in addition to age, race, and gender) resulted in weaker associations than equations using only cystatin C (with or without age, race, and gender). In conclusion, despite better performance in terms of estimating GFR, equations based on both cystatin C and creatinine do not predict mortality more accurately.

### Cystatin C is not a better estimator of GFR than plasma creatinine in the general population [^112Ww3US]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is complicated and costly. Therefore, GFR is commonly estimated by assessing creatinine or cystatin C concentrations. Estimates based on cystatin C predict cardiovascular disease better than creatinine. These estimates have been hypothesized to be superior to those based on creatinine when the GFR is near the normal range. To test this, we measured GFR by iohexol clearance in a representative sample of middle-aged (50–62 years) individuals in the general population, excluding those with coronary heart or kidney disease, stroke, or diabetes mellitus.

Bias, precision (median and interquartile range of estimated minus measured GFR (mGFR)), and accuracy (percentage of estimates within 30% of mGFR) of published cystatin C- and creatinine-based GFR equations were compared in a total of 1621 patients. The cystatin C-based equation with the highest accuracy (94%) had a bias of 3.5 and precision of 18 ml/min per 1.73 m², whereas the most accurate (95%) creatinine-based equation had a bias of 2.9 and precision of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m². The best equation, based on both cystatin C and creatinine, had a bias of 7.6 ml/min per 1.73 m², precision of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m², and accuracy of 92%.

Thus, estimates of GFR based on cystatin C were not superior to those based on creatinine in the general population. The better prediction of cardiovascular disease by cystatin C compared to creatinine measurements, found by others, may be due to factors other than GFR.

### Creatinine-or cystatin C-based equations to estimate glomerular filtration in the general population: Impact on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease [^112nyjAm]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The present study has illustrated large discrepancies in the prevalence of stage 3 CKD, depending on the biomarker used to estimate the GFR. Transitioning from strictly creatinine-based equations (MDRD or CKD-EPI) to cystatin C-based or combined equations will reduce the prevalence of stage 3 CKD by half, which is highly significant from an epidemiological perspective. Additional studies are thus necessary before we can confidently determine the true prevalence of CKD in the general population.

### Cystatin C as a predictor of renal recovery and in-hospital mortality in patients with acute kidney injury and liver cirrhosis [^1143uPrw]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

This retrospective study aimed to investigate the association between baseline serum creatinine and cystatin C levels with outcomes such as in-hospital mortality and recovery of kidney functions in hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and liver cirrhosis. It demonstrated that peak serum cystatin C was a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality in these patients. In addition, baseline serum cystatin C levels were identified as a significant predictor of renal recovery.

Patients with hypertension were more common in the renal recovery group compared to the non-recovery group. This unexpected finding does not suggest that hypertension directly promotes the recovery of kidney function in patients with AKI and liver cirrhosis. Rather, it may reflect other influencing factors such as patient characteristics or closer clinical monitoring among hypertensive patients. Further studies are warranted to explore the complex relationship between hypertension and AKI recovery.

Serum cystatin C levels have been found to be more sensitive markers for estimating kidney functions and as early predictors of kidney dysfunction. Moreover, there is a growing body of research investigating its relationship with clinical outcomes. Several studies demonstrated a strong association between serum cystatin C and mortality in the general population, reflecting proinflammatory and proatherogenic states. Additionally, serum cystatin C was found to be significantly associated with mortality, regardless of kidney function, among elderly patients admitted to intensive care.

### Impact of cystatin C levels on infarct size and hemorrhage volume in acute cerebral stroke [^116tjm8u]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Studies have indicated that serum levels of cystatin C, a sensitive marker of renal function, are significantly associated with cerebral vascular events. However, the influence of cystatin C on infarct size and hemorrhage volume in acute cerebral stroke has not been well established. A total of 222 patients with cerebral infarction and 69 patients with cerebral hemorrhage, as well as 122 healthy controls, were included in this study. Patients were further divided into subgroups according to infarct size and hemorrhage volume. Serum levels of cystatin C were significantly higher in cerebral-stroke patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). Patients with larger infarcts or larger hemorrhage volumes had higher levels of cystatin C (p < 0.05). Certain factors affect cystatin C levels in cerebral-stroke patients, and they could be considered independent predictors of infarct size and hemorrhage volume in acute cerebral stroke events.

### Cystatin C and the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis [^115Stzuq]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction is a risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis. Unlike serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate, cystatin C reflects renal dysfunction independent of factors such as sex, weight, and race. We investigated whether baseline serum levels of cystatin C predict major cardiovascular events in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis and compared the predictive value of cystatin C to these established markers of renal function.

- **Methods**: We prospectively studied 1004 of 1286 consecutive patients with carotid ultrasound scanning. Patients were followed for the occurrence of major cardiovascular events, a composite of myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary bypass graft, stroke, and death.

- **Results**: During a median of 3 years of follow-up, we recorded 346 major cardiovascular events in 311 patients. The risk for a first major cardiovascular event increased significantly with increasing quintiles of cystatin C; hazard ratios ranged from 1.18 to 1.94 for the highest versus the lowest quintile (P < 0.001 for trend). Creatinine levels showed no significant association with major cardiovascular events, and for glomerular filtration rate, only the lowest quintile was moderately associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Cystatin C was significantly and gradually associated with future cardiovascular events in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. In contrast, neither serum creatinine nor estimated glomerular filtration rate were significant predictors.

### Serum cystatin C performs similarly to traditional markers of kidney function in the evaluation of donor kidney function prior to and following unilateral nephrectomy [^1126x6cb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background and objectives. It is essential that candidates for kidney donation be carefully screened to ensure the safety of donation and monitored following unilateral nephrectomy, as previous experience has demonstrated a loss of kidney function of up to 50% following donation. The low-molecular-weight protein cystatin C (cysC) has been introduced as an alternative to serum creatinine for the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In particular, serum cysC is sensitive to detecting mild GFR reduction between 60 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m², making it a potentially effective screening and monitoring test in live kidney donors.

Design, setting, participants, and measurements. We examined the utility of cysC as compared to other traditional measures of kidney function, including serum creatinine and 24-hour urine for creatinine clearance, in the evaluation of kidney function in 51 consecutive live kidney donors both prior to and following unilateral nephrectomy.

- **Results**: This is the largest experience reported in the living kidney donor population. We found that living kidney donors at our center lost approximately 30–35% of kidney function following unilateral nephrectomy, and this remained stable for more than one year. Furthermore, we observed that cysC correlated well with all other markers of kidney function and detected acute changes in kidney function immediately post-nephrectomy.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, however, cysC did not confer any advantage with respect to the preoperative assessment of kidney function or for monitoring following live kidney donation as compared to more traditional measures.

### Circulating cystatin C is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular outcomes, development of renal impairment, and long-term mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease: The LIPID study [^1177daXK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

There has been considerable interest in the cardiorenal syndrome. A recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association describes the syndrome as encompassing "a spectrum of disorders involving both the heart and kidneys in which acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ".

Cystatin C is listed as one of the clinically relevant biomarkers in the syndrome. If cystatin C is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, particularly heart failure, which was not examined in our study, this could be another mechanism for an increase in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Conversely, if cystatin C is a risk factor for developing CKD, this might also be a mechanism for an increase in CVD events.

Finally, large Mendelian randomization studies and their meta-analysis appear to argue against cystatin C being causal and directly implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. This is because genetic variants that increase cystatin C levels have not been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In contrast to our findings, these observations lend support to considering circulating cystatin C to be a powerful marker, rather than a mediator of vascular risk, including in those with a "normal" estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### Use of cystatin C levels in estimating renal function and prognosis in patients with chronic systolic heart failure [^117Tx8cq]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), including creatinine and creatinine-based formulae, are inaccurate in extremes of GFR and substantially biased in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

- **Objective**: To investigate whether serum cystatin C levels would be a better, more accurate, and simple alternative for estimation of GFR and prognosis in CHF.

- **Design**: Cohort study.

- **Setting**: Chronic heart failure.

- **Patients, interventions and main outcome measure**: In 102 CHF patients, the correlation between GFR as estimated by (125)I-iothalamate clearance (GFR(IOTH)), the modification of diet in renal disease formula (GFR(MDRD)), and cystatin C was investigated. The combined endpoint consisted of the first occurrence of all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, or admission for CHF within 24 months.

- **Results**: Mean age was 58 ± 12 years; 77% were male. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28 ± 9%. Mean GFR(IOTH) was 75 ± 27 ml/min/1.73 m², while median cystatin C levels were 0.80 (0.69–1.02) mg/l. GFR(IOTH) was strongly correlated with all renal function estimates, including 1/cystatin C (r = 0.867, p < 0.001). GFR(IOTH) was better predicted by 1/cystatin C compared to 1/serum creatinine (z = 3.12, p = 0.002), but equally predicted compared to GFR(MDRD) (z = 0.92, p = 0.356). Serum 1/cystatin C was a strong independent predictor of prognosis (HR: 2.27 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.63), comparable to GFR(MDRD).

- **Conclusions**: Cystatin C is an accurate and easy estimate of renal function with prognostic properties superior to serum creatinine and similar to creatinine-based methods.

### Association of cystatin C with adverse outcomes [^113ocXsk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss recent studies that have evaluated the determinants of cystatin C, focusing on its relationship with mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and non-cardiovascular outcomes.

Recent findings in the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Study indicate that cystatin C is associated with demographic characteristics independently of the measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albeit to a lesser extent than creatinine. In patients with established chronic kidney disease (CKD), cystatin C shows a strong inverse correlation with measured GFR, suggesting that while it may have other determinants, it primarily reflects kidney function. Several cohort studies, particularly among older adults, have demonstrated that cystatin C is linearly associated with mortality, CVD, and non-CVD outcomes, whereas creatinine is mainly associated with risk in individuals with more advanced kidney disease. A recent study has also revealed that changes in kidney function ascertained by cystatin C, even within the relatively normal range, correlate with subsequent CVD and all-cause mortality among older adults.

In summary, cystatin C appears to capture the association of mild kidney disease with an increased risk of mortality, CVD, and non-CVD outcomes. Future studies should evaluate whether cystatin C can enhance medical decision-making and lead to favorable patient outcomes.

### Serum creatinine and serum cystatin C as an index of muscle mass in adults [^111NPLAh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine reflects both muscle mass and kidney function. Serum cystatin C has recently been recommended as an additional marker for estimating kidney function, and the use of both markers together may provide an index of muscle mass. This review aims to describe the biological basis and examine recent research regarding the relationship of these markers to muscle mass in a range of adult populations and settings.

- **Recent findings**: This review identified 67 studies, 50 of which had direct measures of muscle mass. Almost all found relationships between serum creatinine, cystatin C, and muscle mass and related outcomes. Most studies have been performed in older adults, but similar associations were found in the general population, as well as in subgroups with cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other morbid conditions. The creatinine to cystatin C ratio was the measure examined most often, but other measures showed similar associations across studies.

- **Summary**: Measures of serum creatinine and cystatin C together can serve as an index of muscle mass. They are simple and reliable measures that can be used in clinical practice and research. Further study is needed to determine actionable threshold values for each measure and their clinical utility for testing and intervention.

### Update on cystatin C: Incorporation into clinical practice [^111yHKyZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Kidney function monitoring using creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimation is a routine part of clinical practice. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease. In this review and update, we summarize the overall literature on cystatin C, critically evaluate recent high-impact studies, highlight the role of cystatin C in recent kidney disease guidelines, and suggest a practical approach for clinicians to incorporate cystatin C into practice. We conclude by addressing frequently asked questions related to implementing cystatin C use in a clinical setting.

### Circulating cystatin C is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular outcomes, development of renal impairment, and long-term mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease: The LIPID study [^116VYNat]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The association of elevated circulating levels of cystatin C with adverse medium‐ and long‐term outcomes underscores the importance of CKD as a cardiovascular risk factor in our aging societies. However, our data also support the additional prognostic value for major CVD events and long‐term mortality of measurement of circulating cystatin C beyond allowing improved assessment of eGFR.

### Cystatin C identifies chronic kidney disease patients at higher risk for complications [^114JnGDr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Although cystatin C is a stronger predictor of clinical outcomes associated with CKD than creatinine, the clinical role for cystatin C is unclear. We included 11,909 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and assessed risks for death, cardiovascular events, heart failure, and ESRD among persons categorized into mutually exclusive groups on the basis of the biomarkers that supported a diagnosis of CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²): creatinine only, cystatin C only, both, or neither. We used CKD-EPI equations to estimate GFR from these biomarkers.

In MESA, 9% had CKD by the creatinine-based equation only, 2% had CKD by the cystatin C-based equation only, and 4% had CKD by both equations; in CHS, these percentages were 12%, 4%, and 13%, respectively. Compared with those without CKD, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality in MESA were: 0.80 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.26) for CKD by creatinine only; 3.23 (95% CI 1.84 to 5.67) for CKD by cystatin C only; and 1.93 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.92) for CKD by both. In CHS, the adjusted HR were 1.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.21), 1.78 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.08), and 1.74 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.93), respectively. The pattern was similar for cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure, and kidney failure outcomes.

In conclusion, among adults diagnosed with CKD using the creatinine-based CKD-EPI equation, the adverse prognosis is limited to the subset who also have CKD according to the cystatin C-based equation. Cystatin C may have a role in identifying persons with CKD who have the highest risk for complications.

### The chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation does not improve the underestimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in people with diabetes and preserved renal function [^114wRg7L]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

However, more recent studies using cystatin C values harmonized against an international reference standard and the CKD-EPI 2012 cystatin equation have failed to show that estimating GFR based on cystatin C compared with creatinine provides a substantial improvement in accuracy. The use of GFR estimating equations based on a combination of serum cystatin C and creatinine values may provide a more accurate way of estimating GFR in routine clinical practice. Unfortunately, we did not have cystatin C values measured using a harmonized assay to derive cystatin-eGFR or cystatin-creatinine-eGFR values to allow a comparison of bias, precision, and accuracy with creatinine-eGFR or values in the study.

- **Study limitations**: The limitations of this study include the relatively small number of participants, especially in the longitudinal study, and that the longitudinal study included only two estimates of GFR for each participant. Furthermore, in our longitudinal study, stored serum samples for re-assay were not available, and estimates of eGFR were based on creatinine levels that were stored in our database and that were originally measured by the Jaffe reaction. An attempt to harmonize these historical results with an enzymatic method was attempted, but it is appreciated that this approach has its limitations. Possibly, longer studies examining the relationship between eGFR, measured GFR, and multiple clinical and biochemical variables at multiple time points in a prolonged longitudinal study of people with and without diabetes will help to delineate the reasons why the current approach may fall short.

BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Whilst our longitudinal cohort will not have adequate power to detect differences in progression, our estimates of the accuracy of eGFR (study 1), patterns and determinants of progression (study 2), and intra-individual biological variation (study 3) can be combined in a model to evaluate the impact of alternative monitoring strategies on detection of progression to stage 4 CKD. True GFR values will be modelled over time for representative cohorts of people, and the performance of alternative monitoring strategies in detecting progression to stage 4 CKD (varying in timing and choice of eGFR equation) will be simulated, utilizing estimates of measurement error and accuracy. Outcome variables that will be assessed include false positive progression rates, and the sensitivity and delays in detecting progression.

### How best to estimate glomerular filtration rate? Novel filtration markers and their application [^115ZeVaX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is an increasing health burden. Estimating equations using serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C facilitate the assessment of kidney function as reflected in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Reduced eGFR is associated with increased risk for numerous adverse outcomes and is an important aspect in many clinical situations. However, equations are suboptimal in some clinical settings. The review focuses on approaches to improve the estimation of GFR and aims to familiarize the reader with the underlying methodological hypotheses on how new markers could contribute to improving the overall performance of estimating equations.

Recent findings suggest that low molecular weight proteins such as β-trace-protein and β-2-microglobulin, as well as newly discovered metabolites, show promise as new filtration markers, as they might be beneficial in populations in which creatinine or cystatin C are inaccurate. We propose that the combination of multiple novel markers, alone or in combination with creatinine, cystatin C, or demographics, can potentially improve GFR estimation. For special populations such as dialysis patients, separate equations have been developed to estimate residual kidney function.

GFR estimating equations are an essential part of routine clinical practice but have limitations. The use of multiple markers combined in a single equation appears to be the most promising approach. Future research is required to validate proposed equations in diverse populations.

### Serum creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio as a potential muscle mass surrogate and racial differences in mortality [^114VZQVP]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate equations and muscle mass are powerful markers of health and mortality risk. However, the serum creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio may be a better indicator of health status. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between the creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio and all-cause mortality when stratifying patients by race and chronic kidney disease status.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study examining Black and non-Black US veterans between October 2004 and September 2019, with baseline cystatin C and creatinine data from those not on dialysis during the study period. Veterans were divided into four creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio groups: < 0.75, 0.75- < 1.00, 1.0- < 1.25, and ≥ 1.25. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality subsequent to the cystatin C laboratory measure.

- **Results**: Among 22,316 US veterans, the mean (± standard deviation) age of the cohort was 67 ± 14 years, 5% were female, 82% were non-Black, and 18% were Black. The proportion of Black veterans increased across the creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio groups. In the fully adjusted model, compared with the reference (creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio: 1.00- < 1.25), a creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio < 0.75 had the highest mortality risk among both Black and non-Black veterans (non-Black: hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 3.01 [2.78–3.26] and Black: 4.17 [3.31–5.24]). A creatinine-to-cystatin-ratio ≥ 1.25 was associated with lower death risk than the referent in both groups (non-Black: HR [95% CI]: 0.89 [0.8]).

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^112ndPMe]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

These observations underscore the multifaceted nature of biomarker metabolism and kidney function regulation. While creatinine-specific and cystatin C-specific loci play distinct roles in biomarker metabolism, many of the loci shared between creatinine and cystatin C are involved in kidney function, gene expression, and disease. Previous studies have shown that cystatin C levels are associated with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, it is not known whether these associations are due to impaired kidney function caused by these diseases or if there is a direct link between cystatin C levels and other biomarkers, such as cholesterol. Our findings that cystatin C-specific loci are associated with HDL levels in the bottom99 dataset support previous observations suggesting that these associations represent a direct link.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^115iTuYf]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). High credibility.

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. These biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism. In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both non-overlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism and overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function. Conversely, GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### Association between the serum creatinine to cystatin C ratio and cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and older adults in China: A nationwide cohort study [^114vXwkN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the largest disease burdens globally. Recent epidemiological surveys indicate that, as risk factors such as health inequities and population aging intensify, the incidence of CVD, which had been declining for decades, has recently shown an upward trend. Meanwhile, the number of deaths attributable to CVD has also increased from the late 2010s to 2020. Globally, the prevalence of CVD rose from 271 million cases in 1990 to 523 million in 2019, nearly doubling; the number of CVD-related deaths also increased from 12.1 million in 1990 to 18.6 million in 2019. Given the immense burden imposed by CVD, identifying its risk factors and implementing preventive measures has become critically important. Despite advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVD, the global incidence of CVD continues to rise. This trend may stem from both suboptimal control of traditional risk factors and the existence of residual risk factors beyond current management strategies. Therefore, exploring novel risk factors for CVD is of significant clinical importance and potential.

### Microalbuminuria, but not cystatin C, is associated with carotid atherosclerosis in middle-aged adults [^114PZpB2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Cystatin C, a marker of renal function, has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults, but few data are available in middle-aged adults. Moreover, no study has compared cystatin C and microalbuminuria as risk factors for CVD outcomes in middle-aged adults, and it is not known whether cystatin C is related to an early stage of atherosclerosis.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the relationships between serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum cystatin C (all divided into tertiles), microalbuminuria, and carotid atherosclerosis in a population-based random sample of 523 adults aged 35–64 years from the Seychelles (Indian Ocean). GFR was estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation. Intima-media thickness (IMT) was assessed by B-mode ultrasound.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study sample was 52 years, and 55% were women. Carotid IMT was higher in participants with microalbuminuria (802 vs. 732 microm, P < 0.001) and was inversely associated with GFR tertiles (from 728 to 809 microm, P for trend = 0.002). IMT was not associated with cystatin C or creatinine (P for trend = 0.10 and 0.16, respectively). In multivariate analyses adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, the association between microalbuminuria and IMT remained (P = 0.047), while the association between GFR and IMT disappeared (P for trend = 0.33).

- **Conclusions**: Microalbuminuria, but not cystatin C, is associated with carotid atherosclerosis beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors among middle-aged adults.

### Gestational and age-specific cystatin C reference intervals for newborns [^115aPUd5]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cystatin C (CysC) references are useful for monitoring renal function in neonates. However, the standard CysC references in newborn infants have not been determined. The aim of this study was to establish a useful reference range for CysC in newborns.

- **Study design**: Serum CysC levels were measured in 1,919 blood samples from 1,044 newborns during their first 28 days of life. CysC levels were analyzed for associations between subgroups dichotomized by postnatal age (PA) and gestational age (GA). The serum CysC reference intervals were determined according to the PA and GA. The associations between the serum CysC level and other biochemical parameters, as well as perinatal factors, were also analyzed.

- **Results**: In this study, the mean GA was 35.8 ± 2.9 weeks and the birth weight (BW) was 2,614 ± 697g. Reference ranges of serum CysC were determined, and a general decreasing trend of CysC levels was observed as the GA increased. CysC levels differed significantly among the PA and GA categories (p < 0.001). Serum CysC levels were relatively stable throughout the GA range but were impacted by the white blood cell count within the first postnatal 24 hours. Moreover, CysC levels always correlated positively with serum creatinine concentrations (p < 0.001). Serum creatinine levels were influenced by multiple factors, including BW, GA, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and blood urea nitrogen.

- **Conclusion**: Reference levels of serum CysC should be determined according to the PA and GA. In contrast to creatinine, serum CysC is a reliable index.

### Update on cystatin C: New insights into the importance of mild kidney dysfunction [^114kUbmq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Using cystatin C, a novel serum marker of kidney function, several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Studies have questioned, however, whether cystatin C is predominantly a measure of kidney function. This review summarizes the research literature on cystatin C.

- **Recent findings**: One longitudinal study in patients with diabetes found cystatin C to approximate glomerular filtration rate measures over four years much better than creatinine. Studies in several cohorts found cystatin C to be linearly associated with mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure risk, whereas creatinine predicted increased risk only in subjects with the worst kidney function. One study, however, found that increased age, male sex, increased height and weight, smoking, and higher C-reactive protein levels were associated with cystatin C after adjustment for creatinine clearance, which may suggest nonrenal influences on cystatin C concentrations.

- **Summary**: Cystatin C appears to capture the association of mild kidney dysfunction with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and death. Future research needs to evaluate whether cystatin C will have an important role in clinical medicine.

### Age and sex influence cystatin C in adolescents with and without type 1 diabetes [^117C4K68]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

To compare serum cystatin C levels, a novel biomarker of renal function, in adolescents with and without type 1 diabetes and to determine what factors affect cystatin C levels, cystatin C was measured in youth aged 12–19 years with (n = 259, diabetes duration 9 ± 3 years, HbA(1c) 8.9 ± 1.6%) and without diabetes (n = 78). Data were compared by diabetes status, and linear regression was used to determine factors affecting cystatin C.

Cystatin C (0.698 ± 0.083 vs. 0.688 ± 0.127 mg/L, P = 0.40) was similar by diabetes status. In multiple linear regression, cystatin C was associated with age and serum creatinine in nondiabetic subjects, and sex, age, and serum creatinine in subjects with diabetes (P < 0.05).

These data suggest sex differences and age-related changes in cystatin C in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. An understanding of these changes is needed to determine the potential role of cystatin C as a marker of renal function in this population.

### Viltepso [^112GVmyi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to assess safety**: Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting Viltepso. Consider measurement of glomerular filtration rate prior to initiation of Viltepso. Monitoring for kidney toxicity during treatment is recommended. Obtain the urine samples prior to infusion of Viltepso or at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Viltepso is 80 mg/kg administered once weekly as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. If a dose of Viltepso is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled dose time.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^111dFPsn]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). High credibility.

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. However, these biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration.

- **Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**: Based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys), these studies have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism. In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both non-overlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism as well as overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function, whereas GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### Serum cystatin C concentration compared with other markers of glomerular filtration rate in the old old [^111ouKGC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

To assess serum cystatin C, compared with other markers of renal function, as a marker of renal function in the old old (aged 85 and older), a cross-sectional analysis was conducted. The data were obtained from medically stable individuals aged 70 and older in a geriatric ward at a university hospital in Belgium.

Forty-eight patients (17 men and 31 women), with a mean age of 84.4 ± 6.3 years, who were without acute illness or overt malignancy 7 days after admission, were included in this study. Of these participants, twenty-five were aged 85 and older.

Blood samples and 24-hour urine collections were taken from each patient to determine serum creatinine, serum cystatin C levels, serum albumin, and creatinine clearance. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. On the same day, clearance of 51chromium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid was performed in all patients as the criterion standard of GFR.

The results showed that serum creatinine (r = 0.68), serum cystatin C (r = 0.62), urinary creatinine clearance (r = 0.57), the Cockcroft-Gault formula (r = 0.82), and the MDRD formula (r = 0.65) correlated significantly with GFR (P < 0.0001). Regression analysis indicated that serum cystatin C and serum creatinine were comparable markers of renal function (Y = 0.442 ± 0.007 x GFR and Y = 0.494 ± 0.01 x GFR, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed a similar area under the curve for serum cystatin C and serum creatinine (P = 0.5) in detecting renal impairment (GFR < 80 mL/min/1.73 m²).

### Cystatin C as biomarker for the evaluation of renal outcome in AL amyloidosis [^112ZLdp2]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

The established staging system and the criteria for renal response assessment have been validated in various cohorts. However, there are limitations, especially in the use of eGFR based on creatinine. Creatinine is not a reliable filtration marker in glomerular diseases. Moreover, in AL amyloidosis, patients often experience weight loss and have lower muscle mass, so creatinine and creatinine-based eGFR calculations may not accurately reflect renal function. Therefore, alternative methods to evaluate renal function could be useful. We have previously proposed the use of the 24-hour proteinuria to eGFR ratio as an alternative to the Palladini staging system and renal response criteria, which have been externally validated and compared, showing similar performance to the established Palladini criteria. However, both are based on serum creatinine and 24-hour proteinuria, thus having similar limitations.

Compared with creatinine, CysC rises earlier in acute kidney injury, has a shorter half-life, is only distributed extracellularly, and is relatively freely filtered by the glomeruli. It is reabsorbed and catabolized in the proximal tubule, which may make it a more accurate marker for the detection of early kidney damage. Additionally, CysC is less affected by parameters such as muscle mass, race, gender, and age, leading to higher sensitivity for kidney injury and a more precise estimation of glomerular filtration than creatinine. There are data supporting that patients with lower cystatin C-based eGFR compared to creatinine-based eGFR, meaning patients with higher serum CysC, have a worse prognosis.

### Estimating GFR using serum cystatin C alone and in combination with serum creatinine: a pooled analysis of 3,418 individuals with CKD [^116jrgJK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Serum cystatin C was proposed as a potential replacement for serum creatinine in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation. We report the development and evaluation of GFR-estimating equations using serum cystatin C alone and in combination with serum creatinine and demographic variables.

- **Study design**: Test of diagnostic accuracy.

- **Setting & participants**: Participants screened for three chronic kidney disease (CKD) studies in the United States (n = 2,980) and a clinical population in Paris, France (n = 438).

- **Reference test**: Measured GFR (mGFR).

- **Index test**: Estimated GFR using the four new equations based on serum cystatin C alone, as well as serum cystatin C and serum creatinine, or both combined with age, sex, and race. New equations were developed using linear regression with log GFR as the outcome in two-thirds of the data from US studies. Internal validation was performed in the remaining one-third of the data from US CKD studies, while external validation was conducted in the Paris study.

- **Measurements**: GFR was measured by using urinary clearance of iodine-125-iothalamate in the US studies and chromium-51-EDTA in the Paris study. Serum cystatin C was measured using the Dade-Behring assay, and standardized serum creatinine values were used.

- **Results**: Mean mGFR, serum creatinine, and serum cystatin C values were 48 mL/min/1.73 m² (5th to 95th percentile, 15 to 95), 2.1 mg/dL, and 1.8 mg/L, respectively. For the new equations, coefficients for age, sex, and race were significant in the equation with serum cystatin C, but were 2- to 4-fold smaller than in the equation with serum creatinine.

### Amondys 45 [^1133E75J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to assess safety**: Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) should be measured before starting Amondys 45. Consider measurement of glomerular filtration rate prior to initiation of Amondys 45. Monitoring for kidney toxicity during treatment is recommended. Obtain the urine sample prior to infusion of Amondys 45 or at least 48 hours after infusion [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Amondys 45 is 30 milligrams per kilogram administered once weekly as a 35 to 60-minute intravenous infusion via an in-line 0.2 micron filter. If a dose of Amondys 45 is missed, it may be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled dose.

### The chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation combining creatinine and cystatin C accurately assesses renal function in patients with cirrhosis [^115zUBQ1]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of renal function in cirrhotic patients is still challenging. To find the best test for determining the true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in cirrhotic patients, this study prospectively compared measured (m)GFR, the gold standard, with estimated (e)GFR using equations based on serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C.

- **Methods**: GFR was measured by sinistrin clearance using the bolus method in 50 patients with cirrhosis (Child Turcotte Pugh score A, B, and C) and 24 age-matched healthy subjects as controls. Measured (m)GFR was compared to eGFR using bias, accuracy at 10% and 30%, as well as correlation coefficients.

- **Results**: Creatinine-based equations generally overestimated GFR in patients with cirrhosis, showing a bias (average difference between mGFR and eGFR) of -40 (CG), -12 (MDRD), and -9 (CKD-EPI-Cr) ml/min/1.73 m². Cystatin C-based equations underestimated GFR, especially in patients with Child Turcotte Pugh score C (bias 17 ml/min/1.73 m² for CKD-EPI-CysC). Of these equations, the CKD-EPI equation that combines creatinine and cystatin C (CKD-EPI-Cr-CysC) showed a bias of 0.12 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to measured GFR.

- **Conclusions**: The CKD-EPI equation that combines serum creatinine and cystatin C measurements shows the best performance for accurately estimating GFR in cirrhosis, especially at advanced stages.

### Cystatin C concentration as a risk factor for heart failure in older adults [^112FKNp7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Previous studies that evaluated the association of kidney function with incident heart failure may be limited by the insensitivity of serum creatinine concentration for detecting abnormal kidney function.

- **Objective**: To compare serum concentrations of cystatin C (a novel marker of kidney function) and creatinine as predictors of incident heart failure.

- **Design**: Observational study based on measurement of serum cystatin C from frozen sera obtained at the 1992–1993 visit of the Cardiovascular Health Study. Follow-up occurred every 6 months.

- **Setting**: Adults 65 years of age or older from 4 communities in the United States.

- **Participants**: 4384 persons without previous heart failure who had measurements of serum cystatin C and serum creatinine.

- **Measurements**: Incident heart failure.

- **Results**: The mean (± SD) serum concentrations of cystatin C and creatinine were 82 ± 25 nmol/L (1.10 ± 0.33 mg/L) and 89 ± 34 micromol/L (1.01 ± 0.39 mg/dL), respectively. During a median follow-up of 8.3 years (maximum, 9.1 years), 763 (17%) participants developed heart failure. After adjustment for demographic factors, traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease status, and medication use, sequential quintiles of cystatin C concentration were associated with a stepwise increased risk for heart failure in Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratios, 1.0, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.75], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.94], 1.58 [95% CI, 1.18 to 2.12], and 2.16 [95% CI, 1.61 to 2.91]). In contrast, quintiles of serum creatinine concentration were not associated with increased risk for heart failure.

### Cystatin C- and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate, vascular disease, and mortality in persons with diabetes in the U.S [^111UZCtE]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Serum cystatin C is an alternative to serum creatinine for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), since cystatin C is less influenced by age and muscle mass. Among persons with diabetes, we compared the performance of GFR estimated using cystatin C (eGFRcys) with that using creatinine (eGFRcr) for the identification of reduced kidney function and its association with diabetes complications.

- **Research design and methods**: We analyzed data from adult participants from the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with available cystatin C (N = 4,457). Kidney function was dichotomized as preserved (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) or reduced (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) using the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) cystatin C and the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equations.

- **Results**: Among 778 persons with diabetes, the prevalence of reduced kidney function was 16.5% using eGFRcr and 22.0% using eGFRcys. More persons with diabetes were reclassified from preserved kidney function by eGFRcr to reduced kidney function by eGFRcys than persons without diabetes (odds ratio 3.1 [95% CI 1.9–4.9], P < 0.001). The associations between lower eGFR and higher prevalence of albuminuria, retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary artery disease were robust regardless of the filtration marker. Similarly, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with lower eGFRcr and eGFRcys. Only lower eGFRcys was significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality.

In conclusion, more persons with diabetes had reduced kidney function by eGFRcys than by eGFRcr.

### What should European nephrology do with the new CKD-EPI equation [^113Z68RZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

We could consider changing the analyte from creatinine, or adding an analyte to creatinine as a marker for kidney function. In this respect, cystatin C has received the most attention. Unlike creatinine, cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells and not just by myocytes. Therefore, its serum concentration is not dependent on muscle mass.

The CKD-EPI research group demonstrated that new eGFR equations incorporating both creatinine and cystatin C, while omitting race, are more accurate and lead to smaller differences between Black participants and non-Black participants compared to new equations without race using creatinine alone. Moreover, using cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine strengthens the association between eGFR and the risks of death and kidney failure across diverse populations.

Unfortunately, cystatin C is not widely available for clinical use because not every clinical chemistry lab offers its measurement, and the costs are generally considerably higher than for serum creatinine. Additionally, cystatin C is not entirely independent of specific subject characteristics; for instance, it is increased in obesity, hyperthyroidism, and inflammatory states, and steroids also elevate cystatin C values. Furthermore, the standardization of cystatin C measurement has not yet been fully optimized. Efforts should be made to make cystatin C available at lower costs and to improve its standardization.

Currently, measuring cystatin C for GFR estimation is especially advised for subjects with clear abnormal muscle mass for their age and sex.

### Age, gender, and race effects on cystatin C levels in US adolescents [^113JQrsy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the normal range of serum cystatin C and identify factors associated with its variability, contrasting with factors known to influence creatinine levels within the general US adolescent population.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: Serum cystatin C and creatinine levels were measured in 719 participants aged 12 to 19 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national cross-sectional survey conducted between 1988 and 1994. Gender- and race/ethnicity-specific ranges for cystatin C and creatinine were calculated, and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to assess factors contributing to the variability in cystatin C and creatinine levels.

- **Results**: The mean serum cystatin C level was 0.84 mg/L, being higher in male than in female individuals, and higher in non-Hispanic white versus non-Hispanic black and Mexican American individuals. Conversely, the mean serum creatinine level was 0.71 mg/dL, higher in males compared to females, but lower in non-Hispanic white and Mexican American individuals compared to non-Hispanic black individuals. Unlike creatinine, which increases with age from 12 to 19 years, cystatin C levels decrease, particularly in females. After adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, uric acid and blood urea nitrogen were significantly associated with cystatin C levels.

- **Conclusions**: Serum cystatin C is significantly related to gender, age, race/ethnicity, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen levels in adolescents.

### Factors other than glomerular filtration rate affect serum cystatin C levels [^114h6MDC]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Cystatin C is an endogenous glomerular filtration marker; hence, its serum level is affected by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To study what other factors might affect its blood level, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3,418 patients, which included a pooled dataset of clinical trial participants and a clinical population with chronic kidney disease. The serum cystatin C and creatinine levels were related to clinical and biochemical parameters, and errors-in-variables models were used to account for errors in GFR measurements. The GFR was measured as the urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate and 51Cr-EDTA. Cystatin C was determined at a single laboratory, while creatinine was standardized to reference methods, with levels of 2.1 ± 1.1 mg/dL and 1.8 ± 0.8 mg/L, respectively.

After adjustment for GFR, cystatin C was found to be 4.3% lower for every 20 years of age, 9.2% lower for female gender, but only 1.9% lower in blacks. Diabetes was associated with 8.5% higher levels of cystatin C and 3.9% lower levels of creatinine. Higher C-reactive protein, higher white blood cell count, and lower serum albumin were associated with higher levels of cystatin C and lower levels of creatinine. Adjustment for age, gender, and race had a greater effect on the association of factors with creatinine than cystatin C. Hence, we found that cystatin C is affected by factors other than GFR, which should be considered when the GFR is estimated using serum levels of cystatin C.
