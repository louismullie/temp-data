## Question

Does UHC HMO choice select cover Farxiga or Jardiance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether UnitedHealthcare (UHC) HMO Choice Select plans cover Farxiga (dapagliflozin) and Jardiance (empagliflozin), and what typical access conditions look like. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the general coverage landscape for SGLT2 inhibitors across US plan types. Then, I should verify how HMO formularies typically handle these agents and whether UHC's commercial plans are likely to include them. Next, I will review prior authorization and step-therapy patterns that commonly apply. After that, I should check cost-sharing expectations and any Medicare-specific pricing context that might influence commercial coverage. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer and outline next steps for confirming plan-specific details and navigating access barriers.

> Let me first confirm the class and agents in question. Farxiga (dapagliflozin) and Jardiance (empagliflozin) are SGLT2 inhibitors with FDA-approved indications spanning glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, heart failure risk reduction across EF phenotypes, and chronic kidney disease risk reduction, which underpins their strong presence in cardiorenal guidelines and formularies nationwide [^111TsbpE] [^114v9fYd] [^111CwBAi].

> Next, I should review the national coverage patterns for SGLT2 inhibitors to set expectations. Wait, let me verify the comparative coverage by plan type. Large cross-sectional formulary analyses show that Medicare plans are most likely to cover at least one SGLT2 inhibitor without prior authorization or step therapy, followed by commercial/employer plans, with Medicaid most likely to require prior authorization; this suggests that major commercial carriers, including UHC, commonly include SGLT2 inhibitors on formularies, albeit often with utilization management [^112DtSf9] [^1113nxfs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a specific UHC HMO product. I need to check whether HMO structure itself predicts coverage or restriction intensity. Observational analyses of second-line diabetes medication selection found no clear association between HMO versus PPO structure and likelihood of receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, implying that formulary design and cost-sharing policies, rather than HMO status per se, drive access; thus, UHC HMO Choice Select may still cover Farxiga and Jardiance, but I should confirm the exact formulary and tier placement for that specific plan [^1138NXB7] [^1166FJfK].

> I will now examine utilization management patterns that typically apply. Let me think about prior authorization and step therapy. Commercial plans frequently impose prior authorization and step therapy for SGLT2 inhibitors, with step therapy being particularly common in employer-sponsored coverage; for example, one national analysis found step therapy for dapagliflozin applied to 40% of commercial covered lives, whereas Medicare had far lower step-therapy rates, reinforcing that UHC commercial HMOs are likely to require PA and/or step therapy even if the drugs are covered [^112DtSf9].

> Next, I should review cost-sharing expectations. I should double-check the median co-payments by plan type. Across plans with reported co-pay data, median monthly co-payments for dapagliflozin were substantially higher in commercial and Medicare plans than in Medicaid, with commercial plans often around $40–$60 per month depending on tier, while Medicaid co-pays were much lower; this helps frame out-of-pocket expectations for UHC HMO Choice Select members, though exact tier and co-pay will vary by the specific formulary [^1141GK5L] [^116UjFV8].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about Medicare pricing signals that could influence commercial coverage? I need to check whether Medicare drug price negotiation has targeted these agents. The Inflation Reduction Act's first negotiation cycle included both Farxiga and Jardiance, indicating high utilization and cost; while this directly affects Medicare pricing, commercial plans often benchmark against Medicare trends, so negotiated prices may indirectly influence commercial tiering and access strategies over time, though this is not guaranteed for any given employer plan [^1153NfVK].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Based on national formulary data and UHC's typical commercial practices, UHC HMO Choice Select is likely to cover both Farxiga and Jardiance, but coverage is commonly contingent on prior authorization and may involve step therapy, with placement on a nonpreferred tier yielding moderate co-pays; because formularies vary by employer group and contract year, I should confirm the exact 2025 formulary for the specific member's plan ID to verify tier, PA requirements, and any preferred agent within the class [^112DtSf9] [^1113nxfs] [^1141GK5L].

> I should also consider clinical implications that affect access discussions. Hold on, I should verify renal thresholds and labeled indications because these often inform PA criteria. For dapagliflozin, initiation is not recommended if eGFR is below 25 mL/min/1.73 m², yet continuation may still be appropriate for cardiorenal benefit in CKD; for empagliflozin, similar eGFR considerations apply, and both agents have robust HF and CKD benefits that can be leveraged in PA appeals when clinically indicated, aligning with ACC/AHA/HFSA and KDIGO-aligned guidance [^111TsbpE] [^117Xxkqj] [^114GBnZa].

> Next, I should review practical steps to confirm coverage. I need to ensure the member checks the current UHC formulary via the member portal or by calling member services with the specific plan ID, and ask the prescriber to submit a PA that documents the indication (T2D, HF, and/or CKD), eGFR, and prior therapy if step therapy is required; if denied, an appeal citing guideline support and trial data (DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced, DAPA-CKD, EMPA-KIDNEY) can be effective, and patient assistance programs may mitigate cost if coverage is limited or co-pay is high [^117CUzNz] [^117Xxkqj] [^114GBnZa].

> Final answer: Yes, UHC HMO Choice Select plans generally cover Farxiga and Jardiance, but coverage is typically managed with prior authorization and may involve step therapy, with cost-sharing determined by formulary tier; confirm the specific 2025 formulary and PA criteria for the member's plan to determine exact access and out-of-pocket costs, and use clinical indications and guideline support to optimize approval likelihood if utilization management is required [^112DtSf9] [^1113nxfs] [^1141GK5L].

Regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors

Different SGLT2 inhibitors, also called gliflozins, are currently marketed or are undergoing clinical development and approval procedures (Table 3). In November 2012, the first-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin (Forxiga), was granted a marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Dapagliflozin was initially rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) owing to concerns noted by an Advisory Panel about potential increases in the risk of bladder and breast cancers associated with the drug. In January 2014, FDA granted marketing authorization for dapagliflozin (Farxiga) after new safety data on dapagliflozin from ongoing studies were provided. The FDA required to perform several post-marketing studies, in which > 17 000 patients will be followed for 4–5 years to clarify whether dapagliflozin therapy is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular (CV) events, liver toxicity or cancer. Other post-marketing studies are required by the FDA to further assess bladder cancer risk and dapagliflozin's effect in paediatric patients. Furthermore, an intense pharmacovigilance programme to monitor reports of liver toxicity and pregnancy outcomes has to be implemented by the company. Canagliflozin (Invokana) was approved by the FDA in March 2013, and in November 2013 by the EMA. Marketing authorizations followed a positive opinion of Advisory Committees, but concerns about safety of canagliflozin remained, which are addressed in several post-authorization safety studies (please also refer to the section on safety of SGLT2 inhibitors for details). In Europe, canagliflozin is labelled with an inverted black triangle in the package leaflet and the summary of product characteristics (SmPC), indicating that the drug is under additional monitoring by regulatory authorities. On March 2014, the EMA recommended granting of a marketing authorization for a third SGLT2 inhibitor empaglifozin (Jardiance), and in May 2014 the European Commission followed the positive vote of the EMA. Initially, FDA rejected approval of empagliflozin in March 2014 owing to previously observed deficiencies at a facility where empagliflozin is manufactured, but finally approved it in August 2014. In Japan four SGLT2 inihibitors, namely dapagliflozin, ipragliflozin, tofogliflozin and luseogliflozin, were approved in 2014 (Table 3).

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Other Indications in Adults

The recommended dosage of FARXIGA is 10 mg orally once daily in adults for the following indications:

To reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) in patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
To reduce the risk of CV death, hHF, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure.
To reduce the risk of hHF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors.

For Adults with Renal Impairment Receiving FARXIGA for Indications Other than Glycemic Control:

The recommended dosage of FARXIGA in patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 25 mL/min/1.73 m2is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function.
Initiation with FARXIGA is not recommended in patients with an eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2.
If the eGFR falls below 25 mL/min/1.73 m2while receiving treatment with FARXIGA, patients may continue FARXIGA 10 mg orally once daily to reduce the risk of eGFR decline, ESKD, CV death and hHF.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery

Withhold FARXIGA for at least 3 days, if possible, prior to major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Correlates of second-line type 2 diabetes medication selection in the United States [^1138NXB7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Adjusted associations of T2D medication prescribing with health plan characteristics

After adjustment for other patient, prescriber, and health plan differences, individuals in a Medicare Advantage plan were more likely than those in a commercial health plan to receive INS/B (difference 3.1%, 95% CI (1.5% to 4.6%)) and SFUs (difference 5.1%, 95% CI (2.8% to 7.4%)), and were less likely to receive DPP4s, GLP1s, or SGLT2s. The 'richness' of health coverage (ie, percentage of total healthcare costs that were paid by the patient) was also associated with T2D drug selection; compared with patients in health plans in the lowest quartile of out-of-pocket costs, patients in plans in the highest quartile were more likely to receive DPP4s (difference 2.6%, 95% CI (1.1% to 4.1%)) and were less likely to receive INS/B (difference −1.1%, 95% CI (−2.1% to −0.3%)) or SFUs (difference −2.4%, 95% CI (−4.0% to −0.7%)). No clear associations were observed with the health plan structure (eg, HMO vs PPO plans).

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dapagliflozin PO (also known as Farxiga):

- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold dapagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating dapagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Protocol and registration

This review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA). The protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (Reference No.: CRD42025646379).

2.2 Information sources and search strategy

A systematic search was conducted across three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) on February 4, 2025, to identify relevant studies examining the baseline characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes of DKA in patients using SGLT2i, compared with non‐users. The following search terms were used: (Sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitor*) OR (Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor*) OR (Sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitor*) OR (SGLT2 inhibitor*) OR (SGLT 2 inhibitor*) OR (SGLT2i) OR (dapagliflozin OR Farxiga OR Forxiga OR canagliflozin OR Invokana OR empagliflozin OR Jardiance OR ertugliflozin OR Steglatro OR ipragliflozin OR Suglat OR sotagliflozin OR Zynquista OR Inpefa OR luseogliflozin OR Lusefi OR bexagliflozin OR Brenzavvy OR enavogliflozin OR Envlo) AND ((diabet* ketoacidosis) OR (diabet* ketosis) OR (DKA)). There was no restriction on publication year or language.

All the articles retrieved from these databases were imported into EndNote 21 (Clarivate Analytics, PA). After removing duplicates, two independent reviewers (D. L. and G. S.) initially screened titles and abstracts, followed by a full‐text review to determine study eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (J. Y.) in cases of persistent disagreement.

2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were selected if (1) they provided clinical features or outcomes related to DKA, (2) compared SGLT2i users and non‐users (including other antihyperglycaemic agents), and (3) were observational studies, including cohort studies, case–control studies, and case series. Studies were excluded if they (1) were not original, (2) were in vivo or in vitro, or (3) involved fewer than 10 patients. For overlapping studies, the most recent or most comprehensive study was included.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^116TgYNr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue FARXIGA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting FARXIGA.

Withhold FARXIGA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

FARXIGA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Consensus treatment recommendations for people with Type 2 diabetes

Therapy choices based on efficacy

Lifestyle interventions are a key part of Type 2 diabetes management and should be considered concurrently with pharmacotherapy 52. Unless contraindicated, metformin remains the mainstay of first‐line drug therapy in all people with Type 2 diabetes. We then recommend assessing cardiovascular disease risk to guide further therapy (Fig. 1).

Order does not denote any specific preference. *Metformin to be continued unless no longer tolerated. † Individuals are considered a high risk if they have a history of cardiovascular disease or at least one risk factor (see Table S2 for further details).‐4i, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor;, estimated glomerular filtration rate;‐1, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist;‐2i, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor;, sulphonylurea;, thiazolidinedione.

For those with established cardiovascular disease, use of empagliflozin, canagliflozin, liraglutide or semaglutide is recommended (based on recent cardiovascular outcome trials data and in keeping with updated national and international guidelines; Fig. 1). The specific drug choice may be further guided by the individual's cardiovascular history and comorbidities. Given their favourable results in reducing hospitalization for heart failure, empagliflozin and canagliflozin are a key consideration for those with heart failure, although the licences do not allow for initiation if eGFR is < 60 ml/min 1.73 m 2 12, 15, 53, 54. Empagliflozin and canagliflozin should be discontinued when eGFR is persistently below 45 ml/ min 1.73 m 2 53, 54.

Significant reductions in MACE were reported with canagliflozin 12 and empagliflozin 15, and a numerical reduction with dapagliflozin 24. However, notably, people with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease should be made aware of the increased risk of lower leg amputations associated with canagliflozin 12, 54, although no significant increase was seen in the CREDENCE study 13. A non‐significant increase in risk of stroke was reported with empagliflozin despite a reduction in blood pressure 15, and dapagliflozin should be discussed before treatment in people with a history of stroke 55.

Measures and outcomes

The primary study outcome was the probability of a first prescription fill for a drug in each of the six T2D medication classes. We explored associations with independent variables believed to be related to the likelihood of prescribing a particular drug class. Patient-level characteristics included gender, age, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Score, and presence/absence of a diagnosis code for obesity; most recent hemoglobin A1c test result (categorized as < 8%, 8%–9.9%, ≥ 10%, or 'no value available'); census region of the individual's home zip code; and indicators of utilization within 90 days of the index date that might influence medication choice (eg, presence/absence of a diagnosis of hypoglycemia; presence/absence of a hospitalization; presence/absence of a diagnosis of poorly controlled diabetes; total patient out-of-pocket expenditure). Provider-level or 'prescriber'-level variables included specialty type (family physician, general internist, endocrinologist, nurse practitioner, or 'other'); a prescribing index reflecting the percentage of a provider's patients who have diabetes; and indicators for high versus low probability of recent prescribing of each of the six drug classes (based on the percent of a provider's total T2D medication prescriptions that were for DPP4s, GLP1s, INS/Bs, SFUs, SGLT2s, or TZDs). Health plan-level variables included an index of the 'richness' of health coverage (ie, the median value of the percentage of total healthcare costs paid by the patient, for all persons in the same health plan); an indicator variable for enrollment in a Medicare versus commercial health plan; and the type of plan design (health maintenance organization (HMO); preferred provider organization (PPO); point of service (POS); indemnity (ie, traditional fee for service); exclusive provider organization; or other plan type). Please see the online supplementary appendix for additional details.

Data sources

Data sources included health plan enrollment files, medical inpatient and ambulatory claims, and pharmacy claims. Although most patients had recent laboratory claims for A1c tests, test results are typically not available from administrative data. However, the laboratory claims file did include results for 36% of A1c claims. The availability of these results was comparable across the six T2D medication classes. Information about race and ethnicity also was not consistently available in these administrative data but was imputed by the data vendor using a mix of individual-level and neighborhood-level characteristics.

### Generalizability of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcome trials to the type 2 diabetes population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112A5CvR]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

The present meta-analysis used relative measures assumed to be stable across populations, as stated, and this represents the basis for our results to be potentially projectable to populations other than those included in the analysis. Therefore, one may wonder what implications this could have on clinical practice. No data on the characteristics of patients who could have been selectively eligible for one specific SGLT2i CVOTs while excluded from the others have been reported, therefore we could not directly address the proportion of patients who should have been prescribed with a specific SGLT2i. Nevertheless, from a clinical perspective, the results of this meta-analysis introduce a high level of evidence on a novel aspect to be considered when making the evidence-based choice of the specific SGLT2i. We are used to considering the individual characteristics and comorbidities, individual preferences and class/drug-specific properties. However, how should we select the specific SGLT2i in a patient with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, and predominant heart failure or chronic kidney disease? CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME all showed a benefit, then the use of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin would be indicated with the same strength in this patient. Similar considerations can potentially be made for a patient with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, without a history of cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease. Based on our data, the use of dapagliflozin or canagliflozin could be preferred over empagliflozin or ertugliflozin in some circumstances.

### Correlates of second-line type 2 diabetes medication selection in the United States [^1166FJfK]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Patients in health plans with lower out-of-pocket costs were generally less likely to receive newer or costlier second-line medications, such as DPP4s, GLP1s, and SGLT2s, and were more likely to receive drugs that are generally cheaper or have been on the market longer, such as SFUs and basal insulin. It is possible that health plans with lower cost sharing are more likely to impose formulary restrictions or tiered medication copays that offer SFUs at a lower cost to patients, thereby driving selection of those medications. However, the lack of a clear relationship between T2D drug selection and health plan structure (eg, HMO vs PPO) may suggest that other forms of drug and utilization management strategies used by plans may yield inconsistent effects on prescribing. This deserves further research.

Limitations

Our study has notable limitations. First, the reliance on administrative data could lead to misclassification of the timing of second-line treatment. For example, some manufacturers offer coupons to promote the use of newer medications, which may make it difficult to determine the timing of a drug start based on the first submitted pharmacy claim. This also could result in underestimation of the prevalence of some newer medications. Another limitation is that we did not have information about provider characteristics, such as age or date of last board certification, which may relate to their selection of medications. Finally, the observational study design limits our ability to know if associations are causal; additional longitudinal research is needed to determine if more frequent use of certain medications has any impact, good or bad, on important health or economic outcomes.

Our study provides important information about the resilience of sulfonylureas and recent emergence of SGLT2 inhibitors as second-line agents for the management of T2D when metformin is no longer sufficient. In general, select health plan, prescriber, and patient characteristics were associated with the probability that a particular second-line medication was selected. This information should cause health plan administrators to think carefully about all potential effects of policies that restrict formularies or shift medication costs to patients. These findings also will be valuable for the design of future research that compares potential benefits and harms of these medications on important health and economic outcomes.

This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled trials, including 3 monotherapy trials, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy trials, and an initial combination with metformin trial. Across these 13 trials, 2360 patients were treated once daily with FARXIGA 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease.

Consensus recommendations for the management of T2DM in patients with corresponding high risk/history of CVD

The results of all the below mentioned CVOTs are summarized in Table 2. Based on these CVOTs and years of expertise, the authors have come up with the treatment approaches for T2DM patients with high risk/history of CVDs.

Management of T2DM in patients at a risk of CVD

Figure 1 describes the consensus approach to glucose lowering with AHAs in this set of population. For patients not reaching their target HbA1c, it is advisable to assess adherence and arrange timely follow-up every 3 months.

Fig. 1

For SGLT2 inhibitors evidence based preference is empagliflozin > canagliflozin. SGLT2 inhibitors vary in regards to eGFR pre-requisites for a continued use. b For GLP-1 agonist evidence based preference is Semaglutide > Liraglutide > Dulaglutide > Exenatide > Lixenatide. Caution to be exercised in case of end-stage renal disease. c Degludec and insulin Glargine (U100) have shown CVD safety, d Dapagliflozin: preferred option for patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, e Low dose TZDs are better tolerated. f Choose later generation SU to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia

Recommendation: we recommend using metformin alone or in combination with other drugs as first line therapy in patients with T2DM and high risk of CVD (Grade A)

One of the earliest CVOTs in T2DM patients, UKPDS 34, determined whether a policy of reducing hyperglycaemia to near-normal levels will reduce the risk of development or progression of diabetes-related complications. Metformin was among the intensive control group, which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the risk of MI and CV death. This rendered metformin a drug of choice in the view of previously available insulin and sulphonylurea that had risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. With a long-standing experience and global use of metformin, the Food and Drug Administration removed boxed warnings contraindicating its use in patients with HF in 2006, and liberalized contraindications for those with kidney disease in 2016.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2.5 Statistical analyses

Crude incidence rates of both outcomes were estimated within each exposure cohort and pre‐defined subgroups were estimated as the number of individuals with the outcome during each time‐at‐risk window, divided by the total time‐at‐risk.

Population‐level effect estimation analyses using a comparative cohort design were applied for 7 pairwise comparisons and all associated subgroups therein, that is, new users of: (1) canagliflozin vs empagliflozin or dapagliflozin; (2) canagliflozin vs empagliflozin; (3) canagliflozin vs dapagliflozin; (4) canagliflozin vs any DPP‐4i, GLP‐1 receptor agonist or other select AHA; (5) canagliflozin vs any DPP‐4i, GLP‐1 receptor agonist, TZD, SU, insulin or other select AHA; (6) empagliflozin or dapagliflozin vs any DPP‐4i, GLP‐1 receptor agonist or other select AHA; and (7) empagliflozin or dapagliflozin vs any DPP‐4i, GLP‐1 receptor agonist, TZD, SU, insulin or other select AHA. Patients with an observed outcome prior to index exposure were handled in 2 ways: (1) time‐to‐first‐post‐index‐event analysis, where hazards of an occurrence of outcome among all exposed patients were estimated, independent of prior outcome history; and (2) time‐to‐first‐ever‐event analysis, where hazards of first occurrence of outcome were estimated among patients with no history of the outcome.

### Update on perioperative medication management for the hand surgeon: a focus on diabetes, weight loss, rheumatologic, and antithrombotic medications [^116gybcw]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus and obesity are growing health concerns. New pharmacologic interventions have recently begun to play a more notable role in the treatment pathway of these separate but related conditions. In particular, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutides (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro), and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance), have emerged as treatment options. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy in regulating metabolism, improving glycemic control, and managing long-term weight reduction. However, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have also been associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including delayed gastric emptying as well as regurgitation and aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation, and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors have been associated with severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, discontinuation of these medications before surgery is imperative. Given the popularity of these medications among the general public, it is essential for hand surgeons, to understand how to appropriately manage them perioperatively. The objective of this article was to review these new diabetes mellitus and weight loss medications, including their mechanisms of action, indications for use, and perioperative management guidelines. Additionally, we will take this opportunity to review perioperative guidelines for other common medications relevant to patients undergoing procedures involving the hand and upper extremity such as antithrombotic medications and rheumatoid arthritis-related immunosuppressive medications. Finally, we will describe how the electronic medical record system can be used to optimize perioperative medication management in this population.

Clinical Considerations for Chris

While Chris has not presented with established CVD, he has several high-risk factors that predispose him to future risk of CVD. The question arises as to how to modify CV risk in a patient like Chris.

Primary Considerations To optimise glycaemic control for microvascular risk reduction and address any weight issues by optimally assisting with weight loss.

How to Manage? Review self-management and lifestyle modification to assist with weight loss and improved glycaemia. Consider the addition of a glucose-lowering agent with proven CVD safety or positive CVD benefit that also has weight-loss potential.

Which Glucose-Lowering Agent? Based on new research and guidelines, an SGLT-2 inhibitor (oral once-daily dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) or a GLP-1RA (once-daily liraglutide, once-weekly dulaglutide) is an appropriate add-on therapy to Chris's current standard-of-care treatment. When selecting SGLT-2 inhibitors, baseline eGFR and the need for ongoing monitoring need to be carefully considered and the risk of euglycaemic diabetes ketoacidosis and uncommon risks such as mild diuresis and mycotic genital infections discussed. When selecting a GLP-1RA, the frequency of injections may alter choice.

Other Considerations To consider patient profile (lifestyle/adherence), patient preference (oral versus injectable therapy) as well as cost implications (reimbursement criteria).

Following an informed discussion with Chris, he expressed preference for an oral, daily medication (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) as he felt he may forget taking an injection once a week (exenatide QW; dulaglutide). He was not prepared to be out of pocket for the once-daily GLP-1RA option (liraglutide) but was open to using a weekly injection in the future. An SGLT-2 inhibitor was therefore prescribed. In addition, his existing medications were optimised with the dose of sitagliptin/metformin increased to 50/1000 mg BD. The dose of ramipril was also increased to 10 mg and it was recommended to be taken at night.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114v9fYd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

Source: IQVIA National Prescription Audit, 2015–2020.

During the study period, there was a declining trend in the relative use of canagliflozin, from a maximum of 65% of all SGLT2i prescriptions in the first month of the study to a nadir of 3.0% in the most recent month (Figure 4). Our analysis did not detect any structural breaks in this trend coinciding with FDA communications regarding potential amputation risks with this medication (Figure S1).

From September 2019 to December 2020, dapagliflozin's share of SGLT2i prescriptions among cardiologists increased 23%, following a decrease since 2015 (Figure 5A), while empagliflozin's share declined 18%, following an increase since 2015 (Figure 5B). This shift from empagliflozin to dapagliflozin among cardiologists was not observed among noncardiologists, for whom empagliflozin's share of SGLT2i prescriptions continued to increase and dapagliflozin's share remained flat. This swing in prescribing trends among cardiologists coincided with the publication of the DAPA‐HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) trialin September 2019 (P < 0.001), followed in May 2020 (P < 0.001) by FDA drug label expansion for the treatment of heart failure in adults with and without T2D.

### Effects of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors on genital infections in female patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus-real world data analysis [^116s65zs]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are associated with increased risk of genital infections. We aimed to assess incidence and risk factors associated with genital infections among female patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

We retrieved data on adult female patients with T2DM who initiated treatment with empagliflozin or dapagliflozin during March 2015-March 2018, in a large Israeli health maintenance organization (HMO). Genital infections were identified by diagnosis codes or relevant dispensed prescriptions. The proportion of days covered with SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i-PDC) was measured. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors.

Results

Of 1542/6153 patients, 25.1% had events of genital infections during a mean of 2.3 years. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 4.25 for the highest versus lowest SGLT2i-PDC group. Younger age, history of genital infection, and estrogen therapy were associated with increased risk of genital infections. Chronic Kidney Disease and DPP4 inhibitor therapy at baseline were associated with lower risk of genital infections.

Conclusions

Potential risk factors for genital infections were identified in women initiating SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. This study did not involve human participants and therefore did not require institutional review board review or informed consent, according to University of California, San Francisco institutional policy.

Plan-level coverage information for the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin was obtained from Fingertip Formulary (Clarivate Analytics LLC), reflecting coverage in April 2021. Fingertip Formulary maintains detailed drug coverage information for more than 5000 health plan and employer formularies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Plan type was classified as (1) commercial or employer-based; (2) health insurance exchange (HIX), Veterans Affairs (VA), or other (including Federal Employees Health Benefits program, non-VA federal program, municipal plan, pharmacy benefit manager, and union); (3) Medicare; and (4) Medicaid. The study outcomes were insurance coverage (yes or no); formulary restrictions, including prior authorization (yes or no), step therapy (yes or no), and quantity limits (yes or no); and cost sharing, including co-payments and co-insurance (%). A summary variable was constructed for plan coverage of at least 1 SGLT2 inhibitor without prior authorization or step therapy.

For each SGLT2 inhibitor, we used χ 2 tests to compare the differences in coverage and formulary restrictions and used unadjusted linear regression to compare cost sharing by plan type. All analyses were weighted by covered pharmacy lives. Analyses were performed using Stata/IC, version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC).

We examined plan-level data from a total of 4135 US health plans, including 1842 commercial or employer-based plans; 892 HIX, VA, or other plans; 860 Medicare plans; and 541 Medicaid plans, accounting for 297 850 145 covered lives. Coverage varied across SGLT2 inhibitors and plan types (Figure 1). Medicaid plans were most likely and Medicare plans were least likely to require prior authorization. For example, prior authorization was required for empagliflozin for 48% of Medicaid covered lives, compared with 0.1% of Medicare covered lives. Step therapy requirements were most frequent in commercial or employer-based plans (eg, 40% of covered lives for dapagliflozin) and least frequent in Medicare plans (3% of covered lives for dapagliflozin). Medicare plans were most likely to cover at least 1 SGLT2 inhibitor without requiring prior authorization or step therapy (98% of covered lives), followed by commercial or employer-based plans (61% of covered lives); HIX, VA, or other plans (51% of covered lives); and Medicaid plans (43% of covered lives).

### Coverage, formulary restrictions, and affordability of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors by US insurance plan types [^1141GK5L]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Among plans with data on expected co-payments and co-insurance (423 [10%] to 2259 [55%] of 4135 plans), median monthly co-payments and co-insurance were similar across commercial or employer-based; HIX, VA, or other; and Medicare plans (Figure 2). Compared with other plan types, co-payments were much lower in Medicaid plans (median [IQR] cost, $2.28 [$0-$3.90] for dapagliflozin; P < .001).

SGLT2 inhibitor use to manage ASCVD, HF, and DKD risk in type 2 diabetes follows this algorithm: Patient is ≥ 18 years old with T2D and ≥ 1 of the following: ASCVD, HF, DKD, or at high risk for ASCVD. If the patient is pregnant or breast feeding, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor (no safety data available). If the patient's eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m^2, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor. If not, consider starting an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit; after a discussion incorporating patient-clinician preferences and priorities, if the patient wishes to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor, initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin is appropriate. No dose titration is required. Adjust other antihyperglycemic therapies if necessary. Monitor response to therapy and consider further therapies for CV risk reduction, as indicated. This may include the addition of a GLP-1RA in the appropriate patient.

### Comparative outcomes of empagliflozin to dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure [^113yiHC7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to have benefits when used in patients with heart failure. The comparative outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors relative to each other has not been well defined and may impact medication selection.

Objective

To determine the comparative outcomes of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on reducing the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter retrospective cohort study included patients with heart failure from August 18, 2021, and December 6, 2022, in the TriNetX Research Collaborative, a centralized database of deidentified electronic medical record data from a network of 81 health care organizations. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of heart failure, had never received an SGLT2 inhibitor previously, and were newly started on empagliflozin or dapagliflozin. Patients were followed up for 1 year.

Exposure

Initiation of dapagliflozin or empagliflozin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the time to the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization between study days 1 to 365. Kaplan-Meier analyses, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% CIs were used to assess the primary outcome.

Results

Among 744 914 eligible patients, 28 075 began empagliflozin (15 976 [56.9%]) or dapagliflozin (12 099 [43.1%]). After nearest-neighbor matching for demographics, diagnoses, and medication use, there were 11 077 patients in each group. Of patients who received empagliflozin, 9247 (57.9%) were male, 3130 (19.6%) were Black individuals, and 9576 (59.9%) were White individuals. Similarly, of those who received dapagliflozin, 7439 (61.5%) were male, 2445 (20.2%) were Black individuals, and 7131 (58.9%) were White individuals. Patients receiving empagliflozin were less likely to experience the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization compared with those initiated on dapagliflozin (3545 [32.2%] vs 3828 [34.8%] events; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86–0.94]) in the year following SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and less likely to be hospitalized (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86–0.94]). All-cause mortality did not differ between exposure groups (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82–1.00]). There was no difference in mean hemoglobin A1c or adverse events between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, patients who initiated empagliflozin were less likely to experience the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization compared with patients who started dapagliflozin. Additional studies are needed to confirm these finding.

### Patient preference for second-and third-line therapies in type 2 diabetes: a prespecified secondary endpoint of the triMaster study [^113P3ck6]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Overall preference before and after being fed back HbA1c and weight

Table 3 shows the participants' preference for the three drugs both before, and after, being fed back their HbA1cs and weights on each of the therapies. In both situations, each drug had a substantial proportion of participants who selected it as their preferred choice (range 23.6% to 38.3%). Canagliflozin was the most popular first choice, both before and after being fed back their HbA1cs and weights (37.2% and 38.3%, respectively).

There was little evidence of an order effect. 167 (37%) preferred their first drug, 148 (33%) preferred the second, 133 (30%) preferred the third (χ = 3.9, p = 0.14 for comparison with equal preference across the three periods).

Reasons for preference

On first ranking, 222 (52%) chose the preferred drug because of "feeling better", whereas 164 (38%) chose it due to "lack of side effects", with 44 (10%) unclassifiable. Canagliflozin was most likely to be chosen because of "feeling better", whereas pioglitazone was most likely to be chosen because of "lack of side effects" (Extended Data Table 2).

After being fed back their HbA1cs and weight, 125/457 (27%) changed their preferred drug. Most patients (76%) changed because of the HbA1c result (55% HbA1c alone, 21% HbA1c and weight) while 29% changed because of weight (8% weight alone, 21% HbA1c and weight). There were clear differences between the drugs (Extended Data Table 3), with weight being most likely to result in a change in preference to canagliflozin.

Methods

Study Sample

Patients were recruited from a probability-based, nationally representative panel of United States (US) households maintained by Knowledge Networks (Palo Alto, CA, USA). To qualify for inclusion in this study, patients had to (1) be aged 18 years or older; (2) have a self-reported physician diagnosis of T2DM; (3) be currently taking one OAD or no OAD to treat their T2DM; and (4) be not currently taking injectable T2DM treatments (e.g. insulin and glucagon-like-1 receptor agonist). Email invitations were sent to potential panelists based on self-reported physician diagnosis of T2DM. The sample was stratified by age (18–44, 45–64, ≥ 65 years), time since diagnosis (≤ 3, > 3 years), and treatment status (no current OAD, one current OAD).

Survey Instrument

The online DCE survey was adapted from a survey used in a previous study and developed using good research practices. The survey included a series of eight choice questions; each question presented a pair of hypothetical, but realistic, OAD medication profiles (Fig. 1). Patients were asked to choose their preferred medication profile in each pair. Each profile was defined by five clinical outcomes, dosing schedule, and out-of-pocket cost. Clinical outcomes included reduction in average glucose (AG) (between 20 and 66 mg/dL) from a baseline of 206 mg/dL, chance of mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal side effects (between 10% and 30%), frequency of hypoglycemia (between none and > 2 hypoglycemic episodes per month), weight change within the first 6 months after starting treatment (between 6 lb weight gain and 6 lb weight loss), and incremental treatment-related risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) (between 0% and 3%). The combination of attributes in each medication profile and the pairing of profiles in each choice question were determined by an experimental design with known statistical properties developed using good research practices.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^1138nfFm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor initiation and practical considerations are noted, including that individuals with HbA1c in the low or normal range (eg, < 7.0%) might not be initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor based on the KDIGO guideline. Trial context indicates that approximately 18%–25% of participants in large SGLT2 inhibitor trials and 50% in CREDENCE were not on metformin at baseline, and there are no post hoc analyses comparing outcomes according to baseline metformin therapy; therefore, in some cases, it may be reasonable to reduce or discontinue metformin to safely utilize an SGLT2 inhibitor from a glycemic perspective. The KDOQI work group agreed with withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during hospitalization or periods of fasting when risk for diabetic ketoacidosis is higher and to consider decreasing or holding diuretics in euvolemic individuals at initiation to reduce hypovolemia risk, and it underscores the expected initial decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. For implementation, KDIGO offers a clinical practice point to prioritize agents with proven cardiorenal benefit and acknowledges that therapy choice will depend on insurance and assistance programs, while highlighting current US uptake gaps where only 21%–50% of eligible people receive ACEI/ARB therapy versus 75%–80% in Europe.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114kk5GW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — evidence summary in T2D shows that SGLT2 inhibitors have emerged as important new oral therapies for patients with T2D, and Large, randomized controlled trials in patients with T2D have demonstrated that many of these agents reduce MACE in patients with established ASCVD and/or DKD, and reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations. The benefit of reducing HF hospitalizations reflected primarily prevention of symptomatic HF in T2D patients at high risk, as ~90% did not have HF at baseline. The benefits of an SGLT2 inhibitor in treating established HF were demonstrated in the DAPA-HF trial, in which dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV death or worsening HF, and improved HF-related symptoms in ~4,800 patients with HFrEF.

### Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115rh4Uh]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Although total and out-of-pocket costs have slowed uptake of novel cardiovascular therapies in the recent past, 3 factors justify our cautious optimism that the experience with SGLT2 inhibitors will be different. First, diabetes therapies, including SGLT2 inhibitors, receive some of the largest manufacturer discounts observed in the US pharmaceutical market, and these discounts have fully offset increases in list prices in recent years. Second, the availability of several SGLT2 inhibitors with proven benefit in HFrEF treatment may allow payers to negotiate better prices in return for preferential formulary placement. As a result, the majority of US payers will be able to continue to access at least 1 SGLT2 inhibitor at a reasonable price. Finally, recently proposed policy reforms would force payers to pass on at least some of the manufacturer discounts to patients. Collectively, these changes could substantially lower total costs for payers and out-of-pocket costs for patients, and expand access to this cost-effective therapy.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D and associated comorbidities-differentiating within the class [^116wxHP5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Expert opinion

SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors partially block the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubules in the kidney. The members of this class have somewhat similar molecular structure but nevertheless possess differing relative selectivity for SGLT2 compared with SGLT1. Until recently, three SGLT2 inhibitors had been approved by the EMA and FDA for the treatment of T2D, as an adjunct to diet and exercise: canagliflozin (approval: EMA/FDA 2013); dapagliflozin (approval: EMA 2012/FDA 2014); and empagliflozin (approval: EMA/FDA 2014). Of these three, empagliflozin shows the highest relative selectivity, being more than 2500-fold more selective for SGLT2 than SGLT1, followed by dapagliflozin at > 1100-fold, and canagliflozin at > 250-fold. Such factors may be pertinent when discussing relative efficacies and safety profiles of these molecules, although the clinical relevance is unknown.

Figure 2
Antihyperglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetes: general recommendations. Moving from the top to the bottom of the figure, potential sequences of antihyperglycemic therapy. In most patients, begin with lifestyle changes; metformin monotherapy is added at, or soon after, diagnosis (unless there are explicit contraindications). If the HbA 1c target is not achieved after ∼3 months, consider one of the five treatment options combined with metformin: a sulfonylurea, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin. (The order in the chart is determined by historical introduction and route of administration and is not meant to denote any specific preference.) Choice is based on patient and drug characteristics, with the over-riding goal of improving glycemic control while minimizing side effects. Shared decision making with the patient may help in the selection of therapeutic options. The figure displays drugs commonly used both in the U.S. and/or Europe. Rapid-acting secretagogues (meglitinides) may be used in place of sulfonylureas. Other drugs not shown (α-glucosidase inhibitors, colesevelam, dopamine agonists, pramlintide) may be used where available in selected patients but have modest efficacy and/or limiting side effects. In patients intolerant of, or with contraindications for, metformin, select initial drug from other classes depicted and proceed accordingly. In this circumstance, while published trials are generally lacking, it is reasonable to consider three-drug combinations other than metformin. Insulin is likely to be more effective than most other agents as a third-line therapy, especially when HbA 1c is very high (e.g. ≥ 9.0%). The therapeutic regimen should include some basal insulin before moving to more complex insulin strategies (Fig. 3). Dashed arrow line on the left-hand side of the figure denotes the option of a more rapid progression from a two-drug combination directly to multiple daily insulin doses, in those patients with severe hyperglycemia (e.g. HbA 1c ≥ 10.0–12.0%). DPP-4-i, DPP-4 inhibitor; Fx's, bone fractures; GI, gastrointestinal; GLP-1-RA, GLP-1 receptor agonist; HF, heart failure; SU, sulfonylurea. a Consider beginning at this stage in patients with very high HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9%). b Consider rapid-acting, nonsulfonylurea secretagogues (meglitinides) in patients with irregular meal schedules or who develop late postprandial hypoglycemia on sulfonylureas. c See Table 1 for additional potential adverse effects and risks, under "Disadvantages". d Usually a basal insulin (NPH, glargine, detemir) in combination with noninsulin agents. e Certain noninsulin agents may be continued with insulin (see text). Refer to Fig. 3 for details on regimens. Consider beginning at this stage if patient presents with severe hyperglycemia (≥ 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [≥ 300–350 mg/dL]; HbA 1c ≥ 10.0–12.0%) with or without catabolic features (weight loss, ketosis, etc.).

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — cardiorenal effects and prioritization — are summarized, noting that SGLT2is "continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)" and "modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL)". Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs". Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression". Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions".

Empagliflozin — cardiovascular outcomes in EMPA-REG OUTCOME — produced a 14% relative risk reduction in 3-point MACE versus placebo (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99), with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.82) driven predominantly by a 38% reduction in CV death (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Effects on fatal or nonfatal MI were more modest (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.09) and there was no significant difference for fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.56). Hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 35% (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85), and empagliflozin is specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV death in adults with T2D and established CV disease.

### Does SGLT1 inhibition add to the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in the prevention and treatment of heart failure? [^112M4MXe]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTis) have proven effective in preventing the development of heart failure (HF) in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as well as in reducing cardiovascular (CV) mortality and hospitalizations for HF (HHF) in patients with HF and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). On the basis of the evidence from randomized trials the SGLTis, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin have been recommended in European guidelines in patients with T2DM at risk of CV events to reduce HHF, major CV events, end-stage kidney dysfunction, and CV death. There are, however, major differences in the relative inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2 among the SGLTis. Sotagliflozin has a 20× selectivity for SGLT2 compared with SGLT1 in comparison to a 2500× selectivity for empagliflozin, 1200× selectivity for dapagliflozin, and 250× selectivity for canagliflozin (Graphical Abstract). Thus, sotagliflozin, while providing a degree of SGLT2i similar to empagliflozin, provides greater SGLT1i.

Rationale

We have recommended using SGLT-2 inhibitors with demonstrated efficacy for their given indications, but as more large trials report results testing the available SGLT-2 inhibitors in overlapping populations, it is increasingly apparent that any differences between the individual molecules do not appear to create large differences in clinical efficacy. For example, CREDENCE (canagliflozin), DAPA-CKD (dapagliflozin) and EMPA-KIDNEY (empagliflozin) reported relative risk reductions on their respective kidney disease progression outcomes which were comparable in their respective (sub)populations with type 2 DM. Beneficial effects on cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure were consistent in the CKD trials with the totality of evidence across all SGLT-2 inhibitor trials, including those in heart failure-specific populations. Likewise, the HFrEF trials DAPA-HF (dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-REDUCED (empagliflozin), and the HFpEF trials DELIVER (dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-PRESERVED (empagliflozin), share similar designs and results of primary and secondary assessments overall and across subgroups are remarkably consistent.

Relative risk reductions on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) across key cardiovascular safety trials and trials in dedicated CKD populations are also not statistically different from each other. Meta-analyses demonstrate consistent benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition in terms of cardiovascular and kidney benefits without apparent heterogeneity by class overall and stratified by diabetes status. We are of the opinion that the larger effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular death in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, and the larger effects on non-cardiovascular death in DAPA-CKD compared to other SGLT-2 inhibitor trials are more likely represent the play of chance or be caused by factors other than minor differences in the biological action of different SGLT-2 inhibitors. We therefore suggest there is increasing evidence that the cardiac and kidney benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition represent a class effect.

It should be noted, however, that SGLT-2 inhibitors differ in their respective receptor selectivity and there may be an increased propensity to cause diarrhoea and volume depletion when using SGLT-2 inhibitors that also meaningfully inhibit gut SGLT-1 (e.g. sotagliflozin). Selectivity for SGLT-2 over SGLT-1 ranges from: ~20:1 for the dual SGLT-1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin, and from ~250:1 for canagliflozin to ~2500:1 for empagliflozin for the more selective SGLT-2 inhibitors.

### Combination treatment of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists: symbiotic effects on metabolism and cardiorenal risk [^115KFoi3]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Despite beneficial effects on cardiovascular mortality noted in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, non-fatal stroke increased by 30% with empagliflozin and amputations increased by 97% with canagliflozin. Ketoacidosis has been reported with all SGLT2 inhibitors, although its risk may be attenuated by combining it with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Both drug classes have been associated with acute renal failure, possibly due to fluid contraction, and the entire incretin–mimetic class has been associated with pancreatitis. The most common side effects, however, are gastrointestinal and genitourinary, which tend to improve over time.

In conclusion, the SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist combination has additive effects on glycemic control without the inconvenience and dangers of hypoglycemia. There are also synergistic effects on weight loss and blood pressure, potentially leading to lower cardiovascular events, heart failure, cardiovascular and total mortality, as well as a deceleration of renal function. However, if increased cardiac and renal consumption of ketone bodies is indeed the reason for improved outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors, then the combination may negate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiac and renal workload and decrease the cardiorenal benefits. Ultimately, only a cardiovascular and renal outcomes trial with the combination would provide an answer to this hypothesis.

Despite the beneficial and symbiotic effects of a combined therapeutic regimen consisting of a SGLT-2 receptor inhibitor and a GLP-1 agonist, this combination is not being widely utilized. Cost and formulary barriers are the probable reason for this, and in the absence of more prospective studies, third party payers are unlikely "to foot the bill". So why have these studies not been performed? The likeliest explanation is the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies to study their drugs in combination with a non-generic drug for which they do not have a patent. One of the prospective randomized studies was with dapagliflozin and exenatide, and notably the patents of both drugs are held by the same company. In addition, there have been no prospective cardiovascular or renal outcomes trials with any GLP-1 receptor agonist/SGLT2 inhibitor combination. The reluctance to prospectively study this combination needs to be overcome to generate more conclusive data, so that it will be proven once and for all that this synergistic "Cadillac Combination" is effective and that it can be utilized at the earliest possible time in the course of type 2 diabetes.

Cost and equity considerations for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists — There are currently no generic SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists, but these formulations may become available, and clinicians should prescribe generic medications when they are available rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians and patients should discuss the cost of an add-on SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist when selecting a medication from either drug class. Clinicians should be attentive to patient race and ethnicity as a social risk factor for diabetes, and worse health outcomes for type 2 diabetes may be mediated by such factors as social determinants of health.

### Cardiovascular outcomes between dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus [^112oBsM3]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been demonstrated to decrease cardiovascular adverse events. However, there is little real-world clinical evidence regarding a direct comparison between dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Hypothesis

A difference in the cardiovascular efficancy of dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin in DM patients was anticipated, aiming to guide the optimal choice of SGLT2 inhibitors based on cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods

From 2014 to 2020, a total of 1549 patients with DM who were prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin were retrospectively enrolled. We categorized the study population into two groups: dapagliflozin (n = 981) and empagliflozin group (n = 568). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) over a 3-year period.

Results

Propensity-score matching was performed (537 patients in each group). The mean age and hemoglobin A1c were 58.2 ± 13.0 years and 8.4 ± 1.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the dapagliflozin and empagliflozin groups in the risk of MACE (3.7% vs. 4.8%, hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–2.35; p = 0.349). Furthermore, there were no differences between the two groups in secondary endpoints including all-cause death, MI, stroke, and hospitalization for HF. Prior MI and history of HF were independent predictors of MACE.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin showed no significant difference of real-world clinical cardiovascular outcomes in patients with DM over a 3-year period. Further large randomized clinical trials will be warranted for better evaluation.

Hypoglycemia Groups

In the hypoglycemia clinical groups, the RTUR was approximately 35% in the Commercial cohort and 25% in the Medicare cohort. In the Commercial cohort, the RTUR was higher in patients with severe hypoglycemia than patients without severe hypoglycemia (p = 0.03); however, in the Medicare cohort, the RTUR was similar in patients with and without severe hypoglycemia (p = 0.98) (Table 4). To further assess appropriateness of prescribing in this group, according to the guideline-directed treatments, we have calculated the rate of patients who receive SU as the only diabetes treatment. In the Commercial cohort, 10.6% of patients with severe hypoglycemia were receiving sulfonylurea only, while a significantly higher number of patients (11.8%) without severe hypoglycemia were receiving sulfonylurea only (p = 0.06). In the Medicare cohort, a higher number of patients with severe hypoglycemia (16.4%) and without severe hypoglycemia (17.0%) were receiving sulfonylurea only treatment, with no significant differences observed between these groups (p = 0.44).

Regression Analysis

The logistic regression analysis examined the likelihood of being on guideline-recommended therapy for the five clinical groups while controlling for patient characteristics (Figs. 1, 2). Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 in the supplementary material list the results for the 5 clinical groups, the most important 20 significant variables sorted by their decreasing importance, and their odds ratios and upper and lower confidence limits.

Real world evidence studies

Currently, some agents such as exenatide and dapagliflozin only have CV data from meta-analyses or observational studies. Recently published results from the real-world evidence observational study CVD-REAL, in which the risk of HHF in individuals with T2D who had been newly initiated on SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) was compared to other glucose-lowering drugs (oGLD), have shown similar trends for risk reductions in HF and all-cause mortality associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use. This held true for all six countries involved in the study, despite differences in the background treatment and the use of different SGLT2 inhibitors in the US and Europe. Furthermore, as both HF and the subclinical forms of HF are amongst the earliest vascular complications seen when following up diabetic patients who do not have CVD at baseline, it may be suggested that these patients in CVD-REAL benefited from the early use of SGLT2 inhibitors. Of note, there were clear differences between the outcomes in the propensity-matched CVD-REAL and the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, CANVAS Program cohorts, despite canagliflozin comprising the largest overall component of the SGLT2 inhibitors in the CVD-REAL study. For example, in the CANVAS Program, although the combined primary endpoint of 3P-MACE was reduced by 14%, there was no significant reduction in all-cause mortality, yet in the CVD-REAL US cohort, where 75% of patients were receiving canagliflozin, mortality was reduced in the SGLT2 inhibitor group by 62% (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.29–0.50). This is most likely to be as a result of the differing methodologies of the two studies and known limitations of using retrospective data. We therefore feel that although well-performed observational studies showing the same trend can lend support to results that have been obtained from RCTs, only prospective well-performed CVOTs, in which strict study criteria, equalisation of baseline characteristics, and elimination of observer bias, can offer robust evidence of CV benefit. Until the results of the dapagliflozin DECLARE CVOT study become available in 2018, we cannot be confident in a class effect for the SGLT2 inhibitor class. We currently advise that when using the treatment algorithms physicians should continue to evaluate each of the members of any of the classes on the basis of their individual efficacy and safety data.

### Cost of glycemic target achievement with sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK [^1118Zi3i]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In the current analysis of patients with T2DM and suboptimal glycemic control on metformin plus sulfonylurea, initiation of canagliflozin at the recommended starting dose of 100 mg provides a lower cost of achieving HbA1c < 7.0% than initiation of dapagliflozin 10 mg or empagliflozin 10 mg (recommended starting dose). For patients who do not achieve adequate glycemic control with lower doses of SGLT2 inhibitors and can tolerate the increase, the dose of SGLT2 inhibitor will be increased to 300 mg for canagliflozin or 25 mg for empagliflozin. Of all the doses of SGLT2 inhibitors compared in this study, the cost of achieving HbA1c < 7.0% over 26 weeks was lowest for canagliflozin 300 mg.

Analysis of cost per response is a simple and transparent way to compare the actual versus daily acquisition drug costs per patient. This straightforward analysis may be easier to understand and more meaningful to physicians and payers than conventional cost-effectiveness analyses that report quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An analysis similar to the current study was performed on the basis of the outcome of cost per 1% reduction in HbA1c for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, which was intended to serve as a preliminary report demonstrating to US formulary committees that cost per response may be a valuable measure to include in decision-making related to inclusion of SGLT2 inhibitors. Notably, that study used data from the studies reported in each drug's US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved prescribing information and did not allow for statistical comparisons between the different SGLT2 inhibitors, which were possible in the current study owing to the use of the NMA as the data source.

Data Monitoring Committee and interim analysis

A DMC will oversee safety in DAPA‐HF and will undertake one planned interim efficacy analysis when 75% of the primary events are adjudicated (the DMC can also conduct an additional interim analysis, if deemed necessary). The significance level for final analysis will be determined by the Haybittle–Peto function based on the actual number and timing of interim analyses. The interim analysis will use a Haybittle–Peto rule with testing of the primary composite endpoint first at a one‐sided alpha level of 0.001, and then, if superiority of dapagliflozin over placebo is achieved, testing of cardiovascular death at a one‐sided level of 0.001. 18 If this is significant, the DMC will then evaluate the totality of the efficacy data and safety data, to determine whether the benefit is sufficiently unequivocal and overwhelming to recommend early termination of the trial.

Ancillary studies

Serial echocardiography will be carried out in subset of patients, and baseline and follow‐up blood samples are being collected for future measurement of biomarkers of interest.

Trial design and governance

DAPA‐HF was designed jointly by AstraZeneca and the Executive Committee with review, refinement and final approval of the protocol by these parties and the country National Lead Investigators. The conduct of the trial is overseen by AstraZeneca and the Executive Committee working in conjunction with the National Lead Investigators. Membership of all committees is listed in the supplementary Appendix S1.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — insulin initiation and choice note that most persons with T2D who require intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy with a GLP-1 RA or insulin should initially be prescribed a GLP-1 RA, and if insulin intensification is required, one should prescribe a basal insulin or a fixed-ratio combination of a basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA (insulin glargine U-100 + lixisenatide [GlarLixi] or insulin degludec + liraglutide [Ideglira]); insulin should be prescribed for persons with T2D when noninsulin antihyperglycemic therapy fails to achieve target glycemic control or when a person has symptomatic hyperglycemia; long-acting insulin analogs are the recommended initial choice of insulin therapy for persons with T2D, with glargine (U100 or U300), degludec (U100 or U200), or detemir preferred over intermediate-acting Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, and glargine 300 U and degludec can be associated with less hypoglycemia than glargine U100 or detemir; for those on basal insulin and not at goal A1C, one of adding a GLP-1 RA or being switched to a fixed-ratio combination basal insulin–GLP-1 RA (GlarLixi or IdegLira) should be considered before adding a meal-time insulin for postprandial glycemic control.

### Comparative cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients taking dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^112csndm]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Population

From the NHIS database, we identified 366,031 patients diagnosed with T2DM who started taking SGLT2 inhibitors between May 2016 and December 2018. Of note, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were approved for insurance coverage in January and May 2016, respectively, allowing for broader utilization. T2DM was defined based on the diagnostic codes for T2DM (ICD-10 codes E11–E14): the one recorded during hospitalization or at least two outpatient clinic recordings ± the prescription of insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, or at least one GLD. GLDs included metformin, sulfonylurea, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. We applied an active-comparator, new-user design. Data on health check-ups were obtained from the NHIS-Health Screening Program database taken within two years before and closest to the date of SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. We excluded patients aged < 20 years, those taking SGLT2 inhibitors other than dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, and those diagnosed with end-stage renal disease. We also excluded patients who developed clinical events within 28 days after the index date, defined as the first date of SGLT2 inhibitor prescription. We excluded these patients because < 4 weeks of exposure to SGLT2 inhibitors was deemed unlikely to have caused the observed cardiovascular events. Finally, those with missing variables were also excluded (Fig. 1).

1 BACKGROUND

The cardiovascular outcome trial EMPA‐REG OUTCOME 1 showed that empagliflozin, a sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces the relative risk of cardiovascular death by 38% (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49‐0.77), all‐cause mortality by 32% (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57‐0.82) and hospitalization for heart failure by 35% (HR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50‐0.85) when added onto standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease.

However, the beneficial effects seen in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial are yet to be evaluated in routine clinical care, which includes patients across a broader spectrum of cardiovascular risk. Moreover, the information on unintended harms (eg bone fractures, ketoacidosis, lower limb amputations) potentially associated with some SGLT2 inhibitors 2, 3, 4, 5 has been rapidly accumulating. The impact on healthcare resource utilization and costs has also not been fully evaluated in routine clinical care. Real‐world data routinely generated in the course of healthcare delivery for millions of patients can fill these evidence gaps and inform regulatory and coverage decision‐making, 6, 7, 8 as recently recommended by the 21st Century Cures Act and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. 9, 10

The EMPagliflozin compaRative effectIveness and SafEty (EMPRISE) programme of studies aims to assess the comparative effectiveness, safety and impact on healthcare utilization of empagliflozin, based on real‐world data from two commercial and Medicare databases in the United States The study will collect accumulating data on empagliflozin for a period of five years following the date of approval in the United States, 1 August 2014 through 30 September 2019. In the context of noninterventional studies of a newly available medication with prospectively accumulating real‐world data, baseline information from the early stages can provide valuable insights regarding study validity and inform projections of exposure accrual over time and the resulting statistical power. 11, 12 These elements can be crucial to determine the level of confidence in future findings that may inform prompt decision‐making with regard to diabetes treatment.

We sought to describe the rationale and study design of EMPRISE and, using the first year of data, to (a) assess the ability to overcome confounding and achieve high study validity by measuring baseline comparability of treatment groups in the study population; and (b) assess when adequate statistical power will be achieved using projected drug exposure accrual.

### Eligibility for dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in a real-world heart failure population [^116YSxr5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated eligibility for dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in a real-world heart failure (HF) cohort based on selection criteria of DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure), DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure), and EMPEROR (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction and Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with APreserved Ejection Fraction) trials.

Methods and Results

Selection criteria were applied to the Swedish HF registry outpatient population according to 3 scenarios: (i) a "trial scenario" applying all selection criteria; (ii) a "pragmatic scenario" applying the most clinically relevant criteria; and (iii) a "label scenario" following the regulatory agencies labels. Of the 49,317 patients, 55% had an ejection fraction of less than 40% and were assessed for eligibility based on DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced, 45% had ejection fraction of 40% or greater and were assessed based on EMPEROR-Preserved and DELIVER. Eligibility using trial, pragmatic, and label scenarios was 35%, 61%, and 80% for DAPA-HF; 31%, 55%, and 81% for EMPEROR-Reduced; 30%, 61%, and 74% for DELIVER; and 32%, 59%, and 75% for EMPEROR-Preserved, respectively. The main selection criteria limiting eligibility were HF duration and N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels. Eligible patients had more severe HF, more comorbidities, higher use of HF treatments and higher mortality and morbidity. Clinical Highlights: Large clinical trials for the approval of new drugs in heart failure often apply numerous selection criteria, limiting the generalizability of trial findings to real-world populations. We assessed eligibility for dapagliflozin and empagliflozin according to trial criteria, the more practical criteria usually applied in daily practice for treatment selection, and the criteria mandated by regulatory agencies, in a real-word heart failure population. Our results from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry show that a great number of patients with heart failure might be candidates for these therapies, which have been shown to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality; therefore, their use should be implemented in clinical practice.

Lay Summary

When strictly applying selection criteria used in clinical trials, only one-third of a real-world heart failure population is eligible for treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin. Adopting approaches that consider the most meaningful criteria, that is, those most clinically relevant or those mandated by regulatory agencies, significantly broadened eligibility. These results might contribute to future trial design taking into consideration the characteristics of real-world populations, feasibility, and potential cost benefits.

Conclusions

In a real-world HF setting, eligibility for sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors was similar whether selection criteria from DAPA-HF or EMPEROR-Reduced were applied in HFrEF, or EMPEROR-Preserved or DELIVER in HFpEF. These data might help stakeholders assessing the consequences of future trial eligibility.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to insulin in type 1 diabetes: a review of randomized controlled trials [^114p8hFG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Positive results from clinical trials of SGLT‐2 inhibitors and an SGLT‐1/2 inhibitor for patients with T1D have led to new recommendations issued by regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States. The European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CMPH) recommended approving sotagliflozin and extending the indication of dapagliflozin, each as an adjunct to insulin, in adults with T1D having body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in whom insulin does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimization of therapy. 51, 52 In March 2019, the European Commission approved dapagliflozin for use in patients with T1D as indicated above, 53 while the decision on sotagliflozin is pending. Likewise, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approved dapagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin for adults with T1D. 54 Another SGLT‐2 inhibitor used for the treatment of T2D in Japan, ipragliflozin, was approved for a T1D indication in late 2018. 55 In early 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee delivered a tie vote on the use of sotagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin in patients with T1D, in whom optimal control of blood glucose levels is not achieved with insulin alone. 56, 57 A key point of consideration involved discussion of the benefits of sotagliflozin weighed against the risk of DKA, including appropriate selection of patients and whether the risk of DKA can be mitigated in the real world. However, the US FDA ultimately declined to approve sotagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin in patients with T1D. 58

Given the apparent increased risk of DKA with SGLT‐2 inhibitor and SGLT‐1/2 inhibitor use in T1D, it will be imperative to carefully select the patients in whom these medications will be prescribed. There is little direct evidence to help define the ideal patient population, but the risk factors that drive DKA in patients taking these medications are likely similar to those in the general T1D population. Thus, fundamental guidelines for patient selection can be suggested. If approved, SGLT inhibitors should be considered in patients with T1D who have demonstrated both adherence to their prescribed insulin regimen, and the ability to understand and utilize relevant education relating to DKA risk and risk mitigation strategies. These medications should be avoided in patients who have had recent or recurrent DKA, who have difficulty adhering to the prescribed insulin regimen, or who have difficulty processing or synthesizing relevant diabetes‐related information.

Type 2 diabetes — Table 5 opportunities to initiate SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated cardiovascular or renal benefit: Suggested initiation scenarios include in a patient with T2D and ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA); at the time of diagnosis of clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) in a patient with T2D on a regimen without these agents; at the time of diagnosis of T2D in a patient with clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor); at hospital discharge with close outpatient follow-up after admission for ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) events; in a patient with T2D and diabetic kidney disease (SGLT2 inhibitor, alternatively GLP-1RA for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2); and in patients determined to be at high risk of ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor). At the time of hospital discharge or in the outpatient setting, increased vigilance regarding hypoglycemia surveillance is warranted, especially in background insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, and clinicians should use judgment when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if renal function is impaired or an ACE inhibitor/ARB will be started or up-titrated.

### Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin as a treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a multinational health-economic analysis of DAPA-HF [^111JZ6Sy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Mortality, hospitalization for heart failure and adverse events

The model captured the incidence of first and recurrent HHF and urgent HF visits as discrete clinical events, as well as capturing the occurrence of relevant AEs, cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality. Parametric multivariable survival analysis was used to model all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality over time, adjusted for time‐updated KCCQ‐TSS, baseline patient characteristics including T2DM and study arm, as such, patients with lower KCCQ‐TSS or comorbid T2DM were at increased risk of mortality and HHF events. Analysis was conducted from an intention‐to‐treat perspective using the complete DAPA‐HF dataset. 14 The approach to statistical model selection was consistent with guidelines for the analysis of survival data alongside clinical trials, with goodness‐of‐fit assessed through minimizing Akaike Information Criterion. 22, 23 Mortality was assumed to follow a Weibull distribution in the base‐case analysis, following survival extrapolations compared to previously published long‐term projections to ensure plausible extrapolations. 24, 25, 26 Sensitivity of the results of the model to the choice of survival distribution was assessed using deterministic sensitivity analysis. The proportion of deaths attributable to non‐cardiovascular causes was calculated using country‐specific life‐tables, adjusted to remove cardiovascular mortality to avoid double‐counting. 27, 28, 29, 30 Negative binominal generalized estimating multivariable regression models were developed to estimate the incidence of HHF and urgent HF visits in order to capture both first and subsequent episodes of worsening HF. As only 33 first urgent HF visits were observed in DAPA‐HF, the incidence of urgent HF visits was applied using a constant, treatment arm specific incidence rate. Details of the regression models developed for mortality and HHF are provided in online supplementary Table S3.

The following specific AEs were modelled: volume depletion, worsening renal function, episodes of major hypoglycaemia, fracture, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation, urinary tract infection and genital infection. The incidence of genital infection was not routinely collected in DAPA‐HF, as such modelled incidence rates are based on the dapagliflozin and placebo arms of DECLARE‐TIMI 58. 31 Serious AEs were not modelled in their entirety due to the overall favourable tolerability profile associated with dapagliflozin, with 35.7% of patients treated with dapagliflozin experiencing a serious AE in comparison with 40.2% in the placebo arm of DAPA‐HF. Treatment specific AEs were modelled assuming a constant hazard; these are reported in online supplementary Table S4.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117Xxkqj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are a core therapy, and the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF Guideline recommends SGLT inhibitors as a Class I, Level of Evidence: A therapy to reduce the risk of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and cardiovascular (CV) mortality irrespective of diabetes in symptomatic chronic HFrEF. In DAPA-HF, among 4,744 patients with HFrEF, events occurred in 16.3% with dapagliflozin vs 21.2% with placebo (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.65–0.85; P < 0.001), with a 30% decrease in first worsening HF and an 18% decrease in CV death, and treatment attenuated long-term decline in eGFR. In EMPEROR-Reduced, 3,730 patients with chronic HFrEF were randomized, and empagliflozin reduced CV death or HF hospitalization (19.4% vs 24.7%; HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65–0.86; P < 0.001) and slowed the decline in eGFR over time. In SOLOIST-WHF, among 1,222 participants (average LVEF 35%), sotagliflozin was associated with a 29% reduction in worsening HF or CV death during an average 18 months of follow-up, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted an indication for sotagliflozin to reduce CV events in patients with HF. Additional benefits of SGLT inhibitors include improvement in health status, reduction in loop diuretic agent dose, reduced episodes of hyperuricemia and clinical gout, and minimal blood pressure-lowering effects that may favor their use in individuals with lower blood pressures intolerant to other GDMT options.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117CUzNz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — medication access measures for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) notes that newer HFrEF therapies are often expensive, with higher monthly costs and copays, and more time and effort are frequently required to obtain them; prior authorization from payers is often required before these medications will be covered, which can serve as a significant barrier to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). In 2017, the ACC and a coalition of 16 medical organizations called for reform of the prior authorization process and utilization management requirements that increase clinical workload and limit patient access to care, and managing approvals for medications may be time-consuming. Although cost-effectiveness analyses of sacubitril/valsartan, ivabradine, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and vericiguat showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that compares favorably to other accepted cardiovascular therapies when first adopted or approved, these studies consider societal cost but not the fiscal impact on the individual patient. Pharmacists can help navigate insurance coverage and patient assistance programs; standard requests through patient assistance programs allow for 90-day supplies with 3 refills to provide coverage for 1 year, and income verification and reordering procedures are among the most challenging aspects of patient assistance programs for patients and clinicians.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^114rnkvX]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

ARE ADEQUATE THERAPEUTIC TOOLS AVAILABLE NOW FOR PERSONALIZED DIABETES CARE?

Multiple glucose-lowering medication classes: freedom or confusion?

We now have numerous classes of antihyperglycemic therapies (Table 2) and more are expected to be licensed. Does this extensive arsenal provide us with more flexibility in designing personalized diabetes regimens, or does it make the task more difficult by multiplying the options? For specialists, the answer is no doubt the former. But for many primary care providers who must simultaneously stay abreast of developments in numerous fields of medicine, the expanding array of choices may, at times, seem intimidating.

Table 2
Classes of antihyperglycemic agents

Recent meta-analyses have shown that there is not much difference among available therapies in glycemic control (e.g. A1C reduction and likelihood of achieving targets when adding an agent to metformin). However, when one considers other benefits, such as the risk of hypoglycemia and effects on body weight, there appears to be separation among the agents. In addition to these agents' relative glycemic efficacy and effects on body weight and hypoglycemia, HCPs immersed in diabetes care must balance the potential benefits of each agent against concerns that have been raised regarding possible associations between various agents and the risk of developing other diseases.

Difficulties in making benefit-risk judgments are further amplified by the fact that marketing may seek to create demand for drugs that is out of proportion to their efficacy. In addition, there remains a general lack of adequate comparative and exploratory controlled trials between the medications available, not to mention a lack of research into phenotype- and pathophysiology-based regimens.

Developing a straightforward algorithm that narrows the field of viable options will clearly require more evidence than is currently available. Without such evidence, we can offer only opinion, albeit opinion based on an understanding of pathophysiology, epidemiology, pharmacodynamics, toxicology, and costs. Unfortunately, the studies needed to make evidence-based treatment decisions — those that involve comparisons among multiple agents and are adequately powered for important, long-term clinical outcomes — have, for the most part, not been performed.

Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — implementation and cost barriers in the United States — one of the biggest challenges is the cost of newer therapies; in the United States a 30-day supply of SGLT2 inhibitors costs in the range of $300-$450 with out-of-pocket costs between $4 (Medicaid) and $137 (uninsured), with most Medicare and privately insured patients paying ~ $50 per month, and Medicare patients are excluded from the vast majority of manufacturer assistance programs; nationally, more than 75% of US adults think prescription drug costs are unaffordable, ~33% report not taking medications as prescribed due to costs, 7% delayed care due to cost, 6% did not get care, and 9% either delayed or did not get care due to costs; in 2019 the United States spent > $1,000 per capita on prescription medications, approximately $500 higher than any other similar country.

### Coverage, formulary restrictions, and out-of-pocket costs for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in the Medicare part D program [^111oj2cK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced a voluntary plan to cap out-of-pocket costs associated with insulin products in participating enhanced Part D plans. However, this model will not apply to other high-cost glucose-lowering medications such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. These classes are increasingly used as second-line agents for patients with type 2 diabetes despite only a modest effect on glycemic control (approximately 0.8% to 1%) because of mounting evidence of cardiovascular benefits. We sought to examine contemporary coverage and out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries filling either an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist prescription in Medicare Part D.

### Comparison of diabetes medications used by adults with commercial insurance vs Medicare advantage, 2016 to 2019 [^111AnR5C]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study identified gaps in the use of effective, safe, and guideline-recommended medications to lower glucose levels among patients with Medicare Advantage health insurance, particularly among patients who may benefit from preferential use of these medications, such as those with underlying cardiovascular or kidney disease. The effect of the observed disparities may be unknown until the long-term benefits of these agents are more definitively established. Initiation of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i treatment was also reduced among individuals in lower-income households, potentially contributing to poor health outcomes in this population. The findings suggest that innovative solutions are needed to address logistical and financial barriers to evidence-based diabetes management, including simplifying coverage requirements, reducing cost-sharing responsibilities, and creating transparent and straightforward avenues for all patients to obtain and afford the medications they need to optimally manage their disease. Such efforts may help improve access to new diabetes therapeutics, reduce disparities, and improve the health outcomes for patients living with diabetes.

### Projected clinical benefits of implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure [^115shDdd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors form the latest pillar in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and appear to be effective across a range of patient profiles. There is increasing interest in initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors during hospitalization, yet little is known about the putative benefits of this implementation strategy.

Methods

We evaluated Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF (≤ 40%) hospitalized at 228 sites in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) registry in 2016 who had linked claims data for ≥ 1 year postdischarge. We identified those eligible for dapagliflozin under the latest U.S. Food and Drug Administration label (excluding estimated glomerular filtration rates < 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, dialysis and type 1 diabetes). We evaluated 1-year outcomes overall and among key subgroups (age ≥ 75 years, gender, race, hospital region, kidney function, diabetes status, triple therapy). We then projected the potential benefits of implementation of dapagliflozin based on the risk reductions observed in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial.

Results

Among 7523 patients hospitalized for HFrEF, 6576 (87%) would be candidates for dapagliflozin (mean age 79 ± 8 years, 39% women, 11% Black). Among eligible candidates, discharge use of β-blockers, ACEi/ARB, MRA, ARNI, and triple therapy (ACEi/ARB/ARNI+β-blocker+MRA) was recorded in 88%, 64%, 29%, 3%, and 20%, respectively. Among treatment-eligible patients, the 1-year incidence (95% CI) of mortality was 37% (36–38%) and of HF readmission was 33% (32–34%), and each exceeded 25% across all key subgroups. Among 1333 beneficiaries eligible for dapagliflozin who were already on triple therapy, the 1-year incidence of mortality was 26% (24%-29%) and the 1-year readmission due to HF was 30% (27%-32%). Applying the relative risk reductions observed in DAPA-HF, absolute risk reductions with complete implementation of dapagliflozin among treatment-eligible Medicare beneficiaries are projected to be 5% (1%-9%) for mortality and 9% (5%-12%) for HF readmission by 1 year. The projected number of Medicare beneficiaries who would need to be treated for 1 year to prevent 1 death is 19 (11–114), and 12 (8–21) would need to be treated to prevent 1 readmission due to HF.

Conclusions

Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF who are eligible for dapagliflozin after hospitalization due to HF, including those well-treated with other disease-modifying therapies, face high risks of mortality and HF readmission by 1 year. If the benefits of reductions in death and hospitalizations due to HF observed in clinical trials can be fully realized, the absolute benefits of implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors among treatment-eligible candidates are anticipated to be substantial in this high-risk postdischarge setting.

### Positioning sulphonylureas in a modern treatment algorithm for patients with type 2 diabetes: expert opinion from a European consensus panel [^111cgeXR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The large number of pharmacological agents available to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) makes choosing the optimal drug for any given patient a complex task. Because newer agents offer several advantages, whether and when sulphonylureas (SUs) should still be used to treat T2D is controversial. Published treatment guidelines and recommendations should govern the general approach to diabetes management. However, expert opinions can aid in better understanding local practices and in formulating individual choices. The current consensus paper aims to provide additional guidance on the use of SUs in T2D. We summarize current local treatment guidelines in European countries, showing that SUs are still widely proposed as second-line treatment after metformin and are often ranked at the same level as newer glucose-lowering medications. Strong evidence now shows that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are associated with low hypoglycaemia risk, promote weight loss, and exert a positive impact on vascular, cardiac and renal endpoints. Thus, using SUs in place of SGLT-2is and GLP-1RAs may deprive patients of key advantages and potentially important cardiorenal benefits. In subjects with ascertained cardiovascular disease or at very high cardiovascular risk, SGLT-2is and/or GLP-1RAs should be used as part of diabetes management, in the absence of contraindications. Routine utilization of SUs as second-line agents continues to be acceptable in resource-constrained settings.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^112XFKci]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

When transitioning to iGlarLixi from basal insulin, the starting dose depends on the patient's current basal insulin regimen. It is recommended to start at 30 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on 30 units of basal insulin daily or more, and 15 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on < 30 units of basal insulin daily, with titration directed by FPG targets. In those transitioning to iDegLira from basal insulin, the starting dose is 16 units once daily, with titration based on FPG, up to a maximum daily dose of 50 units once daily. Short‐acting insulin should generally be discontinued once an FRC is initiated, unless continued for specific prandial needs that are not expected to be covered by the GLP‐1 RA component. The rationale for discontinuing short‐acting insulin once initiating an FRC is that the GLP‐1 RA is expected to provide sufficient prandial glucose control. In most patients, this is sufficient to address post‐prandial glycemic excursions without the need for additional insulin. However, for those with high carbohydrate intake, continued post‐prandial excursions or long‐standing diabetes with impaired beta‐cell function, prandial insulin may be warranted to achieve glycemic targets.

6.3 Changing from a‐1 receptor agonist to an

Switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC such as iGlarLixi or iDegLira is a strategy to consider when glycemic control is inadequate, particularly secondary to rising FPG levels not being adequately addressed by the GLP‐1 RA alone. Patient selection should take into account the degree to which HbA1c exceeds the target. Overall, intensifying therapy from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC provides an improvement in HbA1c of ~1%. In those on a GLP‐1 RA with more marked HbA1c elevations (i.e. HbA1c more than 2% above goal or more than 10%), FRC therapy may not be expected to achieve glycemic targets, necessitating the initiation of a separate basal insulin. Rates of hypoglycaemia are expected to increase with FRC use due to the inclusion of basal insulin, though the hypoglycaemia risk remains low overall. Weight gain should be expected when initiating an FRC compared to GLP‐1 RA monotherapy due to the insulin component, though it is usually modest and offset by the improvement in glycemic control.

### Medicare drug price negotiation program-https: / / aspe. hhs. gov… [^1153NfVK]. aspe.hhs.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

The Inflation Reduction Act makes improvements to Medicare to increase accessibility and affordability of prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, reduce the rate of growth in Medicare drug spending, and improve the financial sustainability of the Medicare program. Over 67. 3 million Americans are enrolled in the Medicare program, of whom about
54. 1 million are enrolled in the Part D prescription drug program. Under the IRA, the Secretary of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to directly negotiate the prices of certain high expenditure, single source drugs without generic or biosimilar competition with participating drug manufacturers. The IRA requires that drugs selected for negotiation have high total Medicare gross expenditures and meet other criteria defined in the law, including criteria outlined in program guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in accordance with the law.

On August 29, 2023, CMS published the list of 10 drugs covered under Medicare Part D selected for the first cycle of negotiation. The drugs selected are Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and NovoLog/Fiasp. In this issue brief, we examine how the maximum fair prices for these drugs negotiated on behalf of people with Medicare compare to historical list prices and average transaction prices across all payers in the U. S. market. *This content is in the process of Section 508 review. If you need immediate assistance accessing this content, please submit a request to Kenneth Finegold, Kenneth. Finegold@hhs. gov.
