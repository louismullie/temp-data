## Question

what microcytic anemia has high serum iron?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which microcytic anemia presents with high serum iron and how to distinguish it from other causes of microcytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core differential of microcytic anemia and the typical iron study patterns. Then, I should verify which entities can paradoxically show high serum iron despite microcytosis. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that explains this discordance. After that, I need to check supportive laboratory features and diagnostic steps. Finally, I will consider management implications and synthesize a concise answer with the most likely diagnosis and key differentiators.

> Let me first confirm the common causes of microcytosis and their usual iron profiles. Iron deficiency anemia typically shows low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, high TIBC, and low ferritin, whereas thalassemia trait often has normal or high iron indices and a disproportionately low MCV for the degree of anemia; anemia of chronic disease classically has low serum iron with low TIBC and normal or high ferritin due to inflammation, and sideroblastic anemias can show high ferritin with variable serum iron depending on the mechanism and chronicity [^111wbP4h] [^112c7tiS] [^116ir8de].

> Wait, let me verify which entities actually produce high serum iron with microcytosis. The most consistent pattern of high serum iron with microcytic anemia occurs in iron-loading anemias driven by ineffective erythropoiesis, where erythroferrone suppresses hepcidin despite iron overload; examples include non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia and some myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts, both of which can show elevated serum iron and ferritin with microcytosis due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis and iron utilization [^115v52ao]. I should also consider DMT1 deficiency, a rare inherited defect of endosomal iron transport that causes microcytic anemia with high transferrin saturation and iron overload, including liver iron accumulation, which fits the "high iron" phenotype even though the anemia reflects impaired intracellular iron utilization rather than true iron excess [^116Q6UJD] [^116Q6UJD]. Hold on, I should verify that congenital atransferrinemia does not belong here; despite iron overload, serum iron is typically low because transferrin is absent, so it does not fit the "high serum iron" criterion we are targeting [^114UkZXF].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure this makes sense. In ineffective erythropoiesis, expanded but faulty erythropoiesis releases erythroferrone, which suppresses hepcidin. With low hepcidin, intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release continue unchecked, leading to systemic iron overload and high serum iron despite microcytosis from defective hemoglobin synthesis. This creates the paradox of high circulating iron with low hemoglobin content per cell [^115v52ao]. In DMT1 deficiency, the defect is at the level of iron egress from endosomes into the cytosol, so erythroid precursors cannot use iron efficiently even though transferrin saturation and serum iron are high, again producing microcytosis with high serum iron and iron overload features [^116Q6UJD] [^116Q6UJD].

> Next, I should review supportive laboratory clues that help distinguish these entities. In non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis shows elevated HbA2 and often HbF, and the MCV is disproportionately low relative to the hemoglobin level. In MDS with ring sideroblasts, a bone marrow examination demonstrates ring sideroblasts and cytogenetic abnormalities. In DMT1 deficiency, transferrin saturation is markedly elevated and ferritin is normal or mildly increased despite liver iron overload, and genetic testing confirms DMT1 variants. Importantly, in all these conditions, serum iron and transferrin saturation tend to be high, contrasting with the low iron/low TSAT pattern of iron deficiency anemia [^111wbP4h] [^116UL4QN] [^117TR7QE] [^116Q6UJD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check that we are not conflating with other microcytic processes. Anemia of chronic disease usually has low serum iron with low TIBC and normal or high ferritin, so it does not fit a high serum iron profile; iron deficiency anemia has low serum iron and low TSAT; thalassemia trait alone often shows normal or high iron indices but may not consistently present with frankly elevated serum iron unless there is coexisting iron loading, which is why the clearest "high serum iron" microcytic anemia is an iron-loading anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis or a transport/utilization defect like DMT1 deficiency [^116ir8de] [^111wbP4h] [^115v52ao].

> I will now examine management implications briefly to ensure clinical coherence. In non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia and related iron-loading anemias, iron overload management may involve chelation rather than iron supplementation, and serum ferritin thresholds above 800 ng/mL should prompt treatment for iron overload; in DMT1 deficiency, oral iron is typically ineffective and parenteral iron may be required, with attention to iron overload risk; by contrast, in classic iron deficiency anemia, oral or intravenous iron repletion is indicated, and a robust hemoglobin rise after iron therapy supports that diagnosis even if initial studies are equivocal [^113CTph7] [^117TR7QE] [^114J4SK1].

> Let me reconsider the original question to ensure precision. Which microcytic anemia has high serum iron? The best answer is iron-loading anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis, particularly non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia and some myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts, and, as a rarer but paradigmatic example, DMT1 deficiency; these entities share impaired hemoglobin synthesis or intracellular iron utilization with systemic iron overload and suppressed or dysregulated hepcidin signaling, producing microcytosis with high serum iron and high transferrin saturation [^115v52ao] [^117TR7QE] [^116Q6UJD].

---

The microcytic anemia with high serum iron is **sideroblastic anemia** [^115c5dhW], including hereditary and acquired forms, due to defective mitochondrial heme synthesis that traps iron in mitochondria, causing iron overload and high serum iron despite microcytosis [^115c5dhW]. Other causes of microcytosis with high serum iron include **thalassemia intermedia/major** (ineffective erythropoiesis with iron overload) [^115v52ao] and rare **DMT1 deficiency** (impaired iron export with high transferrin saturation and liver iron) [^117TR7QE] [^116Q6UJD]. In contrast, iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease show low serum iron and are excluded here [^116ir8de] [^117UMLkX].

---

## Pathophysiology of sideroblastic anemia

Sideroblastic anemia arises from **defective mitochondrial heme synthesis**, causing iron accumulation in mitochondria and forming ring sideroblasts [^115c5dhW]. This mitochondrial iron trapping leads to systemic iron overload and high serum iron despite microcytosis [^115v52ao].

---

## Laboratory findings in sideroblastic anemia

Typical laboratory findings in sideroblastic anemia include:

| **Laboratory test** | **Findings in sideroblastic anemia** |
|-|-|
| Hemoglobin (Hb) | Low |
| Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) | Low (microcytic) |
| Serum iron | High |
| Ferritin | High |
| Transferrin saturation | High |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | Normal or low |
| Peripheral smear | - Microcytic <br/> - Hypochromic <br/> - Basophilic stippling <br/> - Ringed sideroblasts on bone marrow |

---

Ringed sideroblasts on bone marrow examination are **pathognomonic** for sideroblastic anemia [^111wtzm3].

---

## Hereditary vs. acquired sideroblastic anemia

Sideroblastic anemia may be **hereditary or acquired**:

- **Hereditary sideroblastic anemia**: Often due to mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in heme synthesis, such as ALAS2 [^115c5dhW].

- **Acquired sideroblastic anemia**: Associated with exposure to toxins (e.g. alcohol, lead), drugs (e.g. isoniazid, chloramphenicol), or underlying hematologic malignancies (e.g. myelodysplastic syndrome) [^115v52ao].

---

## Clinical implications of high serum iron in microcytic anemia

High serum iron in microcytic anemia indicates **iron overload**, which can cause significant morbidity, including:

- **Liver damage**: Hepatic iron overload leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

- **Cardiac complications**: Arrhythmias and heart failure due to myocardial iron deposition.

- **Endocrine disturbances**: Diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism.

Management focuses on correcting the underlying cause, using **iron chelation therapy** to reduce iron burden, and providing supportive care [^113CTph7].

---

## Differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia with high serum iron

The **differential diagnosis** of microcytic anemia with high serum iron includes:

- **Sideroblastic anemia**: Defective heme synthesis causing mitochondrial iron accumulation [^115c5dhW].

- **Thalassemia intermedia/major**: Ineffective erythropoiesis leading to iron overload [^115v52ao].

- **DMT1 deficiency**: Rare genetic disorder causing impaired iron export and iron overload [^117TR7QE].

Iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease are excluded because they characteristically present with **low serum iron** [^111sFJG3] [^117UMLkX].

---

## Management strategies

Management of microcytic anemia with high serum iron involves:

- **Identifying and treating the underlying cause**: Addressing genetic mutations, discontinuing offending drugs, or treating underlying malignancies.

- **Iron chelation therapy**: Using agents such as deferoxamine, deferasirox, or deferiprone to reduce iron overload [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Managing complications of iron overload, including liver and cardiac complications.

---

Sideroblastic anemia is the **primary microcytic anemia** associated with high serum iron, due to defective mitochondrial heme synthesis causing iron accumulation and overload [^115c5dhW]. Other causes include thalassemia intermedia/major and DMT1 deficiency, but iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease are excluded because they present with low serum iron [^115v52ao] [^117TR7QE] [^116ir8de] [^117UMLkX].

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

Accurate and timely interpretation of microcytic anemia can be diagnostically challenging in the primary care setting. We sought to develop a novel model for distinguishing iron-deficiency anemia from thalassemia trait in the modern pediatric population. Demographic history and red blood cell indices were retrospectively characterized for 76 children referred to our pediatric hematology clinic for evaluation of microcytic anemia. Statistically significant variables were sequentially added into a logistic regression model to develop the final model. The final discriminating model incorporates red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell values. Favorable predictive performance is seen in the initial (sensitivity 89.2%, specificity 92.3%) and external validation cohort (sensitivity 84.4%, specificity 88.9%). This novel tool may aid in determining the cause of hypochromic, microcytic anemia in the primary care setting. Finally, the study cohort reflects an underrepresented group in the development of screening tools, and thus offers generalizability.

### High serum transferrin receptor level in anemia of chronic disorders indicates coexistent iron deficiency [^115LDMYR]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Blood transferrin receptor (TR) level is largely determined by the quantum of erythropoiesis and by intracellular iron content of the cells of the erythroid lineage. Hence, a high serum TR level has been found to be useful in distinguishing iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from anemia of chronic disorders (ACD). In order to examine its potential role in the diagnosis of concomitant iron deficiency in ACD, we determined serum TR levels in 130 cases of ACD, in 25 cases of IDA, and in 40 normal adults. As expected, all patients of IDA had significantly higher serum TR levels compared to the normal subjects (4.2–19.2 microg/dL vs. 1.3–3.0 microg/dL) (P < 0.002). In 11/25 cases of IDA, the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was in the normal range although bone marrow iron store was absent and serum TR levels were high, thereby highlighting the superiority of TR level in the diagnosis of iron deficiency compared to TIBC. Although 54% (70/130) patients of ACD had normal or low serum TR levels (0.9–3.0 microg/dL) as expected, in 46% (60/130) of ACD patients, serum TR levels were high (3.2–11.0 microg/dL). Mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, and transferrin saturation were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the latter group of patients compared to the former, and these parameters resembled those in IDA patients. Also, serum iron was lower and TIBC was higher in this group of ACD patients compared to those with normal or low serum TR. All these features point to an "IDA-like" profile of ACD patients with high TR and support the possibility of co-existent iron deficiency in this subgroup of ACD patients. In light of these observations it would be prudent to treat ACD patients with high serum TR levels with iron replacement therapy.

Discussion

In general, microcytosis results from conditions that lead to a disruption of alpha or beta-globin-chain production. Most commonly, microcytosis is the result of decreased iron availability or an underlying inherited haemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The Mentzer index is one way of quickly discerning between thalassemia and iron-deficiency, with an MCV/RBC ratio < 13 suggesting thalassemia. In our patient, the value of 11.7 in conjunction with his iron studies was consistent with thalassemia.

Decreased iron availability may be due to an absolute lack of iron stores (ie, iron deficiency), or to a functional lack of available iron. A functional iron deficiency can manifest in the setting of a chronic inflammatory state where serum hepcidin levels are elevated or in the setting of sideroblastic anaemia. In this case, the patient's other comorbidities may have precipitated some chronic inflammation, though his erythrocyte sedimentation rate of only 13 mm/hour argues against an overwhelming inflammatory state.

The exact mechanism by which red blood cells become microcytic is not well documented. The predominant theory is that red blood cells stop dividing once they reach a certain concentration of intracellular haemoglobin. As the production of haemoglobin slows down, more divisions occur before this concentration is reached, resulting in smaller cells. For this reason, microcytosis serves as a loose indicator of decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and macrocytosis an indicator of decreased DNA production.

Diagnosing the aforementioned conditions is fairly standard, with evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, a complete CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate stores, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A bone marrow biopsy is required for identification of ringed sideroblasts in clinching the diagnosis of a sideroblastic anaemia. The haemoglobin electrophoresis is useful in cases of beta-thalassemia and certain cases of alpha-thalassemia (where 3 or 4 copies of the alpha-globin gene are defective resulting in the production of HbH). Alpha-globin and/or beta-globin gene sequencing can also be undertaken, though this is most often done as part of family planning when both parents are suspected of being carriers of a silent mutation.

### Evaluation of microcytosis… [^1163Uzk6]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

It is critical to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy in men and nonmenstruating women. 5, 9, 21, 22 Gastrointestinal sources of blood loss should also be considered in menstruating women and adolescent girls when the anemia is refractory to iron treatment or when gastrointestinal symptoms are present. 23, 24. If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include measurement of serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased. On the other hand, if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal, anemia of chronic disease is most likely. 2, 8, 14 A bone marrow biopsy can help identify sideroblastic anemia.

A serum lead test can detect lead toxicity, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidelines on which high-risk groups of children to screen. 26, 27 Even in the presence of lead toxicity, microcytic anemia can be caused by coexisting iron deficiency anemia.
28. Specific Causes of Microcytosis IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the absorption of iron through dietary intake does not match the needs of the body. The mismatch occurs from inadequate dietary intake or increased needs, which usually cause only mild anemia, or from blood loss or malabsorption, which can lead to more significant anemia. Young children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women have the highest prevalence of the condition. 1 Coexisting iron deficiency anemia can lower hemoglobin A2 levels; therefore, iron deficiency anemia must be corrected before hemoglobin electrophoresis results can be appropriately evaluated.
31.

ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Anemia of chronic disease can be caused by chronic infections or inflammatory processes. Increased levels of cytokines cause a decrease in erythropoietin production, a decreased response to erythropoietin, and interference with iron metabolism. 25 Although anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic, about one fourth to one third of cases are mildly microcytic. The anemia is usually mild and not progressive. Additionally, although serum iron levels are decreased in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin levels are increased because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. 1.

Table 1.
Genetic and acquired iron disorders.

In the clinical setting serum ferritin is a marker of iron deficiency when its level is low, and of iron overload/inflammation when its level is increased, reflecting macrophage ferritin content. However, both the origin and the function of serum ferritin remain largely unexplored. One hypothesis is that the secreted ferritinmay be re-uptaken by cells as an alternative mechanism of iron recycling, e.g. when iron release from macrophages is limited in inflammation.

The cytosolic chaperon Poly (rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) delivers iron to ferritin, and Pcbp1 null mice have microcytic anemia. Ferritin turnover occurs through "ferritinophagy", an autophagic process orchestrated by nuclear receptor co-activator (NCOA)4, a cargo molecule that directs ferritin to lysosomal degradation, to recover iron when needed. PCBP1 also delivers iron to prolylhydroxylase (PHD2) the enzyme that induces degradation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), one of the several links between iron and the hypoxia pathways.

Iron export

The ubiquitous iron exporter ferroportin cooperates with the oxidases ceruloplasmin or hephaestin, to release ferric iron to transferrin. Enterocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes and trophoblasts express high ferroportin levels for their specific functions in iron homeostasis. Blocking iron export may be dangerous in some cells. For example, conditional ferroportin deletion in murine cardiomyocytes leads to local iron overload and cardiac failure; furthermore, specific deletion of ferroportin in erythroblasts and erythrocytes leads to hemolytic anemia, due to the toxicity of iron derived from hemoglobin oxidation in an environment (red blood cells) with limited antioxidant capacity.

Erythroblasts may also export heme through feline leukemia virus C receptor (FLVCR). The latter two export mechanisms seem counterintuitive in cells that need iron/heme for the production of hemoglobin, but are likely biological safeguard mechanisms that protect erythroid cells from iron/heme excess.

### Anemia and malnutrition in geriatric hospitalized patients: a cross-sectional retrospective study [^112JvXXf]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Although CRP was measured as an indicator of systemic inflammation, no significant differences were observed between the anemic and non-anemic groups. However, elevated mean CRP levels were observed in both groups, suggesting a low-grade inflammatory burden across the entire sample, likely reflective of chronic comorbidities common in geriatric inpatients. This may have masked any group-specific differences, limiting our ability to isolate the specific role of inflammation in anemia development. Nevertheless, inflammation is a well-established contributor to anemia of chronic disease via mechanisms such as impaired iron utilization and hepcidin-mediated sequestration of iron stores. Our findings are consistent with prior studies showing that CRP levels may remain uniformly elevated in institutionalized older adults, making it difficult to use CRP alone as a distinguishing factor for anemia etiology.

In line with this, mean MCV values did not significantly differ between anemic and non-anemic patients and were within the normal (normocytic) range in both groups. This suggests that the anemia in our sample does not align with typical patterns of microcytic anemia (often associated with iron deficiency) or macrocytic anemia (typically related to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency). Instead, the normocytic profile may point toward anemia of chronic disease (also called anemia of inflammation), which is frequently normocytic and multifactorial in etiology. This form of anemia is commonly seen in older adults with chronic comorbidities, where iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, and nutrient availability may all be subtly impaired. Thus, the combination of normocytic anemia and elevated CRP levels across both groups points toward a complex interplay of inflammation and nutritional risk in contributing to anemia in geriatric patients.

The multiple linear regression analysis showed that in anemic patients, the serum albumin concentration and the hematocrit value were the decisive predictors of the hemoglobin level. When considering serum albumin concentration to represent a surrogate marker for the nutritional-and protein-status, these findings suggest that the nutritional status of the anemic patients likely triggered the anemia, particularly because it seems that in the anemic group, the blood iron concentration played only a minor role in the development of the anemia. In contrast, albumin was not a significant predictor in the total sample. This discrepancy may be explained by the dominant influence of hematocrit and iron status across the full cohort, which likely overshadowed the more subtle effect of nutritional status. The subgroup analysis in anemic patients, who may already have depleted iron stores, allowed the nuanced role of protein-related nutritional status to emerge more clearly.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Iron-refractory microcytic anemia as the presenting feature of unicentric castleman disease in children [^111WsVUQ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic, iron-refractory, microcytic anemia can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We report the cases of 2 children with occult, unicentric Castleman disease whose primary presenting feature was a chronic, unexplained, iron-refractory, microcytic anemia. Diagnosis was delayed because neither child had palpable lymphadenopathy and the lymphoproliferation was intra-abdominal. Surgical resection cured the anemia and the Castleman disease. A diagnostic clue to Castleman disease is an elevated concentration of interleukin-6 in blood, which causes anemia by inducing the expression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin.

### Anemia in pregnant women: findings from Kuwait birth cohort study [^115pgGJV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia in our setting primarily appears to be linked to low iron levels, as evidenced by the majority of cases presenting with microcytic anemia (MCV < 80 fL). Given that mild iron deficiency anemia rarely results in MCV levels below 80 fL, it is possible that pregnant women with mild anemia with normal MCV may also have iron deficiency anemia. Maintaining adequate iron levels throughout pregnancy is crucial to meet the demands of fetal growth and normal brain development. It is important to note that fetuses accumulate iron stores for postnatal use, particularly during the last trimester, through preferential transfer from the mother, regardless of her iron status. However, professional organizations disagree on screening and supplementation for iron deficiency during pregnancy. The UK adopts a more aggressive approach to screening and supplementation, whereas the US takes a less proactive approach. Notably, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is currently updating its recommendations on iron screening and supplementation during pregnancy. In Kuwait, pregnant women are screened for iron deficiency only if they fall within certain risk categories, such as having a previous diagnosis of iron deficiency, diabetes, smoking, inflammatory bowel syndrome, being multiparas, a history of abnormal uterine bleeding, being underweight or obese, having undergone bariatric surgery, or following a vegetarian diet. It is noteworthy that the prevalence of anemia was significantly lower in women taking iron supplements (26.95% vs. 45.90%); and moderate anemia (Hb 70–99 g/L) was much less common in pregnant women who took supplements compared to those who did not (7.81% vs. 22.95%). Interestingly, our data indicated that while normal ferritin levels were protective against anemia, extremely high ferritin levels (> 150 ng/L) were associated with increased risk of anemia (Table 3) and lower Hb levels (Table 4). This observation, however, was limited to a small number of pregnant women and may be explained by the fact that ferritin is an acute phase reactant, which increases significantly in response to inflammation. Inflammation (such as in cases of clinical or subclinical infection) can lead to anemia, and in such cases, high ferritin levels do not reflect excess iron storage.

### Redefining iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure [^112C2KYL]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Because the treatment of iron deficiency in HF does not depend on characterization of its pathogenesis, efforts to distinguish between absolute and functional iron deficiency at one particular point in time in a patient's clinical course have little therapeutic relevance. There is no rationale for identifying the relative contribution of specific pathophysiologic mechanisms for iron deficiency in clinical practice, and there is no reliable noninvasive means of achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the finding of meaningful hypoferremia together with a hypochromic microcytic anemia might prompt a diagnostic workup for a gastrointestinal malignancy.

### New logarithm-based discrimination formula for differentiating thalassemia trait from iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^111BbzoA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is a global problem that has a serious impact on mothers and infants, and severe anemia is an independent factor for maternal mortality, with a mortality rate of 2.36%, while the rate of anemia in women during pregnancy is as high as 41.8%. Although Thalassemia(TT) is not as high as Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) in incidence, it is also a kind of Microcytic hypochromic anemia (MHA), which can be easily confused with IDA for the similar symptoms and signs. Thalassemia is a monogenic disease caused by the reduction or inhibition of hemoglobin chain synthesis, while IDA is caused by iron deficiency. The causes of the two anemia are different, hence need different treatments. Doctors need to accurately determine the type of anemia of pregnant women and give medical orders to take iron supplements or not. Furthermore, although the vast majority of pregnant women with TT are asymptomatic and usually not associated with any clinical disease, early detection can prevent the birth of a child with homozygous thalassemia syndrome.

Thalassemia is so called because it was first discovered among peoples around the Mediterranean Sea. Thalassemia is mainly distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of high global malaria rate, including the south of the Yangtze River of China. The carrying rate of the thalassemia gene is 16.83%-17.83% in Guangdong Province and 24.51% in Guangxi. In the first 3 months of pregnancy, seven provinces and cities in China, including Chongqing, recommend thalassemia screening as a mandatory item for antenatal care.

Whole blood cell testing is the preliminary means for judging anemia, and serum ferritin and genetic testing are required to determine its type. However, these tests are complex and expensive, require professional testing institutions, thus cannot be used as routine inspection items, and are more difficult in poor and remote areas. Thalassemia is incurable, and a routine iron supplement may cause adverse reactions of iron overload, such as gestational diabetes, placental abnormalities, etc. Studies have found that the maternal β-thalassemia gene independently correlates with hematological diseases in offspring. Identifying thalassemia and iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy is of great significance for treating pregnancy anemia and neonatal health care.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Α-thalassemia frequency and mutations in children with hypochromic microcytic anemias and relation with β-thalassemia, iron deficiency anemia [^113D4Rbz]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of the anemias during childhood are hypochromic and microcytic. The aim of the present study was to determine the status of α-thalassemia mutations and its association with other etiologies, such as iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and β-thalassemia trait, that are frequently seen hypochromic microcytic anemias in children. Children with hypochromic microcytic anemias were included in the study. Serum iron (SI), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method were analyzed. Reverse hybridization of biotinylated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product method was used for detection of α-globin gene mutations. Of the 46 patients involved in the study, 54.3% (n = 25) were boys, and 45.7% (n = 21) were girls. Iron deficiency anemia and β-thalassemia trait were diagnosed in 67.4% (n = 31) and 19.5% (n = 9), respectively. In 17.4% there were α-thalassemia mutations (in 10.9% 3.7 single-gene heterozygote mutation, in 4.3% 20.5-kb double-gene deletion mutation, and in 2.2% α-2 poly-A-1 heterozygote mutation was detected). In 2 patients (4.3%) no etiology was determined. In 2 patients (4.3%) association between iron deficiency anemia and α-thalassemia, in 1 patient (2.2%) association between β and α-thalassemia was detected. In conclusion, α-thalassemia carrier status and its association with other etiologies are frequently seen in Manisa. So, α-thalassemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypochromic microcytic anemias, especially in cases without iron deficiency (ID) and β-thalassemia carrier state.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to diagnose anemia of chronic disease in the presence of serum ferritin > 100 mcg/L and transferrin saturation < 20% in patients with biochemical or clinical evidence of inflammation.

### Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia: a heterogeneous disease that is not always iron refractory [^114bo48f]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Up to now, 94 IRIDA patients of different ethnic origin with 69 different homozygous or compound heterozygous TMPRSS6 defects have been described in 65 families 4, 5, 9, 10. Our case series of 21 patients adds 9 new mutations, spread throughout the entire matriptase‐2 protein and illustrates a geographical distribution of TMPRSS6 defects with different mutations in the patients from Dutch versus Turkish descent. However, haplotype analysis could not prove common ancestry of all patients with identical defects.

Since the cardinal feature of IRIDA is a discrepantly high serum hepcidin in relation to the low iron body status, we hypothesized that the TSAT/hepcidin ratio as first mentioned by Heeney 38 could be a useful diagnostic tool. In our population, consisting of clinically presenting patients and their relatives, TSAT/hepcidin ratio was able to discriminate between bi‐allelic and mono‐allelic IRIDA patients, and between mono‐allelic IRIDA patients and their phenotypically unaffected relatives with the same heterozygous TMPRSS6 defect, even after iron supplementation had been given, provided that inflammation was absent. However, before its introduction as a diagnostic test in the work up of iron deficient microcytic anemic patients suspected for the presence of IRIDA, the ratio needs confirmation in phenotypically and genotypically proven IRIDA patients versus patients presenting with an iron deficient microcytic anemia because of other reasons, e.g. inadequate intake, blood loss or other forms of refractory IDA, such as celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori.

### Anemia in children [^114pjQww]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^11528E2D]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Variation in the expression of hepcidin does not explain the anemia observed in patients with protoporphyria. In a study of 8 patients with EPP, Bossi et alfound that serum and urine hepcidin levels were appropriately low and enteral iron absorption occurred normally. Graziadei et alshowed no overall difference between hepcidin levels among 20 patients with EPP vs controls; however, when stratified by sex and microcytosis, patients who were normocytic had higher hepcidin levels and females with microcytic anemia had expectedly lower levels. Barman-Aksoezen et alreported low levels of hepcidin in their cohort, although without an anticipated increase in iron absorption or total body iron stores. Finally, in the Fech m1Pas/m1Pas mouse model in which hepcidin was induced to provoke an iron-deficient state, Schmidt et alobserved no improvement in erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels or hepatic protoporphyrin accumulation. Taken together, these studies support the notion that hepcidin in EPP is appropriately regulated and that that there are mechanisms independent of hepcidin to explain the iron-deficient phenotype observed in this disorder.

How might iron modulate disease expression in EPP?

The alterations in iron homeostasis in EPP are incompletely understood although various mechanisms have been proposed. First, iron deficiency should limit ALAS2 expression through its iron-responsive element by decreasing ALAS2 translation, which should decrease heme biosynthetic drive and therefore protoporphyrin levels. Second, iron deficiency augments alternative FECH splicing, leading to a reduction in FECH activity, which should increase protoporphyrin levels. Third, FECH is an iron-sulfur cluster protein and reliant on iron both as a substrate and for the formation of its iron-sulfur moieties. The interplay between these mechanisms in vivo requires further study; however, the net effect of iron restriction in EPP is thought to be protective, limiting aberrant protoporphyrin accumulation through a predominant effect on ALAS2 expression.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^116UL4QN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Evaluation of related anemia — Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a decrease in erythropoiesis caused by a deficit in total body iron. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. According to the World Health Organization guideline, IDA affects 30% of the world's population, indicating that it is a problem requiring attention.

Iron deficiency can be divided into 3 stages: prelatent iron deficiency, latent iron deficiency (also called iron-deficient erythropoiesis), and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). At the first stage, iron intake lower than the required amount causes progressive depletion of iron storage primarily in the liver and muscle cells. Patients at this stage generally have no symptoms, and the diagnosis of iron deficiency is made when levels of serum ferritin (the storage form of iron) decrease below 20 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0). Sustained iron storage depletion leads to the second stage of iron deficiency, iron-deficient erythropoiesis, in which iron deficiencies progress and begin to affect erythropoiesis. Despite an increased transferrin level, serum iron level decreases along with transferrin saturation. Erythropoiesis impairment appears when the serum iron level decreases to less than 50.3 μg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179) and transferrin saturation is less than 16%. Hemoglobin level is still within the normal range until the development of the IDA stage. Iron storage levels deplete to the point that they can no longer support the hemoglobin production and generate enough red blood cells (RBCs). Iron deficiency impairs RBC synthesis and hemoglobin production, leading to anemia.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia [^111qp8Jt]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is a hereditary recessive anemia due to a defect in the TMPRSS6 gene encoding Matriptase-2. This protein is a transmembrane serine protease that plays an essential role in down-regulating hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis. Hallmarks of this disease are microcytic hypochromic anemia, low transferrin saturation and normal/high serum hepcidin values. The anemia appears in the post-natal period, although in some cases it is only diagnosed in adulthood. The disease is refractory to oral iron treatment but shows a slow response to intravenous iron injections and partial correction of the anemia. To date, 40 different Matriptase-2 mutations have been reported, affecting all the functional domains of the large ectodomain of the protein. In vitro experiments on transfected cells suggest that Matriptase-2 cleaves Hemojuvelin, a major regulator of hepcidin expression and that this function is altered in this genetic form of anemia. In contrast to the low/undetectable hepcidin levels observed in acquired iron deficiency, in patients with Matriptase-2 deficiency, serum hepcidin is inappropriately high for the low iron status and accounts for the absent/delayed response to oral iron treatment. A challenge for the clinicians and pediatricians is the recognition of the disorder among iron deficiency and other microcytic anemias commonly found in pediatric patients. The current treatment of iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is based on parenteral iron administration; in the future, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway with the aim of suppressing it might become an alternative therapeutic approach.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing surgery (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view hemoglobin levels < 130 g/L as the threshold at which patients are likely to benefit from screening for iron and/or other nutrient deficiencies and enhanced patient blood management measures.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^114eEQko]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Iron‐refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia caused by pathogenic variants in TMPRSS6, encoding matriptase‐2, a transmembrane protease that inhibits hepatic hepcidin synthesis via the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/Small Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) pathway. Pathogenic TMPRSS6 variants lead to inappropriately elevated hepcidin levels relative to the body's iron status, especially circulating iron.

Clinically, IRIDA presents with hypochromic microcytic anaemia with markedly low serum iron and transferrin saturation (TSAT < 10% or < 15% with iron supplementation) in the absence of inflammation. The phenotype is generally more pronounced in children, possibly due to their higher growth‐related iron demands or a different hepcidin set point relative to body iron levels.

Materials and methods

Study population

This is a case-control study conducted at Kırşehir Ahi Evran University Training and Research Hospital Pediatrics Clinic between 1st September 2020 and 31st September 2020. The study included 26 healthy children and 26 children with iron deficiency anemia. Normal hemoglobin and hematocrit lower limits according to age and gender and red cell indices based on normal age and gender determined by the World Health Organization were used for the diagnosis of anemia. All the procedures were followed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In order to evaluate iron status, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin values were analyzed.

The study was conducted with three groups. Group 1 consisted of 26 cases diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia who have not yet commenced treatment. The inclusion criteria for this group require that patients have no chronic physiological diseases, haemoglobinopathies or infections that could affect ferritin levels. The group included patients with microcytic anaemia and iron deficiency based on iron, iron binding capacity, and ferritin levels. To diagnose IDA, we used the World Health Organization's normal age- and sex-specific lower limits for haemoglobin and haematocrit, as well as their normal age- and sex-specific erythrocyte indices, to diagnose the anaemia cases in group 1.

Group 2 consisted of the same patients as in group 1. The patients in this group were treated with 6 mg/kg of ferrous iron preparations for one month. (n = 26)

Group 3: The study sample consisted of children who had undergone a healthy child examination at our hospital and who did not have any chronic complaints(Control group). Specifically, the sample included children between the ages of 0 and 18 years with no health problems. We excluded children with chronic diseases and/or medical conditions that could affect iron homeostasis, resulting in a final sample size of n = 26.

In order to reduce bias in the selection of patients, pre-defined, comprehensive criteria were used to identify individuals for inclusion in the study. These criteria were set in accordance with the main aims and hypotheses of the research. In addition, methods such as random assignment or the creation of balanced groups were used to minimise potential bias between groups. Each step in this selection process was carefully planned and implemented to increase the reliability and internal validity of the research.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Diagnosis… [^115nVPKP]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

2 As such, iron deficiency should still be considered in all cases of anemia unless the mean corpuscular volume is greater than 95 μm³, because this cutoff has a sensitivity of 97. 6 percent. 6 Other causes of microcytosis include chronic inflammatory states, lead poisoning, thalassemia, and sideroblastic anemia.

1. The following diagnostic approach is recommended in patients with anemia and is outlined in Figure
2. 2, 6–11 A serum ferritin level should be obtained in patients with anemia and a mean corpuscular volume less than 95 μm³. Ferritin reflects iron stores and is the most accurate test to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. 7 Although levels below 15 ng per mL are consistent with a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, using a cutoff of 30 ng per mL improves sensitivity from 25 to 92 percent, and specificity remains high at 98 percent.

8, 12 Ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and can be elevated in patients with chronic inflammation or infection. In patients with chronic inflammation, iron deficiency anemia is likely when the ferritin level is less than 50 ng per mL. 7 Ferritin values greater than or equal to 100 ng per mL generally exclude iron deficiency anemia. 9, 10. In patients with no inflammatory states and in whom the ferritin level is indeterminate, further tests can be performed to ascertain iron status. Values consistent with iron deficiency include a low serum iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a high total iron-binding capacity. 2 The soluble transferrin receptor level is an indirect measure of erythropoiesis and is increased in patients with iron deficiency anemia.

8 Another benefit of this test is that the soluble transferrin receptor level is unaffected by inflammatory states and can help identify concomitant iron deficiency anemia in patients with anemia of chronic disease. BLOOD TRANSFUSION There is no universally accepted threshold for transfusing packed red blood cells in patients with iron deficiency anemia. Guidelines often specify certain hemoglobin values as indications to transfuse, but the patient's clinical condition and symptoms are an essential part of deciding whether to transfuse.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^1161wz8n]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A reduced erythrocyte mass can be the consequence of haemolytic anaemia, resulting from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Hereditary or acquired diseases can be the cause of intrinsic abnormalities in the structure and membrane of RBSs, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, enzymatic disorders (glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] and pyruvate synthesis), sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia. Regarding extrinsic factors of anaemia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation represent mechanical processes with the destruction of RBCs. Furthermore, antibody‐mediated destruction of RBCs can also be considered an extrinsic disorder.

The morphology of anaemia is described by RBC size, shape and colour. Using this classification system, anaemias are classified as hypochromic microcytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 fL), macrocytic anaemia (MCV > 100 fL) and normocytic normochromic anaemia (MCV: 80–100 fL). Main causes of microcytic anaemia include IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, with impaired iron absorption due to tissue inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively. Inflammation through cytokine‐mediated mechanisms may trigger an increase in hepcidin and a decrease in circulating iron levels, but not ferritin, hence in the presence of biochemical and/or clinical evidence of inflammation, ACD should be diagnosed if serum ferritin levels are increased and transferrin saturation is decreased.

Finally, anaemia can also be classified according to the form of clinical presentation as acute (usually due to bleeding or haemolysis) or chronic.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Hematological parameters and prevalence of anemia in white and British Indian vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the UK biobank [^117WERHg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Another explanation for differences in red blood cell count is that given the crucial role of vitamin B-12 in erythropoiesis, deficiency in this nutrient in vegetarians or vegans may result in red blood cells that do not develop normally and are too large to leave the bone marrow, which subsequently manifests as lower counts of reticulocytes and mature red blood cells in these diet groups. For subtypes of anemia, macrocytic anemia can be induced by vitamin B-12 deficiency but can be masked by the simultaneous presence of microcytic anemia in cases of severe iron deficiency or high folate intake; previous studies have shown that all 3 exposures are likely in vegetarians. Numbers for anemia subtypes were small in this study, however, and serum levels of relevant nutrients and other parameters that would be used in a clinical setting to classify anemia were not available. Hence, it was not possible to determine how these factors affected the distribution of anemia subtypes in different diet groups.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10⁹ /L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio 2:1 (rather than the normal 3:1 ratio) with a mild left shift, that is, increased early erythroid precursors, and signs of dyserythropoiesis including binucleated erythroblasts, occasional cytoplasmic bridges, and karyorrhexis (Figure 1). Ring sideroblasts were not noted. Cytogenetic testing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry did not show evidence of malignancy or MDS. Based on these findings along with the relatively high ferritin, suboptimal reticulocytosis, and family history of macrocytic anemia with iron overload, a possible diagnosis of CDA was considered, leading to next‐generation sequencing (NGS) on a panel of genes associated with HHA/CDA (Table S1), which demonstrated a novel heterozygous variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 8 of ALAS2 (c.1066G > A, p. Val356Met) (Figure 2).

### Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia: a heterogeneous disease that is not always iron refractory [^114zws9u]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Matriptase‐2, encoded by TMPRSS6, plays an essential role in down‐regulating hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis. Pathogenic TMPRSS6 mutations result in uninhibited hepcidin production, causing iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), a disease characterized by a microcytic, hypochromic anemia due to serum hepcidin values that are inappropriately high for the body iron levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

IRIDA patients typically present in childhood with microcytic anemia not responding to oral iron, in combination with remarkably low transferrin saturation (TSAT), which tends to become less severe with increasing age 7. Serum ferritin levels are generally within the low‐normal range, and increase following intravenous (iv) iron treatment 5. Only a few patients with elevated ferritin concentrations have been described before iv iron treatment had been given 8. To date, 69 different TMPRSS6 defects have been identified in 65 IRIDA families with 94 patients of different ethnic origin 4, 5, 9, 10.

At the population level, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) show that TMPRSS6 is polymorphic with a relatively large amount of polymorphisms of which the nonsynonymous c.2207C > T (p. Ala736Val) is associated with a significant decrease of the concentrations of iron, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH), and red blood cells 11, 12. These findings are corroborated by functional studies, which show that the 736Ala variant inhibits hepcidin production more efficiently 13.

The increasing number of IRIDA cases that are being reported, generate more knowledge on the disease, but many questions remain concerning the mode of inheritance, the genotype–phenotype correlation, the diagnostic workup, and the optimal treatment.

### Molecular basis of inherited microcytic anemia due to defects in iron acquisition or heme synthesis [^1165NARa]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

Microcytic anemia is the most commonly encountered anemia in general medical practice. Nutritional iron deficiency and beta thalassemia trait are the primary causes in pediatrics, whereas bleeding disorders and anemia of chronic disease are common in adulthood. Microcytic hypochromic anemia can result from a defect in globin genes, in heme synthesis, in iron availability or in iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These microcytic anemia can be sideroblastic or not, a trait which reflects the implications of different gene abnormalities. Iron is a trace element that may act as a redox component and therefore is integral to vital biological processes that require the transfer of electrons as in oxygen transport, oxidative phosphorylation, DNA biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism. However, it can also be pro-oxidant and to avoid its toxicity, iron metabolism is strictly controlled and failure of these control systems could induce iron overload or iron deficient anemia. During the past few years, several new discoveries mostly arising from human patients or mouse models have highlighted the implication of iron metabolism components in hereditary microcytic anemia, from intestinal absorption to its final inclusion into heme. In this paper we will review the new information available on the iron acquisition pathway by developing erythrocytes and its regulation, and we will consider only inherited microcytosis due to heme synthesis or to iron metabolism defects. This information could be useful in the diagnosis and classification of these microcytic anemias.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^112Gr85t]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative management — risk assessment for anemia in cardiac surgery states: Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits (Class IIa, Level B-R). Anemia burden is substantial, with the prevalence of anemia in the 30% to 40% range and severe anemia by World Health Organization classification of hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in the 8% to 10% range. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia in the cardiac surgical population, occurring in up to 50% of anemic patients; iron‑deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, whereas normocytic or macrocytic anemia stem from a variety of causes. Routine iron studies are of importance in the determination of the type of anemia present and should be done routinely in the careful preoperative assessment of patients so that treatment can be instituted if warranted, and differentiation must be made between anemias caused by iron deficiency as opposed to other causes of anemia.

### Anemia and poor iron indices are associated with susceptibility to febrile seizures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kZpRY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure in children under the age of 5, and a number of risk factors for this condition have been identified. Several studies have examined the connection between iron deficiency anemia and febrile seizures in children, with inconsistent results. As a result, the authors sought to determine the precise link between iron deficiency anemia and its indices (mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin) in conjunction to febrile seizures. Methods: A systematic literature search from several databases (PubMed, Europe PMC, ScienceDirect) was conducted from database inception until November 30, 2022. Studies were eligible if they investigated the relationship of the iron deficiency anemia and the aforementioned indices with the likelihood of febrile seizures. Results: This meta-analysis comprised 20 case-control studies with a total of 3856 participants. Our study revealed that iron deficiency anemia, low mean corpuscular volume, low serum iron, high total iron-binding capacity, and low ferritin were associated with the incremental risk of developing febrile seizures, with the odds ratios ranging from 1.24 to 1.59. Moreover, diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis indicated that low serum ferritin level had the highest overall area under the curve value amid other iron deficiency anemia indices regarding our outcomes of interest. Conclusion: This study suggest that iron deficiency anemia and poor iron indices are associated with increased risk of febrile seizures in children.

### Severe hypochromic microcytic anemia in a patient with congenital atransferrinemia [^114UkZXF]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by a deficiency of transferrin, resulting in hypochromic, microcytic anemia and hemosiderosis. The authors describe a 10-year-old Iranian girl with hypochromic microcytic anemia. The age presentation of anemia was 3 months. Further evaluations indicate severe hypochromic microcytic anemia with decreased serum levels of iron, TIBC, and increased serum level of ferritin in this patient. The serum level of transferrin was decreased. The diagnosis of atransferrinemia was confirmed. Although atransferrinemia is a rare condition, it should be considered in the cases with hypochromic microcytic anemia, decreased serum levels of iron, TIBC, and increased serum level of ferritin.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^1137r8mL]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Therefore, in chronic diseases, absolute ID is typically diagnosed with higher cut-off ferritin values (i.e. < 100 μg/L) and distinguished from functional ID, diagnosed with normal serum ferritin (100–300 μg/L) and low Tsat (< 20%). Such a definition of ID has been applied in HF syndrome, including clinical trials.

Iron plays a critical role in erythropoiesis, being incorporated into erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Restricted delivery to the erythron can be detected in peripheral blood using indices of so-called iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Reticulocytes are the earliest erythrocytes released into circulating blood and are present for only 1–2 days. Reduced reticulocyte haemoglobin content (< 28 pg) is an early indicator of iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Reticulocyte haemoglobin content is also an early indicator of the response to iron therapy, increasing within 2–4 days after i.v. iron therapy. Later indicators of iron-restricted erythropoiesis are: increased percentage (> 2.5%) of hypochromic erythrocytes [red blood cells (RBCs)] and an increased RBC zinc protoporphyrin, a product of abnormal haem synthesis. Among the last parameters to change with iron-deficient erythropoiesis are the basic haematological indices: haemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration with the picture of microcytic hypochromic anaemia.

### Importance of ferritin for optimizing anemia therapy in chronic kidney disease [^113SAR2s]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of serum ferritin in monitoring the iron status of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) has become suspected. In this review, we reassess the interpretation of high serum ferritin values in such patients, with the goal of treating their anemia in a safe way. From the observations that (1) H-ferritin gene transcription is predominantly active in inflammatory conditions, whereas L-ferritin is induced only after exposure to very high iron concentrations and is preferentially secreted to plasma from hepatocytes; (2) the expression of both types of ferritin proteins are exclusively dependent on intracellular free iron, which is often sequestered by LPS or cytokines in several cell types, and (3) splenic iron is depleted and serum ferritin does not increase in the combined conditions of both inflammation and iron deficiency, it is deduced that elevated serum ferritin levels are caused by the accumulation of intracellular iron, especially reticuloendothelial cells or macrophages, hepatocytes, and other cells, while cytokines or inflammation might modulate the relative ratio of ferritin to body iron storage. Therefore, high levels of serum ferritin in patients on MHD can be used to indicate iron deposition in most cells, including vascular and immunocompetent cells, and is still a reliable indicator of the need to withhold iron administration.

### Renal clearable nanochelators for iron overload therapy [^1162hZQg]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to ineffective erythropoiesis, the homozygous Belgrade rats (b/b) display hypochromic, microcytic anemia with high serum iron and hepatic iron loading. The unique feature of iron loading anemia resembles several types of transfusional iron overload, such as thalassemia. We found that SC injections of DFO 4 -NP increased urinary iron contents by 1800% (p < 0.05; Fig. 3h), whereas the levels of iron in the liver and spleen were decreased by 44% (p < 0.05; Fig. 3i left) and by 32% (p < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 16c, left), respectively, compared to untreated b/b rats. Furthermore, DFO 4 -NP treatment decreased the levels of ferritin in the liver and spleen by 26% (p < 0.001; Fig. 3i, right) and 12% (p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 16c, right), respectively, compared to saline-treated controls. Blank NPs did not show any changes. Therefore, our results indicate that DFO-NPs alleviate iron overload conditions resulting from secondary (or non-dietary) iron overload. In addition, since excess iron increases oxidative stress, we further evaluated the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation and a biomarker of oxidative stress, in b/b rats. Serum MDA levels were decreased in b/b rats by 27% (p < 0.05) after DFO 4 -NP treatment compared to saline-treated controls, blank NP, or even equimolar native DFO, suggesting that DFO-NPs would effectively protect the body from iron-induced oxidative damage.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^112HYMu9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has gained from the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme syntheses. Numerous case reports illustrate that the implementation of these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has increased our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. Integration of these insights into daily clinical practice will reduce delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments. To assist the clinician, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages, and therefore these guidelines are relevant for pediatricians as well as clinicians who treat adults. This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, and recommendations and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate using these guidelines in the clinical setting.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children… [^112k4h31]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Microcytic Anemia DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The U. S. prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children one to five years of age is estimated to be 1% to 2%. 10 A child with microcytic anemia and a history of poor dietary iron intake should receive a trial of iron supplementation and dietary counseling. Iron deficiency anemia is likely if the hemoglobin level increases by more than 1. 0 g per dL after one month of presumptive treatment. Although iron deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, some patients may have normocytic red blood cells. 11 Further testing may also be necessary if suspected iron deficiency anemia does not respond to treatment. Ferritin measurement is the most sensitive test for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. 2, 10 Ferritin is a good reflection of total iron storage and is also the first laboratory index to decline with iron deficiency.

3 It may be less accurate in children with infectious or inflammatory conditions because ferritin is also an acute phase reactant. 3, 34 Infants and children with β-thalassemia trait or β-thalassemia minor may have increased hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F on electrophoresis, with asymptomatic, mild anemia. Those with β-thalassemia intermedia or major usually have moderate to severe anemia complications, including hypersplenism, endocrinopathies, cardiac complications, and hypercoagulopathy due to iron overload from repeated transfusions.
34. Figure 2) starts with a history, reticulocyte count, and peripheral blood smear. 5 A high reticulocyte count indicates increased red blood cell turnover. A high reticulocyte count along with laboratory markers of hemolysis may help confirm hemolytic anemia.

Macrocytic Anemia The evaluation of macrocytic anemia in children begins with examination of a peripheral blood smear for hypersegmented neutrophils, which indicate megaloblastic anemia. 5 If megaloblastic anemia is shown, folate and vitamin B 12 measurements are indicated. Low vitamin B 12 levels may be nutrition/absorption related or congenital and have neurologic consequences, ranging from growth retardation to seizure disorders.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

Table 1
WHO classification of anaemia according to age and severity.

Table 2
Classification of anaemia.

Hypo‐regenerative anaemia can occur in aplastic anaemia, renal cell aplasia, renal failure or endocrine disorders. A disturbance in the maturation and proliferation of red blood cells (RBCs) may be caused by defective DNA synthesis, as in anaemia due to vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency. In IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, there is impaired Hb synthesis. ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection, inflammation or malignancy. To understand the pathomechanism of anaemia, assessment of hepcidin levels may be very helpful. Hepcidin is an iron‐regulatory hormone that inhibits iron release from cells of the reticuloendothelial system and intestinal absorption leading to hypoferraemia. An increase in hepcidin and other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, reduces the availability of iron for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. It is usually a mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia and with low circulating iron and low transferrin saturation, but with a normal to elevated iron storage protein ferritin.

To evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding, we usually refer for colonoscopy and/or EGD. We frequently recommend FOBT, recognizing that FOBT alone is insufficient for excluding gastrointestinal bleeding, with a sensitivity of 58% at detecting the source of IDA.FOBT is more appropriate for colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic people without anemia. We refer for endoscopic evaluation irrespective of FOBT when IDA is suspected unless another etiology for IDA is established. In frail older adults, the decision to perform an endoscopy is often case-by-case with consideration for the person's life expectancy. It should be a shared decision with the patient and caregiver; a positive FOBT suggests a higher yield from endoscopy.

Patients with IDA may present with microcytic or normocytic hypochromic RBCs. Nearly 70% of older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) with IDA present with normal MCV. Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a CBC, reticulocyte count, serum iron level, TIBC (represents the ability to bind iron to transferrin), TSAT (ratio of serum iron to TIBC), and ferritin (reflects iron stores). Individuals with iron deficiency typically have low serum iron, low TSAT, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Timing and fasted state should be considered when iron studies are collected. A TSAT of < 20% suggests that the iron supply is not adequate for RBC production and a very low TSAT of < 15% is consistent with iron deficiency. Compared with lower ferritin cutoffs, a ferritin level of < 50 ng/mL is suspicious for iron deficiency in older adults because this is a more reliable predicter of iron deficiency in older populations. Intermediate ferritin levels (the range from 30 to 100 ng/mL) pose difficulties, particularly in older adults with chronic diseases. Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency even at ferritin levels of up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is < 20%.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

Critical illness alters iron metabolism, and its specific requirements during ICU stay are not well defined.

Ferroptosis

Acute disease can disrupt the redox systems, causing intracellular iron overload and lipid peroxide accumulation in ferroptosis, an iron‐dependent, nonapoptotic cell death. Ferroptosis has been linked to sepsis, viral infections, and ALI, and may contribute to multiorgan dysfunction in practically every ICU patient.

Anemia

Anemia may affect up to 90% of ICU patients, requiring blood transfusion in 15%–35%. The two leading causes of iron‐related anemia are
Iron deficiency anemia: absolute iron deficiency owing to poor intake/adsorption or increased loss owing to phlebotomiesand hemorrhages, affecting 20%–40% of ICU patients.
Anemia of inflammation: Inflammation causes iron storage in the macrophages to reduce redox stress and hide iron from infectious pathogens, leading to iron‐deficient erythropoiesis independently from erythropoietin levels.

The most used biomarkers to determine iron status are iron plasma levels, ferritin, and transferrin, which enable the calculation of transferrin saturation. These are highly affected by inflammation and poorly differentiate between anemia because of inflammation or iron deficiency in acute phases of disease. The newer biomarkers hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) are expensive but increasingly available; they are less affected by inflammation, making these biomarkers promising in critically ill patients. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed by microcytic hypochromic anemia, increased sTfR, and reduced ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation is diagnosed by normocytic normochromic anemia, normal sTfR, and increased ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation in patients with non–iron deficiency anemia develops within 8 days of ICU admission.

Low plasma iron levels and iron deficiency are associated with worsening of chronic cardiac dysfunction. Decreased hepcidin levels are associated with ICU mortality. At ICU discharge, hemoglobin (Hb) < 100 g/L affects up to 53.3% of patients and persists in 46% at hospital discharge and up to 12 months later. Post‐ICU anemia correlates with increased ICU readmission rates, prolonged hospital length of stay, increased mortality, and lower quality of life,(see Table S20).

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^116jf1dw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, 51.4% of the patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 30.9% had macrocytic anemia, 16.0% had microcytic anemia and 1.7% had dimorphic anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia, based on MCV and low serum ferritin levels, was seen only in 1 of 29 patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS. However, the interpretation of routine lab parameters such as serum ferritin is extremely difficult in liver cirrhosis, and bone-marrow staining for iron with Prussian blue is required for the confirmation of the diagnosis.

A total of 58 patients had macrocytosis (MCV > 98 fL); of these, 56 had macrocytic anemia on PBS and 2 had dimorphic anemia. The remaining 51.4% of patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, the most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. We also found a significant correlation between MELD score and macrocytosis.

In our study there was a significant correlation between the MELD score and Hb levels. Lower Hb levels were associated with a higher MELD score. Similar findings were seen in a study conducted by Scheiner et al, where anemic patients showed a higher MELD (12 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 3; P < 0.001). In a study conducted by Jain et al, 88 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis were divided into 5 groups according to their MELD scores. It was found that hematological abnormalities, such as anemia and leucopenia, were more common in the higher MELD score group. Studies have shown that anemia is a poor prognostic factor in patients with liver cirrhosis, and the severity of anemia increases with the stage of liver disease.

We also found a statistically significant correlation between CTP class and Hb. Patients with Child C classification had lower Hb levels compared to those with Child A or B.

### Inflammation-induced hepcidin-25 is associated with the development of anemia in septic patients: an observational study [^116CXgf1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

There are two known ways that hepcidin can result in inflammation-associated anemia. First, hepcidin can abrograte erythroid colony formation in situations where erythropoietin concentrations are reduced, as is the case during sepsis. Furthermore, inflammation leads to sequestration of iron in cells resulting in a blocked transport of iron to the bone marrow. Considering the fact that the lifespan of erythrocytes of approximately 120 days might be shortened due to inflammation and the fact that hepcidin suppresses erythropoiesis itself, we hypothesized that if hepcidin is upregulated by inflammation and thereby suppresses serum iron levels, a measurable effect on Hb level was expected from seven days onwards after the diagnosis of sepsis. Furthermore, we anticipated a swift decrease in inflammation in treated septic patients. For these reasons we determined IL-6 and hepcidin levels for three days and the rate of Hb decrease within 7 to 14 days.

We were not able to demonstrate a relation of Hb decrease with a change in MCV, MCH, or RDW. This does not invalidate the hypothesis that increased hepcidin attributes to the development of anemia in these patients. It was previously shown that erythrocyte progenitor cells carry iron transporter ferroportin1B on their cell membrane. During inflammation systemically elevated hepcidin down-regulates ferroportin on these cells, thereby preventing a loss of intracellular iron and the microcytic anemia that is seen in iron-deficiency anemia. Therefore, inflammation-associated anemia is not typically microcytic. Moreover, the observed effect of hepcidin on the development on anemia may have been mediated by a direct inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis, rather than by blocking iron transport to the bone marrow by sequestration.

Interestingly, hepcidin at day one did not predict the rate of Hb decrease. Probably persistently elevated hepcidin levels are necessary to exert a relevant effect on Hb concentrations. The association we found may be an underestimation, because the patients in this study were already anemic at the time of presentation to the emergency ward and likewise it is possible that before presentation hepcidin levels were even more pronounced. Nevertheless, although statistically significant, the observed association between hepcidin and Hb levels is modest, indicating that other previously mentioned factors that influence Hb are likely to play a role.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^117UMLkX]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency

Iron deficiency, both isolated and associated with anemia, represents one of the five major causes of disability burden worldwide, especially in women. For discussions of the etiology, clinical presentation and treatment of iron deficiency with or without anemia readers are directed to specific reviews. – In absolute iron deficiency low total body and serum iron fully suppress hepcidin, a mechanism of adaptation to increase iron absorption. In functional iron deficiency (e.g. in inflammation) total body iron is not decreased, but iron is sequestered in stores by the high hepcidin levels. This distinction strongly influences the route of iron administration required to treat iron deficiency, as discussed below.

Anemia of inflammation

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β, produced in chronic infections, autoimmunity, cancer, renal failure and other chronic disorders activate hepcidin expression leading to iron-restricted erythropoiesis and anemia of inflammation, once named anemia of chronic diseases. By withholding iron in macrophages, extracellular Gram-negative microorganisms are deprived of this essential nutrient. This is an innate defense mechanism known as 'nutritional immunity'. A recent interpretation is that hypoferremia prevents the generation of NTBI that potentiates the pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria. Anemia, usually moderate and normocytic, is multifactorial, because of concomitant insufficient erythropoietin production and impaired early erythroid commitment. Microcytosis occurs in longstanding severe inflammation such as in Castleman disease, a lymphoproliferative disorder in which high IL-6 production strongly enhances hepcidin synthesisor in patients with ectopic hepcidin expression by liver adenomas. Anemia reverts after anti-IL6 receptor treatment in Castleman disease or after surgical removal of the tumor in the case of adenoma.

Anemia of inflammation regresses with control of the disease. In selected cases intravenous iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are used. Since treatment is often unsatisfactory, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway (blocking either its production or function) is proposed as a novel therapeutic opportunity.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > 50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > 50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > 50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

### Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia: a heterogeneous disease that is not always iron refractory [^111B56o9]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

TMPRSS6 variants that affect protein function result in impaired matriptase-2 function and consequently uninhibited hepcidin production, leading to iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). This disease is characterized by microcytic, hypochromic anemia and serum hepcidin values that are inappropriately high for body iron levels. Much is still unknown about its pathophysiology, genotype-phenotype correlation, and optimal clinical management. We describe 14 different TMPRSS6 variants, of which 9 are novel, in 21 phenotypically affected IRIDA patients from 20 families living in the Netherlands; 16 out of 21 patients were female. In 7 out of 21 cases DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification demonstrated only heterozygous TMPRSS6 variants. The age at presentation, disease severity, and response to iron supplementation were highly variable, even for patients and relatives with similar TMPRSS6 genotypes. Mono-allelic IRIDA patients had a milder phenotype with respect to hemoglobin and MCV and presented significantly later in life with anemia than bi-allelic patients. Transferrin saturation (TSAT)/hepcidin ratios were lower in IRIDA probands than in healthy relatives. Most patients required parenteral iron. Genotype alone was not predictive for the response to oral iron. We conclude that IRIDA is a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous disease. The high proportion of female patients and the discrepancy between phenotypes of probands and relatives with the same genotype, suggest a complex interplay between genetic and acquired factors in the pathogenesis of IRIDA. In the absence of inflammation, the TSAT/hepcidin ratio is a promising diagnostic tool, even after iron supplementation has been given. Am. J.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Two new human DMT1 gene mutations in a patient with microcytic anemia, low ferritinemia, and liver iron overload [^116Q6UJD]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

DMT1 mediates the pH-dependent uptake of Fe(2+) from the diet in duodenal enterocytes and in most other cells. It transfers iron from the endosomes to the cytosol following the uptake of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex. DMT1 mutations are responsible for severe hypochromic microcytic anemia in rodents and in 2 human patients described recently. We report a compound heterozygote for 2 new DMT1 mutations, associated with microcytic anemia from birth and progressive liver iron overload. The first mutation is a GTG deletion in exon 5, leading to the V114 in-frame deletion in transmembrane domain 2, and the second is a G → T substitution in exon 8 leading to the G212V replacement in transmembrane domain 5. Together with the 2 previously reported cases, this patient defines a new syndrome of congenital microcytic hypochromic anemia, poorly responsive to oral iron treatment, with liver iron overload associated paradoxically with normal to moderately elevated serum ferritin levels.

Results

Patient characteristics

Among the 181 patients enrolled 168 were males and 13 were females. The mean age was 49.7 years. Alcohol was the most common etiology (166 patients), followed by cryptogenic (12 patients), Budd–Chiari syndrome (2 patients) and hepatitis B (1 patient).

Distribution of anemia types

The mean Hb levels in males and females were 10.51 g/dL and 10.48 g/dL, respectively. Macrocytosis (MCV > 98 fL) was seen in 58 (32%) patients. On anemia typing, a total of 93 (51.4%) patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 56 (30.9%) had macrocytic anemia, 29 (16.0%) had microcytic anemia and 3 (1.7%) had dimorphic anemia (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic profile

Of the patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS, only 1 had iron-deficiency anemia (serum ferritin < 16 µg/L in males and < 10 µg/L in females). Of the patients who had macrocytic anemia on PBS, 29 had low serum B12 levels (< 220 ng/mL).

Macrocytosis and MELD score

Of the 58 patients with macrocytosis, 45 (77.6%) had a MELD score of > 12, whereas only 13 (22.4%) had a MELD score of < 12. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^115c5dhW]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia

This form of iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) was recognized after the discovery of hepcidin as being due to mutations of its inhibitor TMPRSS6. High hepcidin levels lead to a phenotype opposite to that of hemochromatosis, reminiscent of anemia of inflammation. The anemia is refractory to oral iron and may require intravenous therapy, especially when iron demand is high. TMPRSS6 genetic variants modulate iron and hematologic traits in several genome-wide association studies, alter hepcidin levels in normal subjectsand might confer susceptibility/resistance to iron deficiency, as observed in blood donors.

Other rare recessive disorders of the transferrin receptor pathway – such as hypotransferrinemia and DMT1 mutations – lead to "atypical microcytic anemia" with increased transferrin saturation and iron stores, because of decreased iron utilization by blunted erythropoiesis.

Congenital sideroblastic anemia

Ringed sideroblasts are erythroblasts with iron-loaded mitochondria that, clustering around the nucleus, confer the appearance of a ring at Perls iron staining. Hereditary sideroblastic anemias are usually due to heme deficiency: X-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by mutations in ALAS2, the first, rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis, while recessive forms are associated with mutations of mitochondria glycine importer solute carrier family 25 member 38. Rare severe cases result from mutations of Fe/S cluster proteins, such as GLRX5or HSPA9, which decrease Fe/S groups and the activity of ferrochelatase, the last enzyme of the heme pathway. Another cause of low heme in GLRX5 deficiency is the overactive IRP1 that, not being converted to aconitase because of the Fe/S cluster deficit, blocks ALAS2 translation, thereby preventing heme formation. These disorders reveal the tight connection of heme-Fe/S metabolism. Among syndromic forms, the X-linked ABCB7 deficiency reduces export of Fe/S clusters to the cytosol, while others are associated with immunodeficiencystrengthening the need of Fe/S clusters in other cell types (Table 1). Those due to mitochondrial protein mutationsare not discussed here.

Acquired iron disorders

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^115v52ao]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron-loading anemias

Low hepcidin levels explain the iron overload that develops in the absence of blood transfusions in "iron-loading anemias", i.e. anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis (Table 1). ERFE, released by erythropoietin-stimulated erythroblasts, inhibits hepcidin, despite iron overload. In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia patients, serum ERFE levels are high, to ensure iron acquisition for the expanded erythropoiesis. However, since the erythropoiesis is inefficient, excess iron interferes with erythroblast maturation aggravating anemia in a vicious cycle. In patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, hepcidin increases following transfusions which partially suppress erythropoiesis.

ERFE contributes to the iron loading of some clonal myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients with the ringed sideroblasts subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (once called refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts) carry a somatic mutation in the spliceosome gene SF3B1. Among other abnormally spliced products, an elongated variant of ERFE is more efficient than the wildtype hormone in hepcidin repression.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

### Novel potential therapeutics to modify iron metabolism and red cell synthesis in diseases associated with defective erythropoiesis [^111RdT4S]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemias associated with impaired iron absorption

Other forms of anemia can help us to further understand the relationship between ineffective erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. In this part of the review, we will discuss informative forms of anemia and speculate on novel potential drugs to treat them.

Anemia of inflammation (AI) and IRIDA are two of the clinical manifestations associated with inappropriately high hepcidin levels. AI is common in inflammatory diseases with complex pathophysiological features, such as chronic kidney disease, autoimmune diseases, and some forms of cancer and myelofibrosis. Here, we review conditions in which inflammatory cytokines together with hepcidin contribute to iron-restricted erythropoiesis.

The primary clinical goal for patients with AI is to treat the cause of inflammation; however, treatment for anemia is often managed by administration of intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which is ineffective for some patients and is associated with adverse effects.

Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by splenomegaly, debilitating constitutional symptoms, and bone marrow failure. Disease-related anemia is common and associated with increased expression of hepcidin.86,87

IRIDA develops when mutations in TMPRSS6 lead to high hepcidin levels. Patients with IRIDA have microcytic anemia and low plasma-iron levels and are refractory to oral iron therapy but are partially responsive to parenteral iron administration.

In all these conditions, high levels of hepcidin not only limit iron absorption but also sequester the iron provided to the patients by oral or intravenous administration to parenchymal cells and macrophages. Therefore, drugs that target proteins that interfere with the iron-sensor complex and decrease hepcidin levels or that can redistribute iron to TF may make iron more available for erythropoiesis. In addition, drugs that increase EPO sensitivity could also improve red cell production.
