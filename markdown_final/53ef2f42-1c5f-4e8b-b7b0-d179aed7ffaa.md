## Question

what is the clinical presentation of peritonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how peritonitis presents clinically across different causes, including secondary, spontaneous bacterial, peritoneal dialysis–associated, and primary peritonitis, with attention to subtle or atypical features and a coherent diagnostic framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical construct of peritonitis and how it is classified. Then, I should verify the cardinal local and systemic features and how they vary by cause. Next, I will examine atypical presentations, especially in vulnerable populations. After that, I need to consider key mimics and how they can confound the picture. Finally, I will synthesize a practical bedside diagnostic approach, including thresholds for emergent intervention versus imaging, and highlight what must not be missed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneal lining and may be localized or diffuse; when diffuse with rigidity and systemic inflammatory response, it signals an intra-abdominal catastrophe that usually mandates urgent source control, whereas localized findings may allow diagnostic confirmation prior to definitive therapy [^111gaoWN].

> I will now examine the core local features. The classic peritoneal irritation signs include diffuse abdominal pain, tenderness, guarding, rebound, and board-like rigidity, which are highly concerning for generalized peritonitis and correlate with mortality in resource-limited settings; rigidity and generalized signs portend worse outcomes, so I should not underplay them when present [^113HzAKF] [^114QGVop] [^1121PjRK].

> Wait, let me verify the systemic features. Fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are common, and the progression to hypotension, oliguria, lactic acidosis, and altered mental status indicates severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. Importantly, mortality rises as shock physiology emerges, reinforcing the need for rapid resuscitation and source control when peritonitis is suspected [^1121PjRK] [^113r368L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — features vary by etiology. In secondary peritonitis from hollow viscus perforation or ischemia, the pain is typically acute, severe, and often generalized, frequently with rigidity and free air on imaging. In contrast, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhosis can be subtle, with up to a third presenting with minimal or no abdominal pain and instead manifesting encephalopathy or acute kidney injury, so I should double-check ascitic fluid in any cirrhotic patient with decompensation or fever even without clear peritoneal signs [^116yWDRs] [^111Kw6Pt] [^115GAXoL].

> I need to ensure I account for special contexts. In peritoneal dialysis–associated peritonitis, cloudy effluent is a key sentinel sign and may be the only initial clue, particularly with gram-positive organisms. Pain and fever can be delayed or mild, so any cloudy bag warrants urgent effluent cell count and cultures before antibiotics are started, and some centers use effluent white cell criteria with more than 50% PMNs after a dwell of at least 2 hours to diagnose PD peritonitis [^111tZ6tV].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly or immunocompromised. Let me consider that in these populations, the typical triad of pain, fever, and leukocytosis is often absent. Appendicitis in older adults frequently lacks classic features and can present with ileus or obstruction, and perforation may present late with diffuse peritonitis and hemodynamic instability, so I should maintain a low threshold for imaging and surgical consultation even when the exam is deceptively benign [^111ofRkD] [^115GAXoL].

> Next, I should review primary peritonitis outside cirrhosis. In children, streptococcal peritonitis can present with fever, diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered mental status, and diagnosis rests on ascitic fluid analysis. I should confirm that a PMN count above 250/mm³ establishes SBP even in the absence of a surgical source, and I must not miss this because delayed paracentesis increases mortality [^111ywuzz] [^11179ard] [^113gABep].

> Let me think about the bedside diagnostic framework. In unstable patients with generalized peritonitis or shock physiology, emergent laparotomy for source control should not be delayed for imaging; conversely, in stable patients with localized findings, contrast-enhanced CT is the imaging modality of choice to identify the source and plan percutaneous drainage or surgery as indicated [^113vj6tU].

> I should double-check the ascitic fluid thresholds that change management. In any cirrhotic patient with ascites and concern for infection, I need to perform diagnostic paracentesis promptly; an ascitic PMN count above 250/mm³ establishes SBP and mandates immediate empiric antibiotics, ideally with a third-generation cephalosporin in community-acquired cases, while also sending cultures inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside to maximize yield [^112rQo9V] [^112z52Rh] [^116i32Wu].

> Hmm, wait a minute — about pneumoperitoneum. Free air on upright chest radiograph or CT strongly suggests perforation and supports a surgical source of peritonitis, but I should remember exceptions such as post-polypectomy syndrome or postoperative states where conservative management may be appropriate if the patient is stable and the clinical picture is localized. I need to correlate imaging with exam and trajectory rather than acting on a single sign in isolation [^113vj6tU] [^115Efk5L].

> Let me reconsider what not to miss. Peritoneal signs in the setting of acute mesenteric ischemia usually signal irreversible necrosis and mandate emergent operative exploration. Similarly, delayed recognition of perforated appendicitis or diverticulitis, and failure to act on cloudy PD effluent, can convert a localized process into diffuse peritonitis with high mortality, so time-sensitive source control and appropriate empiric therapy are critical [^116XRpkA] [^112ARMhy] [^111tZ6tV].

> I should confirm a practical synthesis. Peritonitis presents with a spectrum from localized tenderness to diffuse rigidity, often with systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction; SBP in cirrhosis can be occult and requires routine paracentesis on admission, PD peritonitis may present solely with cloudy effluent, and elderly or immunocompromised patients may lack classic features, so a high index of suspicion, judicious imaging, and readiness for urgent source control are the cornerstones of safe practice [^113WhU4o] [^116yWDRs] [^111tZ6tV] [^111ofRkD].

Peritonitis typically presents with **sudden, severe abdominal pain** [^115GAXoL] that becomes diffuse, accompanied by **rebound tenderness, guarding, and rigidity** [^113r368L] [^1121PjRK]. Patients often have **nausea, vomiting, and ileus** with absent bowel sounds [^111mwCE8], and systemic features such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension [^113vj6tU]. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhosis may be subtle [^113zjcZu], with minimal pain, altered mental status, or acute kidney injury [^116yWDRs]; peritoneal dialysis–associated peritonitis often presents with cloudy dialysate [^111tZ6tV] and mild abdominal pain [^111tZ6tV]. Prompt recognition and **early intervention** are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113r368L] [^112BHugS].

## General clinical presentation

- **Abdominal pain**: Sudden, severe, and diffuse [^114QGVop]; initially localized if inflammation is limited [^111gaoWN].

- **Rebound tenderness, guarding, and rigidity**: Classic signs of peritoneal irritation [^114QGVop].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common, often with ileus and absent bowel sounds [^111mwCE8].

- **Systemic signs**: Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension indicating systemic inflammatory response or sepsis [^113vj6tU].

---

## Specific clinical presentations by etiology

| **Etiology** | **Clinical presentation** |
|-|-|
| Secondary peritonitis (e.g. perforated viscus, appendicitis, diverticulitis) | - Severe, generalized abdominal pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Guarding <br/> - Rigidity <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Ileus <br/> - Fever <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypotension [^113vj6tU] [^115GAXoL] |
| Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhosis | - Often subtle <br/> - Minimal or no abdominal pain <br/> - Altered mental status <br/> - Acute kidney injury <br/> - Fever <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypotension [^113zjcZu] [^116yWDRs] |
| Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis | - Cloudy dialysate <br/> - Mild abdominal pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Localized tenderness [^111tZ6tV] [^1167zZRb] |
| Primary peritonitis (e.g. tuberculous peritonitis) | - Insidious onset <br/> - Chronic abdominal pain <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Low-grade fever <br/> - Ascites <br/> - Night sweats [^115ycoMK] |

---

## Variations in presentation

Presentation varies with age, comorbidities, and immune status. Elderly or immunocompromised patients may have **atypical or muted signs** [^111ofRkD], including minimal pain, delayed fever, or subtle peritoneal findings [^116XRpkA]. In children, symptoms may be nonspecific — irritability, vomiting, or abdominal distension — and peritoneal signs can be less reliable [^115GAXoL].

---

## Laboratory and imaging findings

- **Laboratory tests**: Leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and lactate are common; SBP is diagnosed with ascitic PMN count > 250/mm³ [^112rQo9V] [^115o9h96].

- **Imaging**: Plain radiographs may show free air with perforation; ultrasound or CT can identify free fluid, abscesses, or the underlying cause [^113vj6tU] [^1121PjRK].

---

## Conclusion

Peritonitis presents with **severe abdominal pain**, peritoneal signs, and systemic inflammatory response, with variations by etiology and patient factors. Early recognition and intervention are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113r368L] [^112BHugS].

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)/spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) evaluation — patients with ascites due to cirrhosis emergently admitted to the hospital should undergo a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis to rule out SBP even in the absence of symptoms/signs of infection, and patients with ascites who develop signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of infection should undergo workup for infection plus a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis (for cell count and bacteriological culture); if the workup is negative and the patient has a pleural effusion, the patient should undergo a diagnostic thoracentesis; the ascitic fluid should be cultured at the bedside in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before initiation of antibiotics, and bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of the ascitic sample into blood culture bottles increases the sensitivity of the culture to > 90% in the diagnosis of SBP; the diagnosis of SBP/SBE is established with a fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count > 250/mm³.

Results

The results are hereby presented separately as O (obstruction) and P (perforation) when required; otherwise, the statements can be considered valid for both conditions.

Diagnosis

Statement 1.1: The clinical presentation is variable, except for lower rectal cancer, in which case digital examination could be diagnostic. Laboratory tests are not specific. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests have high variability and low specificity; therefore, the escalation to further diagnostic tools, whenever available, is mandatory. LoE 3, GoR B.

Obstruction

Large bowel obstruction can present acutely, with colic-like abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and absence of bowel movement and flatus, while vomiting is less frequent than in small bowel obstruction, or subacutely, with gradual development of symptoms, changes in bowel habits and recurrent left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In a series of 150 consecutive patients suffering from acute mechanical bowel obstruction, 24% presented with large bowel obstruction. Absence of passage of flatus (90%) and/or faeces (80.6%) and abdominal distension (65.3%) were the most common symptoms and physical signs.

Abdominal examination shows tenderness, abdominal distension and hyperactive or absent bowel sounds.

Previous complaint of bloody stools and passage of blood per rectum, despite the absence of bowel movement, can be associated with colon cancer. A rectal cancer may be palpable as an intrinsic lesion.

Laboratory tests are directed at evaluating the electrolyte imbalances, elevated urea nitrogen and metabolic alkalosis that may occur as a consequence of vomiting and dehydration.

Perforation

When perforation occurs at the tumour site, peritoneal contamination is usually localised; at the opposite, when perforation is located proximal to the tumour site, the faecal spread results in diffuse peritonitis and septic shock.

In this setting, physical examination reveals an acutely ill patient characterised by fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and confusion.

The abdomen may be diffusely tender or may present localised tenderness, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are usually absent. The toxic symptoms of peritonitis are usually delayed, but are considered an ominous sign. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia, elevated amylase levels and lactic acidosis suggest perforation or necrosis. The suspicion of large bowel obstruction or perforation is based on aspecific symptoms, signs and laboratory findings: adjunctive diagnostic tests are mandatory, whenever available (Fig. 1).

Diagnosis

Reducing time to diagnosis of severe sepsis is thought to be a critical component in reducing mortality from sepsis-related multiple organ dysfunction. Delineating the source of infection as accurately as possible prior to surgery is the primary aim and the first step in managing intra-abdominal infections. In severe abdominal sepsis however, delays in operative management may lead to worse outcomes and early exploration is always recommended when peritonitis is suspected even if the source of infection is not recognized pre-operatively with certainty.

The diagnosis of intra-abdominal sepsis is based primarily on clinical assessment. Typically, the patient is admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a systemic inflammatory response, including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnoea. Abdominal rigidity suggests the presence of peritonitis. However, clinical assessment alone is not always reliable in critically ill patients due to a variety of clinical constraints (e.g. impaired consciousness, severe underlying disease, etc.). Hypotension, oliguria, and acute altered mental status are waring signs of the patient's transition from sepsis to severe sepsis.

Plain abdominal films are often the first imaging obtained for patients presenting with peritonitis. Upright films are useful for identifying free air under the diaphragm (most often on the right side), which can result from perforated viscera. Free air may be present in most cases of anterior gastric and duodenal perforation. However it is much less frequent with perforations of the small bowel and colon and is unusual with appendiceal perforation. Abdominal plain films have low sensitivity and specificity, and have, in most cases, been replaced by abdominal computed tomography (CT). However, plain films of the abdomen remain a reasonable initial study for patients with suspected peritonitis who, on the basis of history and physical examination, are likely candidates for surgical exploration. In this case, abdominal plain films may confirm evidence of perforation in short time.

Pneumoperitoneum has a wide differential diagnosis and presents with varying degrees of severity; however, not all etiologies require operative intervention. It is imperative that all patients with this diagnosis are evaluated by a surgeon. A thorough history, physical examination, and workup, aimed at localization of the source of pneumoperitoneum will ultimately determine the necessary treatments, including the need for operative intervention. We aim to provide the reader with a working knowledge regarding the evaluation and treatment of patients with pneumoperitoneum.

Core definitions

Peritonitis

Clinicians typically recognize IAS as peritonitis clinically but classify the condition as IAS once managing the patient. Peritonitis is simply any inflammation of the peritoneal lining of the abdominopelvic cavity, with abdominal rigidity is a clinical finding in abdominal palpation. Peritonism is generalized rigidity of the abdomen. While the origins of the peritoneal irritants that result in peritonitis are many, including non-infectious and benign ones, peritonitis may be not infrequently a sign of catastrophe. Peritonitis can be localized or isolated to a certain sector of the abdomen (localized peritonitis) or diffuse with all locations in the abdomen involved (diffuse peritonitis) with the latter being again ominous. With very few exceptions, patients presenting with diffuse peritonitis require immediate surgical exploration, while those with localized clinical signs may be able to undergo further evaluation. Further classic definitions consider primary, secondary, and potentially tertiary etiologies. At all times it should be remembered that while "peritonitis" defines the clinical findings, IAS with progressive organ failure is what kills the patient.

Primary peritonitis is defined as spontaneous bacterial seeding of the peritoneal cavity, which typically requires the presence of a bacterial medium within the peritoneal cavity, such as cirrhotic ascites or peritoneal dialysate. Secondary peritonitis defines irritation of the abdominal peritoneal lining caused by direct contact with a peritoneal contaminant. It occurs most commonly from a physical or functional disruption of gastrointestinal tract integrity and is typically polymicrobial. Tertiary peritonitis is poorly defined, misunderstood, and potentially historical. Upon our review, it was defined most recently in 2005 as ongoing peritonitis: "peritonitis that persists or recurs ≥ 48 h following apparently successful management of primary or secondary peritonitis". Microbiologically, it is associated with a shift from gram negative and enteric bacteria to nosocomial populations. However, it appears that the concepts related to ongoing peritonitis predate the evolving appreciation of the human microbiome and more importantly, the consequences of its devolution to a pathologic dysbiome in critical illness. Finally, a functionally useful set of definitions is the concept of severe and complicated IAS. Severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis (SCIAS) encompasses one of the most challenging situations surgeons may encounter. IAS is defined as severe when associated with organ dysfunction and as complicated when the inflammation or contamination spreads beyond a single organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis.

### Pneumoperitoneum without peritonitis: a case report [^113qD1vW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum (PP), or air within the abdominal cavity, is frequently the harbinger of serious abdominal pathology and frequently represents visceral perforation. Most cases of PP ultimately need surgical exploration and intervention. In addition, cases of nonsurgical PP have also been described in the literature, and it has been suggested that these cases can be managed conservatively. This report documents the occurrence of incidentally found PP. However, it is unclear how often PP is found incidentally, and more importantly how to manage the patient with clinically unsuspected PP without peritoneal signs. Future research could help to better determine the incidence of unsuspected PP and to validate the various diagnostic and treatment algorithms in the literature.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

Analysis of Data

Descriptive statistics were calculated for the following: operative diagnosis; overall and diagnosis-specific mortality rates; age and gender distributions; time (in days) from symptom onset, presentation, and outcome (death versus discharge); presence of rigidity; localized versus generalized peritonitis; presenting vital signs including systolic blood pressure (< 90, ≥ 90), respiratory rate (< 30, ≥ 30), heart rate (< 100, ≥ 100), and temperature (< 35.5, 35.5–38.4, > 38.4); Complete blood count results including total leukocyte count (< 4, 4–11, > 11) hematocrit (< 31.6, 31.6–47.9, > 47.9), and platelet count (< 100, 100–399, ≥ 400); and ultrasound findings if performed (presence or absence of free fluid, abscess, and/or appendicitis).

Correlations between outcome (death during hospitalization versus discharge) and clinical data (age, gender, type of symptoms and symptom duration, examination findings, vital signs, and laboratory values) were calculated using chi-squared analyses. In comparison to operative diagnosis the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in diagnosing appendicitis and free fluid/abscess was reported.

### Peritonitis-the Eastern experience [^114NQ2Wa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a better understanding of pathophysiology, advances in diagnosis, surgery, antimicrobial therapy and intensive care support, peritonitis remains a potentially fatal affliction. On the basis of source and nature of the microbial contamination peritonitis can be classified as primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary peritonitis is infection, often monomicrobial, of the peritoneal fluid without visceral perforation. Secondary peritonitis arises subsequent to loss of integrity of a hollow viscus and is the most common form of peritonitis encountered. Tertiary peritonitis develops following treatment of secondary peritonitis either due to failure of the host inflammatory response or due to superinfection. The contamination of peritoneal cavity thus, can lead to a cascade of infection, sepsis and multisystem organ failure (MSOF) and death if not treated in a timely manner.

This paper aims to present the experience of the East in terms of the spectrum of secondary peritonitis seen, its common causes and outcomes.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^1167zZRb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective renal replacement therapy for the treatment of end-stage renal disease. However, PD-associated peritonitis (PDAP) is a serious complication that is the greatest contributor to infection-related morbidity, including the risk of hospitalization, temporary or permanent transfer to hemodialysis and mortality. Timely and effective treatment of PDAP is essential.

A precise etiological diagnosis and early targeted antibiotic therapy are highly desirable. However, the causative organisms are difficult to determine at the time of initial diagnosis of peritonitis. Consequently, ISPD recommends that gram-positive organisms be covered by a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and that gram-negative organisms be covered by a third-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside. However, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage increases the possibility of secondary infections such as fungal peritonitis episodes and potential problems (including drug interactions and the emergence of resistant strains) with fungal prophylaxis treatment.

According to a previous study, the most common germs causing PDAP were gram-positive, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are the most frequent cause of PDAP in many centers, with an oxacillin resistance rate of 69.6%. Theoretically, vancomycin is a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria. It is effective for the treatment of gram-positive peritonitis, including that caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. In addition to cephazolin, which can only cover some coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains, vancomycin can also cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The use of vancomycin as the first treatment for gram-positive peritonitis was found to be an independent predictor of resolution. However, identifying how to treat PDAP with vancomycin alone is a challenge.

In practice, a substantial percentage of peritonitis patients present with only cloudy effluent, without abdominal pain or fever. This manifestation is always linked to gram-positive organisms, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. We hypothesized that certain clinical manifestations could be indicators for initial vancomycin monotherapy.

Therefore, In the present study, we analyzed the initial clinical manifestations of culture-positive PDAP, including patients who presented with only cloudy effluent and patients who presented with cloudy effluent, abdominal pain and/or fever. We linked the clinical characteristics of peritonitis to the susceptibility of the causative organism to vancomycin and investigated the possibility of using vancomycin monotherapy as an initial treatment regimen for some patients with PDAP to avoid unnecessary antibiotic exposure and secondary infection.

Conclusion

The clinical outcomes associated with secondary peritonitis are highly dependent upon the site of contamination (appendicitis vs others), as well as local and systemic factors. Recent developments in care have influenced the route and choice of operation. Improvements in antimicrobial therapy and results of prospective randomized clinical trials have identified a variety of effective antibiotics for the management of these disorders. There continues to be controversy about the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for secondary peritonitis.

### Updated guideline on diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal… [^112BHugS]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections are the second most common cause of infectious mortality in intensive care units. Complicated intra-abdominal infection, which extends into the peritoneal space, is associated with abscess formation and peritonitis. Uncomplicated infection, which involves intramural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, may progress to complicated infection if left untreated. Initial Evaluation Routine history, physical examination, and laboratory studies will identify most patients who require further evaluation. Intra-abdominal infection should be considered in patients with unreliable physical examination findings who present with evidence of infection from an undetermined source. Further diagnostic imaging is not necessary in patients with obvious signs of diffuse peritonitis and in whom immediate surgical intervention is required.

Computed tomography should be performed to determine whether an intra-abdominal infection is present in adults who are not undergoing immediate laparotomy. Interventions A source control procedure to drain infected foci, control ongoing peritoneal contamination, and restore anatomic and physiologic function is recommended in virtually all patients with intra-abdominal infection. Emergency surgery should be performed in patients with diffuse peritonitis, even if measures to restore physiologic stability must be continued during the procedure. An urgent approach also should be taken in hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of acute organ failure. However, intervention may be delayed for up to 24 hours in closely monitored patients who have started antimicrobial therapy.

Select patients with minimal physiologic derangement and a well-circumscribed focus of infection can be treated with antimicrobial therapy without a source control procedure if close clinical follow-up is possible. In patients with severe peritonitis, relaparotomy is not recommended in the absence of intestinal discontinuity, abdominal fascial loss that prevents abdominal wall closure, or intra-abdominal hypertension. Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Suspected Acute Appendicitis A constellation of findings, including characteristic abdominal pain, localized abdominal tenderness, and laboratory evidence of acute inflammation, identifies most patients with suspected appendicitis. Imaging should be performed in all children in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is uncertain, particularly in those younger than three years. CT is preferred, but ultrasonography is an alternative if exposure to ionizing radiation is a concern.

For patients in whom imaging does not detect appendicitis, follow-up at 24 hours is recommended to ensure resolution of signs and symptoms.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^111ywuzz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Definitions

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) describes a diverse set of diseases. It is broadly defined as peritoneal inflammation in response to microorganisms, resulting in purulence in the peritoneal cavity. IAI are classified as uncomplicated or complicated based on the extent of infection.

Uncomplicated abdominal infections involve intramural inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without anatomic disruption. They are often simple to treat; however, when treatment is delayed or inappropriate, or the infection involves a more virulent nosocomial microbe, the risk of progression into a complicated abdominal infection becomes significant.

Complicated abdominal infections extend beyond the source organ into the peritoneal space. They cause peritoneal inflammation, and are associated with localized or diffuse peritonitis. Localized peritonitis often manifests as an abscess with tissue debris, bacteria, neutrophils, macrophages, and exudative fluid contained in a fibrous capsule. Diffuse peritonitis is categorized as primary, secondary or tertiary peritonitis.

Primary peritonitis is also known as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. It is thought to be the result of bacterial translocation across an intact gut wall. These infections are commonly monomicrobial, and the infecting organism is primarily determined by patient demographics. For example, healthy young girls are most often infected by streptococcal organisms, cirrhotics by gram negative or enterococcal organisms, and peritoneal dialysis patients by Staphylococcus aureus. Diagnosis requires peritoneal fluid aspiration. Characteristics of infection include white blood cell count (WBC) > 500 cells/mm³, high lactate, and low glucose levels. Positive peritoneal fluid cultures are definitive, and resolution of infection is marked by peritoneal fluid with < 250 WBC/mm³.

Secondary peritonitis is caused by microbial contamination through a perforation, laceration, or necrotic segment of the GI tract. Definitive diagnosis is based on clinical examination and history, and specific diagnoses can be confirmed by radiographic imaging. If a patient is stable enough for transport, computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous and oral contrast is the standard method of evaluating most intra-abdominal pathologies, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, and colitis. Suspected biliary pathology is the exception, and ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality for this spectrum of disease including acute cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, and cholangitis. Infections associated with secondary peritonitis are commonly polymicrobial and the infecting organisms are those most commonly associated with the source of contamination (see Table 1).

### Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis: towards improving evidence, practices, and outcomes [^115zsxtW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Peritonitis is a common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis that results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It also significantly limits the use of this important dialysis modality. Despite its importance as a patient safety issue, peritonitis practices and outcomes vary markedly and unacceptably among different centers, regions, and countries. This article reviews peritonitis risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly focusing on potential drivers of variable practices and outcomes, controversial or unresolved areas, and promising avenues warranting further research. Potential strategies for augmenting the existing limited evidence base and reducing the gap between evidence-based best practice and actual practice also are discussed.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^11391h6Y]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) definitions — uncomplicated versus complicated and peritonitis subtypes — note that much literature uses these categories, with uncomplicated IAI traditionally limited to a hollow viscus and complicated IAI extending into normally sterile abdominal sites; some conditions remain borderline. Complicated IAI may present as secondary or tertiary peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscesses, or phlegmon. Secondary peritonitis arises from perforation of a hollow viscus but the term does not always imply infection and lacks detail on extent or chronicity, both of which may affect prognosis. There is less agreement on tertiary peritonitis; one consensus group defined it as infection that persisted or recurred more than 48 hours after apparently successful management of secondary peritonitis. Some clearly complicated conditions, such as peri-appendiceal phlegmon, may be managed without a source control procedure or microbiologic analysis.

The diagnosis of SBP or SBE is established with a fluid absolute neutrophil count greater than 250/mm³ (ascites or pleural, respectively), and spontaneous bacteremia is established with positive blood cultures.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^1134cJth]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Peritonitis due to intra-abdominal infection is a common community-onset infectious syndrome. Frequently encountered diagnoses include intestinal perforation, intestinal ischemia with consequential perforation or secondary bacterial invasion of the bloodstream, cholecystitis, appendicitis, perforated diverticular abscess, or hepatic abscess. For patients recovering from abdominal surgery, especially those with intestinal perforation who may have had contamination of the peritoneal space with intestinal contents, intra-abdominal abscess should be sought as a source of pyrexia; otherwise this is generally an uncommon source of new hospital-onset infection. However, colitis due to Clostridium difficile infection should not be overlooked in the hospitalized patient with fever and diarrhea, especially in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Urinary tract infection is another common aetiology of pyrexia. While the majority of community-onset lower urinary tract infections are not associated with fever and systemic symptoms, patients admitted to hospital and especially the ICU owing to a urinary tract infection typically have infection of the upper urinary tract wherein high fever and other signs of sepsis are common. In patients whose urinary tract infection develops while in the ICU, this is usually the result of an accumulated biofilm on the urinary bladder catheter. In these patients, not only is the bladder catheter the source of the infection, it may also mask the development of symptoms classically ascribed to infection of the urinary tract, and pyrexia may be the only presenting sign. For community-onset infections, the organisms most frequently detected include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently isolated among patients with a urinary tract infection acquired in the ICU.

### Management of peritonitis in the critically ill patient [^116auFZS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Severe secondary peritonitis carries significant mortality, despite advancements in critical care support and other therapies. Surgical management requires a multidisciplinary approach to guide the timing and the number of interventions necessary to eradicate the septic foci and create optimal healing with the fewest complications. Research is needed regarding the best surgical strategy for very severe cases. The use of deferred primary anastomosis seems safe in patients presenting with hemodynamic instability and hypoperfusion. These patients have a high risk of anastomotic failure and fistula formation. Allowing for aggressive resuscitation and judicious assessment of the progression of local inflammation are safe strategies to achieve the highest success and minimize serious and protracted complications in patients who survive the initial septic insult.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^111iM9rq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the European guidelines, SBP is diagnosed based on a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count ≥ 250/mm³ in ascetic fluid and exclusion of secondary causes of intraabdominal infection. A retrospective study from the USA found that only 52.4% of SBP patients fulfilled the polymorphonuclear diagnostic criteria. In addition, paracentesis is required to determine the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear count. In clinical practice, some patients have contraindications to abdominocentesis. These limitations limit the use of polymorphonuclear count and reduce the efficiency of SBP diagnosis. This indicates that there are limitations to diagnosing SBP based on a polymorphonuclear count. Therefore, it is essential to develop a new diagnostic tool for SBP. A calculation tool for predicting SBP could help to find identify SBP rapidly and noninvasively.

In recent years, several models have been developed for the diagnosis of SBP, but only single-center reports with small sample sizes are available. In addition, most studies were conducted in foreign countries, with only scarce reports from China. Single-center studies have inherent limitations, and models may have different degrees of overfitting. Importantly, none of the previous models have been validated in an external data set. SBP has nonspecific symptoms and should be considered in patients with cirrhosis who develop signs or symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, altered mental state, abdominal tenderness, or low blood pressure. However, the aforementioned symptoms are not considered in any of the currently available models. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify symptoms and clinical and laboratory parameters to predict the development of SBP in cirrhotic ascites, as well as to develop a scoring system that is applicable to China for early diagnosis of SBP or exclusion of SBP without the need for abdominal paracentesis.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^115Efk5L]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Post-polypectomy coagulation syndrome (PPCS) — features and management: PPCS, also called post-polypectomy syndrome or transmural burn syndrome, is thought to occur when cautery injury causes full-thickness thermal injury of the bowel wall with localized serosal inflammation and peritonitis. Typical symptoms and signs include fever, localized abdominal tenderness (often with rebound tenderness), and leukocytosis occurring within a few hours to days of the polypectomy. Patients who are suspected to have severe post-polypectomy syndrome should be closely observed by medical and surgical teams, and receive intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and bowel rest, and most patients recover uneventfully. Abdominal radiographs and computed tomography scans may demonstrate features, such as air in the peritoneum, and carbon dioxide insufflation significantly reduces post-procedural symptoms and pneumoperitoneum associated with perforation at a minimal additional cost.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: benefit or risk? [^114x6Nhh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with risk of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Current guidelines recommend primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at risk of a first episode and to prevent recurrence, respectively. Factors associated with prophylaxis failure leading to SBP, ACLF, and increased mortality are not well established. Gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms have become more frequently associated with SBP, particularly in the setting of ACLF. Efforts to understand how long-term antibiotic therapy may affect individual risk of SBP in this population will be critical to developing optimal preventive strategies.

### Fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome associated with tuberculous salpingitis and peritonitis: a case presentation and review of literature [^115ycoMK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first case where Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is associated with both peritoneal and genital tuberculosis and where ascites was the primary clinical finding. Sharma et al. already described 3 cases of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome associated with female genital tuberculosis, however they all presented with chronic abdominal pain and/or infertility. Ascites and peritoneal involvement was not present in any case.

Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome provides a diagnostic challenge as it can mimic many other diseases (most often acute cholecystitis). Clinical presentation includes sharp pain in the upper right quadrant, fever and in most cases, but not always, signs of salpingitis. Most patients show no evidence of generalized intra-abdominal infection and only occasionally have concomitant ascites.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography usually shows linear contrast enhancement of the liver capsule. This was not present in our case.

Symptoms and signs, physical examination and laboratory findings of peritoneal tuberculosis are nonspecific. Symptoms have an insidious onset and include ascites, diffuse abdominal pain, low-grade fever and weight loss, developing over a period of several weeks to months. Lab abnormalities may include mild to moderate anemia, peripheral -usually lymphocytic- leukocytosis, increased alkaline phosphatase or transaminases and hypoalbuminemia.

Abdominal ultrasound may show typical fine mobile strands. Computed tomography findings include peritoneal thickening, omental cake and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Computed tomography findings include peritoneal thickening, omental cake and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.

Ascitic fluid analysis typically shows a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) less than 1.1 g/dL with protein level of more than 2.5 to 3 g/dL. Cytology typically shows a predominance of lymphocytic cells.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^116XPLCC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms of BDI

The most frequent complaints of patients with BDI are persistent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and/or vomiting, fever, and jaundice. The BDI clinical presentations are related to the type of injury. The two most frequent clinical scenarios are bile leakage and bile duct obstruction. In patients with a bile leak, an early visible sign is the presence of bile from the drain or surgical incision. If the subhepatic region is not drained, a perihepatic bile collection (biloma), abscess, or biliary peritonitis may develop with corresponding clinical signs. Generally, jaundice is not observed or is mild in these cases because cholestasis does not occur. In patients with biliary strictures, symptoms are often delayed. Cholestatic jaundice with choluria, fecal acholia, and pruritus are the most common clinical signs and symptoms. If cholangitis develops, fever with chills is typically associated with jaundice. Recurrent cholangitis is the main consequence of bile duct stricture, hepatic injury and dysfunction from complete bile duct occlusion. Sepsis and multiorgan failure may develop in both clinical settings.

When BDI is not identified intraoperatively or during the first postoperative week, patients may have an insidious evolution with relapsing abdominal pain, cholangitis, and bile collections. A late diagnosis, which sometimes is made years after surgery following multiple ineffective attempted repairs or inappropriate management, may result in increased complexity of bile duct repair. Moreover, even if successfully managed, the patient's quality of life and survival may be impaired. Indeed, the clinical course of undiagnosed or unrepaired BDI can evolve to secondary biliary cirrhosis with portal hypertension, liver failure, and, ultimately, death.

### The role of likelihood ratio in clinical diagnosis: applicability in the setting of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^112eLHaq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite imperfect clinical information and uncertainty about clinical course and outcome, the clinician's main task is to make reasonable decisions about patient care. The clinical history and physical examination typically provide information that is useful for making a diagnosis; however, we still rely on laboratory and radiologic tests to confirm a diagnosis in most cases. Understanding the operative characteristic of a test is of key importance because it can change the probability that a patient has a disease before the result of a test is known. This operative characteristic, better known as the likelihood ratio (LR), is a global assessment of the information provided by a test. The LR allows calculating the odds that a patient has a disease after a test is performed. In this article, we explain the meaning of the LR, how it works, and the applicability of this tool in the setting of a challenging scenario in clinical practice, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Laparoscopy in the early diagnosis and management of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis [^112XiWmL]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a rare and dreaded complication that can occur in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although risk factors have been identified, the diagnosis is difficult and is usually made late in the disease after extensive fibrosis of the peritoneal membrane has occurred, at which point therapy is often fruitless. The high mortality rate of SEP is due to complications resulting from recurrent bowel obstruction, malnutrition, and sepsis. We report three patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of SEP all of whom had normal abdominal CT scans. Nevertheless, each patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, which confirmed the clinical suspicion of SEP. In each case, the diagnosis was made before extensive peritoneal fibrosis had occurred allowing therapeutic intervention at an early stage. All three patients subsequently became asymptomatic and thrived. This clinical improvement was supported by the lack of progression to overt peritoneal fibrosis on repeat laparoscopy. We conclude that a high index of suspicion in conjunction with a low threshold for diagnostic laparoscopy may be an effective strategy to establish an early diagnosis and treatment regimen for SEP. Additionally, repeat laparoscopy can be used to guide the length of therapy. These interventions may ultimately improve the long-term morbidity and mortality of SEP.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^1121PjRK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

In the patient with abdominal sepsis early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications.

Complicated intra-abdominal infections diagnosis is mainly a clinical diagnosis.

Abdominal pain, which may be acute or insidious. Initially, the pain may be dull and poorly localized (visceral peritoneum) and often progresses to steady, severe, and more localized pain (parietal peritoneum).

Systemic manifestations are SIRS manifestations: Core body temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, heart rate > 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute (not ventilated) or PaCO2 < 32 mm Hg (ventilated), WBC > 12,000, < 4,000 or > 10% immature forms (bands).

Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as lactic acidosis, oliguria, and acute alteration of mental status are indicative of evolution to severe sepsis.

Abdominal rigidity suggests peritonitis and the need for urgent laparotomy.

The diagnostic approach to confirm abdominal infection source in septic patients depends on the hemo-dynamic stability of the patient.

Unstable Patients may not perform studies that require trips away from the ICU or emergency department. In these patients intra-abdominal septic source may be detected by ultrasound (US).

Abdominal ultrasound, that has the advantage of being portable, may be helpful in the evaluation of right upper quadrant (e.g. perihepatic abscess, cholecystitis, pancreatitis), right lower quadrant, and pelvic pathology (e.g. appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, Douglas abscess), but the examination is sometimes limited because of patient discomfort, abdominal distension, and bowel gas interference.

When patients are stable, computerized tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for most intra-abdominal processes.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115FAhYR]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:

- **Definition**: SBP is a bacterial infection in the peritoneal fluid without any other identifiable source of infection.
- **Pathophysiology**: SBP is a severe complication of cirrhosis, primarily occurring due to bacterial translocation from the gut to the peritoneal cavity.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of SBP in the US is estimated at 4000 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations often include rapid onset of symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental status. Diagnosis is typically made by analyzing ascitic fluid, with a neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ indicating SBP. If not promptly treated, SBP can lead to serious complications such as renal failure, septic shock, and hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of SBP is generally poor, with high in-hospital mortality rates. Factors such as renal dysfunction, high bilirubin levels, and low sodium levels have been associated with increased mortality.

### Noninfectious causes of cloudy peritoneal dialysate [^112oXHxR]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

The appearance of cloudy dialysate fluid in combination with the clinical manifestations of peritonitis usually heralds infectious peritonitis. Diagnosis is readily established in most cases by routine culture of the turbid dialysate. However, an occasional patient presents with culture-negative, cloudy dialysate. After ruling out atypical infectious etiologies, a diverse set of aseptic causes remains in the differential diagnosis. Herein we review these causes and suggest an organizational scheme, based on identifying the cellular or noncellular constituent producing the dialysate turbidity, to facilitate appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Materials and methods

Study population

This study retrospectively recruited patients who experienced PDAP in the Department of Nephrology, Peking University Third Hospital, from February 1, 2015, to July 31, 2022. In our center, after PD initiation, all patients were closely followed by dedicated nurse. Most of our patients performed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and dialysate containing 132 mmol/l of sodium and 1.5 or 2.5% glucose concentration (Dianeal, Baxter Healthcare, Tianjing, China) was used in all the patients.

Patient included in the present study were > 18 years of age and met the diagnostic criteria for PDAP by per International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD). Patients were excluded if (1) the initial diagnosis of peritonitis was from another hospital, (2) a culture was not collected or was negative, (3) data for initial clinical manifestations were missing, or (4) relapsing peritonitis. In our center, followed ISPD guideline, our center's empirical initial antibiotic treatment regimen including gram-positive coverage using vancomycin and gram-negative coverage using ceftazidime.

This study was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital Ethical Committee (M2024088).

Patients' peritonitis were divided into two groups based on the clinical manifestations at the initial diagnosis of peritonitis: patients who presented with only cloudy effluent and a dialysis effluent with a white cell (WBC) count > 100/mL and > 50% polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) after a dwell time of at least 2 h were grouped into one group (PDAP-cloudy), whereas patients' peritonitis who presented with cloudy effluent, abdominal pain and/or fever were grouped into another group (PDAP-multi). In addition, culture-positive patients' peritonitis was divided based on whether the causative organism was sensitive or resistant to vancomycin.

Data collection

The general characteristics of the patients included sex, age, dialysis vintage, primary disease, and comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease). Clinical data related to PDAP collected for patients included date of diagnosis of peritonitis; date of visit; initial clinical manifestations of peritonitis (e.g. cloudy dialysate fluid, abdominal pain, fever, and others); dialysis fluid analysis results (e.g. dialysis effluent WBC count and PMN count); bacterial culture testing results; antimicrobial susceptibility testing results; and clinical biochemical indicators (e.g. hemoglobin, serum albumin, and serum potassium) at the time of visit.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^112ARMhy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Making the clinical diagnosis

When encountering a new patient in the emergency department (ED), the surgeon first makes the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis based on history, physical exam and routine laboratory testing. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting symptom. It is typically located in the left lower quadrant; however, a redundant sigmoid colon can reach the right lower quadrant and mimic appendicitis. Localized peritoneal irritation can result in guarding and rebound tenderness. Free perforation often presents as frank peritonitis. Fever and leukocytosis are usually present and assist in making the clinical diagnosis. Nausea and vomiting are the most notable symptoms when a stricture results in an obstruction. The initial assessment should include a) an assessment of the severity of the signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and white blood cell count, b) peritonitis on physical exam and c) signs of organ dysfunctions. Patients with clinical diagnosis consistent with diverticulitis who have concerning signs of sepsis should be considered to be at high risk for complicated diverticulitis. They should have IV access obtained, be given a bolus of IV isotonic crystalloids (20 ml/kg), be administered IV antibiotics, and be admitted to the hospital.

These patients should undergo CT scanning with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis with the exception of pregnant women where ultrasound is recommended. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity in confirming the diagnosis and identifying patients who are candidates for therapeutic PCD. CT scanning also excludes other causes of left lower quadrant abdominal pain (e.g. leaking abdominal aortic aneurism or an ovarian abscess), but is not reliable in differentiating acute diverticulitis from colon malignancy.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^116XRpkA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination findings should be assumed to be AMI until disproven. (Recommendation 1B)

The key to early diagnosis is a high level of clinical suspicion.

The clinical scenario of a patient complaining of excruciating abdominal pain with an unrevealing abdominal exam is classic for early AMI. If the physical exam demonstrates signs of peritonitis, there is likely irreversible intestinal ischemia with bowel necrosis. In a study of AMI, 95% of patients presented with abdominal pain, 44% with nausea, 35% with vomiting, 35% with diarrhea, and 16% with blood per rectum. Approximately one-third of patients present with the triad of abdominal pain, fever, and hemocult-positive stools. Other patients, particularly those with delayed diagnosis, may present in extremis with septic shock. Clinical signs of peritonitis may be subtle. Accordingly, one must have a high index of suspicion, because such findings almost always are predictive of intestinal infarction.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116V5aiV]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Ascitic fluid culture

Ascites culture is essential to help guide antibiotic therapy. Patients with 'culture-negative neutrocytic ascites' (PMN count > 250 cells/mm³) have a similar presentation to those with culture-positive SBP. As both groups of patients have significant morbidity and mortality, they should be treated in a similar manner. Some patients have 'bacterascites' in which cultures are positive, but, ascitic neutrophil count is < 250 cells/mm³. In some patients, bacterascites represents a transient and spontaneously reversible colonisation of ascites, in others, particularly those who are symptomatic, it may represent the first step in the development of SBP. Discussion with microbiologists about the organism cultured can help differentiate the above two scenarios, and when a positive culture is obtained a repeat tap should be sent to guide management.

Although the identification of pathogen(s) is essential for the management of infectious diseases, ascites fluid cultures often fail to provide positive results, even when using ascites samples from patients who develop clinical manifestations of SBP. Bacterial DNA detection and sequencing have been applied to the diagnosis of several infectious diseases, and molecular techniques can detect small amounts of bacterial DNA within a few hours. These promising techniques have yet to be introduced into routine clinical practice.

Fungal peritonitis is a rare, less studied complication and observational data suggest a worse prognosis. In a large multicentre study of 2743 cirrhotic inpatients, of whom 1052 had infections, 12.7% of infected patients had evidence of fungal infections with a case fatality of 30%. The majority of these were urinary, but the highest mortality was seen with fungaemia and peritonitis (case fatality > 50%).

Secondary bacterial peritonitis

A small proportion of patients with cirrhosis may develop peritonitis secondary to perforation or inflammation of an intra-abdominal organ, known as secondary bacterial peritonitis. In a small retrospective analysis, secondary peritonitis represented 4.5% of all peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. This should be suspected in those who have localised abdominal symptoms or signs, very high ascitic neutrophil count, the presence of multiple organisms on ascitic culture or in those with inadequate response to treatment. Cross-sectional imaging, such as CT, should be performed with early consideration of surgery in this scenario.

### An observational study of the etiology, clinical presentation and outcomes associated with peritonitis in lilongwe, Malawi [^115gXAs5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peritonitis is a common surgical emergency with a high mortality rate ranging from 10–60% depending on the study. Though there are several distinct causes of peritonitis, prompt recognition and surgical treatment has been the mainstay of therapy since Kirschner first reported improved outcomes with surgical intervention. This treatment approach requires both a knowledge of the signs and symptoms of peritonitis to aid diagnosis and an understanding of common causes to assist the surgeon in appropriate surgical care.

Despite a high prevalence of peritonitis reported in several African countries, little is known about the presentation, causes, and outcome of peritonitis in the south eastern African country of Malawi. Local environmental factors combined with genetic predispositions lead to marked variation in disease cause and presentation, and defining this can lead to improved local care and better overall understanding of the disease process. Like many resource-poor settings, acutely ill patients in Malawi often present late in the disease process and there is frequently limited time for diagnostic studies prior to definitive therapy. This knowledge gap, high morbidity and mortality, and delayed presentation illustrates a problem that has potential for improvement in care through a better ability to recognize and treat peritonitis. Therefore, the goals of this study were to better elucidate the etiology, presentation (history, physical, laboratory and ultrasound findings) and outcomes associated with peritonitis at a single large referral hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi.

Conclusions

In our setting peritonitis is associated with an overall mortality rate of 15%. The most common causes are appendicitis and volvulus, and factors associated with death include abdominal rigidity, generalized (versus localized) peritonitis, hypotension, tachycardia and anemia. Future research should investigate whether preoperative correction of these factors improves survival.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^112Jwwdn]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial infection is one of the most common complications leading to acute decompensation and death in cirrhosis. Despite the use of antibiotics, bacterial infections severely impact patient outcomes, increase hospital costs, and extend hospital stays. However, the accumulated mortality of patients with cirrhosis after infections is almost 43.5%. Therefore, bacterial infection can lead to worsened prognosis.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most common infection in decompensated cirrhosis patients, accounting for 40–70% of all infections. SBP is a recurring, fatal bacterial infection, with an incidence of 3.5% in symptom-free patients and 10–30% in hospitalized patients. SBP was first described in English medical literature in the 1960s as a syndrome with an exceedingly poor prognosis and in-hospital mortality rate of almost 100%. In recent years, the prognosis of SBP has improved considerably due to effective antibiotic treatment. However, due to immune dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis, the mortality rate remains as high as 30%. Delayed diagnosis of SBP leads to rapid disease progression and further deterioration of immune function, which leads to decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. At this stage, the liver function continues to deteriorate and the prognosis is poor despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Therefore, delayed diagnosis of SBP affects the outcome and prognosis of treatment, and consequently, the diagnosis should not be missed or delayed. Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with liver cirrhosis could result in an increase in infection due to resistant bacterial strains. Therefore, the early and accurate diagnosis of SBP is particularly important.

### Green dialysate and gallbladder perforation in a peritoneal dialysis patients: a case report and literature review [^111s8k2k]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, gallbladder perforation is uncommon in PD patients. Typical symptoms and signs are even less common. The importance of early diagnosis of gallbladder perforation and prompt surgical intervention cannot be overemphasized. Gallbladder perforation diagnosis is always made after exploratory laparotomy. Abdominal CT scans, biochemical tests of PD fluid, and cultures of PD fluid can aid in the diagnosis. We recommend that the presence of green dialysate with or without peritonitis strongly indicates gallbladder perforation. Because of its high mortality and morbidity rate, it is better to perform exploratory laparotomy than to practice watchful waiting when gallbladder perforation is suspected. Open cholecystectomy with PD catheter removal and administration of aggressive antibiotics are preferred treatment. The prognosis of gallbladder perforation in PD patients is good after timely surgical intervention.

### The SIFIPAC / WSES / SICG / SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^111ofRkD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 1.1. We suggest the use of scoring systems for excluding acute appendicitis in elderly patients with a low-probability score (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).

Statement 1.2. We suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on scoring systems (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
2 Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients? In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.

According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.

Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.

There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.

According to some authors the typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.

According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

### Peritonitis-the Western experience [^113QU9Md]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Much of what has been learned about the management of peritonitis has come from prospective randomized clinical trials. A number of important concepts have developed from these studies. We recognize that patients with appendicular sources of peritonitis have a lower mortality and improved outcomes compared to patients with non-appendicular sources. Pancreatic necrosis incites a unique systemic inflammatory response, which is commonly associated with respiratory failure as well as other organ failures. Although pancreatic necrosis was once treated commonly with operation, non-operative management of sterile necrosis has become the norm due to the use of long-term prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and recognition than uninfected necrosis will usually resolve over time. Pancreatic necrosis is thus excluded from most reviews of peritonitis as it will be from the present review.

The successful management of intraabdominal infection is predicated on the use of appropriate operative measures to address peritoneal infection. Prospective clinical trials have also taught us the importance of the concept of "source control". Source control encompasses all of the measures that eradicate the focus of infection, prevent continuing contamination, and restore functional anatomic relationships. This generally involves: 1) drainage of abscesses or infected fluid collections; 2) débridement of necrotic or infected tissues; and 3) definitive measures to control the source of contamination and to restore anatomy and function.

The response to intraabdominal infection depends upon the complex interaction of a variety of factors. The degree of microbial contamination, the site of origin of contamination and whether contamination is localized or diffuse are important. Previous operations or diseases can result in adhesions that may help localize infections. The systemic response to infection depends upon immune status as well as innate genetically coded responses to infection.

The diagnosis of intraabdominal infection is usually based on history and physical examination. Many patients will have abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning to establish the diagnosis. CT is also useful to identify patients with localized abscesses who are candidates for percutaneous drainage rather than operation.

The treatment of intraabdominal infections is based on the restoration of normal homeostasis. Treatment principles include: 1) restoration of fluid and electrolyte imbalances; 2) administration of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy; 3) control of the source of infection; and 4) physiologic support of organ systems. Failure to address any of these important areas can lead to increased mortality, an increased incidence of organ failure, and prolonged hospital stay.

This article will review the recent advances in the treatment of intraabdominal infections in the Western world. Emphasis will be on the emergence of newer developments upon the outcome of treatment.

Bacterial infection recognition and initial management in cirrhosis — clinical triggers and early therapy are outlined as follows: The presence of fever or hypothermia, chills, and localizing symptoms should raise suspicion for a bacterial infection, although typical symptoms may be absent in cirrhosis; bacterial infection should be suspected when a patient with cirrhosis deteriorates, particularly with encephalopathy, acute kidney injury (AKI), and/or jaundice. Workup should be initiated promptly, including skin examination, leukocyte count with differential, blood cultures, and urinalysis, and if clinical suspicion is strong (e.g., association with systemic inflammatory response), empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as samples for cultures have been collected, particularly in the presence of hemodynamic instability. In patients with cirrhosis in septic shock, mortality increases by 7% for every hour's delay in initiating antibiotics.

### Hospital-acquired peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a call to action [^1119rqpo]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Peritonitis remains a significant complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), and severe episodes of peritonitis lead to structural and functional alterations of the peritoneal membrane, which can result in a permanent transfer to hemodialysis. Although PD is designed primarily to be delivered in the community setting, patients on PD get hospitalized for a number of reasons. In this commentary, we highlight the enormous risks each hospitalization has on the occurrence of peritonitis in patients on PD and the need to understand factors that predispose patients to hospital-acquired peritonitis. Furthermore, we suggest directions on several strategies that could not only reduce the risks of developing peritonitis but also improve outcomes of patients on PD who get hospitalized for an unrelated illness.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^115BjHzp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Recommendation 1: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination. A full panel of blood tests including blood gas and lactate levels are also important to look for suggestions of bowel ischemia. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation, based on low- or very-low-quality evidence, 1C.

Symptoms of sigmoid volvulus include abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting (a late sign). In 30–41% of cases, patients report previous episodes of abdominal distention. This triad is much more common in endemic volvulus, rather than the sporadic kind of volvulus (88% versus 33%).

In the "volvulus belt" countries, the clinical presentation may be acute with peritonitis and shock. In this fulminant clinical presentation, the prognosis is poor because colonic necrosis and perforation would possibly have already occurred, by the time the patient first presents for care. Conversely, in Western countries, the patient usually presents 3 to 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The classic patient is elderly, institutionalized and under psychotropic medications that causes chronic constipation. The history should elicit the above-mentioned risk factors, including a personal history of previous sigmoid volvulus, which is present in 30–40% of cases.

Classically, the clinical examination will identify abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds and often an empty rectum on digital examination. However, the examination is often difficult due to the presence of abdominal distension, which is the result of colonic obstruction of several days duration; if there are no signs of peritoneal irritation, as is often the case, this may result in a delay in diagnosis. Nonetheless, the absence of peritonitis does not indicate the absence of bowel ischemia. Asymmetric gaseous abdominal distention associated with emptiness of the left iliac fossa is pathognomonic for sigmoid volvulus, though this can be very challenging to detect.

The duration of symptoms lasts from a few hours to several days. As these patients are typically old with comorbidities, any vomiting and dehydration can tip them over into renal insufficiency. Thus, blood testing of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.

### Peritonitis-the Western experience [^113zfdP6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis can be defined in a variety of ways. Primary peritonitis is an infection of the peritoneal cavity usually occurring in patients with preexisting ascites that is not related to diseases of the abdominal or retroperitoneal viscera. Secondary peritonitis, the most common form of peritonitis, can occur due to spontaneous perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal ischemia, or following an operation. Tertiary peritonitis is a recurrent infection of the peritoneal cavity that follows an episode of either primary or secondary peritonitis. Peritonitis can also be classified as diffuse or localized. Over time, peritoneal infection can coalesce to form an intraabdominal abscess. These two forms of peritonitis are often referred to collectively as intraabdominal infection.

There are a variety of factors influencing the reduction in mortality from peritonitis over the last century. Safer anesthetic techniques, improved understanding of perioperative fluid management, the advent of blood banking, improvements in critical care, more rapid and accurate diagnostic studies, and more effective antibiotics are some of the factors that have led to a reduction in mortality from peritonitis. On the other hand, a variety of challenges have arisen that threaten to offset these advances. Patients with intraabdominal infection are older, more commonly have comorbid diseases, often have associated immune suppression due to chronic diseases or their treatment, and more frequently have decreased physiologic reserve with either sub-clinical or evident organ failure. Although the bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract has remained relatively consistent over time, the widespread presence of antimicrobial resistance among patients with nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections has presented another challenge. This is particularly true for patients who have received previous antimicrobial treatment, inappropriate therapy, or have developed tertiary peritonitis where the pathogens are commonly resistant to front- line agents.

### Analysis of clinical diagnosis and treatment of intestinal volvulus [^112ysw8X]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of intestinal volvulus is high in Asia, with 24–60 cases per 100,000 people. The causes are mainly related to anatomical factors such as adhesion, intestinal diseases, and physical factors such as tumors and ascariasis. No matter where it occurs, it has the characteristics of acute onset, severe condition and rapid development, which is easy to cause intestinal blood circulation disorders, and can lead to intestinal ischemic necrosis, perforation, and even septic shock and death in the early stage. Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment are very important.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common and typical clinical manifestations of intestinal volvulus. Abdominal pain is generally manifested as sudden and persistent abdominal pain, which is colic in nature and can radiate to the lower back, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, cessation of exhaust, cessation of defecation, ascites, etc. In this study, it was found that all patients had abdominal pain of different degrees, and 63.3% of them were accompanied by symptoms of anal exhaust cessation. Abdominal distension generally occurred in the late stage, which may be caused by the expansion of the intestinal tube above the site of intestinal obstruction. When the signs of peritonitis appear, it often indicates that there are adverse complications. In this study, 26 patients were found to have signs of peritonitis, but statistical analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between intestinal necrosis and signs of peritonitis, which may be related to the small sample size.

Results

Patient's characteristics

A total of 378 patients were admitted in these two institutions with the post-operative diagnosis of acute diffuse peritonitis over the study period.

These included 230 patients from Buea Regional Hospital and 148 patients from Limbe Regional hospital. A total of 73 patients were excluded for the following reasons:
Thirty four records had incomplete data. These included four patients with a presumptive diagnosis of peritonitis who died before a laparotomy could be performed.
For the remaining 39 files, analysis of the operative notes indicated that no cause was identified for the peritonitis during surgical exploration and they were classified as primary peritonitis.

A total of 305 files could finally be analyzed, 201 (65.9%) from Buea Regional Hospital and 104 (34.1%) from Limbe Regional Hospital.

Our sample included 168 males and 137 females, giving a sex-ratio of 1.23/1. The ages of our patients ranged from 3 to 82 years with a mean of 30.6 ± 16.0 years. As shown on Fig. 1, a total of 269 patients (88.2%) were aged 50 years or below.

Fig. 1

Characteristics of the peritonitis

As shown in Table 1, the most common clinical findings were diffuse abdominal pain (100%), abnormal temperature (83%) and signs of peritoneal irritation (tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity: 91%). A total of 138 patients (45%) presented with signs of sepsis on admission. The delay between onset of symptoms and admission ranged from 16 h to 9 days with a mean of 3.62 days.

Most patients (80%) for whom a leucocyte count was requested and had a leucocytosis above 12.000/ml.

The diagnosis of acute generalized peritonitis was suspected on clinical ground in all cases and the most common confirmatory tool was ultrasound used in 238 (78%) cases. The cause of peritonitis was suspected pre-operatively based on the combination of clinical and ultrasonographical findings in 246 (81%) of cases. An erect chest X-ray was requested and performed in 231 (75.7%) patients and revealed a pneumoperitoneum in 37% of cases, all with a final diagnosis of either peptic ulcer or small bowel perforation.

### An observational study of the etiology, clinical presentation and outcomes associated with peritonitis in lilongwe, Malawi [^112CVFzN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study outlines the etiology, associated presenting signs and symptoms, and outcomes of surgically managed peritonitis in a tertiary care center in central Malawi. The most common etiologies of peritonitis were appendicitis and volvulus. Abdominal rigidity, generalized peritonitis (versus localized), hypotension, tachycardia and anemia were significantly associated with mortality. The overall mortality rate was 15%. Ultrasound was specific but not sensitive in diagnosing appendicitis.

There are several similarities between our findings and those from other African countries. Appendicitis was the most common cause of peritonitis in our series (21%) and in studies on acute abdomen from Ghana (43.1%), Nigeria (40.3%) and Ethiopia (24.5%). One important distinction is that our study included patients with peritonitis defined as rigidity, guarding, or rebound tenderness, while these other studies included all patients with acute abdomen. Nega (2009) was the only investigator to report specific symptoms and reported guarding in only 39% of his patients, and though tenderness was present in 78% this was not specifically peritoneal tenderness.

### Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-a guide to imaging appearances and complications [^116N3vvH]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this article is to review and illustrate the typical imaging findings for a patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and its complications, examining the uses and limitations of multimodality imaging.

Background

CAPD is a commonly and increasingly used method of renal replacement therapy in end-stage renal failure (ESRF). From the set-up and insertion of the peritoneal catheter through to the actual treatment, there are pitfalls and complications that may adversely affect the patient and compromise the success of the dialysis. Complications can be either immediate or delayed, and can also be categorised into infectious and non-infectious aetiologies, including catheter failure, dialysate leaks, hernias and encapsulating sclerosing peritonitis.

Conclusion

Early recognition of complications, both clinically and on the different imaging modalities, is essential in the management of CAPD in order to reduce treatment failure and limit patient morbidity and mortality.

Main Messages

Complications of peritoneal dialysis cause patient morbidity and treatment failure. Early recognition of complications from normal appearances is essential to limit dialysis failure. Multimodality imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of these complications.

### ACG clinical guideline: epidemiology, risk factors, patterns of presentation, diagnosis, and management of colon ischemia (CI) [^114kYXFH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — proposed, nonvalidated disease severity criteria for CI to guide treatment define moderate disease as any patient with up to three of the following: male gender; hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg); tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min); abdominal pain with mild rectal bleeding; blood urea nitrogen > 20 mg/dl; Hb < 12 g/dL; LDH > 350 IU/L; serum sodium < 136 mEq/l (mmol/l); WBC > 15×10⁹/l; or colonoscopy/identified mucosal ulceration. Severe disease is defined by more than three of the previously listed criteria or any of: peritoneal signs on physical examination, pneumatosis on CT, gangrene on colonoscopy, and a pan colonic distribution or IRCI on CT or colonoscopy. Patients with mild disease are those without typical symptoms of CI with the commonly associated risk factors for poor outcome that are seen in moderate disease.

### Emergency medicine updates: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113zjcZu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and is associated with significant risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning SBP for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

SBP is commonly due to Gram-negative bacteria, but infections due to Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug resistant bacteria are increasing. The typical presentation of SBP includes abdominal pain, worsening ascites, fever, or altered mental status in a patient with known liver disease; however, some patients may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Paracentesis is the diagnostic modality of choice and should be performed in any patient with ascites and concern for SBP or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or in those being admitted for a complication of cirrhosis. Ultrasound should be used to optimize the procedure. An ascites absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 250 cells/mm³ is diagnostic of SBP. Ascitic fluid should be placed in blood culture bottles to improve the culture yield. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips can be used for rapid diagnosis if available. While many patients will demonstrate coagulation panel abnormalities, routine transfusion is not recommended. Management traditionally includes a third-generation cephalosporin, but specific patient populations may require more broad-spectrum coverage with a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Albumin infusion is associated with reduced risk of renal impairment and mortality.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with suspected SBP.

### Validation of a new simple scoring system to predict spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [^113gABep]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a bacterial infection of ascitic units without any intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. SBP is the most frequent bacterial infection in patients with cirrhosis, followed by urinary tract infections, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and spontaneous bacteremia. When first described, mortality associated with SBP exceeded 90%, but in-hospital mortality was reduced to approximately 20% with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Society guidelines recommend that a diagnostic paracentesis should be performed as soon as a patient with cirrhosis and ascites is hospitalized urgently for any reason, even in the absence of symptoms suggestive of infection. A delayed diagnosis increases in-hospital mortality; with each hour of delay in paracentesis to diagnose SBP, the mortality increased by 3.3%. However, a study in the United States showed that the rate of paracentesis in clinical practice is still suboptimal; only 66% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites undergo paracentesis in the first 24 h after admission. Most patients who do not undergo paracentesis are in the following categories: elderly, many comorbidities, weekend hospitalizations, hospitalizations at private health facilities, and those with contraindications to paracentesis.

### Delayed diagnosis of pediatric bladder rupture with atypical presentation after a minor fall [^115Njk5H]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric bladder injuries, though uncommon, typically result from blunt trauma, often associated with motor vehicle collisions. While most bladder injuries are linked to pelvic fractures, this association may be less common in children due to anatomical differences. Bladder injuries are classified as extraperitoneal, intraperitoneal, or combined, with intraperitoneal injuries being rarer but more prevalent in children due to their higher abdominal bladder position. This case report discusses a rare instance of delayed intraperitoneal bladder rupture in a young child following a relatively minor fall, emphasizing diagnostic challenges.

Case Report

A 4-year-old female presented with new onset abdominal pain, vomiting, and subjective fever three days after a minor fall. Initial evaluation revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, elevated creatinine, and moderate ascites on ultrasound with no gross hematuria. Despite treatment for presumed acute kidney injury, the patient's condition worsened, leading to the identification of a large posterior dome bladder rupture via cystography. Surgical repair was performed, and the patient was discharged with a full recovery after sequential removal of urinary catheters. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Intraperitoneal bladder rupture can occur in healthy children after minor trauma and may not present acutely with the classic signs of gross hematuria and peritonitis. Emergency physicians should consider this diagnosis in young children with unexplained ascites, abdominal pain, hematuria, and renal failure, even with only a remote history of minor abdominal trauma.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colonic volvulus and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^116gRBm8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Colonic volvulus — initial evaluation should include a focused history, physical examination, and basic laboratory assessment. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Presenting symptoms are often nonspecific and may include abdominal pain, bloating, or cramping, nausea, emesis, and obstipation; physical examination typically reveals a distended and tympanic abdomen, and digital rectal examination usually reveals an empty vault. Although the duration of symptoms before presentation ranges from a few hours to several days, cecal volvulus tends to present more acutely, whereas sigmoid volvulus often has a more indolent presentation. Emergency presentation, with clinical signs of peritonitis or shock related to ischemia or perforation occurs in up to 25% and 35% of patients with sigmoid and cecal volvulus. It may be difficult to obtain an accurate history in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and those residing in long-term care facilities, and laboratory testing is often helpful; in general, the history and physical examination and/or radiological evaluations occur in parallel to facilitate care.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Infections in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [^116pqThF]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Considering experience acquired in the past years, it seems as though physicians have reached a plateau in the frequency of peritonitis. A peritonitis rate of 1 every 2 patient years may be acceptable. Further reduction of this peritonitis rate will require inordinately large efforts on all fronts. One will have to consider what are the acceptable costs and risks of peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis. New developments in catheter technology, improved connections, better understanding of patient selection and training programs, improved diagnostic and therapeutic methods in the management of peritonitis, and understanding of the infectious and immune processes are eagerly awaited developments.

Initial diagnosis and management of ascites — diagnostic evaluation: Although cirrhosis is the most common cause, "other potential causes should be considered, including malignancy, heart failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease". The guidance states, "The initial evaluation of ascites should include history, physical examination, abdominal doppler ultrasound, laboratory assessment and diagnostic paracentesis of the ascitic fluid", and clarifies that "the serum albumin ascites gradient is calculated by subtracting the ascitic fluid albumin from the serum albumin in simultaneously obtained samples".

### Computed tomography appearances of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis [^117EZFxq]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) characterized by thickened peritoneal membranes, which lead to decreased ultra-filtration and intestinal obstruction. Its early clinical features are nonspecific, and it is often diagnosed late following laparotomy and peritoneal biopsy, when the patient develops small bowel obstruction, which can be a life-threatening complication. However, this is changing with increasing awareness of computed tomography (CT) findings in SEP. CT can yield an early, non-invasive diagnosis that may improve patient outcome. We present a review of the CT appearances of SEP.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^116Ur8Ps]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Presentation and clinical diagnosis

The clinical presentation of gallstones is notoriously non-specific. The symptoms and signs differ depending on the site of gallstone impaction, and the duration of symptoms can vary significantly from hours to days to weeks, as previously alluded to. Most commonly, gallstone ileus resembles small bowel obstruction of any cause. Symptoms and signs are often intermittent and may include the following:
Abdominal pain — usually generalized and colicky/cramping due to bowel obstruction.
Nausea and vomiting — often follows abdominal pain. The vomitus may be bilious (small bowel obstruction, SBO), feculent (large bowel obstruction, LBO), or may appear "coffee-ground" (see below).
Abdominal distension — this is a very variable sign. Clinical examination may elicit tinkling/high-pitched bowel sounds.
Constipation — this is variable (patient may initially continue to pass stool or flatus, but this can become absolute constipation).
Signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding including hematemesis, coffee ground vomitus or melena due to the erosion of gastroduodenal artery.
Signs of bowel perforation ± peritonitis are extremely rare as first presentation of gallstone ileus.
Patients may also relate a history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, anorexia, or early satiety. Acute cholecystitis is present in 10–30% of patients at time of gallstone ileus.
Rare presentations of gallstone ileus reported in the literature include gangrenous appendicitis with a gallstone impacted at the base of the appendix, or intussusception with the stone serving as a lead point.
Most episodes of gallstone ileus tend to present as acute/subacute. However, a rare form of chronic gallstone ileus has been described in the literature. Karewsky syndrome is characterized by intermittent episodes of pain due to gallstone(s) lodged in the bowel over a protracted period of time.

Blood tests at time of presentation with gallstone ileus tend to be unremarkable (unless there are signs of intra-abdominal sepsis), and the diagnosis is usually made with radiological imaging.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^115GAXoL]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

Patients with PPU may present with severe, sudden-onset epigastric pain, which can become generalised. The peritonitis resulting from acid exposure may present as abdominal 'board-like rigidity'. The clinical picture may be less clear in the obese, the immunocompromized, patients on steroids, patients with a reduced level of consciousness, in the elderly, and in children. In these situations, the clinical history and examination may be non-specific prompting additional imaging and laboratory studies to rule out differential diagnoses. Only two thirds of patients present with frank peritonitis, which may in part explain the diagnostic delay in some patients.

During clinical evaluation, a number of differential diagnoses must be considered, but it is particularly important to exclude a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or acute pancreatitis. The former, due to its high mortality if unrecognised and delayed in treatment, and; the latter, due to the primarily non-operative management.

Diagnostic imaging may have to be delayed pending resuscitation in critically ill patients. Those presenting with generalized peritonitis with or without signs of sepsis will usually be directed straight to the operating room. Notably, mortality increases with every hour surgery is delayed.

### Secondary peritonitis: principles of diagnosis and intervention [^113r368L]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Secondary peritonitis accounts for 1% of urgent or emergent hospital admissions and is the second leading cause of sepsis in patients in intensive care units globally. Overall mortality is 6%, but mortality rises to 35% in patients who develop severe sepsis. Despite the dramatic growth in the availability and use of imaging and laboratory tests, the rapid diagnosis and early management of peritonitis remains a challenge for physicians in emergency medicine, surgery, and critical care. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of peritonitis and its potential progression to sepsis, discuss the utility and limitations of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests, and present a paradigm for the management of secondary peritonitis.
