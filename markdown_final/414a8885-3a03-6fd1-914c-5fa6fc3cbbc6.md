## Question

Pcos symptom onset

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms typically begin and how to interpret onset in adolescents versus adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core epidemiology and whether PCOS is truly a pubertal-onset condition. Then, I should verify adolescent-specific diagnostic criteria and why they differ from adult criteria. Next, I will examine the natural history and timing of symptom emergence across the reproductive lifespan. After that, I need to consider early-life antecedents and risk factors that shape onset. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline and highlight key uncertainties and follow-up needs, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic frame and typical onset window. PCOS affects roughly 8–13% of reproductive-aged women, and contemporary reviews consistently describe manifestations arising in childhood and evolving through adolescence into adulthood, which supports a pubertal or peripubertal onset in many cases [^83ee47ce] [^8a15542f]. Wait, let me verify the adolescent prevalence range; depending on the diagnostic criteria and population, adolescent prevalence is cited around 6–18%, reinforcing that symptomatic expression is common during the teenage years [^adb06237].

> I need to check the adolescent diagnostic criteria because they directly inform how we interpret "symptom onset". In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical) and ovulatory dysfunction (irregular menses defined by time post-menarche) are required, and neither polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound nor anti-Müllerian hormone should be used for diagnosis due to poor specificity in this age group, which is a critical distinction from adult criteria [^119aa810] [^83d6512b] [^35576cb0]. Hold on, I should verify the cycle definitions: for 1–3 years post-menarche, cycles shorter than 21 or longer than 45 days are considered irregular; after 3 years, shorter than 21 or longer than 35 days, or fewer than 8 cycles per year, are irregular; any cycle longer than 90 days at any time post-menarche is abnormal and warrants evaluation, which helps calibrate what constitutes pathologic onset versus physiologic maturation [^c467c9cc].

> Next, I should review the natural history and timing of symptom emergence. Let me consider the classic triad: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and metabolic features. Hyperandrogenic signs such as hirsutism and acne, and ovulatory dysfunction with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, commonly emerge in late puberty or shortly thereafter, often within the first 1–3 years after menarche, aligning with the period of hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis maturation [^333a422a] [^83ee47ce]. I should double-check the anovulation data: up to 85% of cycles can be anovulatory in the first year post-menarche, declining to about 59% by year three, which explains why stricter cycle thresholds are used after 3 years to define pathology and why early irregularity alone is insufficient for diagnosis [^9fe02a51] [^49a2a1dc].

> But wait, what if symptoms begin even earlier? I will now examine early-life antecedents and risk factors that shape onset. Daughters of women with PCOS, girls with premature pubarche, and those with obesity demonstrate higher risk and may show subtle metabolic and reproductive abnormalities from infancy, suggesting that the pathophysiology can be entrenched before overt pubertal symptoms appear [^047c372c] [^38d66baf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these are risk markers rather than diagnostic features, so they inform vigilance rather than early labeling, which is consistent with guideline cautions against overdiagnosis in adolescence [^35576cb0].

> I should confirm how adult-onset PCOS differs and why. In adults, diagnosis requires two of three: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology/elevated AMH, and ultrasound or AMH is not needed if both hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are present, which operationalizes a broader diagnostic net than in adolescents [^119aa810] [^83d6512b]. Let me reconsider the implication: this means that in adults, symptom onset can be recognized later and still meet criteria, whereas in adolescents the narrower criteria deliberately reduce false positives during physiologic maturation, so "onset" in teens must be interpreted with both features present and other causes excluded [^119aa810].

> Next, I should review the longitudinal evolution to avoid overstating a fixed onset. PCOS is a lifelong condition with heterogeneous, evolving phenotypes; reproductive features may moderate with age, but metabolic risks often persist or worsen, and many women report symptom beginnings in adolescence even if diagnosis is delayed into adulthood, which underscores the importance of longitudinal follow-up and reassessment when criteria are not fully met initially [^8a15542f] [^83ee47ce]. I need to ensure I note the "at risk" category: adolescents with only one feature should be monitored and managed symptomatically, with re-evaluation at or before reproductive maturity, typically around 3–8 years post-menarche depending on the missing feature, to catch evolution into full PCOS or to de-label if features resolve [^35576cb0] [^80aaaad0].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while keeping the caveats explicit. Many girls exhibit the onset of PCOS symptoms in mid-to-late puberty, often within 1–3 years after menarche, with hyperandrogenic and ovulatory features clustering during this window; however, because normal pubertal physiology overlaps with PCOS features, diagnosis in adolescents requires both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction after excluding mimics, and ovarian morphology or AMH should not be used to diagnose PCOS in this age group [^83ee47ce] [^119aa810] [^35576cb0]. Hold on, I should verify the earliest actionable signal: primary amenorrhea by age 15 or more than 3 years after thelarche warrants evaluation for underlying pathology, including PCOS, even if full diagnostic criteria are not yet met, which helps avoid missed diagnoses while still applying adolescent-specific thresholds for cycles and androgens [^c467c9cc] [^b54f97f5].

> I should double-check key uncertainties and follow-up needs so we do not overpromise certainty. Evidence quality for adolescent PCOS diagnostics remains low to moderate, and there is ongoing debate about optimal thresholds and timing of reassessment; nonetheless, international guidelines converge on the two-feature adolescent model and the prohibition of ultrasound/AMH for diagnosis, with shared decision-making and culturally sensitive counseling emphasized to navigate diagnostic ambiguity and potential weight stigma during this vulnerable period [^35576cb0] [^83d6512b]. Let me reconsider the bottom line: symptom onset is best viewed as a pubertal emergence of hyperandrogenic and ovulatory features, typically within 1–3 years after menarche, with diagnosis contingent on adolescent-specific criteria and a plan for re-evaluation if criteria are incompletely met, while recognizing that pathophysiologic roots may be present earlier in high-risk girls [^83ee47ce] [^119aa810] [^047c372c].

PCOS symptoms typically begin at **puberty**, with irregular menses, acne, and hirsutism emerging in adolescence [^83ee47ce] [^333a422a]. Early features may appear before menarche, such as premature pubarche or elevated androgens, but diagnosis is challenging due to overlap with normal puberty [^047c372c] [^ec8b36d2]. Most cases are diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood, though symptoms often persist into adulthood and may evolve with age and weight changes [^8a15542f] [^d529b260]. Early recognition and adolescent-specific criteria help avoid both under- and overdiagnosis and enable timely management [^35576cb0] [^b3756a86].

---

## Typical age of symptom onset

- **Puberty**: Most girls develop PCOS symptoms during or shortly after puberty, typically between ages 12–18 [^notfound].
- **Early adolescence**: Symptoms often emerge within 1–3 years after menarche, reflecting immaturity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis [^notfound].
- **Pre-puberty**: Some girls show early signs (e.g. premature pubarche, elevated androgens) before menarche, indicating antecedent endocrine dysfunction [^047c372c].

---

## Early signs and symptoms

Early PCOS features include:

| **Symptom category** | **Common early symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Reproductive | - Irregular menses (oligomenorrhea) <br/> - Primary amenorrhea <br/> - Heavy or prolonged bleeding [^c467c9cc] [^33ad7a74] |
| Hyperandrogenism | - Hirsutism <br/> - Acne <br/> - Early pubarche <br/> - Elevated androgens [^35576cb0] [^047c372c] |
| Metabolic | - Weight gain <br/> - Central obesity <br/> - Insulin resistance <br/> - Dyslipidemia [^d529b260] [^1a8ba427] |
| Psychological | - Anxiety <br/> - Depression <br/> - Body image concerns [^8a15542f] [^197713c8] |

## Diagnostic challenges in adolescence

Diagnosis during adolescence is complicated by **overlap with normal puberty**:

- **Menstrual irregularity**: Common in early post-menarche years, limiting specificity [^9fe02a51] [^6937af21].
- **Hyperandrogenism**: Acne and mild hirsutism are frequent in puberty, reducing diagnostic specificity [^72346706].
- **Ovarian morphology**: Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound are common in adolescents and not specific for PCOS [^7bbbae4b] [^0a7f1b1d].

---

## Adolescent-specific diagnostic criteria

To address these challenges, **adolescent-specific criteria** require both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, with exclusion of other causes:

- **Hyperandrogenism**: Clinical (hirsutism, severe acne) and/or biochemical (elevated androgens) [^35576cb0] [^18c3c7a8].
- **Ovulatory dysfunction**: Irregular cycles defined by time post-menarche (e.g. > 90 days any cycle > 1 year post-menarche; < 21 or > 45 days 1–3 years post-menarche) [^c467c9cc] [^35576cb0].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Rule out congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's, prolactinomas, and thyroid disease [^35576cb0] [^6091992d].

---

## Factors influencing age of onset

Several factors influence **when symptoms appear**:

- **Genetics**: Family history of PCOS or metabolic syndrome increases risk and may hasten onset [^047c372c] [^38d66baf].
- **Intrauterine environment**: Exposure to excess androgens or maternal obesity may program fetal development toward PCOS [^8009a283] [^047c372c].
- **Pubertal timing**: Early puberty or rapid pubertal progression may unmask symptoms earlier [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Excess adiposity amplifies insulin resistance and androgen excess, advancing onset [^8009a283] [^333a422a].

---

## Longitudinal course and progression

PCOS is **chronic and progressive**, with symptoms evolving across the lifespan:

- **Adolescence**: Symptoms often peak with hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity [^notfound].
- **Reproductive years**: Persistent oligomenorrhea, infertility, and pregnancy complications are common [^8a15542f] [^d529b260].
- **Postmenopause**: Androgen excess may persist, and metabolic risks remain elevated [^6f72637c] [^047c372c].

---

## Clinical implications of early onset

Early-onset PCOS carries **significant risks**:

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Higher risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease [^d529b260] [^1a8ba427].
- **Psychological impact**: Greater anxiety, depression, and quality-of-life impairment [^8a15542f] [^197713c8].
- **Infertility**: Persistent anovulation and endometrial hyperplasia increase subfertility risk [^8a15542f] [^33ad7a74].

---

## Management considerations

Early recognition and **individualized care** are essential:

- **Lifestyle**: Weight management, nutrition, and exercise are first-line to mitigate metabolic and reproductive risks [^83ee47ce] [^69243adb].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Combined oral contraceptives for cycle control and hyperandrogenism; metformin for metabolic features [^35576cb0] [^ebf1bf6c].
- **Long-term monitoring**: Regular screening for metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological comorbidities [^1c1f1836] [^ebf1bf6c].

---

PCOS symptoms most often begin at **puberty**, with early features sometimes appearing before menarche. Adolescent-specific diagnostic criteria and early, individualized management are critical to address the reproductive, metabolic, and psychological burdens of this lifelong condition [^83ee47ce] [^35576cb0].

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female reproductive disorder that often manifests during adolescence and is associated with disruptions in health-related quality of life. Prompt evaluation and clinical support after diagnosis may prevent associated complications and optimize overall health management. This article incorporates the most recent evidence and consensus guidelines to provide an updated review of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management strategies for adolescents with this complex condition. We will review the recent international guidelines on PCOS; because the diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial, management of this condition is inconsistent. In 2019, PCOS remains a common, yet neglected, condition, in part, because of the lack of agreement around both diagnosis and management.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^adb06237]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition affecting between 8 and 13% of women of reproductive age and 6–18% of adolescent girls depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied. Adolescence, as defined by the World Health Organisation, is the period between 10 and 19 years of age that includes significant and critical changes in growth, development and puberty.

Diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence is both controversial and challenging due to the overlap of normal pubertal physiological changes (irregular menstrual cycles, acne and polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasound) with adult PCOS diagnostic criteria. These challenges have been acknowledged in adult and paediatric consensus statements. Specifically, challenges include the risk of under-diagnosis, delayed and/or poor diagnosis experiences, and over-diagnosis as well as the additional risk of the use of inconsistent non-evidence-based approaches in the diagnosis and management of PCOS among specialists, general practitioners and allied health professionals. These challenges are exacerbated by the lack of robust evidence. For example, 'only adolescents' studies are limited and suboptimal in quality. Further, adult studies that include adolescents do not specify the number of adolescents or time post menarche, which is critical information to determine the evolution of normal pubertal physiological changes. Lastly, relevant consensus statements are often not specific to adolescents and/or not based on robust high-level evidence and/or rigorous processes, indicating the need for high quality, evidence-based guidelines.

The aim of the first International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS ('the Guideline') was to promote the accurate diagnosis of PCOS, optimal consistent care, the prevention of complications and improved patient health outcomes from adolescence to adulthood. The term 'adolescence' in the Guideline was defined as the period between 10 and 19 years of age according to the World Health Organisation. However, based on evidence, those who were within a gynaecological age of 8 years or less than 8 years post menarche were also identified in the recommendations.

This paper focuses specifically on the adolescent recommendations from the Guideline and examines the evidence and rationale supporting these recommendations. We discuss the importance of avoiding missed diagnosis, of delayed, under- or over-diagnosis, and of evidence-based management to address PCOS symptoms in adolescents. Additionally, we expand on approaches to identify girls 'at risk' of PCOS but not yet diagnosed, including the need for future follow-up.

### Are young adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome slipping through the healthcare cracks? [^4269e84e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder often diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. In adolescence, the many similarities between normal features of puberty and symptoms of PCOS make it challenging to confirm the diagnosis. Even among adult women, the changing definitions of PCOS may lead to inaccurate diagnoses. Women may present with a variety of symptoms to different healthcare providers and may be treated only for the presenting symptoms without evaluation of the syndrome and its associated morbidities. Timely evaluations, accurate diagnosis, appropriate interventions, and multidisciplinary healthcare teams can be valuable because women with PCOS have an increased risk for obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, infertility, endometrial cancer, and anxiety and mood disorders. Appropriate transition of care for the adolescent from pediatric to adult healthcare providers should include education of the patient and her parents regarding the chronic nature of the syndrome and the need for continued follow-up. Girls with symptoms suggestive of PCOS who fail to fulfill diagnostic criteria should undergo prolonged observation. Early identification of PCOS at different entry points in the healthcare system will require physician education and improved access.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^83ee47ce]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

### Curtailing PCOS [^69243adb]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by hormonal imbalance and ovarian dysfunction, often starts during adolescence. Inconsistent diagnostic criteria, variable provider knowledge, and lack of consensus pose specific challenges for the care of women with PCOS. These factors encourage inaccurate diagnosis with both under and overdiagnosis. This unfavorable diagnostic experience exasperates affected women and limits timely opportunities for intervention to minimize associated comorbidities, especially during the transition from pediatric to adult care. Recognition of these issues in the care of adolescents and women with PCOS inspired the development of the International Evidence-Based PCOS Guidelines, which emphasize the prevention, screening, and treatment of PCOS across the reproductive lifespan. The Guidelines and accompanying meta-analyses focus on three major categories of associated comorbidities: (1) reproductive; (2) metabolic; and (3) psychological. With the exception of infertility, this article considers common manifestations and comorbidities associated with PCOS throughout the lifecycle. Healthy lifestyle interventions with prevention of excess weight gain comprise the primary intervention for all comorbidities. Hence, early identification of girls "at risk" for PCOS and those with PCOS is a priority. Extensive guidelines for provider and patient education aim to decrease the medical, psychosocial, and economic burdens attributable to PCOS and its associated comorbidities.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^35576cb0]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) during adolescence is challenging because features of normal pubertal development overlap with adult diagnostic criteria. The international evidence-based PCOS Guideline aimed to promote accurate and timely diagnosis, to optimise consistent care, and to improve health outcomes for adolescents and women with PCOS.

Methods

International healthcare professionals, evidence synthesis teams and consumers informed the priorities, reviewed published data and synthesised the recommendations for the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied to appraise the evidence quality and the feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and strength of the recommendations.

Results

This paper focuses on the specific adolescent PCOS Guideline recommendations. Specific criteria to improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid over diagnosis include: (1) irregular menstrual cycles defined according to years post-menarche; > 90days for any one cycle (> 1year post-menarche), cycles < 21 or > 45days (> 1 to < 3years post-menarche); cycles < 21 or > 35days (> 3years post-menarche) and primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3years post-thelarche. Irregular menstrual cycles (< 1year post-menarche) represent normal pubertal transition. (2) Hyperandrogenism defined as hirsutism, severe acne and/or biochemical hyperandrogenaemia confirmed using validated high-quality assays. (3) Pelvic ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis of PCOS within 8years post menarche. (4) Anti-Müllerian hormone levels not recommended for PCOS diagnosis; and (5) exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. For adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet diagnostic criteria an 'at risk' label can be considered with appropriate symptomatic treatment and regular re-evaluations. Menstrual cycle re-evaluation can occur over 3years post menarche and where only menstrual irregularity or hyperandrogenism are present initially, evaluation with ultrasound can occur after 8years post menarche. Screening for anxiety and depression is required and assessment of eating disorders warrants consideration. Available data endorse the benefits of healthy lifestyle interventions to prevent excess weight gain and should be recommended. For symptom management, the combined oral contraceptive pill and/or metformin may be beneficial.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement accompanied by rigorous processes honed both diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for PCOS during adolescence.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^8a15542f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Despite affecting ~11–13% of women globally, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a substantially understudied condition. PCOS, possibly extending to men's health, imposes a considerable health and economic burden worldwide. Diagnosis in adults follows the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, requiring two out of three criteria - clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and/or specific ovarian morphological characteristics or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone. However, diagnosing adolescents omits ovarian morphology and anti-Müllerian hormone considerations. PCOS, marked by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, strongly contributes to early-onset type 2 diabetes, with increased odds for cardiovascular diseases. Reproduction-related implications include irregular menstrual cycles, anovulatory infertility, heightened risks of pregnancy complications and endometrial cancer. Beyond physiological manifestations, PCOS is associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosexual dysfunction and negative body image, collectively contributing to diminished health-related quality of life in patients. Despite its high prevalence persisting into menopause, diagnosing PCOS often involves extended timelines and multiple health-care visits. Treatment remains ad hoc owing to limited understanding of underlying mechanisms, highlighting the need for research delineating the aetiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome. Identifying factors contributing to PCOS will pave the way for personalized medicine approaches. Additionally, exploring novel biomarkers, refining diagnostic criteria and advancing treatment modalities will be crucial in enhancing the precision and efficacy of interventions that will positively impact the lives of patients.

### The reproductive phenotype in polycystic ovary syndrome [^333a422a]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

The symptoms of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include hirsutism and irregular menstrual bleeding due to ovarian androgen excess and chronic anovulation. Typically, these features emerge late in puberty or shortly thereafter. The proposed mechanism(s) responsible for increased ovarian androgen production include heightened theca cell responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation, increased pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone, and hyperinsulinemia. The cause of ovulatory dysfunction is not well understood, but is linked to abnormal follicle growth and development within the ovary. As a result, infertility is common among women with PCOS and, in many instances, is the initial presenting complaint. Insulin resistance and obesity are frequently associated with PCOS and probably contribute to the severity of symptoms. The polycystic ovary that accompanies the syndrome has recently been defined as having 12 or more follicles per ovary or an ovarian volume greater than 10 mL as determined by ultrasonography. In addition, there is an increased number of growing follicles in the polycystic ovary. Despite this distinctive appearance, the cause and development of the polycystic ovary are completely unknown.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^93c6e3a6]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

### Update on diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome during adolescence [^b3756a86]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic condition beginning during the peripubertal years. The international evidence-based guidelines and the update in 2023 have clearly defined the diagnostic criteria during adolescence with the goal of decreasing controversies and challenges with the diagnosis during this critical life stage. In this narrative review we aimed to examine the recent available data related to the diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. Specifically, we evaluated publications from August 2022 (date when the last searches were run for the update of the international evidence-based guidelines on PCOS) to May 2025. Current evidence supports the use of two main diagnostic criteria for adolescents: irregular menstrual cycles, well defined according to time post-menarche, and hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, after excluding other conditions that mimic PCOS. In contrast to adult PCOS diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary morphology on pelvic ultrasound and/or antimullerian hormone levels should not be used for adolescent PCOS diagnosis. Accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence enables early screening and management of PCOS and its associated comorbidities. Equally important is the early identification of adolescents considered "at risk" of PCOS (those who only meet one diagnostic criterion) as emerging evidence indicated increased metabolic risks and reinforces the need for long-term follow-up. Novel cluster analysis in well-defined adolescent cohorts is beginning to clarify threshold values for diagnostic features and may further refine adolescent-specific criteria. Specific PCOS diagnostic criteria avoiding polycystic ovary morphology and antimullerian hormone; and using of clearly defined irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism should be applied during adolescence. Early recognition of adolescents both with PCOS and those "at risk" is critical to ensure timely metabolic screening and appropriate follow-up. Health care professionals should be aware that different PCOS diagnostic criteria are necessary for adolescents.

### Criteria, prevalence, and phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome [^dfda3623]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder effecting reproductive-aged women worldwide. This article addresses the evolution of the criteria used to diagnosis PCOS; reviews recent advances in the phenotypic approach, specifically in the context of the extended Rotterdam criteria; discusses limitations of the current criteria used to diagnosis, particularly when studying adolescents and women in the peri- and postmenopause; and describes significant strides made in understanding the epidemiology of PCOS. This review recognizes that although there is a high prevalence of PCOS, there is increased variability when using Rotterdam 2003 criteria, owing to limitations in population sampling and approaches used to define PCOS phenotypes. Last, we discuss the distribution of PCOS phenotypes, their morbidity, and the role that referral bias plays in the epidemiology of this syndrome.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^629048dc]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition affecting ~ 8% of adolescents. The adolescent PCOS diagnostic criteria have been controversial due to the overlap of the pubertal changes with adult PCOS diagnostic criteria. These pubertal changes including menstrual irregularities, acne, and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) are well recognized. Given the prevalence of menstrual irregularities during the early postmenarcheal years, mild acne or PCOM, these PCOS diagnostic criteria during adolescence can result in overdiagnosis. Conversely, disregarding diagnostic features can result in delayed or underdiagnosis with adverse long-term consequences. Delayed diagnosis has been reported by individuals who described symptoms starting in adolescence. Hence, nuanced diagnostic criteria are key to accurate and timely diagnosis.

The original consensus-based Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis were upgraded to evidence-based criteria in the 2018 and 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline. The 2023 Guideline recommends adult diagnosis on the basis of the identification of at least two of these recognized features: (1) menstrual irregularities/ovulatory dysfunction, (2) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, and (3) PCOM on ultrasound or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels; however, neither PCOM nor AMH levels are suitable for diagnosing PCOS during adolescence.

In the 2023 update of the PCOS International Evidence-based Guideline ("The Guideline"), we aimed to develop and provide comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment to improve the lives of those with PCOS worldwide from adolescence to adulthood. This manuscript highlights the adolescent-specific recommendations from the 2023 Guideline with supporting evidence. The term "adolescent" refers to individuals between 10 and 19 years of age according to the World Health Organization definition and women within 8 years postmenarche (gynecological age of 8 years or less) have also been identified for specific recommendations.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^83d6512b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: ontogeny in adolescence [^38d66baf]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of symptomatic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often unfolds across puberty, but the ontogeny of PCOS is difficult to study because, in general, its pathophysiology is well entrenched before the diagnosis can be confirmed. However, the study of high-risk groups (daughters of women with PCOS, girls with premature pubarche, and girls with obesity) can offer insight in this regard. Available data support the hypothesis that the pubertal development of PCOS involves various combinations of genetic predisposition, intrauterine programming, hyperinsulinism, and numerous other abnormalities that provoke reproductive symptoms (eg, hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction) in response to the pubertal increase in gonadotropin secretion.

New diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) suggested three main phenotypes: classic (hyperandrogenism and anovulation), ovulatory, and normoandrogenic. However, it is unclear whether the normoandrogenic phenotype actually represents PCOS. Overall, 6% to 8% of reproductive-aged women suffer from PCOS, making this disorder one of the most common endocrine abnormalities.

### Update on PCOS: consequences, challenges, and guiding treatment [^00309b9b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis, and less-than-optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. The International PCOS network, consisting of geographically diverse international experts in PCOS as well as consumers, engaged in a multi-year international evidence-based guideline development process that was jointly sponsored by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The guideline was published in 2018 and endorsed by more than 40 international societies involved in PCOS. Translation of this evidence-based guideline to medical practice and consumer groups remains a priority. However, there remain many challenges to both understanding the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Evidence suggests that both clinicians and consumers are not satisfied with the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment options. This review summarizes the important findings for diagnosis and treatment from the guidelines and expands on recent developments in the literature since its publication. Special attention to diagnosis at the ends of the reproductive spectrum are discussed and remaining areas of controversy are noted. Additionally, the review highlights some of the remaining challenges in the understanding and management of PCOS to help guide clinicians and investigators in this perplexing condition.

### Optimal management of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescence [^e35a11f0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder of reproduction and metabolism, which emerges at puberty, and is characterised by a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, anovulation, hyperinsulinaemia and associated comorbidities. Unlike adult PCOS, there are no agreed-upon diagnostic criteria for adolescent PCOS, but hyperandrogenaemia remains the sine qua non for its diagnosis. Many adolescent girls with PCOS are overweight/obese, and have a heightened risk for comorbidities such as dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, fatty liver disease, sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is essential for implementation of appropriate treatment and management. Available treatments include lifestyle modifications, hormonal contraceptives and insulin sensitisers. However, there are limited data on the best treatment modalities in adolescents. The objective of this review is to describe the clinical manifestations of PCOS in adolescents and the appropriate diagnostic work-up. The optimal treatment modalities based on a review of the available adult and adolescent literature will be discussed.

1 | WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ADOLESCENTS AND WOMEN WITH PCOS?

This guideline aims to optimize evidence-based, consistent care that meets the needs and improves the quality of life of women with PCOS. The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages, targeting areas and outcomes of priority for women with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their health care providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on partnership in care and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered. With effective translation, the guideline and health professional and consumer resources will address gaps and priorities identified by women with PCOS and will promote vital future research.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^ebf1bf6c]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

During adolescence, accurate diagnostic criteria and/or identification of adolescents "at risk" of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are critical to establish appropriate screening, treatment, and lifelong health plans. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS aimed to provide the most up-to-date evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes for individuals with PCOS, emphasizing accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS from adolescence.

Methods

The best practice methods following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) criteria were applied. Healthcare professionals and patients/consumers reviewed extensive evidence synthesis/meta-analysis for 55 prioritized clinical questions. Databases (OVID MEDLINE, All EBM, PsycInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched until August 2022 as part of the 2023 update of the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework guided experts on evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength.

Results

This manuscript focuses on the adolescent-specific recommendations of the 2023 Guideline. The diagnosis is based on the presence of both irregular menstrual cycles (defined according to the time postmenarche) and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. Adolescents with only one of these features can be considered "at risk" of PCOS requiring the management of symptoms and ongoing follow-up. Polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasonography or anti-Müllerian hormone levels should not be used for diagnosis during adolescence. Lifelong health planning is recommended to include healthy lifestyles, screening for depression and metabolic features and the transition to adult care, all underpinned by shared decision-making. Healthcare professionals should explain weight-related health risks to adolescents, while minimizing weight stigma. In adolescents with PCOS or "at risk" of PCOS, combined oral contraceptive pills are indicated for menstrual irregularity and clinical hyperandrogenism, focusing on low dose preparations, and metformin could be considered for metabolic features and cycle regulation. Overall, the evidence is limited in adolescents with PCOS, and recommendations are based on low to moderate certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement and rigorous processes generated International Guideline diagnostic criteria for adolescents that differ from adult criteria and clarified appropriate screening and management strategies for PCOS during adolescence.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations for children [^40166d02]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine syndrome with variable phenotypic expression and important systemic associations and sequelae, including obesity, insulin resistance, infertility, risk of endometrial cancer, and possible risk of cardiovascular events. PCOS is recognized as a condition influenced by genetic and environmental factors and distinct manifestations in all stages of life, including the prenatal period, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Identification of this disorder in childhood and adolescence has received growing attention, in part because of emerging evidence of the benefit of early intervention, but the diagnosis and management of PCOS in children and adolescents can be challenging. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations of PCOS in children are reviewed to enhance identification and evaluation of patients suspected of having this disorder. When a diagnosis of PCOS is suspected in a child but cannot be confirmed, a provisional diagnosis is strongly recommended so as to prompt ongoing monitoring with an emphasis on important early interventions such as obesity reduction.

2 | INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% to 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. – Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, – resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, AGREEII-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to upskill health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^c6c60e7b]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The Guideline recommendations are the result of extensive international engagement and rigorous, evidence-based processes aligned with international best practice. Whilst the Guideline provided recommendations for adult women and adolescents, this paper summarises the evidence and recommendations relating to adolescents as defined by the World Health Organisation, namely as females aged between 10 and 19 years. It also addresses recommendations relating to gynaecological age, and specifically 8 years post menarche, and the use of pelvic ultrasound in PCOS diagnosis as well as recommendations relating to the re-evaluation of girls that do not meet the diagnostic criteria in adolescence but are considered 'at increased risk' of PCOS. There are few evidence-based recommendations relating to adolescents in the Guideline highlighting the limited evidence in this age group. Limitations within studies included poorly defined study populations, challenges in diagnosis around puberty, the different diagnostic criteria used and lack of availability of data for "time post menarche" of subjects included in most of the studies. Research recommendations highlighted these gaps and emphasised the need for greater high-quality research of PCOS during adolescence.

Adolescence — knowledge gaps and recommended future research include the absence of longitudinal studies through adolescence, the absence of specific diagnostic criteria for identifying PCOS early in adolescence, the absence of normative values for a number of biochemical markers during adolescence, assessment of value of intervention in PCOS early in adolescence, and lack of clarity as to whether the severity of symptoms during adolescence predicts the extent of the disorder in later life.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — irregular menstrual cycles and adolescent risk: Irregular menstrual cycles are defined as 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days, 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year, 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle, and Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche (breast development). When irregular menstrual cycles are present a diagnosis of PCOS should be considered and assessed according to these PCOS Guidelines, and for adolescents with features not meeting diagnostic criteria an increased risk could be considered with reassessment advised at or before full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche; ovulatory dysfunction can still occur with regular cycles and serum progesterone levels can be measured to confirm anovulation.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^8009a283]. International Journal of Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest endocrine disorder in women and typically presents during adolescence. The clinical and biochemical presentation is heterogeneous, but elevated serum concentrations of androgens are the most consistent biochemical abnormality and may be considered to be the hallmark of the syndrome. Many women with PCOS also have insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, which may contribute to the clinical and endocrine abnormalities. The aetiology of PCOS is not clear but studies in the Rhesus monkey suggest that exposure to excess androgen during intrauterine life results in many of the features of human PCOS, including ovarian dysfunction, abnormal LH secretion and insulin resistance.

Objective

To review the studies from the literature, including those of the author, regarding aetiology, presentation and management of PCOS in adolescents.

Results and Conclusions

We have proposed that PCOS in adolescents arises as a result of a genetically determined disorder of ovarian function that results in hyper-secretion of androgens, possibly during fetal life and also during physiological activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian in infancy and at the onset of puberty. There is plentiful evidence for a genetic basis for PCOS (it appears to be a complex endocrine disorder resulting from the effects of a several genes), but environmental factors, notably nutrition, influence the clinical and biochemical phenotype. Obesity unmasks or amplifies symptoms, endocrine and metabolic abnormalities. The increasing incidence of childhood obesity has resulted in an alarming Increase not only in distressing symptoms but also impaired glucose tolerance and even diabetes among adolescent girls with PCOS. The search for PCOS genes in this condition, that is not only heterogeneous but also presents only in women of reproductive age, is not straightforward and has produced few convincing candidates so far. In due course, however, identification of the major susceptibility loci is likely to provide key insight into the aetiology of the syndrome and improve diagnosis and management.

### Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome [^80fb5535]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Since the 1990 National Institutes of Health-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome, and as such no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.

In women, the definition of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has become broad and includes several possible phenotypes. Because several features of PCOS may be in evolution in adolescents, we suggest that only firm criteria should be used to make a diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. Hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, and ovarian morphology change during adolescence and are discussed individually. Adolescents with incomplete criteria for a firm diagnosis of PCOS should be followed up carefully and may be diagnosed at a later time.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: etiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis [^4cdee361]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of up to 10%. Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed, generally centered around the features of hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, oligo-ovulation and polycystic ovarian morphology. Insulin resistance is present in a majority of cases, with compensatory hyperinsulinemia contributing to hyperandrogenism via stimulation of ovarian androgen secretion and inhibition of hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin production. Adipose tissue dysfunction has been implicated as a contributor to the insulin resistance observed in PCOS. Environmental and genetic factors also have a role in the development of PCOS. The syndrome is associated with numerous morbidities, including infertility, obstetrical complications, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and mood and eating disorders. Despite these morbidities, PCOS may be common in our society owing to evolutionary advantages of the syndrome in ancient times, including smaller family sizes, reduced exposure to childbirth-related mortality, increased muscle mass and greater capacity to store energy. The diagnosis of PCOS hinges on establishing key features while ruling out other hyperandrogenic or oligo-ovulatory disorders. Treatment is focused on the goals of ameliorating hyperandrogenic symptoms, inducing ovulation and preventing cardiometabolic complications.

Health risks

Polycystic ovary syndrome is well established as a reproductive disorder associated with hyperandrogenism, and is the leading cause of oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are at increased risk of mental health disorders, endometrial cancer, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after induction of ovulation. Consistent with our understanding of the pathogenesis, however, polycystic ovary syndrome is also recognised as a metabolic disorder, with long term health risks, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and obesity. These health risks could be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular eventsand several adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although the reproductive aspects might diminish with age, metabolic features typically persist or can worsen.

### Clinical review: lifecycle of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): from in utero to menopause [^047c372c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is diagnosed during the reproductive years when women present with 2 of 3 of the following criteria: 1) irregular menstrual cycles or anovulation, 2) hyperandrogenism, and 3) PCO morphology. However, there is evidence that PCOS can be identified from early infancy to puberty based on predisposing environmental influences. There is also increasing information about the PCOS phenotype after menopause. The goal of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the appearance of PCOS at different life stages and the influence of reproductive maturation and senescence on the PCOS phenotype.

Evidence

PubMed, the bibliography from the Evidence-Based PCOS Workshop, and the reference lists from identified manuscripts were reviewed.

Evidence Synthesis

The current data suggest that daughters of women with PCOS have a greater follicle complement and mild metabolic abnormalities from infancy. PCOS is often diagnosed in puberty with the onset of hyperandrogenism and may be preceded by premature pubarche. During the reproductive years, there is a gradual decrease in the severity of the cardinal features of PCOS. Menopausal data suggest that the majority of women who had PCOS during their reproductive years continue to manifest cardiovascular risk factors. However, the majority do not present an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, perhaps because women with no history of PCOS may catch up after menopause.

Conclusion

The current data provide a comprehensive starting point to understand the phenotype of PCOS across the lifespan. However, limitations such as a bias of ascertainment in childhood, age-based changes during reproductive life, and the small numbers studied during menopause point to the need for additional longitudinal studies to expand the current knowledge.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescence [^2bed172c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome of variable combinations of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism or acne, and obesity. It can be diagnosed in adolescence and has early childhood antecedents. PCOS is the single most common endocrine cause of an ovulatory infertility and a major risk factor for the metabolic syndrome and, in turn, development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women. Thus, it appears that PCOS increases a woman's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Therefore, identifying girls at risk for PCOS and implementing treatment early in the development of PCOS may be an effective means of preventing some of the long-term complications associated with this syndrome. This article reviews the definition, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of PCOS.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^4bb5d32f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition among reproductive‐aged women, affecting 10%–13% of this population. Underpinned by endocrine abnormalities, the multifaceted nature of PCOS includes diverse metabolic, reproductive, dermatological, and psychological sequelae, which vary depending on lifestyle, environmental, ethnic, and genetic factors. The heterogenous and evolving nature of symptoms across the lifespan in PCOS contributes to its complex presentation and has historically made diagnosis challenging. Based on the International Evidence‐based Guideline PCOS diagnostic criteria, which builds on the earlier consensus‐based Rotterdam criteria, PCOS is diagnosed in adults on the basis of two of three components: (i) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (ii) ovulatory dysfunction, including anovulation or chronic oligo‐ovulation, and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, after exclusion of other possible aetiologies. Testing for the latter of these criteria (ultrasound or AMH) is only required where the first two criteria are not met. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and ovarian features are not included as they are non‐specific for PCOS at this life stage.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^4a0d74db]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% to 13% of women globally. It is a condition with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features, with health impacts across the lifespan. The etiology of PCOS is complex, with an interplay of several factors, including genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity-related dysfunction leading to hypothalamic-ovarian disturbance. Diagnosis is recommended based on the International PCOS Guideline criteria, with diagnosis confirmed in adults when 2 of out the following 3 criteria are met: (i) hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical); (ii) irregular cycles; and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. With its clinical heterogeneity, distinct phenotypes, variation across the lifespan and ethnic variation, PCOS diagnosis can present significant diagnostic challenges to clinicians.

Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM PCOS consensus — this third consensus report summarizes current knowledge and knowledge gaps on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), covering adolescence, hirsutism and acne, contraception, menstrual cycle abnormalities, quality of life, ethnicity, pregnancy complications, long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health, and malignancy and stroke risk. PCOS is described as the most common endocrine disorder in women, with prevalence between 6% and 10% using U.S. National Institutes of Health criteria and as high as 10% to 15% with Rotterdam criteria. PCOS is typically first identified during the early reproductive years, and clinical expression commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism (either clinical or biochemical), and the presence of polycystic ovaries. This work follows earlier ESHRE/ASRM workshops that focused on diagnosis (2004) and infertility management (2008).

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^12133a00]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents — diagnosis and interim treatment notes that PCOS is estimated to affect 6–15% of reproductive-aged women and is the most common cause of persistent hyperandrogenism beyond early puberty. There are no clear consensus guidelines on diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescent girls within 2 years of menarche; thus, obstetrician–gynecologists should exercise caution in assigning this diagnosis prematurely, and most experts agree that longitudinal evaluation of symptoms should occur over the span of the first 1–2 years after menarche before establishing a diagnosis. Treatment of acne and hirsutism should not be withheld during evaluation, and although obesity and insulin resistance are not diagnostic criteria, they often co-exist and warrant early counseling on healthy weight, nutrition, and exercise and evaluations to exclude diabetes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): an interview with richard legro [^ec8b36d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Are there any specific challenges regarding the diagnosis of PCOS associated with specific age groups – so the adolescent or menopausal women?

In regards to the question about the specific challenges associated with adolescent and menopausal women, I think it is difficult or nearly impossible to diagnose it in adolescent and menopausal women. The reason for that is puberty very much mimics the signs and symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome. Puberty is really characterized by the awakening of the adrenal gland, and that contributes to the formation of body hair in the pelvic region, and also the awakening of the ovary, which results in the completion of puberty, development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development. The initial period is characterized by relative androgen excess, much like polycystic ovary syndrome.

Similarly, it is well known that girls, after they have their first period (termed menarche) can have periods within the first three years of relative oligo-ovulation and infrequent menses. Obviously it varies for different populations; some girls can normalize almost immediately after menarche and other girls have a longer period of ovulatory normalization.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^83b8d403]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — androgen assessment while on combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and monitoring: It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the COCP as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotropin-dependent androgen production, and if assessment is imperative the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time. For follow-up, repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role, and in development, in most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12–15 years of age.

Look for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound to provide additional supportive evidence, recognizing that this is less likely to present in menopausal patients.

PCOS after menopause — conclusions and research needs indicate that age may improve many manifestations of PCOS, including normalizing ovarian size and morphology, T levels, and oligo-ovulation before menopause (level B). Priority gaps include that there are little data on long-term fecundity and precise age of menopause in women with PCOS; the long-term risk for morbidity and mortality among postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS is uncertain; there is no established phenotype for PCOS after menopause; most clinical assays are not precise for determining T levels in postmenopausal women; long-term, multicenter cohort studies are needed to assess menopausal phenotype, cardiovascular events, cancer, and other causes of morbidity/mortality; and genomewide association studies should be used to identify new genes/pathways involved in ovarian dysfunction related to age of menopause and polycystic ovaries.

Adolescence — diagnostic context and natural history in PCOS are outlined: As many as 85% of menstrual cycles are anovulatory during the first year after menarche, and up to 59% are still anovulatory during the third year after menarche; in one study, persisting oligomenorrhea was not predicted by increased androgens, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, or increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, whereas increased body mass index (BMI) was the major risk factor for persistent anovulation; only approximately 40% of adolescent women with menstrual irregularity have polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and investigators suggest that oligoamenorrhea or amenorrhea should be present for at least 2 years after menarche (or primary amenorrhea at age 16 yrs), that ultrasound criteria should include increased ovarian size (> 10 cm^3), and that hyperandrogenemia rather than just signs of androgen excess should be documented.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome in the adolescent [^9f936a61]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is now recognized as a heterogeneous disorder that results in overproduction of androgens, primarily from the ovary, leading to anovulation and hirsutism and is associated with insulin resistance. Long-term sequellae of PCOS include higher risk for diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, endometrial hyperplasia, and anovulatory infertility. Symptoms in the adolescent include oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, and weight gain. Insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes have also been demonstrated in adolescents who have PCOS. Treatment should be instituted early to decrease symptoms and long term sequellae of PCOS. Weight loss, oral contraceptives, and antiandrogens are effective in treating the symptoms of this disorder. Insulin-sensitizing medications have been shown to be effective but should be used with caution until larger randomized trials have shown short- and long term benefits and efficacy over traditional therapies in the adolescent population.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^cbd9e9be]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adolescents "at risk" of PCOS require ongoing follow-up and management according to symptoms. Timing of follow-up and re-evaluation of the diagnosis should be discussed and emphasized with adolescents and their families to avoid disruption in care which frequently occurs during transition. Adolescents "at risk" of PCOS can be diagnosed with PCOS during follow-up if they present with a combination of both menstrual irregularities and hyperandrogenism, even before 8 years postmenarche. Thus, re-evaluations before and following transition are essential to ascertain outcomes. Additionally, recent data suggest that adolescents "at risk" for PCOS have abnormal metabolic profiles. Prospective longitudinal studies evaluating adolescents "at risk" of PCOS and healthy adolescents are needed to provide evidence-based data to better advise on the timing of follow-up and the future risk of developing PCOS.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and cardiovascular disease: a premature association? [^c3e028ae]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are often assumed, a priori, to be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), given the high prevalence of the metabolic syndrome X among them. There is, however, no single definition of PCOS, and for that reason a comparison of studies that have analyzed its association with CVD is compromised from the start. Long-term studies of well characterized women with PCOS are lacking, and the link to primary cardiovascular events such as stroke or myocardial infarction remains more speculative than substantive. Epidemiological studies that have focused on isolated signs and stigmata of PCOS, such as polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism, or chronic anovulation, have found mixed results. There are studies that suggest a slight increase in cardiovascular events in women with polycystic ovaries, with perhaps stronger evidence between an increased risk of cardiovascular events in women with menstrual irregularity. However, there is little evidence for an association between hyperandrogenism per se and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, there are less data to substantiate an increased risk of events in women with PCOS identified on the basis of a combination of signs and symptoms, such as hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation. The existing data suggest that PCOS may adversely affect or accelerate the development of an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, and even of subclinical signs of atherosclerosis, but it does not appear to lower the age of clinical presentation to a premenopausal age group. Future studies to identify the risk of cardiovascular events in women with PCOS will benefit from clear and extensive phenotyping of PCOS abnormalities at baseline, from a prospective design, from larger sample sizes, and from longer follow-up.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex syndrome that affects menstrual regularity, causes hyperandrogenism, increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction and infertility, and is associated with higher rates of mental health disorders. The symptoms of PCOS are unique to each individual and will evolve throughout their reproductive lifespan and beyond. Thus, care should be personalized and provided by an appropriate team of multidisciplinary physicians and clinicians, such as dieticians and psychologists.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — menstrual irregularity — PCOS commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, while obesity and insulin resistance are commonly encountered but are not required for diagnosis. Amenorrhea is generally defined as intervals between periods exceeding 199 days, whereas oligomenorrhea involves intercycle intervals between 35 and 199 days; spontaneous ovulations can occur, with a placebo-arm randomized controlled trial reporting ovulation in 32% of cycles. In women with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, there is an approximately 90% chance that PCOS will also be diagnosed.

### Age at onset of metabolic syndrome among women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome-like status [^2685685a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), but whether they develop MetS earlier than women without PCOS is unknown. Understanding the impact of PCOS on the timing of MetS onset is important for screening and clinical care in this population.

Design

Women with PCOS-like status (PCOSp) were identified from participants of the Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study based upon history of irregular menstrual cycles, high free-androgen index, and high levels of antimüllerian hormone. MetS was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Age at MetS onset was compared between women with and without PCOSp using an accelerated failure time model adjusted for baseline education, lifestyle factors, and midlife body weight.

Results

Among the 496 women in the analysis, 11.7% (n = 58) were determined to have PCOSp. Over a mean follow-up of 11 years, 20 women with PCOSp and 136 women without PCOSp developed MetS. After adjusting for smoking, education, and physical activity, women with PCOSp developed MetS at an age 14.4% (95% CI -22.7, -5.2) younger than women without PCOSp. The magnitude of the association was attenuated to 5.4% in models additionally adjusted for body mass index (95% CI -12.4, 2.1). Because a typical study participant without PCOSp developed MetS at 51.5 years old, 5.4% translates to almost 3 years earlier onset of MetS for a comparable woman with PCOSp.

Conclusions

Women with PCOSp develop MetS at a younger age. Earlier screening for MetS in women with PCOS may be warranted.

Conclusions

Adolescent-specific recommendations from the 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline enable accurate and timely diagnosis with well-defined Guideline criteria for PCOS diagnosis during adolescence that differ from adult diagnostic criteria. Additionally, recommendations highlight the importance of identifying and managing adolescents "at risk" of PCOS, screening for depression and glucose abnormalities in adolescents with PCOS and establishing management strategies guided by adolescents' concerns including a lifelong health plan. The overall evidence is limited and of low to moderate quality, highlighting the critical need for further research on PCOS during adolescence and in the longer term.

The menstrual cycle and quality of life in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Symptoms typically associated with PCOS (acne, hirsutism, irregular menses, amenorrhea, obesity, subfertility) are a major source of psychological morbidity and can negatively affect quality of life, with changes in appearance (particularly obesity and hirsutism) reducing quality-of-life and decreasing sexual satisfaction. Biochemical, endocrine, metabolic parameters and menstrual irregularities appear less important. Amenorrhea in PCOS was associated with lower self-esteem, greater fear of negative appearance, and earlier sexarche versus a nationwide Dutch control cohort, with earlier sexarche in younger women but seeming delay in older patients compared with historic Dutch controls.

### Do different diagnostic criteria impact polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis for adolescents? [^c312bd25]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although early diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents might allow for earlier treatment and prevention of chronic disorders, incorrect or premature diagnosis carries risks of unnecessary treatment and psychological distress. There is no consensus concerning which diagnostic criteria to use for adolescents and current criteria vary. The objective of this study was to determine whether using different diagnostic criteria will affect PCOS diagnosis in adolescents.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Fifty-two patients aged 13–18 years with at least 2 of the following criteria were included in the study: (1) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; (2) Clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism; and (3) polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. Patients were then categorized according to the 6 different criteria for PCOS. National Institutes of Health, Rotterdam criteria, Androgen Excess Society, Amsterdam criteria, Endocrine Society criteria, and the Pediatric Endocrine Society criteria. The characteristics of adolescents who were diagnosed with PCOS were also evaluated.

Interventions and Main Outcome Measures

Forty-one patients out of 52 (78.8%) received diagnosis with National Institutes of Health and Endocrine Society criteria, all with Rotterdam criteria, 45/52 (86.5%) with Androgen Excess Society criteria, 36/52 (69.2%) with Amsterdam criteria and 34/52 (65.4%) with the Pediatric Endocrine Society criteria.

Results and Conclusion

This study shows that the choice of guideline used does have a great effect on whether an adolescent received the PCOS diagnosis or not. For physicians using the broader criteria, care should be taken to ensure the patient does not receive diagnosis because of the physiological changes seen during puberty, which might mimic PCOS. For those using stricter criteria, close monitoring of patients who do not receive diagnosis is necessary to prevent chronic complications.

### Updated adolescent diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: impact on prevalence and longitudinal body mass index trajectories from birth to adulthood [^82abe836]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age with an estimated prevalence of 8–13%. Its pathogenesis includes insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism which drive the reproductive (menstrual dysfunction, infertility), metabolic (metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors), and psychological (anxiety, depression, low quality of life) complications. Given the high prevalence and diverse features across the lifespan, as well as the high prevalence of obesity which further exacerbates its clinical features, PCOS contributes to the global burden of disease. It is therefore imperative to recognize the condition early to facilitate interventions and prevent complications.

Being a heterogeneous disorder, the diagnosis of PCOS is difficult and often delayed. PCOS diagnosis is based on oligo-anovulation (OA), biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound extending across the original 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria (OA and HA), the 2003 Rotterdam criteria (any two of OA, HA, and PCOM), and the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (AE-PCOS) Society criteria (HA and OA or PCOM or both). The Rotterdam criteria are now widely accepted and generate four possible diagnostic PCOS phenotypes in adult women: (A) OA + HA + PCOM, (B) OA + HA, (C) HA + PCOM, and (D) OA + PCOM. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence-based guideline, which was co-developed based on unprecedented evidence synthesis and best practice methods, by world-leading multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers across 37 societies from 71 countries, with consumer engagement.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — postmenopause diagnosis and evaluation states that a diagnosis of PCOS could be considered as enduring / lifelong, and healthcare professionals could consider that both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism persist in the postmenopause for women with PCOS; PCOS diagnosis could be considered postmenopause if there is a past diagnosis, or a long-term history of oligo-amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the earlier reproductive years (age 20–40), and further investigations should be considered to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis in postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism.

### PCOS diagnosis in adolescents: the timeline of a controversy in a systematic review [^2e57bbf3]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Study objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescence, a disorder of exclusion, has proved to be a timeless diagnostic challenge for the clinician. Since 1990, several attempts to provide clear diagnostic criteria have been published, most of the time leading to inconsistencies. We attempted to elucidate the controversies and convergences of this subject by conducting a systematic review of the literature concerning official guidelines or proposed criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescent girls. Design Based on a term search sequence via electronic databases such as Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus and a hands-on review of references and learned societies, all available data were classified and analyzed. Single case reports, original studies with adult population or articles with incomplete diagnostic guidelines were excluded. Results Twelve reports dated from 2006 to 2018 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seven of them were endorsed or published by learned societies. All suggested a stricter diagnosis than in adulthood. Polycystic ovarian morphology was used as a necessary criterion only in three guidelines, and there was a tendency for a more objective diagnosis of hyperandrogenism, defined either by clinical features or by biochemical hyperandrogenemia, although in one case both were required. Conclusion Irregular menstrual cycles, allowing for an interval of at least 2 years postmenarche, and hyperandrogenism, usually reinforced by biochemical confirmation, are the main accepted features for PCOS diagnosis in adolescence. Discrepancies among endocrine and reproductive medicine societies still remain, although recent intensified attempts at reaching a consensus should allow for more universally accepted diagnostic criteria.

Adolescents 'at risk' of PCOS

A practice point for this section is that, for adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet the diagnostic criteria, the 'at risk' of PCOS label could be considered and reassessment is advised at or before full reproductive maturity. This timing is at 3 years post menarche in relation to menstrual cycle irregularity and at 8 years post menarche in relation to the use of pelvic ultrasound to identify a polycystic ovarian morphology, as described in the ultrasound section. The timing of reassessment in relation to menstrual cycles was based on physiological maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary ovarian axis and the likelihood of having ovulatory cycles matching those of women in reproductive age. Reassessment is particularly important for adolescent girls with persisting PCOS features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence and should occur after hormonal therapy washout of at least 3 months if this therapy has been commenced (whilst ensuring contraceptive needs are met). This recommendation is based on the need to address isolated symptoms, such as irregular menstrual cycles or clinical hyperandrogenism, where the diagnosis of PCOS remains unclear as pelvic ultrasound is not recommended at this life stage. PCOS cannot be diagnosed during adolescence unless both irregular menstrual cycles or hyperandrogenism are present. It was recommended that these adolescents be made aware of their 'at risk' status for PCOS and that future re-evaluation may be needed if both features persist beyond 3 years post menarche. This recommendation emerged from published evidence as well as from strong and consistent feedback from women with PCOS, who had a poor diagnostic experience and often failed to be diagnosed during adolescence, remaining unaware of this potential diagnosis until seeking treatment for infertility (see Section 1.1 in the Technical Report). Adult physicians and reproductive endocrinologists also expressed significant concern over delayed diagnosis. All GDGs highlighted the need to acknowledge 'risk' yet avoid over-diagnosis or premature labelling. Another practice point for this section is that, in adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles and 'at risk', the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the adolescent and their families, considering all diagnostic challenges at this life stage as well as psychosocial and cultural factors.

Cardiovascular health: metabolic dysfunction and glycemic outcomes in PCOS — Life-long metabolic dysfunction in women with PCOS exaggerates CVD risk with aging, based upon insulin resistance that occurs in most women with PCOS; beginning in adolescence, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent with odds ratio approximately 4:1 and occur in about 40% of women with PCOS by the fourth decade of life, with age and weight gain worsening glycemic control.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — incidence, definition, and diagnostic criteria emphasize that there is no universally accepted definition of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and multiple expert-generated criteria exist; the Rotterdam criteria incorporated ultrasound appearance of the ovary, the Androgen Excess Society (AES) criteria recognize hyperandrogenism as necessary, secondary causes should first be excluded, diagnostic schemes require more than one sign or symptom, polycystic ovaries alone are a nonspecific finding, and insulin resistance is not included in any diagnostic criteria. Prevalence varies by criteria: women meeting National Institutes of Health (NIH) hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation criteria make up approximately 7% of reproductive-aged women; the broader Rotterdam criteria increase prevalence in women with normogonadotropic anovulation to 91% from 55% using the NIH criteria; there are no significant differences in the prevalence of hirsutism or elevated circulating androgen levels between white and black women; and prevalence according to AES criteria will fall between these values.

Adolescent menstrual cycle maturation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — In adolescents, anovulation is frequent, with 85% of menstrual cycles are anovulatory during the first year after menarche, and up to 59% of cycles are still anovulatory during the third year after menarche. With aging in PCOS, women with PCOS appear to gain more regular cycles as they approach menopause; cycle irregularity improves with increasing age, and it has been hypothesized that women with PCOS may have a longer reproductive life span.

Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic suggestions: During adolescence, a positive diagnosis of PCOS should require all elements of the Rotterdam consensus (and not just two out of three). It may be better to define hyperandrogenism as hyperandrogenemia and discount clinical findings such as acne and alopecia, with the exception of documented progressive hirsutism. Oligo-amenorrhea should be present for at least 2 years, and the diagnosis of polycystic ovaries by abdominal ultrasound should also include increased ovarian volume (> 10 cm3). Thus, the diagnosis of PCOS should be considered only in girls who had menarche at least 2 years before diagnosis. By use of these parameters, clinicians may confirm the diagnosis PCOS only in adolescents who have hyperandrogenism, oligo-amenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, and when the diagnosis cannot be confirmed, the patients should be observed closely until adulthood. For ovarian-size context in adolescents, maximal ovarian size is expected to occur 1.25 to 3.8 years after menarche.

Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescence — chronic anovulation and menstrual irregularities: Chronic anovulation and menstrual irregularities are very common in adolescence, with approximately 40% to 50% of adolescent girls having anovulatory cycles; the prevalence of ovulatory cycles increases from 23% to 35% during the first year after menarche to 63% to 65% in the fifth year after menarche. In a cohort assessed at ages 15 and 18 years, persistent oligomenorrhea was not predicted by increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH), increased androgens, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, yet it was present in 43% of girls with normal androgen levels, 40% with normal LH levels, and 44% with normal-appearing ovaries on ultrasound; increased body mass index (BMI) was the major risk factor for persistence of anovulation, and elevated testosterone and polycystic ovaries — but not increased LH — were predictive of persistence at age 18.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome underdiagnosis patterns by individual-level and spatial social vulnerability measures [^339ef88c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinology among reproductive-aged women, contributes a significant economic and health burden through its effects on reproductive, metabolic, and psychosocial health. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated to be between 6% and 12% in the United States. In 2020 alone, PCOS was associated with healthcare costs of ∼$8 billion in the United States. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in reproductive-aged women, and women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its associated comorbidities, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, throughout their life course.

Despite potential serious implications, many women who meet diagnostic criteria for PCOS remain undiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis. The Rotterdam Criteria for diagnosis, established in 2003, requires 2 out of the 3 cardinal features of PCOS: irregular menstruation, symptoms of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism) or lab tests for biochemical androgen excess, and the presence of ovarian cysts on transvaginal ultrasound. According to current guidelines, if a provider suspects a patient has PCOS, they will inquire about relevant symptoms including menstrual cycle irregularity, hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss, and weight gain. If PCOS is suspected but not confirmed symptomatically, after ruling out other endocrinopathies that present with similar symptoms, a provider may order a test for biochemical hyperandrogenemia or a pelvic ultrasound to check for polycystic ovarian morphology to confirm diagnosis. After receiving a PCOS diagnosis, a patient ideally receives access to counseling around menstrual and uterine health, information about potential comorbidities and prevention strategies, and tailored fertility care during periods of attempted conception.

Reproductive features of PCOS

Ovarian dysfunction and infertility

Ovarian dysfunction usually manifests as oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea resulting from chronic oligo-ovulation/anovulation. However, prolonged anovulation can lead to dysfunctional uterine bleeding which may mimic more regular menstrual cycles. The majority of PCOS patients have ovarian dysfunction, with 70% to 80% of women with PCOS presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea. Among those with oligomenorrhoea, 80% to 90% will be diagnosed with PCOS. Among those with amenorrhoea, only 40% will be diagnosed with PCOS as hypothalamic dysfunction is a more common cause. Oligomenorrhoea occurs usually in adolescence, with onset later in life often associated with weight gain. Menstrual irregularity is then often masked by the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), until cessation, when the underlying irregular cycles recur. Menorrhagia can occur with unopposed oestrogen and endometrial hyperplasia, further exacerbated by elevated oestrogen levels in obesity. Whilst inadequate research exists, it is generally recommended that greater than four cycles per year may protect the endometrium. Women with regular menstrual cycles can also now be diagnosed with PCOS based on newer diagnostic criteria (Table 1).

PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. It accounts for 90% to 95% of women attending infertility clinics with anovulation. However 60% of women with PCOS are fertile (defined as the ability to conceive within 12 months), although time to conceive is often increased. In those with PCOS and infertility, 90% are overweight. Obesity independently exacerbates infertility, reduces efficacy of infertility treatment and induces a greater risk of miscarriage. There is currently an active debate about the appropriate limit for body mass index for assisted reproduction therapies, given the reduced success rates and the demonstrated risks of pregnancy in overweight women. Ideally, weight should be optimised prior to pregnancy. Age-related infertility also exacerbates infertility and timely planning of families may warrant discussion.

Diagnosis

The controversies of diagnosing adolescents with PCOS are compounded by a reliance on 95th centiles cut-off points for menstrual cycles or hirsutism, which are not diagnostic of pathology and are derived from highly variable populations and relatively poor-quality data. Additionally, there is a lack of available outcome data on the long-term health impact of PCOS in conditions such as diabetes. Moving forward, there is a need for greater research into how the confluence of diagnostic factors can be separated out to establish a clear clinical syndrome and how these factors predict short- and long-term adverse health outcomes, with studies in this area now underway.

Diagnosis relied on strong consensus recommendations and aimed to avoid delayed, under- or over-diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. The criteria included a clear definition of irregular menstrual cycles according to time post menarche and clinical hyperandrogenism, including severe acne and hirsutism and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, after exclusion of other conditions that mimic PCOS. The use of pelvic ultrasound for diagnosis in females less than 8 years post menarche should be avoided due to the overlap with normal pubertal physiology, the lack of specificity of polycystic ovarian morphology for PCOS diagnosis in this age group and the avoidance of transvaginal ultrasound in those not yet sexually active. AMH was not recommended for a diagnosis of PCOS due to a lack of evidence and apparent lack of specificity. Additionally, special considerations need to be given when assessing adolescents for PCOS; importantly, adolescents' and their family's preferences and cultural norms should be included in decision-making.

The Guideline recommends recognising adolescents 'at risk'. The potential for over-diagnosis is minimised by the narrowed diagnostic criteria; however, there is also respectful recognition of the need to avoid delayed and missed diagnosis and a poor diagnosis experience. As such, reassessment is recommended at 3 years post menarche in relation to menstrual irregularity and at 8 years post menarche in relation to the use of pelvic ultrasound to review the polycystic ovarian morphology. This approach recognises a group of adolescents with only one symptom cluster as 'at risk' of PCOS, enabling a focus on symptom management whilst avoiding premature labelling and recommending subsequent follow-up.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — disagreement and research needs for menstrual disturbance: Disagreement remains about the time needed before regular menstrual cycles occur in young women and the extent to which irregular menses (especially amenorrhea) are a source of psychological morbidity and/or decreased quality of life. Knowledge Gaps/Recommended Future Research include uncertainty about the extent to which severity of menstrual disturbance is associated with PCOS severity, the natural history and progression of menstrual irregularity in PCOS, whether PCOS patients have a longer reproductive life span, and how often oligomenorrheic or amenorrheic women ovulate.

Adolescence — consensus conclusions (agreement) emphasize that criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents differ from those used for older women of reproductive age (level B), that groups at risk (e.g., obese, hirsute, irregular menses) should be identified but physicians should be cautious of overdiagnosing PCOS (level B), and that individual PCOS manifestations in adolescents (e.g., obesity, hirsutism, irregular menses) (level B) should be treated.
