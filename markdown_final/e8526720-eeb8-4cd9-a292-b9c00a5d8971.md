## Question

What oral antibiotic can I send a patient home on when they were on zosyn?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to choose an appropriate oral antibiotic to send a patient home on after they have received intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indication and whether an IV-to-oral switch is appropriate. Then, I should verify the patient's stability and readiness for discharge. Next, I will review culture and susceptibility results to guide narrowing. After that, I need to match oral options to the spectrum and pharmacokinetics required by the infection site and severity. I should also consider special populations and stewardship constraints. Finally, I will outline monitoring, duration, and concrete oral regimen examples with caveats and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indication and whether an IV-to-oral transition is appropriate, because piperacillin-tazobactam is broad-spectrum and used for diverse infections such as intra-abdominal infection, skin and soft tissue infection, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and complicated urinary tract infection. The oral choice must align with the site of infection, likely pathogens, and severity, and I should not assume a single oral agent will suffice across all scenarios [^113XTchg] [^111dE3CL] [^1144icsw].

> Wait, let me verify the patient's clinical stability before considering discharge on oral therapy. I need to ensure hemodynamic stability, defervescence or improving fever curve, ability to tolerate and absorb oral medications, and adequate source control, because guidelines emphasize that oral step-down is appropriate once the patient is clinically improving, hemodynamically stable, source control is addressed, and an effective oral agent with activity against the identified pathogen is available [^111Hu8AB] [^115EJrG2].

> I will now examine the microbiology and susceptibilities, since de-escalation hinges on culture results. If cultures are negative, I should consider the most likely pathogens based on the clinical syndrome and local antibiograms, but if cultures are positive, I must select an oral agent active against the specific organism(s), paying close attention to ESBL or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales where piperacillin-tazobactam may underperform despite in vitro susceptibility and where carbapenems or targeted oral agents are preferred when active [^115rp3Xo] [^114sctJP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about spectrum. I need to ensure the oral regimen matches the infection site's requirements, including anaerobic coverage for intra-abdominal infections, antipseudomonal activity when indicated, and adequate tissue penetration for the involved organ system, because oral options with comparable breadth are limited and some syndromes require combination oral therapy or continuation of IV therapy if no suitable oral agent exists [^112P6LMn] [^112TPsLv].

> Let me consider specific oral options and their limitations. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a common step-down for intra-abdominal infections and some SSTIs when susceptibility allows, fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin are useful for complicated UTI/pyelonephritis and some respiratory infections but should be reserved for susceptible pathogens due to resistance and safety concerns, metronidazole can be paired to add anaerobic coverage when needed, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an option for susceptible Enterobacterales UTI, whereas agents like nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are inappropriate for pyelonephritis or bacteremia because they do not achieve adequate renal parenchymal and systemic levels [^112xZtgT] [^112TPsLv] [^11642ttZ].

> But wait, what if the patient had severe infection or bacteremia? I should confirm whether early switch to oral therapy is supported in that context. Recent data suggest that clinically stable patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia can be safely switched to appropriate oral therapy around day 4 if they meet stability criteria and have an active oral option, and similarly, left-sided endocarditis patients stabilized on IV therapy had noninferior outcomes when switched to oral therapy, reinforcing that route can be flexed when carefully selected and monitored [^116vT8Jq] [^1152W5uJ].

> I need to check special populations and constraints. In renal impairment, I should adjust the total planned antibiotic dose and interval for renally cleared oral agents, in older adults I should account for sodium load from prior piperacillin-tazobactam and consider drug–drug interactions, in pediatrics I should weight-base dosing and confirm pediatric data for the oral switch, and in pregnancy I must avoid teratogenic agents such as fluoroquinolones. Additionally, I should avoid simply defaulting to a fluoroquinolone for convenience given stewardship and adverse effect concerns, and I must document the rationale for the IV-to-oral switch to support appropriate use [^112PdapP] [^11192q5R] [^113c2vU1].

> Next, I should review stewardship principles to avoid overuse. I must ensure the oral regimen is the narrowest effective option, confirm that the total duration is evidence-based and not unnecessarily prolonged, and arrange close follow-up within 48–72 hours to assess clinical response, adherence, and adverse effects, because programs that mandate early IV-to-oral conversion and structured follow-up reduce length of stay, costs, and line-related complications without compromising outcomes [^113c2vU1] [^116iqQEj].

> Let me think about concrete oral regimens with examples. For intra-abdominal infection with adequate source control and susceptible flora, amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg orally twice daily is reasonable, adding metronidazole 500 mg orally every 8 hours if anaerobic coverage is specifically needed, for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis with susceptible pathogens, ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg orally twice daily or levofloxacin 750 mg orally once daily for 5–7 days can be used, and for SSTIs such as animal bites, amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line. Conversely, if Pseudomonas was the target and is now confirmed susceptible, I should confirm whether any oral agent will suffice, and if not, I may need OPAT or a narrower IV regimen rather than forcing an inadequate oral choice [^112xZtgT] [^11642ttZ] [^114gfxEA] [^113nXuxT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought moxifloxacin might cover Pseudomonas and serve as a convenient oral monotherapy for intra-abdominal infections. Hold on, I should verify that because moxifloxacin lacks reliable antipseudomonal activity and should not be used when Pseudomonas coverage is required, so I need to correct that assumption and avoid substituting moxifloxacin for antipseudomonal needs despite its anaerobic activity [^117V1x89].

> I should double-check duration and monitoring plans. Total therapy should align with syndrome-based guidance, for example many intra-abdominal infections require about 5–7 days when source control is achieved, complicated UTI/pyelonephritis typically 7–14 days depending on bacteremia and clinical response, and pneumonia often 7 days with extension for slow response. I need to ensure the patient receives clear return precautions for fever, worsening pain, vomiting, or new diarrhea, and I should arrange early outpatient reassessment to confirm clinical trajectory and adherence [^11642ttZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation captures the indication for IV piperacillin-tazobactam, the clinical rationale for the IV-to-oral switch including stability criteria met, the culture and susceptibility data that justify de-escalation, the chosen oral regimen with dose, frequency, and duration, and the follow-up plan, because this supports antimicrobial stewardship, facilitates continuity of care, and provides medico-legal clarity for the transition decision [^113c2vU1].

For patients stable on IV piperacillin-tazobactam, **amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred oral step-down** when the pathogen is susceptible and anaerobic coverage is needed [^117M4XXW] [^112TPsLv]. If Pseudomonas or ESBL coverage is required, **ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are appropriate oral options** if susceptible [^113nXuxT] [^115rp3Xo]. For MRSA risk, add doxycycline or TMP-SMX to the oral regimen [^117M4XXW]. Ensure clinical stability, confirm susceptibilities, and adjust for renal function before discharge [^111Hu8AB] [^112PdapP].

---

## General principles for oral antibiotic selection

- **Clinical stability**: The patient must be hemodynamically stable, afebrile for at least 24 hours, and able to tolerate oral medications [^111Hu8AB].

- **Susceptibility data**: Confirm microbiological results to ensure the oral agent covers the identified pathogen(s) [^115rp3Xo].

- **Renal function**: Adjust dosing for renal impairment to avoid toxicity [^112PdapP].

- **Allergy history**: Avoid beta-lactams in patients with documented severe hypersensitivity reactions [^113Rz7XT].

## Recommended oral antibiotic alternatives

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended oral antibiotic(s)** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| General step-down (covers Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobes) | Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID | - Broad-spectrum oral beta-lactam <br/> - Suitable for many infections previously treated with piperacillin-tazobactam [^117M4XXW] [^113MyEiv] |
| Pseudomonas coverage (if susceptible) | Ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO BID or levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily | - Oral fluoroquinolones with antipseudomonal activity <br/> - Use only if susceptibility is confirmed [^113nXuxT] [^111Hu8AB] |
| MRSA coverage (add to regimen if indicated) | Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID or TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets PO BID | Effective oral agents for MRSA coverage [^114gfxEA]. |
| ESBL-producing organisms (if susceptible) | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin <br/> - TMP-SMX | - Oral agents with activity against ESBL producers <br/> - Use only if susceptibility is confirmed [^115rp3Xo] [^113u3k1t] |
| Anaerobic coverage (if continued is needed) | Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID or amoxicillin-clavulanate | Effective oral agents for anaerobic coverage [^117M4XXW]. |

## Clinical scenarios and specific recommendations

### Intra-abdominal infections

For intra-abdominal infections, **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID** is appropriate if the patient is clinically stable and susceptibility data support its use [^112TPsLv]. If Pseudomonas was covered initially and remains a concern, **ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO BID** is an option if susceptibility is confirmed [^notfound].

---

### Skin and soft tissue infections

For skin and soft tissue infections, **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID** is appropriate if MRSA is not a concern [^114gfxEA]. If MRSA risk is present, add **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID** or **TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets PO BID** to the regimen [^117M4XXW].

---

### Respiratory tract infections

For respiratory tract infections, **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID** is appropriate if the patient is clinically stable and susceptibility data support its use [^notfound]. If Pseudomonas coverage is needed, **ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO BID** or **levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily** are options if susceptibility is confirmed [^notfound].

---

### Complicated urinary tract infections

For complicated urinary tract infections, **ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO BID** or **levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily** are appropriate if susceptibility is confirmed [^11642ttZ]. If the patient cannot tolerate fluoroquinolones, **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID** is an alternative if susceptibility supports its use [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing for renal function to avoid accumulation and toxicity [^112PdapP].

- **Allergy history**: Avoid beta-lactams in patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions [^113Rz7XT].

- **Drug interactions**: Review concomitant medications for potential interactions, especially with fluoroquinolones and anticoagulants [^111y5tWZ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Arrange **close follow-up** within 48–72 hours to assess clinical response and adherence. Monitor for **adverse effects**, including gastrointestinal upset, rash, and C. difficile infection [^115tbNaz]. Emphasize **adherence** to ensure completion of the prescribed course [^11192q5R].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: Preferred oral step-down for most infections previously treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, if clinically stable and susceptibility data support its use [^notfound].

- **Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin**: Appropriate for infections requiring Pseudomonas or ESBL coverage, if susceptibility is confirmed [^117V1x89] [^115rp3Xo].

- **Doxycycline or TMP-SMX**: Add for MRSA coverage if indicated [^117M4XXW].

- **Metronidazole**: Use for continued anaerobic coverage if needed [^113nXuxT].

---

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the **preferred oral step-down** for patients stable on IV piperacillin-tazobactam, with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin for Pseudomonas or ESBL coverage if susceptible. Ensure clinical stability, confirm susceptibilities, and adjust for renal function before discharge [^111Hu8AB].

Personalised AST did not facilitate more Access oral step-downs

The personalised approach provided at least one susceptible Access category result for patients prescribed a Watch category agent in 386 instances, compared to 618 instances using the standard approach — this difference was mainly due to the presence of gentamicin on the standard panel, an Access agent with a relatively low rate of resistance in this dataset (see Supplementary Data 1). The personalised approach provided susceptible results for Access category agents with oral routes of administration (ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin) for patients on parenteral-only agents (ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, meropenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and cefazolin) with a similar frequency to the standard approach (648 cases versus 669).

Antibiotic therapy, follow-up, and outcomes assessment

Initial empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in the emergency department in accordance with participating hospitals' guidelines, which recommend the administration of a β-lactam agent with or without a macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Initial empirical combination antimicrobial therapy was recommended for patients with severe CAP and/or those without any positive microbiological test. Levofloxacin monotherapy was indicated for Legionella pneumonia and for selected patients such as those with β-lactam allergy. Carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam and cefipime were considered broad-spectrum antibiotics. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics were generally considered when penicillin or ceftriaxone was used. All decisions regarding empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, de-escalation, switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, and duration of treatment were made by the attending clinicians. The investigators were not involved in any decisions regarding antibiotic treatment.

All participants were seen daily during their hospital stay by their attending physicians and by at least one of the study investigators. The investigators recorded all outcome measures. DOTs were calculated as the days elapsed from the initial dose of antimicrobial until the last dose of antimicrobial therapy for the CAP episode. The DOT for a given patient on multiple antibiotics was the sum of DOT for each antibiotic that the patient received. All antibiotics administered to patients for an episode of CAP and its related complications were included in the primary endpoint calculation. A new treatment for CAP was considered if there was an interruption in antibiotic therapy lasting more than 48 h. Antimicrobial de-escalation was considered when a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment regimen was replaced with narrower-spectrum antimicrobials or when one or more initial combination empiric antimicrobials were discontinued. Participants attended an outpatient visit 30 days after hospital discharge. The investigators recorded readmissions for any reason or death from any cause in the 30 days after randomisation. The information was obtained from specific searches of hospital databases and was checked by asking patients at the outpatient visit 30 days after hospital discharge. For patients who did not attend this outpatient visit, a structured telephone interview was used to assess outcomes. Adverse events were recorded in all patients who received at least one dose of antibiotic therapy. All adverse events were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The study was monitored by the IDIBELL Clinical Research and Clinical Trials Unit. All data were recorded on a secure web application for building and managing databases (REDCap). The study endpoints were assessed by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which was blinded to study group and patient identity.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114sctJP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

"I wouldn't have felt comfortable with that [being treated at home], maybe because I had the extra bit with oxygen but I felt happier where I was, with the risk of anything happening". (Int 11, 470)

".it was just nice to know that if anything had gone wrong, I was in a hospital. I don't know if everybody feels the same when they've got pneumonia, but I was definitely in a lot of pain, so I would have rather been in the hospital for them to be able to check on me. Because at home, I just, I think I would probably worry even more if I was at home with it". (Int 11, 629)

Participants did not routinely refer to their experiences of treatment as a reason for their preferences but all of the 5 patients who had received IV antibiotics and oxygen in their first 24 hours of hospital stated a preference for hospital care. It is possible that treatment type may have influenced patients' perceptions of how ill they were and subsequently their beliefs about the most appropriate site of care.

". depends if you're needing oxygen, are they going to give you oxygen at home? " (Int 7, 1144)

"if you were at home, you wouldn't get the various drugs as quickly. whereas in a hospital you've got everything, haven't you? It doesn't matter what happens. They've got it on hand". (Int 3, 424)

Conversely, those patients that received oral antibiotics saw no added benefit to hospital and stated a clear preference for home.

". well, what I was doing in hospital I could do at home, I mean I was only resting there and taking my pills". (Int 8, 630)

Those patients that had previously self-managed acute exacerbations of an existing lung condition at home had a better understanding of the treatments and support they could access at home and appeared more confident to manage treatments such as nebulisers at home.

### Associations of facility-level antibiotic use and hospital-onsetinfection in US acute-care hospitals, 2012–2018 [^1113smpP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used adult hospital discharge and inpatient charge records for antibiotic use, CDI tests and treatment from ACHs contributing to the Premier Healthcare Database from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. A case of HO-CDI was defined as a hospital discharge with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code specifying enterocolitis due to Clostridioides difficile (ICD-9 008.45 or ICD-10 A04.7, A04.71, or A04.72) in any secondary diagnostic position and inpatient treatment with metronidazole (parenteral or oral), fidaxomicin, or vancomycin (oral) initiated on hospital day 3 or later after admission. Facility-level monthly rates of HO-CDI were calculated per 10,000 patient days (PD). Hospital antibiotic use was measured by days of therapy (DOT) per 1,000 PD and examined through monthly rates of total antibiotic use and use of 7 antibiotic classes: fluoroquinolones, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (cephalosporins), piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination (excluding piperacillin-tazobactam), clindamycin, and penicillins. In addition, we evaluated combined use of 3 high-risk antibiotic classes: fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and carbapenems.

### Non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children, why not? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114UoixQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The three studies included in the present meta-analyses used, as NOM, intravenous therapy with meropenem combined with metronidazole (n = 2) or piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 1) for at least 48 h. Subsequently, the intravenous therapies were switched to oral ciprofloxacin combined with oral metronidazole for an additional 5–8 days. One potential concern may relate to the risk of Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI), a serious antibiotic-related complication that has been reported among children undergoing treatment for appendicitis. A retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System has recently reported that only 0.2% of the nearly 106,000 patients developed CDI, suggesting that this event is rare. Furthermore, the antibiotic treatment duration is a key issue. Indeed, evidence is now available showing that prolonged antibiotic treatment can lead to the emergence of resistant bacteria. Accordingly, local antibiotic protocols have been established in some centers for the optimization of treatments for pediatric acute appendicitis. For instance, Surlemont et al. have proposed that to limit antibiotic overuse, treatment should not exceed 48 h for uncomplicated appendicitis, eventually prolonged to 5 days for perforated appendicitis/peritonitis.

Another important matter of concern is represented by the selection of the antibiotic to be given intravenously. All the 3 studies used carbapenems with broad spectrum, namely meropenem and the combination piperacillin/tazobactam, whereas most of the antimicrobial stewardship programs now suggest the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic combinations (i.e. ceftriaxone/metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate) for the treatment of appendicitis to limit the increasing prevalence of multidrug resistance. It must be, indeed, considered that in most European countries (such as Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain) the presence of carbapenems-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has become a serious life-threatening condition, and carbapenem-sparing regimens have been advocated. Thus, meropenem should not be considered as the first treatment option in countries with a high rate of resistance to carbapenems. Worthy of mention, some recent studies have confirmed the optimal clinical efficacy and safety of amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children. Accordingly, short-term therapy with this combined regimen should be considered as first-line treatment for uncomplicated peritonitis in children.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^113u4pih]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) coverage is guided by on-admission risk factors and mortality risk. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known), or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA; when empiric coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, and oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for empiric coverage of HAP if one of the above agents is used (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA was chosen in an effort to balance the need for effective initial antibiotic therapy against the risks of excessive antibiotic use; when implementing these recommendations, individual units may elect to modify this threshold.

### Oral antibiotics with early hospital discharge compared with in-patient intravenous antibiotics for low-risk febrile neutropenia in patients with cancer: a prospective randomised controlled single centre study [^1168aDsG]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Neutropenic sepsis remains a potentially life-threatening complication of anticancer chemotherapy. However, it is possible to identify patients who are at low risk for serious complications and for whom less-intensive, more-convenient treatment may be appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics in conjunction with early hospital discharge in comparison with standard in-patient intravenous antibiotics in patients with low-risk neutropenic fever. In all, 126 episodes of low-risk neutropenic fever occurred in 102 patients. Patients were randomised to receive either: an oral regimen of ciprofloxacin (750 mg 12 hourly) plus amoxicillin-clavulanate (675 mg 8 hourly) for a total of 5 days, or a standard intravenous regimen of gentamicin and tazocin (piperacillin/tazobactam) until hospital discharge. Patients randomised to oral antibiotics were eligible for discharge following 24 h of hospitalisation, if clinically stable and symptomatically improved. The efficacy of the two arms was similar: initial treatment was successful without antibiotic modification in 90% of episodes in the intravenous arm and 84.8% of episodes in the oral arm, P = 0.55, absolute difference between the groups 5.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference -7 to 17.3%. Only one episode in the oral arm was associated with significant clinical deterioration: this occurred within the initial in-patient assessment period. The median in-patient stay was 4 days in the intravenous arm (range 2–8) and 2 days in the oral arm (range 1–16 days), P < 0.0005. The reduction in hospital stay led to significant cost-savings in the oral arm. In conclusion, this study suggests that oral antibiotics in conjunction with early hospital discharge for patients who remain stable after a 24 h period of in-patient monitoring offers a feasible and cost-effective alternative to conventional management of low-risk neutropenic fever.

### Oral antibiotics with early hospital discharge compared with in-patient intravenous antibiotics for low-risk febrile neutropenia in patients with cancer: a prospective randomised controlled single centre study [^116LZE7D]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The success rate without modification of the initial antibiotic regimen of the oral arm of this study was similar to the intravenous arm, 84.8 and 90%, respectively. These success rates are consistent with those of the largest open-label study, which has demonstrated equivalence of oral antibiotics compared with intravenous treatment in the in-patient setting. In our study, there was some evidence that clinicians were more confident of the intravenous regimen than the oral regimen. Firstly, there was an excess of failures in the oral arm due solely to persistent fever in the absence of clinical deterioration or resistance (Table 3). In addition, there was a greater number of patients in the intravenous arm who remained as in-patients beyond 4 days than one might have anticipated, given the 90% success rate of this arm. The majority of these patients had not been discharged because they did not fulfil the criteria for discharge of a rising neutrophil count. However, we identified five episodes in which patients had remained pyrexial for more than 72 h without antibiotic modification due to clinical well being. There were no such episodes in the oral arm. Hence, the success rate of the intravenous arm may have been somewhat overestimated.

More importantly, we encountered no significant problems with safety of the oral antibiotics and early discharge strategy: only one patient receiving oral antibiotics had significant clinical deterioration and this occurred within the initial 24-h mandatory monitoring period. However, we acknowledge that given the relatively small size of this study, there was limited power to detect small but clinically important differences in safety. In addition, in our study, all patients fulfilled strict entry criteria including good history of compliance and supportive home environment with continued contact by telephone with the specialist centre after discharge and rapid access for readmission to the centre in the event of deterioration. In view of this, our follow-up programme was less stringent than recently published guidelines suggest. Although there are presently no evidence-based criteria for optimal monitoring of patients postdischarge, we believe that more robust follow-up guidelines should be considered in the setting of less-specialised centres or multicentre trials.

Methods

Overview of the guidelines

FN was defined as per NICE guidelines(neutrophils ≤ 0.5×10⁹ /L and either fever ≥ 38°C or clinical evidence of sepsis). It was recommended that all patients (both inpatient and outpatient) with FN received first-line intravenous antibiotics, as per local policy within 1 hour of arrival to hospital or inpatient febrile episode. The patient's AUS rule score was used to determine the minimum recommended period of intravenous antibiotics and inpatient observation (table 1). After initial inpatient treatment, children who met all eligibility criteria in table 1 could be discharged to a homecare programme.

Table 1
AUS rule variables and homecare eligibility criteria

Homecare involved treatment with oral antibiotics, parents taking their child's temperature every 4–6 hours when awake and daily clinical reviews via telephone until antibiotics were stopped. Prior to discharge, patients and their families received education about the homecare programme and must have tolerated one dose of oral antibiotics.

The suggested oral antibiotic regimen was ciprofloxacin plus co-amoxiclav (or clarithromycin if allergic to penicillin). Antibiotics could be stopped if that patient was clinically well; had been apyrexial (temperature < 38°C) for at least 24 hours; had negative blood cultures and the absence of a need for rationalising and/or continuation of antibiotics. Reasons for further medical review and/or admission are given in online supplemental table 1.

The CCLG low-risk FN programme modified the implementation toolkit from Melbourne. The guidance provided centres and clinicians with the option to adapt the recommendations based on local practice and service pressures. Children with homecare eligible episodes were not mandated to be sent home after the recommended period of observation and treating team discretion was included in the eligibility criteria.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric antibiotic selection uses a four-step approach: "Assess (1) severity of illness, (2) risk factors for resistance, (3) patient-specific considerations, and (4) if septic, consider the antibiogram". For sepsis with or without shock, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * carbapenems,# piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones&" with alternatives "Novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors,+ cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an IV route, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones&" and alternatives are "Carbapenems,# newer agents (novel beta lactams-beta lactamase inhibitors,† cefiderocol, plazomicin), or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an oral route, preferred therapy is "Fluoroquinolones& or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole" with alternatives "Amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral cephalosporins (see Table 3.1)". Sepsis is described as "identified by SOFA score of 2 or higher" and screening tools "may be useful"; in step 4 choose antibiotics with susceptibilities "at least 90%" for sepsis with shock and "at least 80%" for sepsis without shock. The page also notes that "Difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens may require use of drugs not listed here (e.g., colistin); refer to IDSA Antimicrobial Resistance guidance" and that "nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are generally not appropriate choices for cUTI because they may not achieve adequate levels in renal parenchyma and blood".

### Tazobactam sodium and piperacillin sodium (Zosyn) [^111pdpLN]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.6	Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.7	Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

5.8 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZOSYN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.9	Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing ZOSYN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Fosfomycin for injection (ZTI-01) versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection including acute pyelonephritis: ZEUS, A phase 2 / 3 randomized trial [^117PgEvR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

ZTI-01 (fosfomycin for injection) is an epoxide antibiotic with a differentiated mechanism of action (MOA) inhibiting an early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis. ZTI-01 has broad in vitro spectrum of activity, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, and is being developed for treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP) in the United States.

Methods

Hospitalized adults with suspected or microbiologically confirmed cUTI/AP were randomized 1:1 to 6 g ZTI-01 q8h or 4.5 g intravenous (IV) piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) q8h for a fixed 7-day course (no oral switch); patients with concomitant bacteremia could receive up to 14 days.

Results

Of 465 randomized patients, 233 and 231 were treated with ZTI-01 and PIP-TAZ, respectively. In the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (m-MITT) population, ZTI-01 met the primary objective of noninferiority compared with PIP-TAZ with overall success rates of 64.7% (119/184 patients) vs 54.5% (97/178 patients), respectively; treatment difference was 10.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.4, 20.8). Clinical cure rates at test of cure (TOC, day 19–21) were high and similar between treatments (90.8% [167/184] vs 91.6% [163/178], respectively). In post hoc analysis using unique pathogens typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, overall success rates at TOC in m-MITT were 69.0% (127/184) for ZTI-01 versus 57.3% (102/178) for PIP-TAZ (difference 11.7% 95% CI: 1.3, 22.1). ZTI-01 was well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events, including hypokalemia and elevated serum aminotransferases, were mild and transient.

Conclusions

ZTI-01 was effective for treatment of cUTI including AP and offers a new IV therapeutic option with a differentiated MOA for patients with serious Gram-negative infections.

### Piperacillin sodium (pipracil) [^1151mtfh]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Laboratory Tests

While piperacillin
possesses the characteristic low toxicity of the penicillin group
of antibiotics, periodic assessment of organ system functions, including
renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, during prolonged therapy is advisable.

All patients with gonorrhea
should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis.
Patients treated with piperacillin should have a follow-up serologic
test for syphilis after 3 months.

Drug Interactions

Aminoglycosides

The mixing
of piperacillin with an aminoglycoside in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the
aminoglycoside.

Vecuronium

When used
in the perioperative period, piperacillin has been implicated in the
prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium. Caution
is indicated when piperacillin is used perioperatively. In one controlled
clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including piperacillin, were
reported to prolong the action of vecuronium. Due to their similar
mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade
produced by any of the non-depolarizing muscle relaxants could be
prolonged in the presence of piperacillin.

Probenecid

The oral
combination of probenecid before intramuscular injection of PIPRACIL
produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.

Anticoagulants

Coagulation
parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly
during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral
anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation
system or the thrombocyte function.

Methotrexate

Piperacillin
sodium may reduce the excretion of methotrexate. Therefore, serum
levels of methotrexate should be monitored in patients to avoid drug
toxicity.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

As with other penicillins,
the administration of PIPRACIL may result in a false-positive reaction
for glucose in the urine using a copper-reduction method. It is recommended
that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be
used.

There
have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories
Platelia Aspergillus EIA test
in patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam injection who were subsequently
found to be free of Aspergillus infection. Cross-reactions with non- Aspergillus polysaccharides and polyfuranoses with the
Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test have been reported.

Therefore, positive test results in patients receiving piperacillin
should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic
methods.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^117NaStw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales has been debated. Gram-negative bacteria may express multiple ESBLs as well as AmpC beta-lactamases concomitantly, and can manifest other mechanisms of resistance, limiting the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam. On the other hand, the activity of beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin/tazobactam, is influenced by the "inoculum effect", an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic when the inoculum size is larger. A RCT conducted in patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales blood stream infections showed inferior results of piperacillin/tazobactam compared to carbapenems. Although piperacillin/tazobactam is not considered the first-choice antibiotic to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, it may be an option for IAIs with adequate source control when bacteria are susceptible (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L). A high dose or prolonged/continuous infusion should be prescribed to optimise pharmacokinetics (PK) targeting in critically ill patients.

### Oral antibiotics with early hospital discharge compared with in-patient intravenous antibiotics for low-risk febrile neutropenia in patients with cancer: a prospective randomised controlled single centre study [^1161YpMy]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics

Between February 1997 and August 2000 111 patients, representing 135 episodes of fever associated with neutropenia, consented to participate in the study. Of the 135 episodes evaluated, nine episodes were excluded from the analysis, seven in the intravenous arm and two in the oral arm. Eight failed to meet the inclusion criteria; four were not neutropenic, one did not have fever, one required intravenous fluids at the time of randomisation, one had received antibiotics within 7 days of being entered into the study and one was allergic to study drugs. The final patient withdrew consent prior to commencement of antibiotics. The remaining 126 eligible episodes occurred in 102 patients (87 patients randomised once, 10 twice, three three times, one four times and one six times).

Sixty eligible episodes of neutropenic fever were assigned to the intravenous regimen of gentamicin and tazocin and 66 were assigned to receive the oral regimen of ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin–clavulanate. Of the 102 first episodes of neutropenic fever (i.e. occurring in patients not previously randomised), 51 were in the oral and 51 in the intravenous arm. The arms were well balanced with respect to age, sex and primary site of cancer, Table 1

Table 1
Patient characteristics.

The majority of episodes occurred in women, reflecting the most frequent underlying diagnoses of breast cancer and small-cell lung cancer. Only 4.8% of episodes had a diagnosis of lymphoma, 92% of episodes had neutrophil counts of ≤ 0.5 × 10⁹ l⁻¹ at randomisation.

Clinical symptoms at randomisation were by definition mild to moderate (CTC grades I–II), Table 1. A total of 36.5% had no symptoms other than fever. Positive microbiological cultures are shown in Table 2

### Effect of meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam on clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication in complicated urinary tract infection: the TANGO I randomized clinical trial [^114umekd]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trial (TANGO I) conducted November 2014 to April 2016 and enrolling patients (≥ 18 years) with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276) every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they met prespecified criteria for improvement, to complete 10 days of total treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point for FDA criteria was overall success (clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication composite) at end of intravenous treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Primary end point for European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at test-of-cure visit in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. Prespecified noninferiority margin was -15%. Because the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the event of noninferiority, 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Among 550 patients randomized, 545 received study drug (mean age, 52.8 years; 361 [66.2%] women; 374 [68.6%] in the microbiologic modified ITT population; 347 [63.7%] in the microbiologic evaluable population; 508 [93.2%] completed the trial). For the FDA primary end point, overall success occurred in 189 of 192 (98.4%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 171 of 182 (94.0%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point, microbial eradication in the microbiologic modified ITT population occurred in 128 of 192 (66.7%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 105 of 182 (57.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 9.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001 for noninferiority); microbial eradication in the microbiologic evaluable population occurred in 118 of 178 (66.3%) vs 102 of 169 (60.4%) (difference, 5.9% [95% CI, -4.2% to 16.0%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). Adverse events were reported in 106 of 272 (39.0%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 97 of 273 (35.5%) with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis and growth of a baseline pathogen, meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in a composite outcome of complete resolution or improvement of symptoms along with microbial eradication that met the noninferiority criterion. Further research is needed to understand the spectrum of patients in whom meropenem-vaborbactam offers a clinical advantage.

### Investigation algorithms [^1142jNwP]. Pathway Editors (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Piperacillin/Tazobactam Dosage Calculator (non-pulmonary indications)" for acute appendicitis.

The Piperacillin/Tazobactam Dose Calculator for Non-Pulmonary Indications is a clinical tool used to determine the appropriate dosage of the antibiotic combination piperacillin/tazobactam for patients with various non-pulmonary infections. This calculator is specifically designed for use in adult patients who are not suffering from pulmonary conditions but require treatment with this antibiotic for other types of infections. The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to provide accurate and individualized dosing recommendations based on a patient's specific clinical parameters, such as body weight and renal function. This helps to optimize the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy while minimizing potential side effects. The calculator should not be used in patients with pulmonary infections, as the dosing requirements may differ. It is also not suitable for use in pediatric patients or in patients with severe renal impairment, as the dosing calculations may not be accurate in these populations.

The Piperacillin/tazobactam dose calculator is designed to provide dosage recommendations for non-pulmonary indications based on the patient's renal function. By assessing the level of kidney function, the calculator can tailor the medication dosage to ensure efficacy and safety in treatment.

The key inputs to this calculator are grouped into the following categories of renal function:

- Hemodialysis
- Creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 40 mL/min
- CrCl between 20–40 mL/min
- CrCl less than 20 mL/min

Based on the selected renal function category, the dosing recommendation is determined as follows:

1. For patients on Hemodialysis, the suggestion is to administer Piperacillin/tazobactam at a dose of 2.25 g intravenously every 12 hours. Additionally, on hemodialysis days, following each dialysis session, an extra dose of 0.75 g should be given.

2. If the patient's creatinine clearance is greater than 40 mL/min, the recommended dose is 3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours.

3. For creatinine clearance ranging from 20 to 40 mL/min, the dosage is set at 2.25 g intravenously every 6 hours.

4. When the creatinine clearance is less than 20 mL/min, the dosing schedule is adjusted to 2.25 g intravenously every 8 hours.

This strategic adjustment of dosage according to renal function is crucial for providing personalized medical care, ensuring that medications are both safe and effective while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with ZOSYN in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, ZOSYN was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with ZOSYN in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

### Successful reduction of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a urology ward: a 10-year study [^111auuT7]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Avoidance and reduction of AMP

The need for AMP generally depends on the surgical wound classification according to the CDC guidelines. Based on the CDC guidelines and several urology guidelines, we have gradually reduced AMP in urological surgeries for patients without infectious risk. In the pre-intervention period, patients routinely received intravenous second-generation cephalosporin for 3 to 5 days, followed by oral antibiotics for several days. Since April 2001, we have reduced the AMP step by step based on the surgical wound classification. In clean and clean-contaminated surgeries, patients received second-generation cephalosporin administered postoperatively for 2 to 3 days and immediately before the start of the operation. In clean urological surgeries, patients without infectious risk received AMP as follows: between August 2003 and August 2004: ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium immediately before the surgery; between September 2004 and September 2005: levofloxacin (LVFX) orally once immediately before the surgery; after October 2005: no AMP was administered. After we confirmed that perioperative infection had not increased, we extended the range of application of reducing AMP. In clean-contaminated urological surgeries, patients received AMP as follows: between January 2005 and September 2005: tazobactam sodium/piperacillin sodium (TAZ/PIPC) intravenously immediately before the surgery and for 3 days afterwards; between October 2005 and September 2006: TAZ/PIPC once immediately before the surgery; after October 2006: LVFX orally once immediately before the surgery. In the transurethral resection of bladder tumors, patients received AMP as follows: between April and September 2006: LVFX orally once immediately before the surgery; after October 2006: no AMP was administered. In contaminated urological surgeries using bowel segments, patients received cefmetazole on the operative day only, although prolonged operation and other morbidity risk factors may support the use of a prolonged regimen, which should be within three days according to the European Association of Urology guideline. If a perioperative infection was found, antibiotics were administered immediately according to the drug sensitivity profile of cultured pathogens.

Other than that, in the treatment of urinary tract infection, we use broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents as initial empiric therapy with the intent of covering multiple possible pathogens until microbiological results become available. Once the etiologic pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility data are available, we use an antibiotic with the narrowest possible spectrum.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam added to vancomycin increases risk for acute kidney injury: fact or fiction? [^111J7bdd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam are 2 of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in hospitals. Recent data from multiple meta-analyses suggest that the combination increases the risk for vancomycin-induced kidney injury when compared to alternative viable options. However, these studies are unable to prove biologic plausibility and causality as randomized controlled trials have not been performed. Furthermore, these studies define acute kidney injury according to thresholds of serum creatinine rise. Serum creatinine is not a direct indicator of renal injury, rather a surrogate of glomerular function. More reliable, specific, and sensitive biomarkers are needed to truly define if there is a causal relationship with increased toxicity when piperacillin-tazobactam is added to vancomycin. This viewpoint will explore the available evidence for and against increased acute kidney injury in the setting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam coadministration.

### Circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection of a 14-CM long-segment Barrett's esophagus with multifocal adenocarcinoma: a case report [^113L63GK]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome

Next day, the patient was discharged on levofloxacin and proton pump inhibitor. A week later, he was readmitted with chest pain; imaging revealed stents in place, and he was treated symptomatically. One month later, he returned with stent intolerance. Difficult extraction caused trauma and a small esophageal leak, necessitating placement of a new stent, treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), fluconazole, and total parenteral nutrition. Managed conservatively, he was discharged 8 days later with amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (Augmentin) and fluconazole. Four weeks later, EGD was performed to retrieve the stent, and an esophagram showed no residual leak. A long esophageal stricture developed and was successfully treated with 5 biweekly dilations, triamcinolone injections (1 mL/4 quadrants every 1 cm), and a 4-week course of prednisolone (30 mg). Despite the resolution of the stricture, the patient had poor oral intake and lost 13 kg. Mild depression was diagnosed, and mirtazapine (15 mg daily) was initiated to address both poor appetite and depression.

The patient is currently doing well, without dysphagia and a 14-kg weight gain, returning to baseline. He undergoes endoscopic surveillance with biopsies (4 quadrants every 1 cm) every 3 months, with no signs of recurrence. Six-month EUS showed no lymphadenopathy and a stable paraesophageal lymph node. At 1-year surveillance, CT was negative for recurrence. Over 18 months, he has had 11 EGDs in total.

### Antibiotics as first-line therapy for acute appendicitis: evidence for a change in clinical practice [^112ugMT7]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized studies have indicated that acute appendicitis may be treated by antibiotics without the need of surgery. However, concerns have been raised about selection bias of patients in such studies. Therefore, the present study was aimed to validate previous findings in randomized studies by a full-scale population-based application.

Methods

All patients with acute appendicitis at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (May 2009 and February 2010) were offered intravenous piperacillin plus tazobactam according to our previous experience, followed by 9 days out-hospital oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole. Endpoints were treatment efficacy and complications. Efficient antibiotic treatment was defined as recovery without the need of surgery beyond 1 year of follow-up.

Results

A total of 558 consecutive patients were hospitalized and treated due to acute appendicitis. Seventy-nine percent (n = 442) received antibiotics as first-line therapy and 20% (n = 111) had primary surgery as the second-line therapy. Seventy-seven percent of patients on primary antibiotics recovered while 23% (n = 100) had subsequent appendectomy due to failed initial treatment on antibiotics. Thirty-eight patients (11%) of the 342 had experienced recurrent appendicitis at 1-year follow-up. Primary antibiotic treatment had fewer complications compared to primary surgery.

Conclusions

This population-based study confirms previous results of randomized studies. Antibiotic treatment can be offered as the first-line therapy to a majority of unselected patients with acute appendicitis without medical drawbacks other than the unknown risk for long-term relapse, which must be weighed against the unpredicted but well-known risk for serious major complications following surgical intervention.

Overall, 14 FN episodes resulted in admission to ICU and 7 children died during that inpatient episode (2 of infection, 5 of other causes). No child eligible for homecare with AUS score 0–1 went to ICU or died within 7 days of the episode. No representation within 7 days of discharge resulted in ICU admission or death.

There were 172 (21%) FN episodes with at least one documented positive blood culture (excluding contaminants as defined by the treating team). One hundred ninety organisms were identified, of which 39% were Gram-negative organisms (58% enterobacterales, 15% Pseudomonas, 23% others and 4% unspecified), and 61% were Gram-positive (25% coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and 12% viridans streptococci) (online supplemental table 7). In children eligible for homecare, there were a total of 15 positive blood cultures (10 at initial presentation, 5 at representation); 5/15 (33%) were Gram-negative, but 8/15 (53%) were CoNS.

None of the criteria for stopping the project were met. A sensitivity analysis with one episode per patient, selected at random, did not show important differences in the core outcomes (online supplemental table 8).

### Tazobactam sodium and piperacillin sodium (Zosyn) [^112PdapP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Patients over 65 years are not at an increased risk of developing adverse effects solely because of age. However, dosage should be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

ZOSYN contains 65 mg (2.84 mEq) of sodium per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive between 780 and 1040 mg/day (34.1 and 45.5 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6	Renal Impairment

In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced to the degree of renal function impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

Dosage adjustment of ZOSYN is not warranted in patients with hepatic cirrhosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8	Patients with Cystic Fibrosis

As with other semisynthetic penicillins, piperacillin therapy has been associated with an increased incidence of fever and rash in cystic fibrosis patients.

### Effect of cefepime / enmetazobactam vs piperacillin / tazobactam on clinical cure and microbiological eradication in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis: a randomized clinical trial [^113ozfZZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cefepime/enmetazobactam is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination and a potential empirical therapy for resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate whether cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome of treatment efficacy in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) or acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority clinical trial conducted at 90 sites in Europe, North and Central America, South America, and South Africa. Recruitment occurred between September 24, 2018, and November 2, 2019. Final follow-up occurred November 26, 2019. Participants were adult patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative urinary pathogens.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to receive either cefepime, 2 g/enmetazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 520), or piperacillin, 4 g/tazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 521), by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days (up to 14 days in patients with a positive blood culture at baseline).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the primary analysis set (patients who received any amount of study drug with a baseline gram-negative pathogen not resistant to either treatment and ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL in urine culture or the same pathogen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures) who achieved overall treatment success (defined as clinical cure combined with microbiological eradication [< 10³ CFU/mL in urine] of infection). Two-sided 95% CIs were computed using the stratified Newcombe method. The prespecified noninferiority margin was -10%. If noninferiority was established, a superiority comparison was also prespecified.

Results

Among 1041 patients randomized (mean age, 54.7 years; 573 women [55.0%]), 1034 (99.3%) received study drug and 995 (95.6%) completed the trial. Among the primary analysis set, the primary outcome occurred in 79.1% (273/345) of patients receiving cefepime/enmetazobactam compared with 58.9% (196/333) receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (between-group difference, 21.2% [95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 50.0% (258/516) of patients treated with cefepime/enmetazobactam and 44.0% (228/518) with piperacillin/tazobactam; most were mild to moderate in severity (89.9% vs 88.6%, respectively). A total of 1.7% (9/516) of participants who received cefepime/enmetazobactam and 0.8% (4/518) of those who received piperacillin/tazobactam did not complete the assigned therapy due to adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Further research is needed to determine the potential role for cefepime/enmetazobactam in the treatment of complicated UTI and pyelonephritis.

### Increasing evidence of the nephrotoxicity of piperacillin / tazobactam and vancomycin combination therapy-what is the clinician to Do? [^1178MT7z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Early administration of appropriate empiric antibiotics is essential for achieving the best possible outcomes in sepsis. Yet the choice of antibiotic therapy has become more challenging due to recent reports of nephrotoxicity with the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the "workhorse" regimen at many institutions. In this article we assess the evidence for nephrotoxicity and its possible mechanisms, provide recommendations for risk mitigation, address the advantages and disadvantages of alternative antibiotic choices, and suggest areas for future research.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — S. aureus coverage and MRSA/MSSA selection is as follows: For patients being treated empirically for HAP, we recommend prescribing an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known, or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA, and when empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^112ZbpHr]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Appropriate use of antimicrobial agents: challenges and strategies for improvement [^116HmFmb]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The use of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy is common in intensive care unit patients and contributes to a number of poor outcomes. Selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy is complicated by many factors, including the large number of agents available, the presence of resistant organisms, and the general desire among practitioners to use the most focused therapy available. An important aspect of appropriate antimicrobial use is prompt initiation of adequate empirical therapy, which has been shown to improve mortality rates in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and other serious infections. Other key strategies include streamlining antimicrobial therapy when a pathogen is identified and switching from intravenous to oral therapy when clinically indicated. In addition, antibiotic rotation (or cycling) has been evaluated in several trials as a means to minimize resistance. Promoting appropriate antimicrobial therapy ultimately will require a multidisciplinary, system-oriented, institution-specific approach because each intensive care unit has its own unique flora and antimicrobial resistance patterns.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^112q5A1Z]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pip/Taz plays an important role as empiric therapy for serious infections post-surgery. Available clinical trials have marked the safety and efficacy of Pip/Taz monotherapy in the treatment of moderate to severe infections including bacteremia associated with post-operative nosocomial infections, intravenous line associated, nosocomial respiratory tract infections, febrile neutropenia, intra-abdominal and peritoneal infections, and complicated wound infections.

We attempted to prospectively study the journey the postoperative cardiac patient who is started on empiric Pip/taz and address the appropriateness of use of Pip/Taz in these patient and potential areas of improvement.

The empiric use of pip/taz as monotherapy was common in postoperative patients demonstrating signs of possible infection. The main reasons for initiating Pip/Taz was use was fever, or high level of white blood cells (WBCs). However potential for inappropriate use exists in complicated post-operative cardiac cases.

We were able to demonstrate the potential inappropriate use is this setting is a genuine concern.

Overall appropriate use was demonstrated in 55% of cases.

The common causes include inadequate initial work up, failure to adjust dosing and inappropriate de-escalation of antibiotics after the microbial culture results. At the time of initiation 12% of cases Pip/Taz use was inappropriate as the antibiotic was started without a culture and sensitivity test.

In a review of the literature. A study by Thomas 2015 addressed the duration of empiric antibiotic therapy in adult ICUs, 333 of 660 (50%) of the empiric antibiotics were continued for at least 72 h and half of all empiric antibiotics ordered in critically ill patients are continued for at least 72 h in absence of adjudicated infection.

### A prospective randomized trial to assess oral versus intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of postoperative wound infection after extremity fractures (POvIV study) [^112RL4ZS]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Patients surgically treated for infection after extremity fractures are typically discharged with a 6- to 12-week antibiotic regimen. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are associated with significant cost and potential complications of deep vein thrombosis, line clotting, and sepsis. Many of the pathogens that cause musculoskeletal infection have both oral (PO) and IV antibiotic options with adequate bioavailability and antibacterial effect, yet IV antibiotics remain the standard of care absent evidence that PO options are clinically as efficacious. The POvIV study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to compare PO with IV antibiotic therapy in patients with postoperative wound infections after extremity fractures. Patients between the ages of 18 and 84 who have a culture-positive surgical site infection after internal fixation for fracture repair or arthrodesis are approached for this study, and if they provide consent, are randomly assigned to receive either PO or IV antibiotics. Antibiotic selection is based on culture and sensitivity results. Randomization determines the route of administration. Patients are followed for 1 year after study enrollment. This study will be the largest prospective randomized trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PO antibiotic use for treatment of postoperative wound infections. Results will inform clinician decisions on antibiotic delivery in patients with postoperative wound infections.

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^114oKkZ8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute-care settings

The acute-care setting was an early target of VA antibiotic stewardship activities, and studies of several inpatient stewardship interventions have demonstrated tangible improvements in the selection, spectrum, duration, and proper dosing of antibiotic therapy.- Meta-analyses and systemic reviews, including one from the VA Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP), have demonstrated that inpatient stewardship activities can safely improve antibiotic-prescribing and reduce antibiotic resistance. - However, limited evidence is available to inform the staffing and information technology resources essential for the success of hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs, including how these resources should vary by facility size and complexity. Contributing to this knowledge gap is a lack of detail on resources needed to implement successful interventions that have been described in the literature. Future implementation studies should quantify not only outcomes but also resources needed for implementation in an objective manner, including time, expertise and informatic resources [Question 10].

In hospitals that lack on-site infectious disease (ID) physicians and ID pharmacists, telehealth is a promising tool for stewardship, and the VA has specific expertise in how to use telehealth for this purpose. Strategies to advance the implementation and sustainment of telehealth-supported stewardship activities in resource-limited, acute-care settings are needed [Question 9].

Future studies, preferably randomized-controlled clinical trials, could further inform several targets for acute-care stewardship activities. First, while oral antibiotic therapy is gaining greater acceptance for infections traditionally treated with parenteral therapy (eg, osteomyelitis), there is room to better define the optimal selection and dosing of oral agents [Question 3]. Second, more data on the comparative safety profiles of commonly prescribed antibiotic regimens would be valuable. A recent pragmatic trial comparing cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam may serve as a viable model for future investigations. The VA Cooperative Studies Program research infrastructure and clinical trials networks have demonstrated success in the conduct of point-of-care and pragmatic clinical trials. - Thus, the VA is an ideal setting for pursuing similar pragmatic trials designed to compare different standard-of-care antibiotic options. Third, large clinical trials could help identify specific situations where it is safe to decrease the length of recommended antibiotic therapy for common uncomplicated infections [Question 4]. For example, in cases of pneumonia, tools such as multiple polymerase chain reaction panels could improve identification of viral pneumonia and, in turn, identify patients in whom early discontinuation or avoidance of antibiotics is feasible.

### Antibiotic overuse and stewardship at hospital discharge: the reducing overuse of antibiotics at discharge home framework [^11192q5R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONSEQUENCES OF ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE AND BARRIERS TO APPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTIC USE AT DISCHARGE

Data on the consequences of antibiotic overuse at discharge are limited and mostly drawn from what we know about the harm from antibiotic misuse generally. These consequences include post-discharge hospital-associated CDI, antibiotic-associated side effects (up to one-quarter of which occur after hospital discharge), effects on community antibiotic resistance (including SNFs to which patients are discharged), and harms associated with the long-term intravenous devices for OPAT.

Hospital discharge is a difficult but critical area for antibiotic stewardship for 3 additional reasons. First, clinicians may perceive the "stakes" as being higher at discharge. Patients transition from being closely monitored to not being seen by a clinician for long periods of time immediately following a serious illness. Thus, getting "it right" feels more important because the effect of decisions at discharge are hard to monitor. In this light, clinicians, though well-intentioned, may weigh risks incorrectly. For example, some will err on the side of prescribing broad-spectrum or longer antibiotic durations to try to prevent readmissions rather than consider the excess risk those decisions may create. Second, there is the complexity surrounding changes of drug, route, and formulation that are required at discharge. Most clinicians hope to transition a patient from an intravenous antibiotic to a medication in the same drug class. When an oral equivalent is not available, clinicians may choose broader-spectrum oral drugs. Finally, there are medication adherence issues. Appropriately, clinicians often account for ease of dosing and cost when determining what to prescribe at discharge. Still, patients may not complete antibiotic courses for various reasons including side effects that are discomforting but not critical enough to seek care.

However, increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae including community-acquired isolates, during the last decade, has compromised clinical utility of these agents for empirical therapy of serious Gram-negative infections. This is likely due to excessive use of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in both children and adults, particularly in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. The combination of over use of these oral antibiotics in the community and potential for household transmission of resistant E. coli strains among family members make ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance unpredictable. Fortunately, most isolates remain susceptible to other beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

A meta-analysis of PubMed and Scopus databases providing data for mortality among patients treated with carbapenems, BLBLI or non- BLBLI (mainly cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), preferably as monotherapy was published in 2013. The study reported no statistically significant difference in mortality between carbapenems and BLBLI administered as either empiric or definitive therapy. The authors concluded that the role of BLBLI should be further evaluated for definitive treatment. In a recent study of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of ESBL bacteremia; the use of piperacillin/tazobactam in ESBLs infections is still controversial.

### Notes from the field: first reported case of shewanella haliotis in the region of the americas-new york, December 2018 [^112HBqJR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The patient was treated empirically with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam while in the hospital and was discharged with a prescription for oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. At a follow-up visit 13 days later, he was recovering well. Empiric treatment of Shewanella spp. can be challenging; limited and varying antibiotic susceptibility profiles have been reported. This patient's isolate was susceptible to several classes of antimicrobials, but resistance to certain antibiotics has been observed in this isolate and others. In a case series of 16 patients from Martinique, Shewanella spp. sensitivities to piperacillin-tazobactam and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were reported to be 98% and 75%, respectively.

Risk factors for or potential vectors of Shewanella spp. infections are unidentified in up to 40%–50% of cases. S. haliotis is ecologically distributed in marine environments, including broad contamination of cultivated shellfish. Although infection following consumption of seafood is seldom reported, consumption of raw seafood could be an important vehicle for foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. This patient reported consuming raw salmon 10 days before becoming ill but had no other marine exposures or exposure to ill contacts. The time from potential exposure to onset of abdominal pain in this patient is consistent with that reported in the literature on Shewanella spp. (3–49 days). The epidemiologic exposure history supports the link between raw fish consumption and infection.

No other organisms were isolated in this patient; in the Martinique case series of Shewanella spp. one half of infections were monomicrobial as well. This case highlights the importance of preventing seafood-associated infections and the need to consider rare human pathogens in elderly or immunocompromised, marine-exposed populations, as well as persons who might consume at-risk food that might have been imported from outside the United States and persons who might have been infected outside the United States when traveling.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1136ebsk]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for initial management of patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, using the four-step assessment, rather than carbapenems and newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides.
Recognize that other agents, such as TMP/SMX, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of complicated UTI.

Randomisation

All patients were initially assessed with a history and full physical examination. Standard screening investigations consisted of a full blood count and differential, a biochemical screen and a minimum of one set of peripheral venous blood cultures in addition to cultures via a central venous catheter if present. Chest radiographs and other microbiological cultures were performed only where clinically indicated.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned by means of consecutively drawn sealed envelopes to receive either an oral regimen of ciprofloxacin 750 mg every 12 h plus amoxicillin–clavulanate (amoxicillin 500 mg+clavulanate 175 mg) every 8 h for a total of 5 days, or an intravenous regimen of gentamicin 80 mg every 8 h and dose adjusted according to therapeutic levels plus tazocin (piperacillin 4 g+tazobactam 500 mg; Lederle, Maidenhead, UK) every 8 h until hospital discharge.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^113L9Jv2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^111xUUUk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Pip/Taz, play an essential role in the empirical therapy of serious infections.

Pip /taz is a combination of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor and has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including most Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria and is effective for many polymicrobial infections.

Pip/Taz is useful against a variety of respiratory infection, intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, febrile neutropenia, and bloodstream infections (BSI) which are among the most frequent complications in neutropenic cancer patients caused by Gram-negative rods which associated with high mortality.

Improper use of these antibiotics is common and costly, as physicians often use broad-spectrum antibiotics when a narrower-spectrum agent would work. Overuse of broad-spectrum agents also has an important role in growing worldwide bacterial resistance which has become a serious problem and adds to the overall costs of medical care with increased side effects.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has published stewardship guidelines to optimize antibiotic use, using cost-effective interventions, to minimize antibiotic resistance, minimize side effects and control Clostridium difficile infections.

Various strategies have offered for antimicrobial stewardship programs. Like staff education, formulary restrictions and substitutions, early de-escalating, early converting parenteral to oral, and practice guidelines that consider local microbiology and resistance.

One useful strategy is to decrease inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics by restricting its use to infectious diseases consultant to get approval for dispensing.

By identifying the inappropriate use of pip /taz, further regulations can be implemented to optimize the use of this medication and thus decreasing the antimicrobial drug resistance which contribute to better patient outcomes. In addition, if appropriate use of Pip/Taz is established, unnecessary hospital costs can be reduced. Hence, we conducted this study to estimate the appropriate use of Pip/Taz utilization in the surgical cardiac unit using Antibiotic stewardship guidelines as a reference.

### Clinafloxacin versus piperacillin / tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and soft-tissue infections in adults at a veterans affairs medical center [^113XrCj5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Severe skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. Thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents.

Objective

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, was I site in a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult patients with SSTI.

Methods

Over an 18-month period, patients aged ≥ 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial SSTI requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg IV every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours. After a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg PO every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg PO every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups.

Results

The center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but I of whom were male, reflecting the typical VA medical center population. The mean age was 60 years (range, 36–80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65 years (range, 35–87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (P = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. Sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. The mean (± SD) duration of treatment was 10.69 ± 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 ± 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 ± 10.28 days and 14.95 ± 19.20 days, respectively. Fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The most commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. Clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. The piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. The clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (P = 0.034).

Conclusions

In this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated SSTIs. Appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. Further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.

### Tazobactam sodium and piperacillin sodium (Zosyn) [^111y5tWZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7.1	Aminoglycosides

Piperacillin may inactivate aminoglycosides by converting them to microbiologically inert amides.

In vivo inactivation:

When aminoglycosides are administered in conjunction with piperacillin to patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, the concentrations of the aminoglycosides (especially tobramycin) may be significantly reduced and should be monitored.

Sequential administration of ZOSYN and tobramycin to patients with either normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment has been shown to modestly decrease serum concentrations of tobramycin but no dosage adjustment is considered necessary.

In vitro inactivation:

Due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, ZOSYN and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. ZOSYN and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated. ZOSYN, which contains EDTA, is compatible with amikacin and gentamicin for simultaneous Y-site infusion in certain diluents and at specific concentrations. ZOSYN is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous Y-site infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

7.2	Probenecid

Probenecid administered concomitantly with ZOSYN prolongs the half-life of piperacillin by 21% and that of tazobactam by 71% because probenecid inhibits tubular renal secretion of both piperacillin and tazobactam. Probenecid should not be co-administered with ZOSYN unless the benefit outweighs the risk.

7.3	Vancomycin

Studies have detected an increased incidence of acute kidney injury in patients concomitantly administered piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin as compared to vancomycin alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Monitor kidney function in patients concomitantly administered with piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin.

No pharmacokinetic interactions have been noted between piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin.

7.4	Anticoagulants

Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation system or the thrombocyte function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Therapy duration and oral step-down in pediatric intra-abdominal infection — Although randomized controlled trials have found that a 3–4 day course of antimicrobial therapy is adequate in adult patients, the task force recommends a five-day total duration of antimicrobial therapy in pediatric patients with IAI. Two RCTs in pediatric patients found a switch to oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid equivalent to use of IV therapy only. There are no data indicating that administering oral antibiotic agents after completing a full course of IV antibiotic agents provides any additional benefit, so oral agents should be used only to complete a recommended five-day course of antimicrobial therapy and not to extend therapy beyond that. Similarly, there are no data suggesting a benefit of additional IV antibiotic agents beyond five days.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Antibiotic overuse and stewardship at hospital discharge: the reducing overuse of antibiotics at discharge home framework [^114T1Mde]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Emergency Department and Observation Discharges

Patients who arrive at the hospital but are discharged without an inpatient stay are also susceptible to antibiotic overuse after discharge, though data are limited. One small, single-center study found that 79% of patients prescribed an antibiotic on discharge from an observation stay received excess, inappropriate, or unnecessary antibiotics. Similarly, patients discharged from emergency departments (EDs) have high rates of antibiotic use and overuse. More than 10% of ED visits are related to infection, making antimicrobials the most common class of new drugs prescribed at ED discharge. In one Veterans Affairs (VA) study, 39% of antibiotics prescribed to patients discharged from the ED were inappropriate.

Outpatient Intravenous Antibiotic Therapy

Up to 14% of antibiotics prescribed at discharge are parenteral. Outpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy (OPAT) programs have revolutionized antibiotic delivery, allowing patients to defer long inpatient stays for early discharge. However, many patients prescribed OPAT could be treated with oral or no antibiotics, a number likely to rise as evidence increasingly supports oral therapy for diseases historically treated with intravenous antibiotics. Case reviews have found that OPAT was potentially not needed in up to 40% of cases. In one pediatric study, additional OPAT misuse was common: 10.5% of cases had an antibiotic drug–organism mismatch and 11.4% of orders had inappropriate antibiotic dosing.

### Ertapenem versus piperacillin / tazobactam for diabetic foot infections (SIDESTEP): prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blinded, multicentre trial [^113MyEiv]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot infections are a common and serious problem, yet few randomised trials of adequate quality have compared the efficacy of the various antibiotic regimens available for their treatment. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam for foot infections.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blinded, multicentre trial in adults (n = 586) with diabetes and a foot infection classified as moderate-to-severe and requiring intravenous antibiotics. We assigned patients intravenous ertapenem (1 g daily; n = 295) or piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h; n = 291) given for a minimum of 5 days, after which oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875/125 mg every 12 h) could be given for up to 23 days. Investigators retained the option to administer vancomycin to patients in either group to ensure adequate coverage for potentially antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a favourable clinical response (cure or improvement) on the day that intravenous antibiotic was discontinued. Analyses were by an evaluable-patient only approach. This study is registered with, number NCT00229112.

Findings

Of the 576 patients treated, 445 were available for assessment at the end of intravenous therapy. Both baseline characteristics and favourable clinical response rates were similar for the 226 who received ertapenem and the 219 who received piperacillin/tazobactam (94%vs 92%, respectively; between treatment difference 1.9%, 95% CI -2.9 to 6.9). Rates of favourable microbiological responses (eradication rates and clinical outcomes, by pathogen) and adverse events did not differ between groups.

Interpretation

Clinical and microbiological outcomes for patients treated with ertapenem were equivalent to those for patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, suggesting that this once-daily antibiotic should be considered for parenteral therapy of diabetic foot infections, when deemed appropriate.

Inpatient management

According to our findings, more than one-third of our respondents used a higher than accepted ANC level to trigger a clinical decision. Respondents treated patients with FN as inpatients in 56% of low-risk cases and in 98% of high-risk cases (Table 2). The treatment for patients at low risk of FN was intravenously (IV) administered antibiotic monotherapy, which was given by 53% of respondents; ceftriaxone was the most frequently used drug (34%). In patients at high risk of FN, double-drug antibiotics administered IV were given by more than half of the respondents; the top selections included a combination of amikacin and primarily ceftazidime (n = 32, 30%), piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 27, 25%), or cefepime (n = 26, 24%).

Discharge criteria

Subtle differences were seen in discharge criteria for patients at low vs. high risk of FN. For low-risk cases, 56% of respondents preferred that the patient was afebrile for more than 48 h; 60% preferred that blood cultures were negative for more than 72 h; and 55% preferred 72-h inpatient monitoring before discharge. For high-risk cases, 57% of respondents required that patients be afebrile for more than 72 h; 67% required negative blood cultures for 72 h; and 67% required inpatient monitoring for 72 h before discharge (Table 3). An ANC > 500/μL and rising was a criterion for discharge in 74% of patients at low risk of FN and in 81% at high risk of FN (Table 3).

### Randomized controlled trial of moxifloxacin compared with piperacillin-tazobactam and amoxicillin-clavulanate for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections [^112TPsLv]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of sequential intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) moxifloxacin treatment against a standard antimicrobial regimen of IV piperacillin-tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin-clavulanate for the treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI).

Summary Background Data

cIAIs are commonly due to mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and require both source control and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Methods

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, phase III comparative trial. Patients with cIAI were stratified by disease severity (APACHE II score) and randomized to either IV/PO moxifloxacin (400 mg q24 hours) or comparator (IV piperacillin-tazobactam [3.0/0.375 g q6 hours] ± PO amoxicillin-clavulanate [800 mg/114 mg q12 hours]), each for 5 to 14 days. The primary efficacy variable was clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure visit (days 25–50). Bacteriologic outcomes were also determined.

Results

Of 656 intent-to-treat patients, 379 (58%) were valid to assess efficacy (183 moxifloxacin, 196 comparator). Demographic and baseline medical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Clinical cure rates at test-of-cure were 80% (146 of 183) for moxifloxacin versus 78% (153 of 196) for comparator (95% confidence interval, -7.4%, 9.3%). The clinical cure rate at test-of-cure for hospital-acquired cIAI was higher with moxifloxacin (82%, 22 of 27) versus comparator (55%, 17 of 31; P = 0.05); rates were similar for community-acquired infections (80% [124 of 156] versus 82% [136 of 165], respectively). Bacterial eradication rates were 78% (117 of 150) with moxifloxacin versus 77% (126 of 163) in the comparator group (95% confidence interval, -9.9%, 8.7%).

Conclusions

Once daily IV/PO moxifloxacin monotherapy was as least as effective as standard IV piperacillin-tazobactam/PO amoxicillin-clavulanate dosed multiple times daily for the treatment of cIAIs.

### Ertapenem sodium (ertapenem) [^112MRRdQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetic Foot Infections

Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of diabetic foot infections without concomitant osteomyelitis in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial. This trial compared ertapenem (1 g intravenously once a day) with piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours). Test-of-cure was defined as clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the 10-day posttherapy follow-up visit. The trial included 295 patients randomized to ertapenem and 291 patients to piperacillin/tazobactam. Both regimens allowed the option to switch to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate for a total of 5 to 28 days of treatment (parenteral and oral). All patients were eligible to receive appropriate adjunctive treatment methods, such as debridement, as is typically required in the treatment of diabetic foot infections, and most patients received these treatments. Patients with suspected osteomyelitis could be enrolled if all the infected bone was removed within 2 days of initiation of study therapy, and preferably within the prestudy period. Investigators had the option to add open-label vancomycin if enterococci or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were among the pathogens isolated or if patients had a history of MRSA infection and additional therapy was indicated in the opinion of the investigator. Two hundred and four (204) patients randomized to ertapenem and 202 patients randomized to piperacillin/tazobactam were clinically evaluable. The clinical success rates at 10 days posttherapy were 75.0% (153/204) for ertapenem and 70.8% (143/202) for piperacillin/tazobactam.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, piperacillin and tazobactam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Piperacillin and tazobactam may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and piperacillin and tazobactam discontinued if lesions progress.

5.3 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in pediatric and adult patients treated with piperacillin and tazobactam. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. If HLH is suspected, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam immediately and institute appropriate management.

5.4 Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and initiate appropriate therapy.

5.5 Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, piperacillin and tazobactam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with piperacillin and tazobactam administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.

Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy in high-risk febrile and neutropenic cancer patients [^112veMAX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside has been the standard approach for treating febrile neutropenia for many years. More recently, beta-lactam monotherapy has also been shown to be a reliable and safe approach. In the present study, 763 eligible patients with fever and neutropenia received piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy. On day 3, according to the study protocol, 165 patients with persistent fever who fulfilled the study entry criteria were randomised to receive vancomycin or a placebo. The success rate was 51% in the intention-to-treat analysis and 62% in the per-protocol analysis. The overall mortality rate was 8% (58/763), with only 18 (2.4%) deaths attributed to the initial or subsequent infection. Randomisation had no influence on the study endpoints. The adverse event rate was evaluated only in the patient population not included in the randomised part of the study. Among these patients, adverse events probably or definitely related to piperacillin-tazobactam therapy were uncommon, confirming the favourable safety profile of piperacillin-tazobactam. It was concluded that piperacillin-tazobactam could be considered as monotherapy for patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia.

### Implementing criteria-based early switch / early discharge programmes: a European perspective [^1158Bp2j]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Early switch (ES) from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotic therapy programmes is increasingly included as a component of hospital antimicrobial stewardship initiatives that aim to optimize antimicrobial therapy while limiting toxicity and resistance. In terms of prioritizing the most cost-effective stewardship interventions, ES has been seen as a 'low-hanging fruit', which refers to selecting the most obtainable targets rather than confronting more complicated issues. Administration of highly bioavailable oral antibiotics should be considered for nearly all non-critically ill patients and has been recommended as an effective and safe strategy for over two decades. However, to accrue the most benefit from ES, it should be combined with an early discharge (ED) plan, protocol, or care pathway. Benefits of this combined approach include improved patient comfort and mobility, reduced incidence of IV-line-related adverse effects, reduced IV antimicrobial preparation time, decreased hospital stays, reduced antimicrobial purchasing and administration costs, decreased patient deconditioning, and shortened recovery times. Results from published studies document decreases in healthcare resource use and costs following implementation of ES programmes, which in most studies facilitate the opportunity for ED and ED programmes. Barriers to the implementation of these programmes include clinician misconceptions, practical considerations, organizational factors, and a striking lack of awareness of IV to oral switch guidance. These and other barriers will need to be addressed to maximize the effectiveness of ES and ED programmes. As national antimicrobial stewardship programmes dictate the inclusion of ES and ED programmes within healthcare facilities, programmes must be developed and success must be documented.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg q6h) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^116vT8Jq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria included hospitalization, age of 18 years or older, growth of gram-negative bacteria on blood culture, and evidence of infection. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment had to be initiated within 24 hours of the first blood culture. Participants had to be clinically stable within 4 days of the initial blood culture (temperature ≤ 37.8 °C, systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, heart rate < 100/min, respiratory rate < 24/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation > 90%), with an available susceptibility report on day 4. Individuals who were immunosuppressed (receiving corticosteroid treatment with ≥ 20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for > 14 days, HIV positive, having received chemotherapy for < 28 days, neutropenia [< 1000 /μL], organ transplant recipient, or receiving biological response modifier therapy), transitioned to hospice care within 4 days of the initial blood culture, had an established uncontrolled focus of infection, or had a blood culture with polymicrobial growth or growth of either Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Brucella, or Fusobacterium species were excluded. Additionally, individuals who ended antibiotic treatment before or on the index date were excluded.

Treatment Strategy and Assignment

Early switch to oral antibiotics was defined as transitioning to oral antibiotic therapy within 4 days of blood culture. Prolonged IV treatment was defined as a minimum of 5 days of IV antibiotic treatment.

The index date was set to 4 days after the initial blood culture, mimicking the time of randomization in the target trial. Participants were allocated into 1 of the 2 treatment groups according to the antibiotic treatment strategy with which their data were compatible at the index date.

Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was defined as initiation of either piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin in combination with gentamicin, mecillinam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, meropenem, ertapenem, or tobramycin. Choice of IV and oral antibiotic agent after availability of the susceptibility report was at the discretion of the treating physician but had to comply with the susceptibility result. Antibiotic treatment had to be maintained for 7 to 14 days.

Follow-Up and Outcomes

Follow-up started at randomization and ended on day 90 or at the time of death, whichever occurred first. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality.

### Patients' views and experience of intravenous and oral antimicrobial therapy: room for change [^114PCAJD]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Little is known about patients' views or preferences about the route of administration of antimicrobials. In this study semi-structured interviews were carried out to assess patients' perceptions of an infection that required IV antimicrobial therapy in hospital, their preference for intravenous, IV followed by oral and discharge on oral therapy or home IV therapy. Interviews were transcribed and the content analysed. Twelve patients were interviewed while in hospital or by telephone after discharge. Patients' information about their infection was incomplete and many expressed the view that they would like more information. Many patients expressed a preference for oral therapy over IV therapy although this was dependent on it being of equal efficacy. Contrary views were related to personal difficulty with tablets. Patients varied in their acceptance of home IV therapy and expressed concern about adequate support but the majority expressed a preference for being discharged on oral therapy once they were well enough.

### Partial oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment of endocarditis [^1152W5uJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with infective endocarditis on the left side of the heart are typically treated with intravenous antibiotic agents for up to 6 weeks. Whether a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotics once the patient is in stable condition would result in efficacy and safety similar to those with continued intravenous treatment is unknown.

Methods

In a randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial, we assigned 400 adults in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci and who were being treated with intravenous antibiotics to continue intravenous treatment (199 patients) or to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (201 patients). In all patients, antibiotic treatment was administered intravenously for at least 10 days. If feasible, patients in the orally treated group were discharged to outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen, from the time of randomization until 6 months after antibiotic treatment was completed.

Results

After randomization, antibiotic treatment was completed after a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the intravenously treated group and 17 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the orally treated group (P = 0.48). The primary composite outcome occurred in 24 patients (12.1%) in the intravenously treated group and in 18 (9.0%) in the orally treated group (between-group difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -3.4 to 9.6; P = 0.40), which met noninferiority criteria.

Conclusions

In patients with endocarditis on the left side of the heart who were in stable condition, changing to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment. (Funded by the Danish Heart Foundation and others; POET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01375257 .).

Regarding the use of piperacillin / tazobactam IV (also known as Zosyn) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis:

- Dose as in eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m². Maximal dose of 2.25g. Maximal frequency of q12h.
- Monitor for neuromuscular excitability and convulsions.
- **For nosocomial pneumonia ONLY**: Reduce dose to 2.25g every 8 hours.
Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g should be given after each dialysis period on dialysis days.

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) — oral antibiotic use and IV-to-oral transitions: We recommend ASPs implement programs to increase both appropriate use of oral antibiotics for initial therapy and the timely transition of patients from IV to oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence cited shows cost and length-of-stay benefits; an abbreviated IV cephalosporin course followed by oral cephalosporin had a lower total cost of care ($5002 vs $2953; P < .005) and a shorter hospital stay (10 vs 7 days; p = 0.01), and line complications were lower with switching (17/81 vs 26/81) though not significant (P = 0.077). Early switching on medical wards shortened IV duration (reduction in median days, 19%; 95% CI, 9%–29%; p = 0.001) but only 151 of 246 (61.1%) potential cases were switched, while guideline implementation increased conversions (52/97 [54%] vs 66/80 [83%]; difference, 29%; 95% CI, 16%–42%; P < .001). Another example of benefit is reduction in the need for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT); in 56 patients who received oral (n = 50) or no additional antibiotics (n = 6) after mandatory infectious diseases approval of OPAT, only 1 of 56 patients had clinical failure and there was a per-patient cost savings of $3847.

Treatment of Nonfermenters

For nonfermenters such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones are not recommended as initial treatment after debridement because of the high rate of resistance that can develop. Although the bactericidal action of beta-lactams appears inferior to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem (except ertapenem) should be used as the initial therapy. There is some in vitro evidence of a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing with a high inoculum, and so, the addition of an aminoglycoside for 2–5 days can be considered.

If P. aeruginosa is resistant to fluoroquinolones, there are no other suitable oral agents and beta-lactams need to be continued intravenously according to susceptibility testing.

Pseudomonas spp. and other nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter spp. may be multiresistant but sensitive to colistin. Colistin should be used in combination therapy with careful monitoring of renal function and trough serum dosages, as it is associated with a high risk of nephrotoxicity. Tigecycline may be an alternative for some organisms, but not for P. aeruginosa because of intrinsic resistance to the agent. Expert microbiology advice should be sought for any of these infections.

Treatment of Anaerobes

In the group of Gram-positive anaerobes, Cutibacterium (previously Propionibacterium) acnes is most frequently isolated). Cutibacterium acnes is highly susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics except metronidazole; however, resistance is emerging against macrolides, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. – In biofilm-related infections, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin are less effective, while rifampicin, daptomycin, and ceftriaxone have demonstrated biofilm activity in animal models. In combination, rifampicin and levofloxacin show good efficacy. We recommend starting with benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone, followed by oral treatment of rifampicin in combination with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or quinolones. For other Gram-positive anaerobes (eg, Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus species, and Clostridium species), there are no studies to guide treatment. Penicillin (or ceftriaxone) would be a good initial therapy, and treatment should be guided by speciation, susceptibilities, and microbiological advice.

Gram-negative anaerobes should be treated with IV ampicillin/sulbactam or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid based on availability, followed by oral metronidazole.

7.1 Aminoglycosides

Piperacillin may inactivate aminoglycosides by converting them to microbiologically inert amides.

In vivo inactivation:

When aminoglycosides are administered in conjunction with piperacillin to patients with end‑stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, the concentrations of the aminoglycosides (especially tobramycin) may be significantly reduced and should be monitored.

Sequential administration of ZOSYN and tobramycin to patients with either normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment has been shown to modestly decrease serum concentrations of tobramycin but no dosage adjustment is considered necessary.

In vitro inactivation:

Due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, ZOSYN and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. ZOSYN and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated. ZOSYN, which contains EDTA, is compatible with amikacin and gentamicin for simultaneous Y-site infusion in certain diluents and at specific concentrations. ZOSYN is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous Y-site infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

7.2 Probenecid

Probenecid administered concomitantly with ZOSYN prolongs the half-life of piperacillin by 21% and that of tazobactam by 71% because probenecid inhibits tubular renal secretion of both piperacillin and tazobactam. Probenecid should not be co-administered with ZOSYN unless the benefit outweighs the risk.

7.3 Vancomycin

Studies have detected an increased incidence of acute kidney injury in patients concomitantly administered piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin as compared to vancomycin alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Monitor kidney function in patients concomitantly administered with piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin.

No pharmacokinetic interactions have been noted between piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin.

7.4 Anticoagulants

Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation system or the thrombocyte function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Sequential antibiotic therapy [^1166H8qp]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials are an important source of hospital expenditure. Traditionally, severe bacterial infections have been treated initially with intravenous antibiotics, followed by physician-directed switch to oral therapy. Unfortunately this approach results in unnecessary prolongation of intravenous treatment, with all its inherent disadvantages. Sequential antibiotic therapy, however, ensures an early switch to the oral route when the patient is clinically stable. This increasingly employed strategy is safe and results in improved quality and cost-effectiveness of health care. To ensure timely and appropriate switch, such programmes need to be underpinned by clear guidelines and supported by a multidisciplinary team. In the future, key questions, such as what is the optimal time of switch for specific infections, and can conditions such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis be efficaciously treated with oral therapy, need to be answered. Only then will clinicians be able to practise evidence-based infection management incorporating sequential antimicrobial therapy.

5.6 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

As with other penicillins, ZOSYN may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.8 Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections caused by Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant inducible AmpC production. Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, piperacillin and tazobactam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Piperacillin and tazobactam may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and piperacillin and tazobactam discontinued if lesions progress.

5.3 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in pediatric and adult patients treated with piperacillin and tazobactam. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. If HLH is suspected, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam immediately and institute appropriate management.

5.4 Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and initiate appropriate therapy.

5.5 Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, piperacillin and tazobactam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with piperacillin and tazobactam administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.

Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
