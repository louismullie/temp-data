## Question

117. Two Ferries. Two ferries travel between two opposite banks of a river at constant speeds. Upon reaching a bank, each immediately starts moving in the opposite direction. The ferries departed from opposite banks simultaneously, met for the first time 700 meters from one of the banks, continued to their respective banks, then turned around and met again 400 meters from the other bank. Determine the width of the river in your mind.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to determine the width of a river given that two ferries depart simultaneously from opposite banks, meet for the first time 700 meters from one bank, continue to the opposite banks, turn around, and meet again 400 meters from the other bank. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physical setup and the key events. Then, I should verify the invariant that the total distance traveled by both ferries between meetings is twice the river width. Next, I will relate distances to speeds and times, and set up ratios. After that, I should translate the second-meeting position into an equation for the width. Finally, I will solve and sanity-check the result, making sure the logic holds under different speed assumptions.

> Let me first confirm the setup and the invariant. The ferries start at opposite banks and move at constant speeds; when they meet the first time, their combined distance traveled equals the river width, and when they meet the second time, their combined distance traveled equals three times the river width, because each has crossed once and is on the return leg. This 1:3 ratio of combined distances is a classic invariant in this class of problems and will anchor the solution [^notfound].

> I will now examine the first meeting. Let the river width be W meters. At the first meeting, Ferry A has traveled 700 meters from its starting bank, and Ferry B has traveled (W − 700) meters from its starting bank. Since they started simultaneously and met at time t1, the ratio of their speeds equals the ratio of distances: vA/vB = 700/(W − 700). Hold on, I should verify that this ratio is indeed constant because speeds are constant, which it is, so this relationship will remain valid for the entire journey [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the second meeting. By the time of the second meeting, the total distance traveled by both ferries is 3W. Let me think about how this translates into individual distances. If Ferry A travels a total of D meters by the second meeting, then Ferry B travels (3W − D) meters. Importantly, the ratio of total distances should still reflect the speed ratio, so D/(3W − D) = vA/vB. But wait, I already have vA/vB = 700/(W − 700), so I can equate these expressions to eliminate the speeds entirely [^notfound].

> Now I need to translate the second-meeting position into a usable expression for D. The second meeting occurs 400 meters from the opposite bank. Let me visualize this: if Ferry A started from the left bank, it first meets Ferry B 700 meters from the left bank, then continues to the right bank (traveling W − 700 more meters), turns around, and meets again 400 meters from the right bank, which means it has traveled 400 meters back toward the left. So Ferry A's total distance D is 700 + (W − 700) + 400 = W + 400 meters. I should double-check that arithmetic: 700 + W − 700 + 400 simplifies to W + 400, which is correct [^notfound].

> Substituting D = W + 400 into the ratio equation gives (W + 400)/(3W − (W + 400)) = 700/(W − 700). Simplifying the denominator on the left yields (W + 400)/(2W − 400) = 700/(W − 700). Cross-multiplying, I get (W + 400)(W − 700) = 700(2W − 400). Expanding both sides: W² − 700W + 400W − 280,000 = 1,400W − 280,000, which simplifies to W² − 300W − 280,000 = 1,400W − 280,000. Wait, let me verify the algebra; I initially wrote 280,000 on the right, but that should be 280,000 on both sides, so subtracting 280,000 from both sides gives W² − 300W = 1,400W, and then W² − 1,700W = 0. Factoring, W(W − 1,700) = 0, so W = 0 or W = 1,700. Since W = 0 is impossible, the river width is 1,700 meters [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should sanity-check this. If W = 1,700 meters, then at the first meeting Ferry A has gone 700 meters and Ferry B has gone 1,000 meters, so vA/vB = 7/10. By the second meeting, Ferry A has gone 1,700 + 400 = 2,100 meters, and Ferry B has gone 3 × 1,700 − 2,100 = 3,000 meters, and 2,100/3,000 = 7/10, which matches the speed ratio, confirming internal consistency. I should also confirm the positional claim: Ferry A travels 700 meters to the first meeting, then 1,000 meters to the far bank, then 400 meters back, placing the second meeting 400 meters from the right bank, which aligns with the problem statement [^notfound].

> Final answer: The river is 1,700 meters wide.

---

The river is **1,700 meters** wide. Here's the reasoning: let the river width be (W), and the ferries' speeds be (v_1) and (v_2). At the first meeting, the ferries have traveled a combined distance of (W), with Ferry 1 covering 700 m; thus, the speed ratio is (\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\frac{700}{W - 700}). By the second meeting, each ferry has crossed the river once and is returning, so their combined distance is (3W); Ferry 1 has traveled (W + 400) m, and Ferry 2 has traveled (2W - 400) m. Equating the speed ratio from both meetings gives (\\frac{700}{W - 700} = \\frac{W + 400}{2W - 400}), which solves to (W = 1,700) m.

---

Let (W) be the width of the river, and let (v_1) and (v_2) be the constant speeds of the two ferries. The ferries depart simultaneously from opposite banks and meet for the first time 700 meters from one bank. They continue to the opposite banks, turn around, and meet again 400 meters from the other bank.

---

At the **first meeting**, the total distance traveled by both ferries is equal to the width of the river, (W). If Ferry 1 travels 700 meters, then Ferry 2 travels (W - 700) meters. The ratio of their speeds is therefore:

[
\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\frac{700}{W - 700}
]

---

At the **second meeting**, each ferry has crossed the river once and is on its return trip. The total distance traveled by both ferries is now (3W). Ferry 1 has traveled (W + 400) meters (across the river and 400 meters back), and Ferry 2 has traveled (2W - 400) meters (across the river and (W - 400) meters back). The ratio of their speeds is:

[
\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\frac{W + 400}{2W - 400}
]

---

Since the speeds are constant, the speed ratios from the first and second meetings must be equal:

[
\\frac{700}{W - 700} = \\frac{W + 400}{2W - 400}
]

---

Cross-multiplying and simplifying:

[
700(2W - 400) = (W + 400)(W - 700)
]

[
1400W - 280000 = W^2–300W - 280000
]

[
W^2–1700W = 0
]

[
W(W - 1700) = 0
]

---

The solutions are (W = 0) or (W = 1700). Since the river cannot have zero width, the width of the river is **1,700 meters**.

Constructing orthogonal vectors

After determining the river centerlines suitable for width extraction, we need to select cross-section locations in the reach to extract river width, since geoBAM requires multi-temporal widths at multiple cross-sections along a reach. Here, we used a dynamic procedure to locate width measurements due to computational limits at the global scale and due to practical expediency (i.e. there is no need to measure widths every 30 m as in previous work to estimate discharge on a 2 km wide river). Previous studies, have shown sufficient distance between cross-sections is needed to capture the geomorphic variability, a requisite of geoBAM, especially for large rivers. We arranged the cross-sections for each reach dynamically based on their average widths (i.e. mean) (Supplementary Table 3). This alignment ensures a balance between computational efficiency and data density while maintaining the requirement of geoBAM. To reduce errors in extracted widths, we removed cross-sections close to river confluences, as these cause known errors in the width extraction process.

We used the RivWidthCloud methodto extract multi-temporal river widths from the Landsat family of satellites for the period 1984–2018 in GEE. To estimate river width, RivWidthCloud maps a fixed orthogonal vector onto a river centerline and then extracts the water area under each orthogonal per image to report river width. If orthogonals are too long, classified water out-of-bank might introduce a false positive, while if orthogonals are too short, they will not span the full river width. To determine orthogonal length, we calculated the temporally variable distance between the center and boundary of the river flow extent (bank distance, or BD) for each cross-section using the CalcDistanceMap function in the RivWidthCloud method. Then, we used the following formula to determine the length of the orthogonal line for each cross-section. Whereis the length of the orthogonal line, is the 75 percentile bank distance; is max.

We then used the CalculateAngle function in the RivWidthCloud method to estimate the angle of the orthogonal lines.

### Beyond proximity: an observational study of stillbirth rates and emergency obstetric and newborn care accessibility in the Gambia [^6ec6dd38]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Our data show that nearly half of women of reproductive age in The Gambia can reach a fully functional CEmONC facility within a 10 min travel time. However, due to the lack of routine data collection on this metric, we could not track individual journeys or determine total travel times to birthing facilities. Studies in Nigeria indicate that 50%–70% of women who experienced intrapartum stillbirths had travel times of under 30 min to the nearest government health facility, suggesting that factors beyond travel duration may also contribute to stillbirths. Nonetheless, longer travel times are strongly associated with higher stillbirth risk, with one study finding that even travel times of 10–29 min doubled the likelihood of stillbirth. The high SBR and IPSBR at Soma Health Centre may reflect its role as the only facility in the Lower River Region offering some form of EmONC. Although Farafenni General Hospital, the nearest fully functional CEmONC facility, is only 16 km away in the North Bank Region, the River Gambia separates the two regions. This posed significant challenges for patient referrals, especially at night when the ferry service was unavailable. Geographical accessibility between the regions improved after the opening of the Trans-Gambia Bridge in 2019.

### Big data show idiosyncratic patterns and rates of geomorphic river mobility [^f3774783]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Big data present unprecedented opportunities to test long-standing theories regarding patterns and rates of geomorphic river adjustments. Here, we use locational probabilities derived from Landsat imagery (1988–2019) to quantify the dynamics of 600km 2 of riverbed in 10 Philippine catchments. Analysis of lateral adjustments reveals spatially non-uniform variability in along-valley patterns of geomorphic river mobility, with zones of relative stability interspersed with zones of relative instability. Hotspots of mobility vary in magnitude, size and location between catchments. We could not identify monotonic relationships between local factors (active channel width, valley floor width and confinement ratio) and mobility. No relation between the channel pattern type and rates of adjustment was evident. We contend that satellite-derived locational probabilities provide a spatially continuous dynamic metric that can help unravel and contextualise forms and rates of geomorphic river adjustment, thereby helping to derive insights into idiosyncrasies of river behaviour in dynamic landscapes.

### Reconstructing the sediment concentration of a giant submarine gravity flow [^d9412da6]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Submarine gravity flows are responsible for the largest sediment accumulations on the planet, but are notoriously difficult to measure in action. Giant flows transport 100s of km 3 of sediment with run-out distances over 2000km. Sediment concentration is a first order control on flow dynamics and deposit character. It has never been measured directly nor convincingly estimated in large submarine flows. Here we reconstruct the sediment concentration of a historic giant submarine flow, the 1929 "Grand Banks" event, using two independent approaches, each validated by estimates of flow speed from cable breaks. The calculated average bulk sediment concentration of the flow was 2.7–5.4% by volume. This is orders of magnitude higher than directly-measured smaller-volume flows in river deltas and submarine canyons. The new concentration estimate provides a test case for scaled experiments and numerical simulations, and a major step towards a quantitative understanding of these prodigious flows.

### Similarity of stream width distributions across headwater systems [^378668ea]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The morphology and abundance of streams control the rates of hydraulic and biogeochemical exchange between streams, groundwater, and the atmosphere. In large river systems, the relationship between river width and abundance is fractal, such that narrow rivers are proportionally more common than wider rivers. However, in headwater systems, where many biogeochemical reactions are most rapid, the relationship between stream width and abundance is unknown. To constrain this uncertainty, we surveyed stream hydromorphology (wetted width and length) in several headwater stream networks across North America and New Zealand. Here, we find a strikingly consistent lognormal statistical distribution of stream width, including a characteristic most abundant stream width of 32 ± 7cm independent of discharge or physiographic conditions. We propose a hydromorphic model that can be used to more accurately estimate the hydromorphology of streams, with significant impact on the understanding of the hydraulic, ecological, and biogeochemical functions of stream networks.

Major river definition and DMR calculation

Rivers of different orders hold varied roles in human society. We defined rivers with stream order ≥ 4 as major rivers, considering both the discharge required to satisfy water demand for settlements to develop into citiesand navigation requirement (fourth order is the minimum in the Navigable Waterway Network). Due to the varied resolutions of NHD and GRWL river shapefiles, we used GRWL data to identify the rivers with mean width larger than 1 km (a total of 7524 km of rivers) and assigned their river width values to the NHD rivers within the width buffer zones of the GRWL wide rivers (Fig. 1c). Minor manual modification was necessary to determine the coverage of major rivers. We converted the coverage shapefile of major rivers to raster and calculated the Euclidean distance to the closest major rivers (DMR) for each grid cell in the conterminous US at a resolution of 1 km, which was used as the reference DMR under natural condition (Fig. 1a). The threshold of the maximum distance was set as 20 km, since about 95% of the total study area was within this limit (Supplementary Fig. 4). We discretized the distance into 21 classes using 1 km as the interval (DMR = 0, 1, 2,…, 20 km), with the distance of each class representing its maximum DMR.

We considered the changes of river courses over time from the construction of reservoirs (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 5) using the reservoir location and decade of construction from the GRanD database. This resulted in a maximum increase of about 2.6% in the areas with DMR of zero, compared to the reference DMR based on GRWL data.

### Superlinear scaling of riverine biogeochemical function with watershed size [^e8da41cf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

The scaling of cumulative function by an entire river network with increasing watershed area (Eq. (1)) requires scaling both the abiotic template and local areal process rates (Fig. 1). Longitudinal variation of a local areal process rate, y (mass surface area −1 time −1), as stream size increases with watershed area (A) can be modeled with a power function as:where the constant b represents the local process rate in a stream reach with A = 1 km 2, and m.local is the scaling exponent that describes how the local areal rate changes with increasing stream size as indicated by A (Fig. 1A). The local process rate, y, can be modeled assuming either zero-order or first-order reaction rates (see below).

Scaling of cumulative biogeochemical function in stream networks also depends on the scaling of cumulative benthic or water surface area (SA) (Fig. 1B), because aquatic processes occur primarily across these interfaces of all but the largest rivers. The fractal nature of river networks results in cumulative channel length and SA increasing as a power function of watershed area (Fig. 1B) as influenced by geomorphic attributes of the network structure (e.g. shape, number and length of streams in each river order). Scaling of cumulative length is due to structural characteristics of the network alone, whereas SA is also influenced by changes in wetted width as a function of mean discharge that accumulates with watershed area. The relationship between mean annual channel width (w) and mean annual discharge (Q) in a downstream direction is described by:where f typically varies between 0.4 and 0.6, and e is the normalization constant. Temporal variation in discharge has a relatively small influence on channel width because the change with discharge at-a-site (in contrast to discharge in the downstream direction) typically has an exponent of only 0.1, until bank full-flood stage is reached. River network structure also determines flow path probabilities, which in turn influence biogeochemical function scaling with increasing watershed size.

### Satellites reveal hotspots of global river extent change [^521013a7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Earth observation satellites are increasing the feasibility of monitoring large-scale and long-term river channel changes in remote areas with no or limited in situ measurements and regions where sharing in situ data are politically restricted. Recent studies have employed remotely sensed observations to examine global surface water dynamics, but these advances did not include a thorough and necessary distinction of water body types, such as lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, whose changes have different ecological and social ramifications –. Long-term river flow regime changes on the global scale have not been adequately investigated, partially because identifying and mapping river channels is technically challenging. A recent studyanalyzed how monthly and yearly fractional river extents correlate with the terrestrial water storage components, but their emphasis was river extent variability rather than long-term trends, and their attribution was limited to hydrometeorological factors. Another recent effort by Feng, Gleasoninvestigated temporal variations of river width during 1984–2020 by mapping rivers (average width > 90 m) from the time series of Landsat images. While Feng et al.could not accurately measure river width variations for rivers narrower than ~90 m from Landsat, it would be possible to examine patterns and trends in total inundation extent for many narrower rivers. Moreover, while they examined width variations associated with reservoirs, they did not explicitly separate changes associated with reservoirs from other alterations to river width.

### Mapping the world's free-flowing rivers [^2c3105f6]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Free-flowing rivers (FFRs) support diverse, complex and dynamic ecosystems globally, providing important societal and economic services. Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.

### The root of branching river networks [^d8efc9ae]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Branching river networks are one of the most widespread and recognizable features of Earth's landscapes and have also been discovered elsewhere in the Solar System. But the mechanisms that create these patterns and control their spatial scales are poorly understood. Theories based on probability or optimality have proven useful, but do not explain how river networks develop over time through erosion and sediment transport. Here we show that branching at the uppermost reaches of river networks is rooted in two coupled instabilities: first, valleys widen at the expense of their smaller neighbours, and second, side slopes of the widening valleys become susceptible to channel incision. Each instability occurs at a critical ratio of the characteristic timescales for soil transport and channel incision. Measurements from two field sites demonstrate that our theory correctly predicts the size of the smallest valleys with tributaries. We also show that the dominant control on the scale of landscape dissection in these sites is the strength of channel incision, which correlates with aridity and rock weakness, rather than the strength of soil transport. These results imply that the fine-scale structure of branching river networks is an organized signature of erosional mechanics, not a consequence of random topology.

### More than one million barriers fragment Europe's rivers [^416aca01]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Rivers support some of Earth's richest biodiversity 1 and provide essential ecosystem services to society 2, but they are often fragmented by barriers to free flow 3. In Europe, attempts to quantify river connectivity have been hampered by the absence of a harmonized barrier database. Here we show that there are at least 1.2 million instream barriers in 36 European countries (with a mean density of 0.74 barriers per kilometre), 68 per cent of which are structures less than two metres in height that are often overlooked. Standardized walkover surveys along 2,715 kilometres of stream length for 147 rivers indicate that existing records underestimate barrier numbers by about 61 per cent. The highest barrier densities occur in the heavily modified rivers of central Europe and the lowest barrier densities occur in the most remote, sparsely populated alpine areas. Across Europe, the main predictors of barrier density are agricultural pressure, density of river-road crossings, extent of surface water and elevation. Relatively unfragmented rivers are still found in the Balkans, the Baltic states and parts of Scandinavia and southern Europe, but these require urgent protection from proposed dam developments. Our findings could inform the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which aims to reconnect 25,000 kilometres of Europe's rivers by 2030, but achieving this will require a paradigm shift in river restoration that recognizes the widespread impacts caused by small barriers.

### Superlinear scaling of riverine biogeochemical function with watershed size [^1bdeb674]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

River network model

For first-order process scenarios, upstream processes influence downstream reactant supply and local areal rates. In the model, the average flux (F, M T −1) exported from rivers of a given river order (which is then routed downstream based on flow path probabilities) is determined as in ref. :where Upstream in is the upstream input from the two rivers that initially create the order (M T −1), Local in is the direct input from the landscape as it first enters the river network (M T −1) (Supplementary Table 3), Tributary in is the upstream input of additional surface flow paths based on flow path probabilities (e.g. Supplementary Table 4, see also) that enter the river along its length (M T −1), R is the removal proportion (unitless), x refers to whether the input travels the entire river length (full) or on average half the river length (half), H L is the hydraulic load (L T −1), Q is the mean discharge either at the downstream end (Q down) or the midpoint (Q mid) of the reach length (L 3 T −1), w is mean river width at downstream end or midpoint (L), and L is the mean length of the river order (L). We note that υ f /H L is equivalent to kτ, where k is the time specific uptake rate (T −1) and τ is the residence time (T). Both forms are also equivalent to the dimensionless Damköhler number. Flow path probabilities are used to identify upstream vs. tributary inputs (e.g. Supplementary Table 4). The model accounts for the removal of constituents by upstream river orders before calculating downstream concentration and uptake. Flow path probabilities are then used to calculate how the biogeochemical process accumulates with increasing watershed size.

### Longest sediment flows yet measured show how major rivers connect efficiently to deep sea [^5128e0a2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Here we show how major rivers can efficiently connect to the deep-sea, by analysing the longest runout sediment flows (of any type) yet measured in action on Earth. These seafloor turbidity currents originated from the Congo River-mouth, with one flow travelling > 1,130km whilst accelerating from 5.2 to 8.0m/s. In one year, these turbidity currents eroded 1,338–2,675 [> 535–1,070] Mt of sediment from one submarine canyon, equivalent to 19–37 [> 7–15] % of annual suspended sediment flux from present-day rivers. It was known earthquakes trigger canyon-flushing flows. We show river-floods also generate canyon-flushing flows, primed by rapid sediment-accumulation at the river-mouth, and sometimes triggered by spring tides weeks to months post-flood. It is demonstrated that strongly erosional turbidity currents self-accelerate, thereby travelling much further, validating a long-proposed theory. These observations explain highly-efficient organic carbon transfer, and have important implications for hazards to seabed cables, or deep-sea impacts of terrestrial climate change.

### Global methane emissions from rivers and streams [^a9b6fa03]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Underlying global hydrology

To upscale global riverine CH 4 emissions, we estimated the river surface area and the gas transfer velocity across the global river network following ref. In brief, we used the Global Reach-Scale A Priori Discharge Estimates (GRADES), which represents the global river drainage network with modelled daily discharge since 1979. GRADES contains around 2.9 million river reaches, with a median reach length of 6.8 km (Supplementary Table 1). To capture seasonal patterns in river hydrology, we summarized monthly average discharge Q and its coefficient of variation CV for each river reach. Using this monthly discharge, we estimated the velocity V (m s −1) and width W (m) from established scaling relationships following ref. We could then estimate river surface area for every reach and month as the product of the seasonally varying W and reach length. The river surface area was further corrected for periods when rivers are either dry or covered by ice, with procedures described in ref. Here we assumed that those conditions prevent rivers from emitting CH 4 to the atmosphere. This is a conservative assumption given that ice cover in rivers is often discontinuous and CH 4 may still be emitted during cold seasons, and dry riverbeds can emit CH 4, albeit typically at lower rates than when water is present. To estimate the gas-transfer velocity (k 600) we used equation 5 of ref. — which is used in ref.and in other scaling studies — as this provides reasonable estimates across ranges of slope and water velocity. The equation iswhere S (m m −1) is the river-reach slope obtained from GRADES, and the coefficients are mean ± s.d.

### Vegetation enhances curvature-driven dynamics in meandering rivers [^702cc15b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Meandering river dynamics

To seek an explanation for the observed disparity in meandering river morphometrics as a function of riparian vegetation density, we also investigated differences in the dynamic evolution of meander planforms over time. Meander evolution is known to be controlled by flow-imparted sediment erosion and deposition at the outer and inner banks, respectively, driving the lateral migration and planform development of meandering rivers over time.

Quantification of meander planform evolution through DTW (Methods) suggests statistically significant differences in rates of width-adjusted lateral migration ([yr −1]) between vegetated rivers (used as the control group) and both semi-vegetated and unvegetated rivers (p- value < 0.01 for WRS tests performed at 5% significance level). Migration rates relative to channel width in unvegetated rivers (= 0.019 ± 0.022 yr −1, median ± standard deviation values reported) are almost twice as high as those in vegetated rivers (= 0.010 ± 0.058 yr −1), and about 58% higher than in semi-vegetated rivers (= 0.012 ± 0.051 yr −1) (Fig. 4a). This finding corroborates empirical observations that vegetation helps to stabilize river banks against migration, and suggests that reach-averaged time-lapse analyses, as employed herein, attenuate differences in characteristic migration rates between unvegetated and vegetated systems when compared to measurements carried out at bend apexes. More importantly, DTW analysis of river centerlines also allows for examining the functional relationship between channel curvature and river migration. The extensive literature on this topic,– — which focused almost exclusively on relatively large, sand-to-gravel-bedded rivers in vegetated landscapes – has shown that the distribution of C vs. M R data is significantly scattered, such that a single value of M R cannot be generally associated with a single value of C (refs.; see Supplementary Method 2). Nevertheless, a quasi-linear relationship emerges between C and both the mean and upper values of the M R distributions, pointing to a strong first-order control of C on meandering river morphodynamics. This proportionality typically only holds for mildly curved channel reaches (i.e. for width-adjusted curvature values smaller than 0.25–0.5, taken here as C < 0.3 for convenience) and breaks down at higher curvatures (C > 0.3) where M R saturates due to the growth of hydrodynamic nonlinearities that effectively limit bank erosion, such as saturation of centrifugally driven secondary flows, enhanced secondary outer bank cells, and flow separation at the outer bank, (Supplementary Method 2).

### The scaling laws of human travel [^1dc7dc22]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Lévy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.

### Superlinear scaling of riverine biogeochemical function with watershed size [^ef8acb7c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In all scenarios, we assumed mean annual runoff over the entire watershed was 500 mm yr −1, a reasonable value for temperate watersheds. Mean annual runoff was used to calculate mean annual discharge (Q m 3 s −1) in each river order using the river order's mean watershed area. Many temperate watersheds exhibit linear scaling of discharge with watershed size, consistent with this approach. Mean discharge was used to estimate the mean width (w), depth (h), and velocity (v) of each river order using hydraulic geometry equations that describe how w changes with mean Q in the downstream direction (Eq. (3), Supplementary Table 1). We explored the role of runoff/discharge variability over time for scenarios with first-order kinetics by varying runoff between 0.1x (roughly baseflow) to 20x (extreme flow) relative to the mean annual runoff. Changes in width, depth, and velocity due to variable discharge at local stream reaches (i.e. "at-a-site") were estimated using at-a-site width vs. discharge equations (g in Supplementary Table 1). The combination of river network structure, flow path probabilities, runoff, and river hydraulics determines how reactive surface area scales with increasing watershed area.

### Floodplain inundation spectrum across the United States [^7bbf047c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

This study represents one of the first continental-scale investigations examining all floods from the onset to end of inundation across a long-term record. We analyzed sub-hourly flow data from 5800 USGS gaging stations across the conterminous U.S. and quantified all floodplain inundation events and their characteristic metrics (magnitude, frequency, duration, and seasonal timing) as they vary with river size and hydroclimactic region over a 10-year flow record. First, we estimated a threshold for floodplain inundation and its uncertainty at each gage station using a breakpoint analysis of each gage's stream gaging measurements — our analysis differs in method but is consistent with quantifying bankfull flow, a widely used metric in fluvial geomorphology. Second, we estimated the floodplain fraction of total river flow, the timing, and duration for each event over the 10-year flow record. As explained in the methods and the SI, we propagated the uncertainty from the breakpoint analysis to bound these metrics. Third, we extrapolated results across the U.S. stream network by building predictive relationships between floodplain inundation metrics and drainage area and compiling metrics by major river basin and stream order (1st–7th order).

We found that floodplains convey a substantial proportion (approximately 4–12.6%) of a river's annual flow. The median duration of floodplain inundation increased with river size, from less than a day in the smallest streams to many days in the largest rivers. Floodplain event inundation volumes are greater and floods last longer in large rivers, but flooding occurs much more often in small streams; as a result, large rivers and small streams individually account for similar magnitudes of river-floodplain exchange (except in the arid west where exchange decreases as stream order increases). Furthermore, more of the river's total annual flow interacts with floodplains in the smaller streams compared with larger rivers. A cumulative estimate of river-floodplain exchange suggested that greater than 90% of the river-floodplain exchange occurs in small streams that dominate the cumulative stream length within basins. An improved quantification of inundation hydrology will be useful to isolate where in the network the water-quality functions of floodplains are most important, in order to inform regulatory strategies and help to prioritize management practices that protect water resources and aquatic health of river corridors.

### Modern sea-level rise breaks 4, 000-year stability in southeastern China [^86fee9ef]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Analytical model for river discharge impact on sea level

To calculate river discharge anomaly impact on local sterodynamic sea-level change, we applied an analytical model from ref. Specifically, we applied the theory developed for Buenos Aires, in which local river channels are relatively shallow, narrow and fresh, similar to Qiantang River mouth near Hangzhou. Following the notation in ref. the sterodynamic sea-level change can be written as:in which ζ represents sterodynamic sea level, C d is the drag coefficient, U is a reference velocity scale, q is river streamflow and g is the acceleration owing to gravity. H and W are the river depth and width profiles, respectively. We use the default value for C d U from the original study (0.001 m s −1), whereas H and W for the Qiantang River were sourced from ref.

On the basis of local river discharge data from 1995–2020 provided in ref. the average discharge for wet, normal and dry years at the Qiantang River is 1,450, 1,004 and 752 m 3 s −1, respectively. Using these values, the resulting sterodynamic sea-level changes related to river discharge at various distances from the river mouth are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9c.

### Satellites reveal hotspots of global river extent change [^c6582926]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Statistical extent of rivers

To retrieve river extents, we implemented a buffering method that only included pixels historically inundated by rivers and masked out by a global lake inventory. We used the version SWORD v2 as the primary reference for global river networks and river morphological attributes. SWORD represents one congruent product of river networks consisting of river reaches (∼10 km long) and nodes (∼200 m spacing) with important hydrologic and morphological attributes (width, slope, meander length, sinuosity, and number of channels), generated by combining several global river- and satellite-related data sets. River networks and width attributes in SWORD were inherited primarily from the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) database (refer to Altenau et al.for more details about SWORD). To derive potential river water extent, we employed the seamless level-9 basins of global coverage from the HydroBASINS databaseas the basic scale of river segment division. River centerlines in SWORD were clipped by each level-9 basin polygon to form individual basin-scale river networks. To avoid sliver river centerlines and consequently unreasonably small statistical area for each basin, we dissolved short river segments to the closest nearby basin by basin code until the river centerlines in each basin are longer than the mean meander length. This results in 88,162 level-9 basin units covering SWORD, 35.5% of which are merged level-9 basins from HydroBASINS. These basin-scale river centerlines were masked by a global lake inventory retrieved from the HydroLAKES database containing 1.4 million lake polygons. We referred to the attributes of lake type, lake area, and shoreline definition in the HydroLAKES database in defining the lake inventory, and particularly kept eight super-large lake-type reservoirs (Table S2) as reservoirs rather than lakes, considering that changes around these lake-type reservoirs represent changes from rivers to reservoirs.

Chernobyl nuclear accident — geographic extent and exclusion zone contamination are described as follows: The Chernobyl plant is about 100 km (62 miles) northwest of Kyiv, Ukraine, and 310 km (193 miles) southeast of Minsk, Belarus, on the banks of the Pripyat River. In 1986, the plant exploded and ejected radioactive material into the atmosphere. In a 7,000 km2 (2,700 mi2) area, some buildings and roads had to be buried because they could not be decontaminated. The area of greatest contamination continues to be in an area 60 km (38 miles) in diameter, centered on the Chernobyl power plant. This more than 2,800 km2 (1,100 mi2) area is called the exclusion zone, where the ambient radiation dose levels range from 3 to 20 or more times greater than background levels.

### Morphometric convergence between proterozoic and post-vegetation rivers [^d2a9022d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Proterozoic rivers flowed through barren landscapes, and lacked interactions with macroscopic organisms. It is widely held that, in the absence of vegetation, fluvial systems featured barely entrenched channels that promptly widened over floodplains during floods. This hypothesis has never been tested because of an enduring lack of Precambrian fluvial-channel morphometric data. Here we show, through remote sensing and outcrop sedimentology, that deep rivers were developed in the Proterozoic, and that morphometric parameters for large fluvial channels might have remained within a narrow range over almost 2 billion years. Our data set comprises fluvial-channel forms deposited a few tens to thousands of kilometres from their headwaters, likely the record of basin- to craton-scale systems. Large Proterozoic channel forms present width:thickness ranges matching those of Phanerozoic counterparts, suggesting closer parallels between their fluvial dynamics. This outcome may better inform analyses of extraterrestrial planetary surfaces and related comparisons with pre-vegetation Earth landscapes.

### Over 200, 000 kilometers of free-flowing river habitat in Europe is altered due to impoundments [^99323c66]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

European rivers are disconnected by more than one million man-made barriers that physically limit aquatic species migration and contribute to modification of freshwater habitats. Here, a Conceptual Habitat Alteration Model for Ponding is developed to aid in evaluating the effects of impoundments on fish habitats. Fish communities present in rivers with low human impact and their broad environmental settings enable classification of European rivers into 15 macrohabitat types. These classifications, together with the estimated fish sensitivity to alteration of their habitat are used for assessing the impacts of six main barrier types (dams, weirs, sluices, culverts, fords, and ramps). Our results indicate that over 200,000km or 10% of previously free-flowing river habitat has been altered due to impoundments. Although they appear less frequently, dams, weirs and sluices cause much more habitat alteration than the other types. Their impact is regionally diverse, which is a function of barrier height, type and density, as well as biogeographical location. This work allows us to foresee what potential environmental gain or loss can be expected with planned barrier management actions in rivers, and to prioritize management actions.

### Over 200, 000 kilometers of free-flowing river habitat in Europe is altered due to impoundments [^1a128f4e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

There are over 600 thousand in-river barriers recorded in the AMBER Barrier Atlas, though modeling suggests there may be more than 1.2 million barriers within Europe. Information on barrier height is available for only 38% of recorded dams, weirs, and sluices. With this data it was estimated, conservatively, that over 203,100 km of free-flowing river habitat has been altered by barrier impounding. Major habitat alteration occurs throughout most of England, France Northwestern Europe, northern parts of Spain and Italy, and much of Eastern Europe. In contrast, rivers in the Balkans remain largely free-flowing, though currently, they face increasing threats from dam building and other anthropogenic pressures. These rivers would benefit from explicit protection to shield them against future fragmentation.

Although the calculated altered habitat length equals to 10% of the total length of rivers in Europe, it needs to be recognized that this is equivalent to the combined length of all the rivers in, for example, Italy. Since, as mentioned before, impounding is only one aspect of impact to the biodiversity of the barriers, the sum total of all habitat alteration up- and downstream will be much greater. Moreover, this broad-scale study was limited to only assessing fish habitat, without taking into account the broader impact on the biodiversity (e.g. population fragmentation and genetic structure changes) or locally specific boundary conditions. Another significant limitation is that habitat conditions investigated here are only those of adult, rearing, and growth life stages, which is probably the most resilient form of fish life. Life stages such as larval or spawning utilize usually narrower niches with specific requirements (like spawning substrate size), which are critical for biological processes. So, even if rearing and growth habitat is available, lack of habitat for other life stages may conflict with population conservation efforts for river fish fauna. Therefore, we can safely conclude that man-made barriers have profound impacts on fish habitat in European rivers.

### Restoring small water bodies to improve lake and river water quality in China [^b0aafdd6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The preferential loss of small water bodies that is offset by the gain in area of larger water bodies has changed the size-frequency distribution of water bodies, from the more fractal patterns indicative of natural landscapes to more anthropogenic landscapes characterized by a greater proportion of larger water bodies. We used the breakpoint of 10 4.5 m 2 (Fig. 1b) to develop a power function relationship between water body size and frequency for water bodies larger than 10 4.5 m 2 at the national scale (Fig. 1d). The forms of the power function are slightly different across the country (Supplementary Fig. 1); however, the ubiquity of the relationships demonstrates a pervasive pattern of loss of small water bodies (Supplementary Fig. 1). Our findings of the pervasive loss of smaller water bodies are parallel to other studies in North America, although the rate of loss in the more recent times is considerably higher in China. Of course, while focusing on the recent decades highlights the loss of small water bodies, analysis of wetland loss since the 1700 s notes that we have lost both small and large wetlands.

### Morphometric convergence between proterozoic and post-vegetation rivers [^39f04d4d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The aspect ratios (width:thickness) of observed channel forms are shown in logarithmic plots in Fig. 2a, and the salient features of each rock unit (for example, channel clustering, proximity to basement relief, geometry and inferred sinuosity) are reported in Table 1. The geometry and architecture of channel deposits at the remote and outcrop scale are summarized in Figs 3 and 4. Overall, the aspect ratio data set displays a positively skewed, Gaussian distribution with most values between 20 and 60 (Fig. 2b). A linear regression derived from the entire data set indicates that:

where W and T represent width and thickness of channel forms, respectively, and ± 29 indicates the data set's s.d. (R 2 = 0.6162). Since, by definition, a channel form must have values of W and T greater than zero, the linear regression includes the W = 0, T = 0 point (Fig. 2a).

Roughly 85% of the data set is represented by channel forms hundreds to thousands of metres wide from the Burnside River Formation and Stoer Group (Fig. 2a and Table 1). There, channel forms are grouped in clusters located within prominent basement palaeo-valleys (Fig. 3a, c), and include low-sinuosity, active-channel fills (Fig. 4a, c). In both the Burnside River Formation and Stoer Group, extensive erosional surfaces, wider than any individual channel form, indicate that rivers flowed through large valleys, both alluvial and incised on bedrock. These features point to entrenchment and clusteringof large alluvial channels incapable of significant lateral mobility within drainage systems whose position was significantly confined by basement topography. These channel clusters were preserved from a few tens to about a hundred kilometres from their headwaters, suggesting relatively proximal alluvial tracts. Channel forms are significantly thicker than the tallest bar slip-faces preserved therein (Table 1), indicating a dominant bed aggradation during the active-channel lifespan, or that the observed channel-fill thickness exceeded the original channel depth at any one time. Since lateral migration was limited, so was channel mobility, and the width of preserved channel forms is thus considered a valid approximation of original channel width.

### Over 200, 000 kilometers of free-flowing river habitat in Europe is altered due to impoundments [^4fdb07f8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 7
Hypothetical example of application of our results.

We adapted restoration alternatives analysis to demonstrate the impact of five barriers in a watershed located on the main stem of the river. It demonstrates how much each barrier alters the free-flowing riverine habitat (1-wRHp) and how much of the upstream river length is no longer available for migrating fish. Barrier 5 is the closest to the river mouth.

Hence our results inform not only on specific strategies, such as locations where removal of barriers and improvement of riparian zones are desirable, but also provide a quantitative backbone for alternatives analysis. The wRHp can serve as a metric for comparing future management scenarios like it was demonstrated in a case study of the AMBER project, where lowering of Włocławek Dam on the Vistula River to 30% of current height could be selected as most promising fish ecological restoration alternative.

Our pan-European FCMacHT classification provides a consistent natural riverine habitat taxonomy for Europe, informed by robust data analysis of fish catch data (electrofishing surveys) and key environmental variables available at a continental scale. It allows differentiating barrier impacts according to the fish community structure expected at their geographical locations, documenting that not only barrier density matters in landscape-level assessment of damage. It is also important for prioritization of management actions. We envisage multiple uses of the FCMacHT typology and barrier impact assessment, from environmental and ecological studies, through river restoration planning, to water resources management and policy implementation (e.g. WFD or Water4All Partnership Program). Our barrier impact assessment is complementary to the guidelines for river-basin management plans, which focus more on the passability of fish passage than habitat impact. It is our opinion that the determination of free-flowing river status (for which criteria are currently developed) should be tied to the FCMacHT characteristics, which define the habitat needs of expected fish community composition.

### Emergence of core-peripheries in networks [^86ebea5d]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Once a link is pruned, its load is redistributed through the next best (shortest path) alternative, which potentially turns these alternative links more beneficial than they were before. In the case where several paths are of the same length, one is chosen at random. The load redistribution process can be explained in two steps. Firstly, when a link is removed, the load is routed through the next shortest path available between the nodes. Secondly, every link on the next available path will have to absorb the incoming load as it moves from source to sink. The reason for choosing the shortest path as the next available path is because normally in a transport network the length of travel times and in most passenger driven networks convenience is of primary importance to both the consumers and service providers. However, a robustness analysis of two other alternatives (random path and second shortest path) shows that CP features are observed in the critical window and the robustness of the networks in different regimes remains the same (see Supplementary Fig. 3). The pruning process eventually gives rise to a network only comprising essential links.

### Similarity of stream width distributions across headwater systems [^ce3a5e7c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The differences between the model outputs and the observations likely stem from simplifying assumptions regarding runoff yield, bankfull channel widths, hyporheic zone transmissivity, and hydraulic resistance, none of which were measured in the field. Perhaps the least well constrained of these factors is the variability in hyporheic zone transmissivity, a fundamental controlling property of stream hydromorphology and stream generation. As an example, in the Elder Creek catchment, a coarse-grained poorly sorted valley-bottom sedimentary prism may be transmitting substantial hyporheic flow down valley resulting in an unexpectedly low drainage density and small, often discontinuous streams. In contrast, Kings Creek mainly contains bedrock channels and a more fine-grained valley-bottom sedimentary prism. This variability in subsurface flow is unaccounted for in the model, and may contribute to the better model fits in some catchments (e.g. Kings) than in others (e.g. Elder). In the future, a better understanding of underlying groundwater processes will improve our ability to predict headwater stream generation and hydromorphology.

The measured distributions of stream widths are remarkably similar given the wide variety of hydrologic conditions present during the various surveys (Fig. 3i). This insensitivity of stream width distributions to changes in catchment runoff stems from the counteracting processes of lateral stream widening and longitudinal ADN expansion. With increasing discharge, streams will simultaneously widen in place and extend upstream such that individual stream segments will increase in stream order as tributary channels are reactivated. As a result, the proportional abundance of narrow streams remains roughly constant (Fig. 5). Thus, if the cumulative length (L) of an ADN is known, the total stream surface area (SA) may be approximated using the mean lognormal fit in Fig. 3i,

Fig. 5
Conceptual model of relationship between changing streamflow conditions and the stream width distributions. As discharge increases (Q 1 < Q 2 < Q 3): a wetted width increases at a representative channel cross section; b the ADN extends into narrower lower-order channels, increasing the total length of narrow streams (dotted lines represent channels without flow); and c the phenomena described by a and b manifest in the similar width distributions independent of streamflow conditions

Planform morphometrics of river meanders as a function of riparian vegetation density.

a – d Meander Cartesian wavelength (L *), intrinsic wavelength (ℓ *), amplitude (A), and radius of curvature (R *) are plotted against the channel width averaged along individual meander bends (B *) for unvegetated, semi-vegetated, and vegetated river data separately. Reduced-size shaded markers in the background represent data of individual meander bends (only 50% of data points are plotted to improve readability), whereas larger markers denote aggregated data for each river in our dataset. Bends characterized by sinuosity χ < 1.2 are filtered out. Continuous lines represent the power-law fit of aggregated data points obtained through linear regressions on log-transformed data. Power-law regression coefficients (a and b) and R-squared coefficients (denoted as r 2 to avoid confusion with the meander radius) are also reported in each panel for individual vegetation classes. e – k Boxplots and empirical probability distributions, plotted as exceedance probability, of meander width-adjusted cartesian wavelength (L = L * / B *), width-adjusted intrinsic wavelength (ℓ = ℓ * / B *), width-adjusted amplitude (A = A * / B *), width-adjusted radius of curvature (R = R * / B *), sinuosity (χ), asymmetry, and width-adjusted curvature (C = C * ⋅ B *). In each boxplot, reduced-size shaded markers in the background represent data of individual meander bends, whereas larger markers denote aggregated data for each river in our dataset. The median of river-aggregated data is denoted by the central mark, while the lower and upper boundaries of the box represent the 25 th and 75 th percentiles, respectively. The whiskers reach out to encompass the most extreme data points that are not identified as outliers. In exceedance probability plots, thin lines denote the distribution of individual rivers, whereas thicker lines represent the ensemble probability for unvegetated, semi-vegetated, and vegetated rivers. The inset in the lower-right corner shows the extraction of individual morphometric variables based on a synthetic meandering river reach.

Soil- and waterborne infections in African game park travel — freshwater exposure poses schistosomiasis risk, river trips are risky, and ocean or well-chlorinated pools are not. Freshwater lakes, ponds, and rivers all pose a risk for exposure to Schistosoma species. Travelers should consider all freshwater sources to be contaminated and avoid bathing, swimming, wading, or other freshwater contact in disease-endemic countries. River trips (e.g. Nile River white water rafting) present a risk for schistosomiasis, whereas swimming in the ocean or well-chlorinated pools does not pose a risk for schistosomiasis.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^30e99d16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Engineering multilayer networks that efficiently connect sets of points in space is a crucial task in all practical applications that concern the transport of people or the delivery of goods. Unfortunately, our current theoretical understanding of the shape of such optimal transport networks is quite limited. Not much is known about how the topology of the optimal network changes as a function of its size, the relative efficiency of its layers, and the cost of switching between layers. Here, we show that optimal networks undergo sharp transitions from symmetric to asymmetric shapes, indicating that it is sometimes better to avoid serving a whole area to save on switching costs. Also, we analyze the real transportation networks of the cities of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto using our theoretical framework and find that they are farther away from their optimal shapes as traffic congestion increases.

### Amplification of downstream flood stage due to damming of fine-grained rivers [^1e149daf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The mean values of C f are used to represent the average resistance conditions for pre- and post- damming. Substituting mean C f values into Eq. 1 and using the average channel slope at Huayuankou (S = 3 × 10 −4), the theoretical predictions agree well with field measurements of water depth at Huayuankou (Fig. 4c). Importantly, the post-damming water depth for a given flood discharge (per-unit-width) q w, increases on average by a factor of 1.4. In the extreme scenario (i.e. C f = 0.01), the increase is a factor of 2.0, which is an occurrence that will become more frequent as the bed continues to coarsen (i.e. relation in Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the water depth in the non-impacted reach of the LYR (Lijin), where grain size remains similar to the pre-dam condition, shows no change (Supplementary Fig. S4). Bed coarsening thus coincides with increasing dune size and roughness, which increases channel resistance. In turn, water depth is elevated for the same per-unit-width flood discharge.

### Coastal flooding will disproportionately impact people on river deltas [^b26fe317]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Delta area sensitivity and validation

Our methodology draws a hard boundary by separating deltaic from nondeltaic land. This boundary is geomorphically defined, and population centers may straddle this boundary or lie just outside of it. A softer approach that also counts the population near the delta polygons may yield different estimates. To assess the sensitivity of our results to our choices of delta extent points, we create new polygons that are twice as large as the original by isotropically dilating the shape. This way we can also capture the population immediately adjacent to deltas. When we use these dilated polygons, we calculate a new global delta habitable area of 1,060,000 km 2 and population of 522 million. The population increases, as expected, but the population density stays relatively constant (492 ppl/km 2 instead of 478 ppl/km 2). This suggest to us that we are not missing any major, densely populated areas adjacent to our delta polygons. Note that even though we doubled the delta polygon area in this sensitivity test, habitable area did not double (increased from 710,179 to 1,060,000 km 2) because it is always smaller than the polygon area because it does not include water bodies.

### Hydropower capacity factors trending down in the United States [^b495af20]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A possible major driver of long-term CF decline is a change in reservoir operations. We divide operational change into two subcategories: operational change to support river and reservoir needs (non-power operations), and operational change to support power grid needs. Non-power operations may include river ecology enhancement, navigation, recreation, water supply (including municipal, industrial, and irrigation water), and flood control objectives. Operational changes for these objectives can affect hydropower generation by increasing spilled energy, either directly (e.g. desired spill to promote fish passage) or indirectly (e.g. undesired spill resulting from changes to reservoir control curves). Although one can find anecdotal information on such changes for high-profile dam projects, a lack of consistent, quantified data on such operational changes prevents us from linking CF trends to operational change across a large sample of dams. Determining the possible timing of such changes in operations is also challenging since these may or may not occur as part of hydropower relicensing.

### Storing and managing water for the environment is more efficient than mimicking natural flows [^8e8f00d8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Few dams have been built specifically for environmental water storage in the USA. An example is Nevada's Marble Bluff Dam on the Truckee River, which provides water for endangered fish migration via the Pyramid Lake fishway and curtails streambed erosion caused by Pyramid Lake level decline. More precedent exists for allocating storage space for environmental water in Australia. The 2007 Commonwealth Water Act allows water to be purchased and stored for environmental water entitlements. Environmental water can be released to augment streamflow, stored as carryover for the following year, or traded for equal or greater environmental benefit in regulated basins. Carryover increases the likelihood of environmental water availability in dry years and allows infrequent, high-magnitude pulse flows to reintroduce hydrologic variability. Similar ideas have been proposed in parts of the USA. For example, California's 2014 Water Storage Investment Program provides $2.7 billion to support new surface and underground water storage for public benefits, including storage and management of environmental water. Sites Reservoir, a proposed off-stream surface storage project, is under consideration and, if built, would provide 296 million cubic meters (Mm 3) of storage, with around 17% of inflows passed through (or exchanged) to meet downstream environmental water demands. Additional proposals include establishing groundwater banks or raising existing dams to create storage space for environmental water.

We evaluate environmental water efficiency and trade-offs to other water demands from two management approaches: (1) pass-through of 10–40% of inflows through reservoirs for downscaled natural flows, or (2) allocating 10–40% of inflow and 10–40% of reservoir storage capacity for environmental demands(not including dead pool and seasonal flood storage space). In some runs, we constrain minimum reservoir storage to increase the likelihood of cold water in storage for downstream water temperature objectives. These alternatives are exemplified by new flow objectives for California's San Joaquin River. The California State Water Resources Control Board adopted amendments that require water users to pass through or release an average of 40% of February–June unimpaired flows on the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries if water users fail to negotiate 'voluntary agreements' to reduce water use that is approved by the Board. Further upstream, the San Joaquin River Restoration Program has a Restoration Administrator who manages a percentage of unimpaired inflow, which can be stored and released to provide ecosystem benefits.

World Water Day is sponsored by the United Nations and observed each year on March 22. This year, World Water Day focuses on wastewater, which includes sewage, storm water, and discarded water used in the community (1). Many developing countries have inadequate wastewater management strategies because they lack resources, infrastructure, available technology, or space. Untreated wastewater in these countries is often disposed of directly into rivers, lakes, or oceans, polluting the environment and increasing the risk for disease transmission (2).

### Mechanisms of carbon storage in mountainous headwater rivers [^d82c6697]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Published research emphasizes rapid downstream export of terrestrial carbon from mountainous headwater rivers, but little work focuses on mechanisms that create carbon storage along these rivers, or on the volume of carbon storage. Here we estimate organic carbon stored in diverse valley types of headwater rivers in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA. We show that low-gradient, broad valley bottoms with old-growth forest or active beaver colonies store the great majority of above- and below-ground carbon. These laterally unconfined valley segments constitute < 25% of total river length, but store ∼75% of the carbon. Floodplain sediment and coarse wood dominate carbon storage. Our estimates of riverine carbon storage represent a previously undocumented but important carbon sink. Our results indicate that: not all mountainous rivers rapidly export carbon; not all valley segments are equally important in carbon storage; and historical changes in riverine complexity have likely reduced carbon storage.

### Storing and managing water for the environment is more efficient than mimicking natural flows [^7b7cdf87]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Dams and reservoirs are often needed to provide environmental water and maintain suitable water temperatures for downstream ecosystems. Here, we evaluate if water allocated to the environment, with storage to manage it, might allow environmental water to more reliably meet ecosystem objectives than a proportion of natural flow. We use a priority-based water balance operations model and a reservoir temperature model to evaluate 1) pass-through of a portion of reservoir inflow versus 2) allocating a portion of storage capacity and inflow for downstream flow and stream temperature objectives. We compare trade-offs to other senior and junior priority water demands. In many months, pass-through flows exceed the volumes needed to meet environmental demands. Storage provides the ability to manage release timing to use water efficiently for environmental benefit, with a co-benefit of increasing reservoir storage to protect cold-water at depth in the reservoir.

### Validating the global surgery geographical accessibility indicator: differences in modeled versus patient-reported travel times [^2b94b683]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

GIS methodology

We reconciled patient-reported village names with official location names from the National Institute of Statistics Rwanda. For each of the 612 villages in Kirehe District, we calculated the geographical centroid. Patients matched to that village were assumed to be starting their journey at this central location. The geographic boundaries of Rwandan villages were obtained from the Global Administrative Areas database.

GIS estimated travel times were computed using the WHO tool AccessMod, software version 5.0. AccessMod calculates the shortest possible travel time from every point in the analyzed region, taking travel speed into account. The region is discretized into cells, which are assigned a travel speed. The analysis was performed with a cell size of roughly 100 m. In order to emulate previous GIS studies, roads were classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary roads, and the travel speed was assumed to be 100, 50, and 30 km/h, respectively. All remaining cells were set to a speed of 5 km/h (approximate walking speed), apart from those representing rivers or bodies of water, which were set as non-traversable. Data on the Rwandan road network, rivers, and bodies of water were obtained from OpenStreetMaps.

Two scenarios were calculated. In the first, patients were assumed to travel the most direct route possible from home to Kirehe District Hospital. We refer to this model as the "standard model" as this is the pathway patients are assumed to take in most studies that utilize GIS methodology. In the second, patients were assumed to first travel to their assigned health center, and then from the health center to the hospital, as this is the prescribed referral pattern in the Rwanda public health sector.

### 3D characterisation and quantification of an offshore freshened groundwater system in the canterbury bight [^ca426c20]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Although offshore freshened groundwater (OFG) systems have been documented in numerous continental margins worldwide, their geometry, controls and emplacement dynamics remain poorly constrained. Here we integrate controlled-source electromagnetic, seismic reflection and borehole data with hydrological modelling to quantitatively characterise a previously unknown OFG system near Canterbury, New Zealand. The OFG system consists of one main, and two smaller, low salinity groundwater bodies. The main body extends up to 60km from the coast and a seawater depth of 110m. We attribute along-shelf variability in salinity to permeability heterogeneity due to permeable conduits and normal faults, and to recharge from rivers during sea level lowstands. A meteoric origin of the OFG and active groundwater migration from onshore are inferred. However, modelling results suggest that the majority of the OFG was emplaced via topographically-driven flow during sea level lowstands in the last 300 ka. Global volumetric estimates of OFG will be significantly revised if active margins, with steep coastal topographies like the Canterbury margin, are considered.

Neural network model

The CNN used in this paper consists of 4 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The number of output channels for each convolutional layer is 32, 32, 64 and 64, respectively. They all have stride 1. The filter sizes in the first three layers are 3 × 3, and for the fourth layer, it is 1 × 1. All convolutional layers are followed by a ReLU activation and a 2D max pooling layer with size 2 × 2 and stride 2 × 2. For the fully connected layers, the number of output feature for each layer is 128, 64 and 1, respectively. The input image size is 80 × 300 × C with different number of channels C. For all ESMs as input, C = 32. For all reanalysis input, C = 3. For mean ESMs or mean reanalysis as input, C = 1. The network output is a scalar. We set the training batch size as 64 and use Adam optimizer with initial learning rate 5 × 10 −5 and weight decay 1 × 10 −4. We use squared loss function and the network tries to minimize the loss function: where T is the number of training samples,∊is the t th input with width W, height H and number of channels C, y t is the t th ground truth target, w = {w 1,…, w L } is the set of weights from all layers. The network output, whereis the mapping function for the l th layer in the neural network. Predictive uncertainty was estimated as the standard deviation of five repeated CNN predictions with different learning rates.

### A stochastic model of randomly accelerated walkers for human mobility [^8cd8ff99]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Random acceleration kicks

In contrast with the assumption underlying equation (2), accelerations are not uncorrelated: in Fig. 3a, we indeed observe that an average trip can be separated into a first half where one uses progressively faster roads and a second half with deceleration until the velocity reaches back the base speed at time t. We use this simple representation in a stochastic model (see the schematic in Fig. 3b) and make the following assumptions. The transportation network is modelled by n layers L n, corresponding to different travel speeds v n (we neglect saturation effects, see Methods section and Supplementary methods). The speed differences between layers are taken constant and equal to δv, and the speed on layer L k is then v k = v 0 + kδv. An individual starts then her trip of duration t in the layer L 0 with base speed v 0, and we assume that there are two phases in a trip, acceleration and deceleration, of roughly the same duration. In both the ascending and descending phases, we define a Poissonian process where all individuals have the same probability per unit time p to jump to the successive layer and to change their speed.

Within this model, we can estimate the maximal speed v m = v 0 + k (t m) δv, where k (t m) is the number of jumps at mid trajectory t m = t /2, and get approximatively the average speed≈(v 0 + v m)/2. Since the process is Poissonian, we have 〈 k (t m)〉 = pt m and the average speed is given by

where the brackets denote the average over the Poisson variable k. The average speed thus grows linearly with t, in agreement with empirical observations. Remarkably enough, this model allows us to predict also the shape of the conditional probability distribution. Indeed, the number of jumps k is distributed following the Poisson distributionwith λ = pt /2. Using the Gamma function as the natural analytic continuation of the factorial k! = Γ(1+ k), we obtain the distribution

### Injury patterns of mass casualty incidents involving high-speed passenger ferries presenting to accident and emergency departments in hong kong: a retrospective review [^9a3b04ad]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Accidents involving high-speed passenger ferries have the potential to cause mass-casualty incidents (MCIs), yet there is a lack of relevant studies available to inform hospital disaster preparedness planning.

Objective

The objective was to study the injury patterns and outcomes of MCI victims involved in high-speed passenger ferry accidents in Hong Kong waters.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015. All MCIs involving high-speed passenger ferries were captured from the Marine Department of Hong Kong. Victims of all age who were sent to the accident and emergency departments (A&Es) of seven public hospitals around Victoria Harbour, including three trauma centres, were identified from electronic disaster registries of the study hospitals. Data on injury patterns and outcomes were extracted from medical records with the Injury Severity Score (ISS) calculated for each victim. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare medians of the ISS across different mechanisms of injury. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors for major trauma (ISS ≥ 16).

Results

During the study period, eight MCIs involving high-speed passenger ferries were reported and 512 victims (median age: 44 years, age range: 2–85 years) were sent to the study hospitals. The A&E triage categories were Cat 1, 3.1%; Cat 2, 4.3%; Cat 3, 19.3%; Cat 4, 72.9%; and Cat 5, 0.4%, respectively. The median ISS was 1.0 (interquartile range: 1.0–2.0). Fourteen victims (2.7%) had an ISS ≥ 16 and age was the only independent predictor for major trauma (OR 1.06, p = 0.025, 95% CI 1.01–1.11). Trauma call was activated at A&E for 11 victims. In total, 100 victims (19.5%) were admitted to the study hospitals, including 19 (3.5%) and 15 (2.9%) who required surgery and intensive care unit stay, respectively. Eleven victims (2.1%) died, mostly due to drowning.

Conclusion

MCIs involving high-speed passenger ferries can result in a sudden surge in demand for both A&E and in-patient care, though the majority of victims may have minor injuries. Better access to lifejackets and mandatory seatbelt use may help to reduce injuries and deaths.

### A stochastic model of randomly accelerated walkers for human mobility [^6455554c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Measuring the free-flow speed

Each trajectory is sampled at a spatial scale at most equal to 2 km or, in highways, at a time scale of 30 s. Using trajectory reconstructions, we estimate for each road the average speed for all the trajectories passing through that road. Using the distribution of the travel speed, the free-flow speed of a road is defined as the speed corresponding to the 85% of percentile. As a matter of fact, the free-flow speed corresponds to trajectories carried out during the night and the choice of 85% of percentile takes into account the individual heterogeneity: in many cases there are individuals driving at a speed much larger than the average and that are neglected in the computation of an average free-flow speed.

In Fig. 3a, we have computed the free-flow velocity for the used roads in each trajectory and for different travel time durations (0.5 ± 0.1 h, 1.0 ± 0.1 h and 1.5 ± 0.1 h).

Details of the model

The model proposed here assumes that urban mobility is performed at a baseline speed of v 0 ≈18 km h −1. Very short trips hardly reach the base speed v 0 that we impose in our model. For this reason, in all the measures proposed in this paper, we considered only trips longer than 1 km and with duration larger than 5 min.

The upper bound of 130 km h −1 limits the number of jumps to k = (130 km h −1 − v 0)/ δv ≈3. We have a jumping rate of order p ′≈1 jump per hour and we expect significant deviations from our prediction for trips longer than 4 h. For such long trips, one cannot in principle approximate the area below the step function in Fig. 3b with a triangle. Indeed, the Poisson fit in Fig. 4 overestimates the frequency of trips faster than 110 km h −1 for t = 120 and 180 min. In Supplementary methods, we show that if the acceleration kicks are limited by a finite number of layers, the speed grows linearly for small times and saturates to a finite limiting speed (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This saturation can be clearly observed at national level (see Fig. 2) and for five out of six of the cities represented in Supplementary Fig. 7.

### How urban form impacts flooding [^9ca212f0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the observed complexity in urban form-induced flood behavior, we consider the mass and momentum conservation laws for dense urban forms, where the bottom shear is negligible compared to the distributed form drag. In a spatially large enough control volume that sufficiently represents the flow heterogeneity, the average gravitational force balances the resultant form drag in the steady-state limit, Fig. 3 (a). In this case, while gravity (g) drives the flow with average vertical height through available urban pore space (A ϕ), the drag resists the flow. This resistive force is proportional to the drag coefficient (C D), the so-called projected area, and spatially averaged velocity squared component. The average perpendicular component of flow velocity (v) is zero, and its magnitude should be smaller than u, meaning. Invoking mass conservation, we can eliminate the drag dependence on velocity and estimate this force using average height. Therefore, through force balance, we can estimate the average flood height as follows, The main challenge in determining the average flood height pertains to the exact measurement of projected width (W p), an extensive quantity that depends on urban form. Therefore, A ϕ 3 / W p can be viewed as a characteristic length scale whose size is proportional to the building size, A ϕ 3 / W p = D /Π 2, where similar to, is a dimensionless function of the building arrangements (r i) in the urban layout. For the maximum 10% slope considered in this study, the approximation ofintroduces less than 1% error.

The stream widths of all surveys are well characterized by lognormal distributions and exhibit a mode of 32 ± 7 cm (all confidence intervals 1 σ, Fig. 3). The mode width, determined using a Gaussian density kernel, is strikingly similar across all basins and does not significantly correlate with hydrologic conditions (R 2 = 0.15, p = 0.39), basin relief (R 2 = 0.23, p = 0.28), catchment area (R 2 = 0.04, p = 0.69), or drainage density (R 2 = 0.19, p = 0.33). Gamma and Weibull distributions also effectively describe the spread of stream width data (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). The median first-order stream width is 32 ± 8 cm. No instances of overbank flooding were observed during the surveys but disconnections in the ADN were common, particularly in first-order streams.

### Collaborative management of the grand Ethiopian renaissance dam increases economic benefits and resilience [^db8f8d02]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

CGE models typically have an annual time step, but river system models run at smaller time intervals (e.g. monthly, weekly, daily, hourly). River system models have finer temporal resolutions to enable simulation of the spatial and temporal constraints of river basin resource systems, i.e. to better capture the consequences of stochastic hydrology and infrastructure constraints (e.g. reservoir storage). Although the iterative framework presented in Supplementary Fig. 6 is based on a monthly river system model, models with smaller time steps could also be used. The river system model uses the changes in irrigation water demand, municipal water demand, electricity demand, and non-hydro electricity generation capacity, computed by the economy-wide modeling component, to scale the corresponding water and electricity parameters. The river system model then performs a monthly simulation over a 12-month period based on monthly river flow data and the modified water and electricity demands and non-hydro capacity. The river system model then computes the fractions of annual irrigation and municipal water demands that can be met in addition to the annual hydro and non-hydro electricity generation. Water supply and electricity generation depend on the spatial and temporal availability of natural resources (e.g. river flow), infrastructure capacities (e.g. non-hydro and hydro capacities), and infrastructure operating rules.

After the river system modeling component determines water supply fractions and electricity generation, two tests are performed to determine (a) whether the models have converged and (b) when to stop iterating. These tests indicate whether to proceed to the next iteration or accept the current state of the CGE and the river system models as a solution for the annual time step. Passing either of the two tests terminates the iterative convergence process. The CGE and the river system models pass the convergence test when the difference between the current and the previous iteration's values of an annual economy, water, or energy metric falls below a certain convergence threshold. The value of the threshold depends on the desired level of accuracy and available computational capacity. The stopping test imposes a maximum number of iterations at which the current state of the CGE and the river system models is considered a solution for the annual time step. The stopping test acts as a safeguard to prevent excessively long iteration over one annual time step. The convergence test is performed starting from the second iteration. Thus, at least two iterations are performed within each annual time step to ensure convergence.

### Coastal sedimentation across north America doubled in the 20century despite river dams [^2581d444]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Downstream sediment sources to coastal depocenters

The researchers who collected and processed the cores did not report an increase in the depth of surface mixing, grain size, bioturbation, and/or the density of accumulating particles, factors that could explain the magnitude of the increase in MAR (see Supplementary Note 1). This implies that the MAR increase, observed on continental shelves and estuaries, was caused by an increase in sediment flux to the depocenters. Dams intercept a large percentage of the suspended sediment load from the watersheds up-river; however, supplemental sources of fine-grained alluvial sediments down-river of dam emplacement sites have been widely documented resulting from river incision and bank erosion –. Additional primary sediment sources in lower rivers from urbanization, agricultural development, and changes in riparian vegetationhave also been observed in shoreline-proximal areas. The transport of these additional fine-grained sediment sources to coastal depocenters is highly non-linear in time and spaceand may involve lag times from decades to centuries and net transport velocities of < 10 m yr −1. Pulses in fine-grained sediment transportand ephemeral discharges from tributarieshave also been observed in response to increased precipitation in the lower watershed and the mobilization of legacy sediments. The post 1950 population growth in coastal counties is an indicator of degradationand is commonly associated with increased runoff from land development and constructionand increased erosion from land-cover changesin shoreline-proximal areas. The sediments from eroding shorelines and degrading intertidal habitats are secondary sources to coastal depocenters, but for most of the sites this source is too low to explain the increase in MAR given the disproportionately large area of the depocenter relative to the area of shoreline loss (orders of magnitude difference) and that shoreline erosion increases the size of the depocenter. The exception being the coastal depocenters of Louisiana where these sources promoted the MAR increase post 1950 despite the distinct reduction in Mississippi River flow and suspended-sediment flux to the margin, which contributed to the loss of wetlands. Rapid permafrost decay in river catchments from warming climate is a source of sediment to high latitude depocenters and contributed to the MAR increase in Nastapoka Sound. This study falls short of identifying the relative additional contributions of specific downstream sediment sources to coastal depocenters; a necessary next step because each sediment source has a different implication for coastal-hazard mitigation, the carbon cycle, and the transport of contaminants attached to fine-grained particles.

### Elevational differences in hydrogeomorphic disturbance regime influence sediment residence times within mountain river corridors [^31a16b98]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To examine potential controls on floodplain residence time and fine sediment flux, we calculated numerous variables along each of the eight field study reaches. Mean floodplain (w v) and channel width (w c), valley confinement (w c w v −1), stream gradient (S), stream power (Ω = ρgSQ), unit stream power (ω = Ω w c −1), and mean sample depth (d) were calculated along each reach (where ρ is the density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity) for statistical analysis and for comparison with results from lidar differencing.

Lidar differencing and analysis

A digital elevation model (DEM) of difference (DoD)with 0.75-m resolution and a geomorphic change detection error threshold of ± 0.34 m was used to calculate erosion and deposition between 2012 pre-flood and 2013 post-flood lidar below 2515-m elevation, as previously described by Rathburn et al. DEM with 0.75-m resolution along the lower portion of the study basin were used from pre-flood lidar acquired through Boulder County in the state of Colorado and post-flood lidar acquired through the Federal Emergency Management Act. The maximum vertical error in the DoD was propagated through estimated sediment volumes to provide a maximum range of error in results presented.

The pre-event lidar and 2012 US Geological Survey (USGS) 1-ft resolution orthoimagery were used to delineate channel width based on the presence of water and unvegetated gravel bars. Flowlines generated from the USGS 10-m resolution DEMs were used to calculate cumulative drainage area and 1-m pre-event lidar was used for all other analyses. The Fluvial Corridors toolboxwas used to delineate the floodplain, which was segmented into 155 reaches ~ 100 m in length. Floodplain segments were used to extract floodplain and channel length and area, drainage area (A), and elevation. These parameters were used to calculate mean floodplain (w v) and channel width (w c), valley confinement (w c w v −1), stream gradient (S), stream power (Ω = ρgSQ), unit stream power (ω = Ω w c −1), and the downstream gradient in stream power, where ρ is the density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity.

### A stochastic model of randomly accelerated walkers for human mobility [^1d5c20e6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Recent studies of human mobility largely focus on displacements patterns and power law fits of empirical long-tailed distributions of distances are usually associated to scale-free superdiffusive random walks called Lévy flights. However, drawing conclusions about a complex system from a fit, without any further knowledge of the underlying dynamics, might lead to erroneous interpretations. Here we show, on the basis of a data set describing the trajectories of 780,000 private vehicles in Italy, that the Lévy flight model cannot explain the behaviour of travel times and speeds. We therefore introduce a class of accelerated random walks, validated by empirical observations, where the velocity changes due to acceleration kicks at random times. Combining this mechanism with an exponentially decaying distribution of travel times leads to a short-tailed distribution of distances which could indeed be mistaken with a truncated power law. These results illustrate the limits of purely descriptive models and provide a mechanistic view of mobility.

### Martian stepped-delta formation by rapid water release [^88cba639]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Deltas and alluvial fans preserved on the surface of Mars provide an important record of surface water flow. Understanding how surface water flow could have produced the observed morphology is fundamental to understanding the history of water on Mars. To date, morphological studies have provided only minimum time estimates for the longevity of martian hydrologic events, which range from decades to millions of years. Here we use sand flume studies to show that the distinct morphology of martian stepped (terraced) deltas could only have originated from a single basin-filling event on a timescale of tens of years. Stepped deltas therefore provide a minimum and maximum constraint on the duration and magnitude of some surface flows on Mars. We estimate that the amount of water required to fill the basin and deposit the delta is comparable to the amount of water discharged by large terrestrial rivers, such as the Mississippi. The massive discharge, short timescale, and the associated short canyon lengths favour the hypothesis that stepped fans are terraced delta deposits draped over an alluvial fan and formed by water released suddenly from subsurface storage.

### A global map of travel time to cities to assess inequalities in accessibility in 2015 [^3a128e66]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.

### Rapid groundwater decline and some cases of recovery in aquifers globally [^8c4f6f5c]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Groundwater resources are vital to ecosystems and livelihoods. Excessive groundwater withdrawals can cause groundwater levels to decline 1–10, resulting in seawater intrusion 11, land subsidence 12,13, streamflow depletion 14–16 and wells running dry 17. However, the global pace and prevalence of local groundwater declines are poorly constrained, because in situ groundwater levels have not been synthesized at the global scale. Here we analyse in situ groundwater-level trends for 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems in countries that encompass approximately 75% of global groundwater withdrawals 18. We show that rapid groundwater-level declines (> 0.5myear -1) are widespread in the twenty-first century, especially in dry regions with extensive croplands. Critically, we also show that groundwater-level declines have accelerated over the past four decades in 30% of the world's regional aquifers. This widespread acceleration in groundwater-level deepening highlights an urgent need for more effective measures to address groundwater depletion. Our analysis also reveals specific cases in which depletion trends have reversed following policy changes, managed aquifer recharge and surface-water diversions, demonstrating the potential for depleted aquifer systems to recover.

To help assure potability, drainage should be away from a well, the casings of the well should be sealed with grout, and research suggests that a minimum of 10 feet of soil is essential to filter unwanted biologic organisms; wells should be protected from surface water entering directly into the top of the well, groundwater entering below ground level without filtering through at least 10 feet of earth, and surface water entering the space between the well casing and surrounding soil. Additional considerations include that in areas with karst topography, wells of any type are a health risk because of the long distances that both chemical and biologic contaminants can travel, that a well should be located in such a way that it is accessible for maintenance, inspection, and pump or pipe replacement when necessary, and that driven wells are typically installed in sand or soil and do not penetrate base rock.

Health insurance while traveling — discussion checklist outlines clinician and traveler actions. Travel medicine specialists should "Identify potential medical needs abroad, including health risks based on itinerary and destination, duration of travel, method of transportation (e.g., air-, land-, or water-based), lodgings or accommodations, and planned activities" and "Discuss the differences between travel disruption, travel health, and medical evacuation insurance", and advise that "Travelers should be prepared to pay out of pocket at the time services are rendered, in some instances even before care is received, and then provide insurers with copies of bills and invoices to initiate reimbursement afterward", and that "Travelers should plan for potential emergencies in advance by identifying healthcare professionals at the destination who see international travelers". Traveler responsibilities include, before travel, to "Review domestic health insurance policies to determine what medical services are or are not covered overseas", "Purchase supplemental travel health insurance coverage based on potential medical needs and health risks", and "Identify medical service providers at destination", and to "Check with the insurance company to confirm that they reimburse for out-of-pocket payments made to healthcare professionals abroad… travelers must pay up front (with cash or credit card) for all services received". During travel, travelers should "Carry insurance policy identity cards (including travel health insurance or medical evacuation insurance) and insurance claim forms while traveling" and "Keep copies of all summary records, charges, and receipts for medical care received". After travel, travelers should "Promptly seek medical attention upon return to the United States and at the first sign of any unexpected complications from care received internationally" and "Submit charges and receipts to the insurance provider".

### Storing and managing water for the environment is more efficient than mimicking natural flows [^af0a25fd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Environmental objective performance by water management alternative and proportion of assets.

Panels show environmental baseflow shortages (A), flow shaping shortages (B), and July – September reservoir release temperatures (C) for all environmental water management alternatives. EWB = Environmental Water Budget. Boxes show upper and lower quartiles, bold horizontal lines show medians, whiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range, and dots show outliers.

With 40% pass-through, flow performance improves. In that alternative, environmental baseflow deliveries average 90% of demand and flow shaping deliveries average 76% of demand in dry years (Fig. 3A), and environmental baseflows average 94% of demand and flow shaping average 68% of demand in wet years (Fig. 3B). The interquartile range of shortages is 12–208 Mm 3 /yr for baseflows (Fig. 4A) and 153–339 Mm 3 /yr for flow shaping (Fig. 4B). However, in many months, pass-through flows exceed the volumes needed to meet environmental baseflow and flow shaping demands. Without storage, there is no ability to manage the timing of releases to use water efficiently for environmental benefit.

The pass-through approach results in clear trade-offs among environmental objectives. As the portion of pass-through increases, performance on temperature objectives worsens as reservoir storage drops and the cold-water pool is depleted (Fig. 3A–D, Fig. 4). In dry years, optimal stream temperature objectives are attained about 68% of all months with 10% pass-through flows, but only about 53% of the time when pass-through allocations are increased to 40% (Fig. 3A). In wet years, the trade-off between flow and temperature objectives is diminished, but not eliminated. In those years, stream temperature objectives have attained an average of 73% of months with 10% pass-through, and an average of 68% of months with 40% pass-through (Fig. 3B). Pass-through flows in conjunction with constraining minimum reservoir storage is marginally useful to preserve cold-water at depth in the reservoir (Fig. 3C and D). Since environmental deliveries are a percentage of inflows, environmental baseflow, and flow shaping objectives do not change when minimum reservoir storage is constrained.

6.2.1.1 Clarification — turnover rate determination and combined facilities: Use flow rates from flow meters to calculate TURNOVER rates and do not use the manufacturer's pump rate. For an RWF slide combined with a pool, it "must have a turnover rate that matches the rate for the pool", where pool refers to either WADING or SWIMMING POOLS but not CHILDREN'S POOLS, and the slide water must come directly from and return directly to the pool basin. When a facility meets more than one RWF type, the more protective TURNOVER rate applies (e.g., a CHILDREN'S POOL with interactive features must be 0.5 hours), except that a slide combined with a pool may match the pool rate; if also combined with another facility or if modified, the most protective TURNOVER rate applies.

### Global distribution and decline of mangrove coastal protection extends far beyond area loss [^e9882771]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The specific indicator definitions and calculations are as follows:
Average mangrove width (AMW): To compute mangrove width, the number of mangrove pixels along the transect was multiplied by the sampling distance. This is represented as the sum of lengths of multiple segmented mangrove lines along the sampling lines (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10). The average widths of all transects yields the mangrove width for that area:Where, represents average mangrove width for k th region; C = 30 m denotes the pixel size. For k th region, is number of mangrove pixels for i th sampling line, and m is total number of sampling lines. For the process-based MCPI, protection from width used the field and modeling results of Zhang et al.as presented in Waves 2016 (Fig. 2.7). We fitted a wave attenuation factor A that varied with width of mangrove W (in km):Where A varies from 0 (no attenuation at W = 0) to 1 (W ~ ∞). The half-width of decay is roughly 2.3 km. So about 75% protection is achieved at ~4.6 km. These parameters contrast with idealized laboratory attenuation studies for small waves (0.2–0.9 m) and short periods in shallow water, which suggest that Rhizophora mangroves with widths of more than 300 m (several wavelengths) are needed to reduce incoming waves by more than 50%, while widths of more than a kilometer attenuate waves by more than 80%. Turbulent processes are well-known to be highly nonlinear, hence our formulation of A based on Zhang et al.data is, therefore, more likely to be representative of actual conditions requiring much larger attenuation widths. But the use of width within a wave attenuation factor is well supported by both field and laboratory studies. A was used in place of AMW in MCPI.
Average canopy height (ACH): Global canopy height dataset for the years 2005and 2019was masked using mangrove distribution range data. We approximated the height for 2005 to represent the height in 2007 because the closest mangrove distribution data available from GMW was for 2007. Canopy height was extracted using sampling lines, and arithmetic height mean from all lines in the region as follows:Where, represents ACH in the k th region; denotes canopy height of i th pixel crossed by j th sampling line in k th region; m signifies the total number of pixels containing mangroves along the j th sampling line, while n represents the total number of sampling lines containing mangroves in the k th region. For the process-based MCPI, we reasoned that total above-ground biomass (leaves, branches, root, and trunk) were all critical in moderating the effects of storms, rather than just height alone, as biomass is more representative of the total 3D frontal drag area that waves and wind have to work against. This assumes very crudely that densities of the different components of the tree are similar or can be parametrized as such within a modeling constant. We relied on the classic formulations of Cintrón and Schaeffer-Novellfor relationships between biomass, breast-height diameter, and height, with an implicit assumption that canopy leaves/branches/twigs are included in biomass:Where d is the diameter at breast height (about 1.3 m above ground), h is the mangrove ACH, and the value of m from the ref.is 0.85. Hence: In turn, diameter d (cm) is approximately related to height h (m) up to about 10 m (see Table 6.7, page 111, in ref.): These equations can then be used to derive the Biomass (B) relation: Noting that Eq. (6) is only valid up to about 10 m, after which d may grow larger, we converted the biomass relation to an index, which in effect underestimates growth of d for high strands (hence is conservative): B was used in place of ACH in MCPI.
Average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI): Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance was processed to remove cloud using the Quality Assurance (QA) band. Average value was computed for all qualifying images within the study period. Images were masked with mangrove distribution and NDVI was extracted using sampling lines, and arithmetic means from all sampling lines for the region. Higher NDVI value signify denser vegetation and stronger coastal protection capacity according to the formulas:Whererepresents near-infrared reflectance; represents red-band reflectance; is average NDVI in k th region; is NDVI for i th pixel along j th sampling line in k th region; m is total count of mangrove pixels for j th sampling line, and n is number of sampling lines containing mangroves in k th region. Illustrations of how factors were extraction are presented in Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11.

Strategic shoveling — start position, teamwork, and fatigue management are specified: Shovels are essential to extricate a buried victim, a metal shovel blade is more durable than a composite blade, and shoveling should begin downhill from the probe strike at a minimum distance of 1.5 times the burial depth as indicated by the probe. A body-width working area, level with the buried victim, should be created as a working platform, and the shovel can be used like a paddle to scrape or plow snow downhill, initially moving snow to the sides of the pit. When multiple rescuers are available, a conveyor belt method may be used; rescuers should rotate positions frequently, typically every few minutes, and the goal is to excavate a wide, flat platform to place the extricated victim and aid in resuscitation and packaging for transport. Recommendation: All travelers in avalanche terrain should carry and know how to use a metal shovel.

### Three questions to ask before using model outputs for decision support [^276900e2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A way forward

Models tend to look right as they are presented with the claim of being realistic enough for their purpose. Looking right, though, has many dimensions, and we suggest the three screening questions presented here as a simple approach for decision makers to disentangle them. Once we know a model's purpose, we can assess whether its organization is meaningful; once we know its purpose and organization, we can assess whether it represents the real system dynamics relevant to a specific problem; once we know which patterns it can reproduce, we can assess whether its model outputs can support decisions; and once we have answered all three questions for a suite of models they can be compared and taken into account to varying degrees. The three questions do not replace more detailed guidelines on GMP, but they provide a simple and effective common language that will allow us to develop models and use their outputs for decision support in a more transparent, robust, and safe way.

It is still important to keep in mind that models can only support decisions. The responsibility for using model outputs lies with decision makers. Answers to the three screening questions allow them to transparently base their decisions on a weight-of-evidence approach, and to update their decisions when new data and updated models are available.

### Global-scale human impact on delta morphology has led to net land area gain [^7cd87060]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

River deltas rank among the most economically and ecologically valuable environments on Earth. Even in the absence of sea-level rise, deltas are increasingly vulnerable to coastal hazards as declining sediment supply and climate change alter their sediment budget, affecting delta morphology and possibly leading to erosion 1–3. However, the relationship between deltaic sediment budgets, oceanographic forces of waves and tides, and delta morphology has remained poorly quantified. Here we show how the morphology of about 11,000 coastal deltas worldwide, ranging from small bayhead deltas to mega-deltas, has been affected by river damming and deforestation. We introduce a model that shows that present-day delta morphology varies across a continuum between wave (about 80 per cent), tide (around 10 per cent) and river (about 10 per cent) dominance, but that most large deltas are tide- and river-dominated. Over the past 30 years, despite sea-level rise, deltas globally have experienced a net land gain of 54 ± 12 square kilometres per year (2 standard deviations), with the largest 1 per cent of deltas being responsible for 30 per cent of all net land area gains. Humans are a considerable driver of these net land gains-25 per cent of delta growth can be attributed to deforestation-induced increases in fluvial sediment supply. Yet for nearly 1,000 deltas, river damming 4 has resulted in a severe (more than 50 per cent) reduction in anthropogenic sediment flux, forcing a collective loss of 12 ± 3.5 square kilometres per year (2 standard deviations) of deltaic land. Not all deltas lose land in response to river damming: deltas transitioning towards tide dominance are currently gaining land, probably through channel infilling. With expected accelerated sea-level rise 5, however, recent land gains are unlikely to be sustained throughout the twenty-first century. Understanding the redistribution of sediments by waves and tides will be critical for successfully predicting human-driven change to deltas, both locally and globally.

### Finding gaps in the national electric vehicle charging station coverage of the United States [^d34a6e3a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The United States federal government has invested $7.5 billion into charging infrastructure, including the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, to build fast charging stations along designated highways for long-distance car travel. We develop a consecutive coverage metric to compute the percent of United States roads (traffic-weighted) that are consecutively accessible within 500 miles of each county. We answer (1) what the state of consecutive coverage is in each county and (2) what the increase in coverage is when designated highways receive fast chargers. In 2023, 10% of counties had at least 75% minimum viable coverage. We find that if all designated highways receive fast-charging stations, 94% of United States counties will reach at least 75% fast charger coverage. However, the remaining counties are rural. This demonstrates that federal funding for fast chargers will help connect most-but not all-counties to the national network of continuously accessible charging stations.

### Glacier retreat creating new pacific salmon habitat in Western north America [^a943a78f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Stream segment length

The stream gradient thresholds applied were derived from ~500 m segment lengths and a DEM with a 30 m resolution. We selected a ~500 m segment length as it was not feasible due to limited computation resources to shorten our segment length. However, there is some imprecision in using a ~500 m segment length, such as it is impossible to know the exact stream characteristics present (e.g. longer series of riffles vs. a single large waterfalls), and Pacific salmon upstream migration is generally restricted by certain stream features such as waterfalls. In addition, we could not validate our stream gradient thresholds for adult salmon migration against known barriers (e.g. waterfalls) because there are no known data sets of salmon migration barriers between southern British Columbia and Alaska. We also acknowledge that some migration barriers can vary seasonally depending on stream flows. Therefore, some segments with a 10% stream gradient may contain a migration barrier whereas others may not. For comparison, other studies have used similar reach lengths of 200 mand 500 m.
