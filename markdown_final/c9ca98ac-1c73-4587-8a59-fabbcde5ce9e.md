## Question

cacitrial is 1,25 OH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "cacitrial" refers to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, i.e., calcitriol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "cacitrial" is a typographical error for "calcitriol". Then, I should verify the chemical nomenclature of calcitriol and confirm that it is indeed 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Next, I will review the vitamin D activation pathway to place calcitriol in context. After that, I should check pharmacokinetics and clinical indications to ensure the interpretation is clinically sound. Finally, I will consider safety, monitoring, and when to use calcitriol versus other vitamin D forms, and then synthesize a clear answer with supporting references [^1165iBsx] [^116199L9].

> Let me first confirm the name mapping, because "cacitrial" does not correspond to a standard vitamin D metabolite; wait, let me verify that this is most likely a misspelling of "calcitriol", which is the active hormonal form of vitamin D used clinically and described in regulatory and endocrine sources, and the surrounding context about "1,25 OH" fits calcitriol precisely [^1165iBsx] [^116199L9].

> I will now examine the chemical identity to ensure accuracy; calcitriol is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also written as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol or 1,25(OH)2D3, which matches the user's "1,25 OH" phrasing, so yes, "cacitrial" in this context corresponds to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [^1165iBsx] [^116199L9].

> Next, I should review the activation pathway to place this correctly; vitamin D3 is hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol), and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), which is the biologically active hormone that regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, so calcitriol sits at the end of the activation cascade and is the active metabolite [^1165iBsx] [^116199L9] [^1167Q1RY].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacokinetics because they drive monitoring; calcitriol has a short half-life of about 5–8 hours, so dosing is typically daily or appropriately spaced, and its rapid action necessitates close monitoring of serum and urine calcium and phosphate to avoid hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, which is why calcitriol is reserved for specific indications rather than routine supplementation [^112Tpe7y] [^1167Q1RY].

> Let me consider clinical indications to avoid overgeneralization; calcitriol is indicated when endogenous activation is impaired, such as in chronic kidney disease with reduced 1-α-hydroxylase activity, hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D–dependent rickets type 1, and other disorders of impaired calcitriol synthesis or action, whereas nutritional vitamin D deficiency is generally treated with cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol rather than calcitriol due to safety and practicality [^112Tpe7y] [^111jHwZu] [^11742Qf2].

> I should double-check safety and contraindications; calcitriol is contraindicated in hypercalcemia or vitamin D toxicity, and therapy requires periodic calcium and phosphate monitoring because of the higher risk of hypercalcemia compared with parent vitamin D forms, reinforcing the principle that calcitriol is a hormone replacement therapy rather than a routine supplement [^1153iRtL] [^115fuFLp] [^112Tpe7y].

> But wait, what if someone meant a different vitamin D form; let me reconsider the alternatives to avoid confusion: calcifediol is 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the circulating prohormone, while cholecalciferol is the parent compound requiring hepatic and renal activation; neither is the 1,25-dihydroxy form, so the "1,25 OH" phrasing points uniquely to calcitriol in this context [^1167Q1RY] [^111jadS3].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: yes, "cacitrial" appears to be a typographical error for calcitriol, which is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active hormonal form of vitamin D used when renal activation is impaired or when rapid hormonal replacement is clinically indicated, with careful monitoring to prevent hypercalcemia [^1165iBsx] [^116199L9] [^112Tpe7y].

Calcitriol is **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D** [^1165iBsx], the active form of vitamin D produced by renal 1α-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [^1167Q1RY]. It is used to treat hypocalcemia in chronic kidney disease, hypoparathyroidism, and vitamin D–dependent rickets, but requires close monitoring for hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria [^112Tpe7y] [^1161JB9B]. Calcitriol is not for routine supplementation because of its short half-life and narrow therapeutic window [^1167Q1RY] [^112Tpe7y].

---

## Chemical structure and nomenclature

Calcitriol is **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3** (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), with hydroxyl groups at positions 1 and 25 that confer hormonal activity [^1165iBsx] [^116199L9].

---

## Physiological role

Calcitriol is the **active hormone** that binds the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis, increasing intestinal absorption and modulating bone turnover [^112Tpe7y] [^114vxqEe].

---

## Clinical indications

Calcitriol is indicated for:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Treats secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypocalcemia due to impaired renal 1α-hydroxylation [^1161JB9B] [^112Tpe7y].
- **Hypoparathyroidism**: Replaces absent PTH-driven 1α-hydroxylation [^112Tpe7y].
- **Vitamin D–dependent rickets**: Corrects defective 1α-hydroxylation or VDR resistance [^112Tpe7y].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

Calcitriol has a **short half-life** of 5–8 hours and is rapidly inactivated, necessitating careful dosing and monitoring [^1167Q1RY] [^112Tpe7y].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

Calcitriol requires **close monitoring** of serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH because of risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria; it is not for routine supplementation due to its potency and narrow therapeutic window [^112Tpe7y] [^11639dQb].

## Comparison with other vitamin D forms

| **Form of vitamin d** | **Description** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) | Parent compound requiring hepatic and renal activation | Routine supplementation |
| Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) | Plant-derived parent compound | Routine supplementation |
| Calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) | Intermediate metabolite with longer half-life | Rapid correction of deficiency |
| Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) | Active hormone | Hormone replacement therapy |

---

Calcitriol is **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D**, the active hormone used for specific deficiencies of activation or action; it is not for routine supplementation and requires careful monitoring [^1165iBsx] [^112Tpe7y].

### Vitamin D and colon cancer [^1122vC1q]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The most active vitamin D metabolite, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), is a pleiotropic hormone with wide regulatory actions. Classically, vitamin D deficiency was known to alter calcium and phosphate metabolism and bone biology. In addition, recent epidemiological and experimental studies support the association of vitamin D deficiency with a large variety of human diseases, and particularly with the high risk of colorectal cancer. By regulating the expression of many genes via several mechanisms, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces differentiation, controls the detoxification metabolism and cell phenotype, sensitises cells to apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of cultured human colon carcinoma cells. Consistently, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and several of its analogues decrease intestinal tumourigenesis in animal models. Molecular, genetic and clinical data in humans are scarce but they suggest that vitamin D is protective against colon cancer. Clearly, the available evidence warrants new, well-designed, large-scale trials to clarify the role of vitamin D in the prevention and/or therapy of this important neoplasia.

### Circulating vitamin D metabolites and subclinical atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes [^115jSPS1]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Premature atherosclerosis is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes. Treatment to control glycemia, plasma lipids, and blood pressure can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, identification of additional therapeutic targets is desirable to further reduce risk.

Existing evidence suggests that impaired vitamin D metabolism may promote atherosclerosis. In animal experimental models, insufficient 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2 D, the active vitamin D hormone] stimulates the renin-angiotensin system, which promotes vascular damage through hemodynamic and metabolic effects and unfavorably modulates immune cell function in the arterial wall. Human studies suggest that these actions may be clinically relevant. Low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D, reflecting total vitamin D intake from cutaneous synthesis and oral consumption] have been associated with increased risks of coronary artery calcium (CAC), cardiovascular disease events, and death in populations with and without diabetes. Also, one study showed that low circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D are associated with increased risk of CAC. In addition, genetic variation in CYP24A1, the main enzyme responsible for catabolism of 25(OH)D to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [24,25(OH) 2 D 3] and of 1,25(OH) 2 D to 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D, has been associated with risk of CAC.

We measured serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 among 1,193 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study. We hypothesized that low concentrations of each of these metabolites, reflecting decreased vitamin D intake, activity, and turnover, respectively, would be associated with increased risk of subclinical cardiovascular disease, manifest as a greater prevalence and severity of CAC and greater carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).

Calcium and vitamin D — dosing and safety note that "The amount of calcium supplementation in randomized trials ranges from 500 to 1500 mg/d". "Expert opinion currently recommends ≤ 1000 mg/d in the form of supplements", while "the overall recommendation from the National Osteoporosis Foundation and Institute of Medicine (for women > 50 years and men > 70 years of age) is a total calcium intake of 1200 mg/d". In the Women's Health Initiative, "the daily dietary intake in the active arm was ~1100 mg/d in addition to the 1000 mg of calcium supplementation, resulting in a total intake of ~2100 mg/d (109)", and "This intake led to a 17% increase in the development of renal stones (109)".

Calcitriol

Calcitriol is the active hormonal form of vitamin D and the natural VDR ligand. It promotes active intestinal calcium absorption and suppresses PTH secretion. Calcitriol has a short half-life of around 5 to 8 hours; therefore, it should be administered daily (or with intermittent regimens) and sometimes in lower doses distributed over a 24-hour period. As calcitriol is not an organic micronutrient, its use in clinical practice requires careful monitoring. Calcitriol increases the activity of CYP24A1, which stimulates the degradation of 25(OH)D. This results in serum 25(OH)D not being useful as a marker of adequate vitamin D supplementation and reduced potential benefits of physiological extrarenal/local production of calcitriol due to reduced substrate availability. Moreover, some studies have reported a more significant incidence of adverse events such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Thus, there is a need to monitor serum and urine calcium and phosphate. Because of these safety and clinical practicality issues, there is consensus that calcitriol use should be limited to hormone replacement for patients with limited/absent renal tubular 1-α-hydroxylase activity, as their capacity to produce calcitriol is severely limited. Indeed, calcitriol was first used to treat patients with vitamin D–resistant rickets type 1. Other indications are X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, chronic hypoparathyroidism, as an alternative to the use of the native missing hormone PTH, and moderate-to-severe kidney failure when calcitriol production is impaired or to suppress excessive PTH secretion. This use helps to control secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone diseases. However, as calcitriol use is associated with frequent hypercalcemia, its use could be replaced by analogues with less calcemic activity approved for use in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure, in particular maxacalcitol (22-oxa-1,25(OH) 2 D 3) and falecalcitriol (1,25(OH) 2–26,27-F6-D 3), which are currently available in Japan, and paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25(OH) 2 D 2) and doxercalciferol (1α(OH)D2), available in the United States. Calcitriol has also been proposed for the treatment of osteoporosis, but it is not approved in this setting.

### Fall prevention with supplemental and active forms of vitamin D: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116y16Tb]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective To test the efficacy of supplemental vitamin D and active forms of vitamin D with or without calcium in preventing falls among older individuals.

Data sources We searched Medline, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, BIOSIS, and Embase up to August 2008 for relevant articles. Further studies were identified by consulting clinical experts, bibliographies, and abstracts. We contacted authors for additional data when necessary.

Review methods Only double blind randomised controlled trials of older individuals (mean age 65 years or older) receiving a defined oral dose of supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol)) or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (1α-hydroxycalciferol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol)) and with sufficiently specified fall assessment were considered for inclusion.

Results Eight randomised controlled trials (n = 2426) of supplemental vitamin D met our inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity among trials was observed for dose of vitamin D (700–1000 IU/day v 200–600 IU/day; P = 0.02) and achieved 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 concentration (25(OH)D concentration: < 60 nmol/l v ≥ 60 nmol/l; P = 0.005). High dose supplemental vitamin D reduced fall risk by 19% (pooled relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92; n = 1921 from seven trials), whereas achieved serum 25(OH)D concentrations of 60 nmol/l or more resulted in a 23% fall reduction (pooled RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90). Falls were not notably reduced by low dose supplemental vitamin D (pooled RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.35; n = 505 from two trials) or by achieved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of less than 60 nmol/l (pooled RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84). Two randomised controlled trials (n = 624) of active forms of vitamin D met our inclusion criteria. Active forms of vitamin D reduced fall risk by 22% (pooled RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94).

Conclusions Supplemental vitamin D in a dose of 700–1000 IU a day reduced the risk of falling among older individuals by 19% and to a similar degree as active forms of vitamin D. Doses of supplemental vitamin D of less than 700 IU or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of less than 60 nmol/l may not reduce the risk of falling among older individuals.

Different Forms of Vitamin D Supplementation

The main supplemental oral forms of vitamin D are cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2). Both are readily available without a prescription. Cholecalciferol is the most used form of supplemental vitamin D. Calcidiol (calcifediol, 25(OH)D), the inactive vitamin D metabolite produced in the liver, and other vitamin D analogues, such as calcitriol (1,25(OH) 2 D, the physiologically active form of vitamin D) and alfacalcidol (1-hydroxyvitamin D), are used as prescription medicines in some conditions (Table 4).

### Calcium and vitamin D controversies [^112GMqvg]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Controversies regarding appropriate use of vitamin D and calcium are predominately related to the extraskeletal effects. Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. The concerns regarding calcium and cardiovascular complications are inconclusive at best, and do not warrant a change in our approach to supplementation at this time. A growing body of literature exists suggesting that additional vitamin D may have numerous benefits, although more study needs to be done. Further prospective trials would provide insight into the potential advantages that increased vitamin D supplementation could provide.

### Fall prevention with supplemental and active forms of vitamin D: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117UKmsq]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test the efficacy of supplemental vitamin D and active forms of vitamin D with or without calcium in preventing falls among older individuals.

Conclusions

Supplemental vitamin D in a dose of 700–1000 IU a day reduced the risk of falling among older individuals by 19% and to a similar degree as active forms of vitamin D. Doses of supplemental vitamin D of less than 700 IU or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of less than 60 nmol/l may not reduce the risk of falling among older individuals.

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^114TerHH]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The known knowns

Pleiotropic functions of vitamin D

Vitamin D 3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol in a dual-stage process where the B ring is broken under ultraviolet rays (e.g. sunlight), and the pre-D 3 formed in this process isomerises to D 3 in a thermo-sensitive but non-catalytic process.

The three main steps in vitamin D metabolism, 25-hydroxylation, 1a-hydroxylation, and 24-hydroxylation, are all performed by cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases (CYPs). The first step towards activation is conversion of vitamin D to 25 hydroxy-D. In addition to UV activation small amounts of vitamin D, either as D2 or D3, can enter the body from its intestinal absorption from dietary intake and progress towards activation by hydroxlyation. The next step toward full activation is into 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D) via CYP27B1 (also known as 1-alpha hydroxylase), a mitochondrial P450 enzyme in the proximal renal tubule of the kidney. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D 24 hydroxylase, also known as CYP24, can hydroxylate both 25 hydroxy-D and 1,25(OH) 2 D. In addition to 1,25(OH) 2 D, the kidney also produces 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, a relatively inactive metabolite.

Figure 1 summarises the synthesis and metabolism of vitamin D as well as its classic and pleiotropic functions.

There is a growing appreciation for the many roles of vitamin D beyond its classic actions on calcium metabolism and musculoskeletal health. This has been driven by the finding that most body tissues have receptors for the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, known as vitamin D receptors (VDRs). Additionally, most of these tissues also contain the enzyme CYP27B1, which is responsible for the conversion of the major circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25 hydroxy-D), to its active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D. Regulation of this conversion at the tissue level differs from the conventional activation that occurs in the kidney in that it is more substrate dependent and hence more susceptible to vitamin D deficiency.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^11639dQb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

### 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels inversely associate with risk for developing coronary artery calcification [^113G9CNQ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency associates with increased risk for cardiovascular events and mortality, but the mechanism driving this association is unknown. Here, we tested whether circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration associates with coronary artery calcification (CAC), a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We included 1370 participants: 394 with and 976 without chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). At baseline, CAC was prevalent among 723 (53%) participants. Among participants free of CAC at baseline, 135 (21%) developed incident CAC during 3 yr of follow-up. Lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration did not associate with prevalent CAC but did associate with increased risk for developing incident CAC, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, site, season, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, and kidney function. Further adjustment for BP, diabetes, C-reactive protein, and lipids did not alter this finding. The association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with incident CAC seemed to be stronger among participants with lower estimated GFR. Circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations among participants with chronic kidney disease did not significantly associate with prevalent or incident CAC in adjusted models. In conclusion, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations associate with increased risk for incident CAC. Accelerated development of atherosclerosis may underlie, in part, the increased cardiovascular risk associated with vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^112bpWTs]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Sources of vitamin D and cutaneous synthesis — "Most circulating vitamin D is synthesized from skin exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation", and "Vitamin D synthesis by the skin is the main source of this prohormone for most people", with forms distinguished because "Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is plant derived, whereas vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by animals". Mechanistically, "7-Dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D) is a relatively rigid, 4-ringed structure" in epidermal membranes and "Exposure to UV-B in the wavelengths of 290 to 315 nm initiates the synthesis of vitamin D", after which "Previtamin D isomerizes to vitamin D and then is transferred to extracellular space and dermal capillaries, where it binds with vitamin D–binding protein (DBP)". The complex is "transported to the liver for 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)-D (calcidiol)", with subsequent renal steps whereby "25(OH)-D is released into the circulation and transported to the kidney bound to DBP for 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2-D and for 24-hydroxylation to 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [24,25(OH)2-D]", noting that "1,25(OH)2-D (calcitriol) is the active form of vitamin D" and that "Nuclear receptors for 1,25(OH)2-D are present in > 30 tissues".

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

### Vitamin D-dependent hypercalcemia [^1125CUSt]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D metabolism represents a well-integrated, hormonally regulated endocrine unit interlinking calcium and phosphate metabolism. Pathophysiologic processes disturbing vitamin D metabolism comprise classic defects of vitamin D activation and action presenting as different forms of vitamin D-dependent rickets as well as disorders with increased vitamin D activity. The latter may result in hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal calcifications. Acquired and hereditary disorders causing hypervitaminosis D are discussed, including vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disease, and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia that may be caused by either a defective vitamin D degradation or by a primary defect in phosphate conservation.

### Is replacement therapy with nutritional and active forms of vitamin D required in chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder? [^114oQJrH]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Apart from regulating mineral metabolism, recent evidence suggests that both the 'active' 1,25(OH)2D and the 'storage' 25(OH)D forms of vitamin D have distinct and important actions on many organ systems, bringing to light the systemic importance of both forms of the vitamin. This review discusses the current evidence related to the etiology and consequences of reduced levels of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D in the chronic kidney disease population.

Recent Findings

Both 25(OH)vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D therapy have actions on parathyroid gland, cardiac, bone, and immune system function. In both the general and chronic kidney disease populations, vitamin D therapy decreases fracture rates, decreases cancer and infection rates, and improves cardiac function.

Summary

To improve quality of life and to decrease mortality, therapy with vitamin D - in both the 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D forms - should be considered throughout the course of chronic kidney disease.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^111XQeK2]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

### Mechanisms of disease: vitamin D and inflammatory bowel disease [^11317Dzu]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Until recently, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3))-the active form of vitamin D-was thought to function primarily as a regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism. More diverse functionality was indicated by the discovery of the vitamin D receptor in tissues that are not involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Detection of the vitamin D receptor in monocytes and activated T cells has sparked interest in the immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D. Here, we review the role of vitamin D in regulation of the immune system, and evidence for its involvement in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Ergocalciferol [^1141yQxT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The in vivo synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver (to 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and the second in the kidneys (to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorous by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules.

There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys.

### Evidence-based policy on dietary calcium and vitamin D [^1167np1J]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D makes a positive contribution by grounding its recommendations on the available evidence base. The committee does not substantially change recommended dietary intakes for calcium and modestly increases those for vitamin D based on the need for a median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40 nmol/L. They do not support the suggestion that all adults should have levels > 75 nmol/L. The committee concludes that current evidence does not support nonskeletal benefits for vitamin D or calcium, and notes that higher intakes of both could have adverse health consequences. The present authors are generally in agreement with these conclusions, with some caveats regarding the evidence base used. However, we believe that the central role of sunlight exposure in determining vitamin D status needs to be explicitly reflected in public policy in this area.

### New aspects of vitamin D metabolism and action-addressing the skin as source and target [^114vxqEe]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin D has a key role in stimulating calcium absorption from the gut and promoting skeletal health, as well as many other important physiological functions. Vitamin D is produced in the skin. It is subsequently metabolized to its hormonally active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D), by the 1-hydroxylase and catabolized by the 24-hydroxylase. In this Review, we pay special attention to the effect of mutations in these enzymes and their clinical manifestations. We then discuss the role of vitamin D binding protein in transporting vitamin D and its metabolites from their source to their targets, the free hormone hypothesis for cell entry and HSP70 for intracellular transport. This is followed by discussion of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that mediates the cellular actions of 1,25(OH) 2 D. Cell-specific recruitment of co-regulatory complexes by liganded VDR leads to changes in gene expression that result in distinct physiological actions by 1,25(OH) 2 D, which are disrupted by mutations in the VDR. We then discuss the epidermis and hair follicle, to provide a non-skeletal example of a tissue that expresses VDR that not only makes vitamin D but also can metabolize it to its hormonally active form. This enables vitamin D to regulate epidermal differentiation and hair follicle cycling and, in so doing, to promote barrier function, wound healing and hair growth, while limiting cancer development.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^113TRypV]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The production of vitamin D

Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem caused mainly by insufficient exposure to sunlight. It is estimated that 1 billion people have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency worldwide, particularly prevalent among elderly people. Vitamin D exists in two forms — D2 (ergocalciferol), which is obtained from yeast and plants and D3 (cholecalciferol), obtained from the diet through the ingestion of vitamin D containing products (fatty fish and eggs), vitamin D fortified milk or margarine and /or the use of multivitamins. However, the primary source of vitamin D3 (80–90% of the body stores) is via ultraviolet irradiation of the precursor molecule 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. Vitamin D (D2 and D3) are then subsequently hydroxylated in the liver by 25-hydroxylase to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). 25OHD is then further hydroxylated in the kidney by the 1-alpha hydroxylase to form 1,25-di25OHD (1,25(OH) 2 D) or calcitriol), which is the biologically active form of vitamin D. The 1-alpha hydroxylation can also occur in a multitude of other tissues, generating locally active vitamin D, which leads to auto and /or paracrine effects. The principal index of vitamin D status is the serum 25OHD concentration, with a half-life of ∼3 weeks, when compared with the biologically active form 1,25(OH) 2 D which has a half-life of only 4–6 h.

### 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 α-hydroxylase in normal and malignant colon tissue [^116WgBkC]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin D affects calcium metabolism and prevents proliferation of colon cells in vitro. In human beings the main circulating form of vitamin D is 25-hydroxyvitamin D; to regulate calcium homoeostasis, this form must be converted to 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1alpha-hydroxylation in the kidney with 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase. Cultured transformed colon cancer cells can convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). We identified messenger RNA (mRNA) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase in normal colon tissue and in malignant and adjacent normal colon tissue. These findings support the notion that vitamin D might have a role in cell growth regulation and cancer protection, and might be the explanation for why the risk of dying from colorectal cancer is highest in areas with the least amount of sunlight.

### Fall prevention with supplemental and active forms of vitamin D: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116Ljn4H]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Active forms of vitamin D reduced falls by 22% and the high dose supplemental vitamin D reduced falls by 19%, suggesting no difference in efficacy between these alternatives in unselected older persons. However, the efficacy data for active forms of vitamin D was drawn from relatively few studies. In addition, active forms cost more and have a higher risk profile, so we believe adequate dosing of supplemental vitamin D should be preferred. Importantly, the efficacy of active forms of vitamin D adds to the evidence that improved vitamin D status reduces the risk of falling in older individuals.

Limitations of study

As with all meta-analyses, this review has the potential for publication bias. However, we found no evidence for publication bias using the Begg's test and the Egger's test with all eight trials. Although the Begg's test funnel plot suggested a possible absence of negative studies with small sample sizes, the trim and fill analysis did not confirm this suggestion. With respect to trial quality, our primary analysis was restricted to trials with a double blind design and sufficient quality fall assessment to address the efficacy of vitamin D for fall prevention. In our sensitivity analysis that included additional trials with an open study design or insufficient fall assessment, study variation was larger than expected for the pooled result from all 15 trials. Even within the 14 high dose trials, variation between trials was larger than expected, supporting our pre-defined strategy of focusing on fall efficacy from double blind trials with sufficient fall assessment.

Implications for future research

We found a greater fall reduction in studies with a maximum vitamin D daily dose of 1000 IU a day than in studies with lower doses; therefore, higher doses may be even more effective. Such doses should be explored in future research to optimise the fall prevention benefit with vitamin D.

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^115ovcsL]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Classical metabolic pathway

There are two major isoforms of vitamin D, vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol), and vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D 2 is synthesized from ergosterol by UVB radiation in plants, yeasts, and fungi and can be ingested in a diet containing plant source foods, such as mushrooms. Vitamin D 3 is synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol by UVB radiation in the epidermis of skin and can be also ingested in a diet of animal source foods, such as cod liver oil. Vitamin D (both vitamin D 2 and D 3, calciol) originating from either the diet or the skin binds to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in circulation and is first delivered to the liver.

In the liver, vitamin D is metabolized by vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1 and CYP27A1) to 25(OH)D (calcidiol), which is the major circulating form of vitamin D in serum. 25(OH)D is further metabolized by 25(OH)D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) mainly in the proximal tubule of the kidney to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1α,25(OH) 2 D, calcitriol], which is the most biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol then enters the circulation and, after binding to VDBP, is delivered target tissues such as intestine, bone, and kidney, where vitamin D is known to regulate absorption, mobilization, and reabsorption, respectively, of calcium and phosphate. After being produced, the levels of both calcidiol and calcitriol are tightly regulated by 25(OH)D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), which is the primary vitamin D inactivating enzyme catalyzing hydroxylation at C-24 and C-23 of both calcidiol and calcitriol. The 24-hydroxylase pathway produces biologically inactive biliary excreted calcitroic acid, whereas the less known 23-hydroxylase pathway produces 1,25–26,23 lactone, whose relative activity by CYP24A1 catalysis shows species difference. The importance of CYP24A1-driven calcitriol inactivation was underscored by the finding of impaired intramembranous bone mineralization and hypercalcemia in Cyp24a1 knockout mice, leading to perinatal death in 50% of the mice. Interestingly, the defect was normalized in Cyp24a1 and VDR double knockout mice, suggesting that increased calcitriol levels, but not the absence of 24- or 23-hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites, were responsible for the defective phenotype.

### Moderator's view: vitamin D deficiency treatment in advanced chronic kidney disease: a close look at the emperor's clothes [^115xkNuc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Two recent vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol) trials in stage G5D CKD patients with vitamin D insufficiency showed that this sterol effectively increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] but fails to modify serum PTH and other clinical outcomes. The Pro side of this polar view emphasizes that the duration of these studies was too short to allow sensible analyses based on a clinical endpoint. Furthermore, he notes that in the second study, the use of active forms of vitamin D, phosphate binders and cinacalcet could have hindered appreciation of the effect of ergocalciferol supplementation per se The Con side produces an updated meta-analysis showing that inactive vitamin D forms largely fail to reduce serum PTH and affect various relevant endpoints, including muscle strength, functional capacity, quality of life and hospitalization. Studies suggesting an effect of inactive vitamin D forms in advanced CKD are either very small and mainly based on sequential, uncontrolled observations or inherently weak, simple pre/post studies. No biological or clinical evidence exists that 25(OH)D may exert meaningful effects in CKD patients who are being treated with active forms of vitamin D. Careful a etiologic studies based on the omics sciences, i.e. precise pathophysiological profiling of individual CKD patients followed by consequential, well-targeted intervention(s) in the precision medicine scenario, will likely provide a definitive answer to the lingering question of whether inactive vitamin D forms may have biological effects beyond those produced by their proximate metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.

Vitamin D Metabolism and Mechanism of Action

Metabolism

Vitamin D 3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D 2 and D 3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D 3 23) hydroxy forms 24,25(OH) 2 D 2/3, 23,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 2/3 (or 1,23,25(OH) 3 D 3). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH) 2 D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

Endocrine Practice (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to patients undergone bariatric surgery, AACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to initiate initial oral doses of vitamin D2 at 50,000 IU 1–3 times weekly or vitamin D3 at minimum of 3,000–6,000 IU/day in patients with severe vitamin D malabsorption. Consider administering concurrent oral calcitriol in recalcitrant cases.

### Clinical review: the role of the parent compound vitamin D with respect to metabolism and function: why clinical dose intervals can affect clinical outcomes [^112735xf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

There is no doubt that vitamin D must be activated to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to achieve full biological activity or that many tissues participate in this activation process-be it endocrine or autocrine. We believe that not only is 25-hydroxyvitamin D important to tissue delivery for this activation process, but also that intact vitamin D has a pivotal role in this process.

Objective

In this review, evidence on the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system is presented and discussed in relation to vitamin D-binding protein affinity, circulating half-lives, and enzymatic transformations of vitamin D metabolites, and how these affect biological action in any given tissue.

Conclusions

Circulating vitamin D, the parent compound, likely plays an important physiological role with respect to the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system, as a substrate in many tissues, not originally thought to be important. Based on emerging data from the laboratory, clinical trials, and data on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D amassed during many decades, it is likely that for the optimal functioning of these systems, significant vitamin D should be available on a daily basis to ensure stable circulating concentrations, implying that variation in vitamin D dosing schedules could have profound effects on the outcomes of clinical trials because of the short circulating half-life of intact vitamin D.

### Fall prevention with supplemental and active forms of vitamin D: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112E6WVM]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Trials of oral active forms of vitamin D

We found two randomised controlled trials of active forms of vitamin D that met our inclusion criteria (table 6). w16 w17 Falls were addressed as a primary outcome measure in both studies. No additional trials were identified for a sensitivity analysis. The two trials included 624 individuals with a mean age of 73 years, 70% of whom were women. In both studies, patients in the treatment group were more likely to experience hypercalcaemia (up to 3 mmol/l) than were those in the control group. The incidence of hypercalcaemia was twice as frequent in the treatment group as in the placebo group in one trial (12% v 6%), without details in the other. The pooled relative risk for fall prevention for active forms of vitamin D was 0.78 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.94), and active forms of vitamin D reduced the risk of falls by 22% (table 7).

Primary pooled analysis for active forms of vitamin D and the prevention of falls

Q test: P < 0.100 indicates heterogeneity.

I² estimates above 25% are considered to represent modest heterogeneity, and values above 50% represent large heterogeneity beyond chance.

Fall prevention with active forms of vitamin D compared with high dose supplemental vitamin D

The pooled relative risk for fall prevention of 0.78 for active forms of vitamin D was similar to the pooled relative risk of 0.81 for high dose of supplemental vitamin D. The ratio of the two effect sizes (pooled relative risk supplemental vitamin D/pooled relative risk active forms of vitamin D) was 1.04 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.31), suggesting that active forms and standard forms of vitamin D have statistically indistinguishable effects on fall prevention.

Test for publication bias

We found no evidence for publication bias in the eight supplemental vitamin D trials, according to both Begg's test and Egger's test. Although the Begg's test funnel plot indicated a potential absence of negative studies with small sample sizes, a trim and fill analysis did not confirm this possibility.

### Vitamin D supplementation: cholecalciferol, calcifediol, and calcitriol [^113XdRxM]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The specific compound that is meant for use in the context of vitamin D supplementation is often ambiguous. The term "supplementation" has been used in the context of cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcidiol, and calcitriol. In nature, by far the major form of vitamin D that nurtures the body is cholecalciferol. In contrast, ergocalciferol is primarily a synthetic and less stable product which is less potent per microgram dose than is cholecalciferol. Calcidol is the major circulating metabolite of cholecalciferol, while calcitriol is the hormone that upregulates the active transport of calcium from the gut, and which suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion. Nutrition policy papers and guidelines leave unstated the obvious fact that calcidiol and calcitriol are not nutrients, and that those metabolites are not pertinent to food fortification or dietary supplementation. Recent evidence shows that ergocalciferol is not stable with storage, and it is far more susceptible to breakdown with cooking and baking than is cholecalciferol. Therefore, it must be concluded that cholecalciferol is the only form of vitamin D that should be considered in the context of the nutritional functions of fortification and supplementation.

### Vitamin D status and the host resistance to infections: what It is currently (not) understood [^116CUsTu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Vitamin D is increasingly thought to play a role in regulating immunity. This comprehensive review updates the current understanding regarding ways in which we believe that vitamin D regulates responsiveness of the immune system and how serum status modulates the host defense against pathogens.

Methods

The literature was searched by using PubMed and Scopus with the following key words: vitamin D, immunity, innate and adaptive immunity, infectious disease, and vaccine response.

Findings

Vitamin D deficiency remains a major public health concern worldwide. The overall body of evidence confirms that vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the immune response to infections. Epidemiologic studies suggest a clear association between vitamin D deficiency and susceptibility to various pathogens. However, translation of vitamin D use into the clinic as a means of controlling infections is fraught with methodologic and epidemiologic challenges. The recent discovery of alternative activation pathways, different active forms of vitamin D, and possible interaction with non-vitamin D receptors provide further complications to an already complex interaction between vitamin D and the immune system. Moreover, it has become apparent that the individual responsiveness to supplementation is more dynamic than presumed from the static assessment of 25-hydroxy vitamin D status. Furthermore, the epigenetic response at the level of the individual to environmental changes and lifestyle or health conditions provides greater variation than those resulting from vitamin D receptor polymorphisms.

Implications

To understand the future of vitamin D with respect to clinical applications in the prevention and better control of infectious diseases, it is necessary to determine all aspects of vitamin D metabolism, as well as the mechanisms by which active forms interact with the immune system globally. For the most part, we are unable to identify tissue-specific applications of supplementation except for those subjects at high risk of osteomalacia and osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^111SH2XV]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^116P4Epz]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin obtainable from the diet, as well as a seco-steroidal prohormone produced in the skin by ultraviolet B (UVB, 290–320 nm) from sunlight. Vitamin D, as a precursor of a potent steroid hormone, undergoes two-step metabolism in the liver and kidney to synthesize a biologically active form, calcitriol, which binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to enable its diverse physiological functions. The classical role of vitamin D is to regulate metabolism of calcium and phosphate, which is essential for bone remodeling. However, extensive research over the past decades has suggested that low sunlight exposure and vitamin D deficiency are also associated with the increased risk of many other extra-skeletal diseases such as cancer –.

The first observation of an inverse correlation between sunlight exposure and overall cancer incidence and mortality in North America was published almost 80 years ago. Later, in 1980 and 1992, the first epidemiological studies linking low sunlight exposure and high risk of colon and prostate cancers were reported, respectively, which suggested that vitamin D as a surrogate for sunlight exposure may protect against colon and prostate cancer risk. Since then, many epidemiological studies have supported and extended the UVB–vitamin D–cancer hypothesis in 18 different types of cancers. The hypothesis has been further supported by studies showing the direct association between vitamin D and cancer risk. Several lines of population-based studies revealed an inverse correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and high risk of colon, breast, prostate, gastric, and other cancers. Moreover, there are strong evidences from several cell culture and animal studies to support the antitumorigenic effects of vitamin D. As such, it is now becoming evident that deficiency of vitamin D can contribute to the development and progression of many types of cancers, and thus maintenance of sufficient serum vitamin D levels could be beneficial for prevention and treatment of cancer.

### The impact of diet and nutrition on prostate cancer-food for thought? [^116VTByu]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin A

The two forms of vitamin A include pro-vitamin A and pre-formed vitamin A. The pre-formed vitamin A is the active form of vitamin A and is only found in animal food, such as liver. Pro-vitamin A needs to be converted into its active form, which is retinol.

In addition to its important role of maintaining healthy vision, vitamin A exhibits antineoplastic properties, such as inhibition of cellular proliferation, induction of apoptosis and anti-oxidant effects.

While animal studies indicate that vitamin A and retinoid acids are promising dietary compounds for reducing the risk of prostate cancer, related human studies show inconsistent and conflicting results. The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer (ATBC) Prevention Study found 23% higher prostate cancer incidence in men receiving 20mg beta-carotene supplements daily, while another trial reported no prostate cancer effects at 30mg of beta-carotene. A systematic review and dose-dependent meta-analysis showed that dietary intake of beta-carotenes was not associated with reduced prostate cancer risk. Moreover, beta-carotene supplementation, specifically in smokers, and higher circulating retinol concentrations appeared to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.

Vitamin D

Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin in response to sunlight. The primary active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, regulates bone mineralization.

However, vitamin D has also been shown to have anti-carcinogenic properties, including promotion of apoptosis, immunomodulation and inhibition of angiogenesis and proliferation. Despite the expected benefit of vitamin D for preventing prostate cancer, the results in literature have been inconsistent and debatable. While some studies indicated that higher vitamin D levels negatively affect prostate cancer status, others suggested the exact opposite. Currently, the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer risk remains unclear.

### Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) [^1165iBsx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The other names frequently used for calcitriol are 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-DHCC, 1,25(OH)2D3and 1,25-diOHC.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Man's natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to vitamin D3(cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3must be metabolically activated in the liver and the kidney before it is fully active as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism at target tissues. The initial transformation of vitamin D3is catalyzed by a vitamin D3–25-hydroxylase enzyme (25-OHase) present in the liver, and the product of this reaction is 25-hydroxyvitamin D3[25-(OH) D3]. Hydroxylation of 25-(OH) D3occurs in the mitochondria of kidney tissue, activated by the renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3–1 alpha-hydroxylase (alpha-OHase), to produce 1,25-(OH)2D3(calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D3. Endogenous synthesis and catabolism of calcitriol, as well as physiological control mechanisms affecting these processes, play a critical role regulating the serum level of calcitriol. Physiological daily production is normally 0.5 to 1.0 mcg and is somewhat higher during periods of increased bone synthesis (e.g., growth or pregnancy).

### Vitamin D: the iceberg nutrient [^114zxSHh]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The understanding of vitamin D's role in human health has recently expanded. It is now recognized as more than a hormone activated in the kidney only for calcium homeostasis. It is metabolized and used by virtually every cell in the body. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a deficit in their kidney production of 1,25(OH)(2)D and have classically been treated with calcitriol or its active analogues. Despite often having lower systemic levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D, patients with chronic kidney disease retain the capability of extra renal production of 1,25(OH)(2)D. This has far reaching implications for their health. This review examines clinical trials and observations in 3 areas that impact chronic kidney disease patients. Cancer, cardiovascular disease and infections are responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. We will discuss vitamin D's role in these disease states with a focus on the chronic kidney disease patient.

Physiological daily production is normally 0.5 to 1.0 mcg and is somewhat higher during periods of increased bone synthesis (eg, growth or pregnancy).

Pharmacodynamics

The two known sites of action of calcitriol are intestine and bone. A calcitriol receptor-binding protein appears to exist in the mucosa of human intestine. Additional evidence suggests that calcitriol may also act on the kidney and the parathyroid glands. Calcitriol is the most active known form of vitamin D3in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. In acutely uremic rats calcitriol has been shown to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption.

The kidneys of uremic patients cannot adequately synthesize calcitriol, the active hormone formed from precursor vitamin D. Resultant hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism are a major cause of the metabolic bone disease of renal failure. However, other bone-toxic substances which accumulate in uremia (eg, aluminum) may also contribute.

The beneficial effect of calcitriol in renal osteodystrophy appears to result from correction of hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is uncertain whether calcitriol produces other independent beneficial effects. Calcitriol treatment is not associated with an accelerated rate of renal function deterioration. No radiographic evidence of extraskeletal calcification has been found in predialysis patients following treatment. The duration of pharmacologic activity of a single dose of calcitriol is about 3 to 5 days.

### Vitamin D binding protein and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: emerging clinical applications [^117BVncy]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The precursor of the active form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), is recognized as the optimal indicator of vitamin D status. Vitamin D3 undergoes conversion through a multitude of enzymatic reactions described within the paper, and vitamin D levels are dependent on many factors including the vitamin D binding protein (DBP). The free hormone hypothesis postulates that protein-bound hormones are not biologically available and that unbound hormones are biologically active. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is tightly bound to DBP and albumin, with less than 1% circulating in an unbound form. As a result, factors affecting DBP alter the interpretation of 25(OH)D levels. The aim of this review is to assess the current methodology used to measure total and free 25(OH)D, and DBP. Additionally, we analyze the effects of other endocrine hormones and disease processes on DBP levels and subsequently, the interpretation of 25(OH)D levels.

Vitamin D

There are multiple pharmacological analogues and formulations of vitamin D available for clinical use. To be effective in disorders resulting from vitamin D deficiency, nutritional sources of vitamin D (cholecalciferol, vitamin D 3; and ergocalciferol, vitamin D 2) must undergo two enzymatic hydroxylations: 1) in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD); 2) in the kidney, 1α-hydroxylase converts 25OHD to the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) or 1,25- dihydroxyergocalciferol. The liver hydroxylation is largely substrate driven, but the kidney's 1α-hydroxylase is very tightly regulated by hormones (e.g. parathyroid hormone) and concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions. In the VITAH trial, we use the following terminology for the specific vitamin D analogues; nutritional vitamin D therapy is provided in the form of ergocalciferol, and alfacalcidiol, is provided as the active (activated) vitamin D derivative.

Effects of vitamin D on mineral biology

(A) schematic showing biogenesis of vitamin D. Vitamin D3 derived from either the diet or UVB irradiation in the skin is metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25(OH)D 3) in the liver through an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by CYP27A1. 25(OH)D 3 is subsequently metabolized to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD (1,25(OH) 2 D 3) in the kidneys by CYP27B1. Both 25(OH)D 3 and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 are converted by CYP24A1 to 24 hydroxylated products and excreted. CYP27B1 is tightly regulated: a drop in serum calcium levels is detected by the parathyroid gland and results in secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Both PTH and reduced serum calcium and phosphate concentration directly stimulate CYP27B1 activity, and thus increased 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 production. 1,25(OH) 2 D 3, in a negative feedback loop, down-regulates its own production through inhibiting CYP27B1 activity as well as PTH production. 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 has multiple systemic effects which ultimately result in restoration of serum calcium levels, as well as re-calcification of bones. FGF-23 is produced by osteocytes and decreases circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3, through induction of CYP24A1 and suppression of CYP27B1. In the schematic, black arrows represent induction, red arrows represent inhibition.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^1147pFqd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been extensively related to the occurrence of skeletal disorders, such as rickets and osteomalacia. It can also be negatively implicated in osteopenia and osteoporosis, which must be mandatory and managed with vitamin D supplements. More recently, the interest in the putative extraskeletal effects of vitamin D have resulted in several clinical trials addressing vitamin D's influence on cancer and CV risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The null results of some of these RCTs — especially the megatrials — hampered the enthusiasm around these topics. However, these trials were progressively revised, and their null results were mainly related to the enrollment of vitamin D–replete adults in whom benefit would be unlikely and the inhomogeneous methodologies in vitamin D supplementation with different forms, metabolites, and doses. Indeed, subsequent secondary analyses have progressively shown that vitamin D might be useful in reducing cancer incidence and mortality in the long term, in reducing autoimmune diseases and CV events (in particular central arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation) occurrence, and the development of diabetes from prediabetes forms. Nonetheless, these RCTs and the following meta-analyses were not powerful enough to evaluate these crucial subgroups, and further studies with better methodological conductions are warranted.

Regarding the different forms and metabolites used for vitamin D supplementation, oral administration is the preferred route, and parenteral administration should be reserved for special clinical situations, such as in patients with severe gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes or after bariatric surgery. Cholecalciferol remains the preferred choice, and it is generally safe, requiring less strict monitoring. Ergocalciferol has been demonstrated to be less effective in raising 25(OH)D serum levels and, thus, should be reserved for specific clinical conditions. Calcifediol could be recommended in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, CYP2R1 dysfunction, or in situations in which a quick, rapid achievement of vitamin D sufficiency is desirable. Calcitriol use should be limited for patients with limited/absent renal tubular 1-α-hydroxylase activity and in vitamin D–resistant rickets type 1, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, and chronic hypoparathyroidism.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112cezVV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### The vitamin D receptor [^114dP6UN]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

The vitamin D endocrine system is known for its essential role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, and induces cell differentiation, inhibits cell growth, controls other hormonal systems, and modulates the immune response. Vitamin D(3) is a prohormone that is taken up by diet or synthesized in ultraviolet radiation-exposed skin and metabolically converted to the active metabolite, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). This nuclear hormone binds with high affinity the nuclear receptor vitamin D receptor. More than 3000 synthetic analogs of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) are known. This review aims to provide an overview on vitamin D signaling from the skin perspective.

### Ergocalciferol capsules, (ergocalciferol) [^117BQhhy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The in vivo synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver (to 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and the second in the kidneys (to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules.

There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^111jHwZu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 5: Micronutrients — vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outlines threshold definitions, testing, supplementation, and safety. Some, but not all, guidelines have defined insufficiency of vitamin D by serum 25(OH)D level between 20 and 29 ng/mL, deficiency as 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency as serum 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/mL. Both the KDOQI and KDIGO reports recommend checking and supplementing low serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CKD and dialysis patients. In the most recent update of the KDIGO guideline on MBD, it is suggested based on low-quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 1–5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be individualized according to baseline values and interventions; however, there was no clear suggestion on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed. Current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1–5D and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population, and it has been recommended for 1,000 to 2,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol for vitamin D repletion for the general population, although KDOQI acknowledges that patients with CKD may require a more aggressive therapeutic plan. Because in CKD there is no clear evidence about the superiority of cholecalciferol, clinicians should use the form commercially available in the context of their clinical practice. The tolerable upper intake level proposed by the IOM for the general population is 4,000 IU/d, there is no recommendation of a safe dose of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol supplementation to prevent toxicity or adverse effects such as hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in CKD, and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered, especially for patients who are using calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D active analogues.

### Vitamin D in kidney disease: pathophysiology and the utility of treatment [^114Ec7x7]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

CKD is associated with decreased vitamin D metabolites, both the storage form 25(OH)D and the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This contributes to hyperparathyroidism, and increased levels of PTH mobilize minerals from the skeleton and increase the risk for fractures. Treatment with vitamin D sterols efficiently reduces secondary hyperparathyroidism of CKD. Observational studies suggest survival and other potential benefits of vitamin D treatment in the CKD population. These observations need to be verified with controlled prospective trials.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^11742Qf2]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D assessment and therapy specify that an individual's vitamin D status is assessed by serum 25(OH)D, and adults who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient (serum 25[OH]D 20 to 29 or < 20 ng/mL, respectively) may receive 50,000 IU vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for 6 to 8 weeks to achieve a 25(OH)D blood level > 30 ng/mL; the above-noted replacement regimen should be followed by maintenance therapy of 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D3, daily. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) rather than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) should be used for replacement, and a higher dose may be required in patients with obesity or malabsorption and those on medications affecting metabolism of vitamin D. Not every 25(OH)D assay measures 25(OH)D2 and, due to unequal cross-reactivity, many current assays are inaccurate if there is a significant amount of 25(OH)D2; therefore, use of an appropriate assay, generally one performed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry that accurately quantifies both 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, is essential, and in patients with active granulomatous disease, replacement of vitamin D must be undertaken with caution due to risk for hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia.

I present the results of published studies and original data and describe the functional outcomes of effects related to the interaction between vitamin D status and calcium intake. These effects fall into 3 broad categories: 1) synergistic effects of vitamin D status and calcium intake on calcium absorption; 2) effects of calcium intake on vitamin D status; and 3) largely observational data suggesting an association between calcium and vitamin D status and nonskeletal outcomes, such as cancer. To a considerable extent, both vitamin D status and the benefits associated therewith appear to be dependent on, or at least augmented by, calcium intakes at or above currently recommended levels.

### Administration of vitamin D and its metabolites in critically ill adult patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113jxcFD]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that current evidence only provides limited data about the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation and the route of administration. In the majority of the included RCTs, cholecalciferol, the inactive form of vitamin D, was administered EN/PO. Since ICU patients frequently suffer from organ dysfunction, it remains unclear if this inactive form of vitamin D is adequately absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract of the critically ill patient and adequately converted into its biological active form by liver and kidneys. In hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, for example, vitamin D levels between 30 and 60 ng/L could only be reached in 64% of patients despite an "aggressive" enteral dosage regimen. Therefore, it needs to be elucidated if the supplemented vitamin D dose as well as the product type is appropriate to correct low baseline levels. Insufficient supplementation might be one reason for the lack of efficacy. Only 3 studies reported about calcitriol levels, the active metabolite of vitamin D and resulting effects. In the majority of the trials, it is unknown if and when active vitamin D levels were high enough to unfold their beneficial biological effects at all. Recently, serum 1,25(OH)2D levels have been investigated in cardiac surgery patients. Higher levels were associated with less organ dysfunction, shorter hospital stay and lower inflammatory marker levels, indicating the high clinical relevance of this biological active form. Furthermore, the multinational multicenter VITDALIZE trial currently evaluates a new promising supplementation strategy. Enrolled critically ill patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 12 ng/mL) will receive in addition to the loading dose of 540,000 IU cholecalciferol after ICU admission a daily dose of 4000 IU for 90 days. The resulting clinical outcomes will be compared to such patients that received placebo.

### Pharmacologic calcitriol inhibits osteoclast lineage commitment via the BMP-smad1 and I κ B-NF-κ B pathways [^111MuqqC]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is involved in a range of physiological processes and its active form and analogs have been used to treat diseases such as osteoporosis. Yet how vitamin D executes its function remains unsolved. Here we show that the active form of vitamin D calcitriol increases the peak bone mass in mice by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Although calcitriol modestly promoted osteoclast maturation, it strongly inhibited osteoclast lineage commitment from its progenitor monocyte by increasing Smad1 transcription via the vitamin D receptor and enhancing BMP-Smad1 activation, which in turn led to increased IκBα expression and decreased NF-κB activation and NFATc1 expression, with IκBα being a Smad1 target gene. Inhibition of BMP type I receptor or ablation of Bmpr1a in monocytes alleviated the inhibitory effects of calcitriol on osteoclast commitment, bone resorption, and bone mass augmentation. These findings uncover crosstalk between the BMP-Smad1 and RANKL-NF-κB pathways during osteoclastogenesis that underlies the action of active vitamin D on bone health. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

### Circulating vitamin D metabolites and subclinical atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes [^111rjNXK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study of 1,193 people with type 1 diabetes, we did not observe the hypothesized associations of lower plasma vitamin D metabolite concentrations with increased risks of subclinical cardiovascular disease, as measured by CAC or carotid IMT. To our surprise, we observed trends toward associations of lower concentrations of vitamin D metabolites with reduced CAC prevalence and severity, while risk estimates for IMT were close to null. Our findings contrast with those of previous studies that have shown associations of low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D with increased risk of CAC and cardiovascular mortality.

A number of prior studies have reported associations of low circulating 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH) 2 D concentrations with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Among 374 participants in the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study, circulating 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L was associated with a 3.3-fold increased odds of prevalent CAC compared with 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L in minimally adjusted analyses. Among 200 Steno Clinic patients with type 2 diabetes, plasma 25(OH)D < 12.5 nmol/L (N = 19) was associated with increased risk of Agatston coronary calcium score ≥ 400 compared with 25(OH)D ≥ 12.5 nmol/L. Among 1,370 mostly nondiabetic participants in MESA, each 25 nmol/L decrement in 25(OH)D was associated with a 23% increased risk of developing CAC over 3 years' median follow-up. Lower 25(OH)D concentration has also been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease events in the general population and with increased mortality risk in types 1 and 2 diabetes, each presumably reflecting in part an increased tendency to develop coronary heart disease. Lower circulating 1,25(OH) 2 D concentrations were associated with increased risk of prevalent CAC among a population referred for evaluation of hyperlipidemia and with a trend toward increased risk of incident CAC in MESA.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^112TbN33]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

There is some debate regarding the equivalent bioavailability of vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3. Some authors conclude that vitamin D2 is less efficient in raising serum concentrations of 25(OH)D or producing the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D while others show no difference. Because supplementation or fortification of food with vitamin D is the center of an important debate due to the high prevalence of worldwide insufficiency, it is important to assess the efficacy of each form. Several studies have reported that the administration of vitamin D2 leads to a reduction of total 25(OH)D and, more specifically, of circulating 25(OH)D3, leading to a reduction in the active form 1,25(OH)2D. This is potentially due to a competition between both forms for available 25-hydroxylase activity, the first hydroxylation step necessary in obtaining active vitamin D, although the in vivo regulation of the different 25-hydroxylases is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, it seems that the route of administration (bolus versus daily) may affect the comparison of both vitamin D forms in maintaining plasma 25(OH)D, mainly due to a difference of half-life for each metabolite, theiraffinity for their transporters, hydroxylating enzymes or receptors.

According to the traditional model, steroid hormones bind to nuclear receptors and initiate genomic responses through modulation of transcription. Similarly, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) elicits physiological regulation of gene transcription following binding of its ligand, 1,25(OH)2D and, like other steroid hormone receptors, it can regulate a diverse range of biological activities across many tissues (Fig. 1). Advances in transcriptional research provide data that genomic effects are not the only mechanism of action for vitamin D activity. Rapid effects are also observed after treatment with vitamin D, which can be exerted through both the VDR and other membrane-based receptors such as MARRS (Fig. 1). The biological outcome of these two modes of action is relatively inter-related, and the multiplicity of mechanisms of action associated to the diversity of target tissues render this steroid hormone a complex pleitropicmolecule.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^111Cw8FU]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The real answer, however, about a causal role of vitamin D status on cancer has to come from RCTs. Only a few studies have so far addressed this question. Nine of 10 such RCTs [Table 6] did not demonstrate a clear benefit of vitamin D supplementation (400 to 2000 IU/d for up to 8 years of follow-up). The large Women's Health Initiative trial did not demonstrate a beneficial effect of combined vitamin D (400 IU/d) and calcium supplementation on cancer in general or on colorectal cancer. Two subsequent studies of the Women's Health Initiativedata, either excluding women who took calcium or vitamin D supplementation at baseline or excluding women who took hormone replacement therapy during the study, revealed a better effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on colorectal cancer, albeit still being a nonsignificant decrease [RR, 0.81 (0.58 to 1.13 (not significant) and RR, 0.71 (0.46 to 1.09], respectively, of the risk of colorectal cancer (Table 6)]. However, excluding women on hormone replacement therapy revealed that vitamin D and calcium supplementation modestly but significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer or all invasive cancers (Table 6). Trivedi et al. randomly treated 2686 elderly individuals (2037 men and 649 women, aged 65 to 85 years) with 100,000 IU of vitamin D every 4 months or placebo for 5 years and found no differences on cancer incidence or mortality. Another extensive study dealing with colon adenoma and colon cancer did not reveal a beneficial effect of daily 1000 IU of vitamin D supplementation during 3 to 5 years, even in a high-risk population. Two smaller studies from Omaha, Nebraska, provided more optimistic results on overall incidence of cancer after combined treatment with vitamin D and calcium. In the first one, a group of women treated with 1100 IU/d of vitamin D plus calcium for 4 years showed a significant reduction on cancer incidence compared with the placebo group, with a RR of 0.402 (CI, 0.20 to 0.82; P = 0.013). However, when compared with the calcium-supplemented group or the combined placebo–calcium control groups, the significant difference was lost (Table 6). Alternatively, the results of an RTC, which included 2303 elderly women from rural counties of the United States, showed that 2000 IU of vitamin D 3 plus 1500 mg of calcium per day compared with placebo had no significant effect on cancer incidence and mortality after 4 years (P = 0.06). However, a post hoc analysis excluding those who withdrew from the study, died, or developed cancer within the first year showed a significant difference between groups (χ², 3.17% vs 4.86%; P = 0.046). In proportional hazards modeling, the HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.99). A limitation of this study was that most of the women included were not vitamin D deficient at baseline (serum 25OHD 82 ± 25 nmol/L); mean ± SD), although, as expected, at the end of the study the vitamin D–calcium group reached higher concentrations of serum 25OHD than did the placebo group (109 and 79 nmol/L, respectively; P < 0.001). Besides, all participants, including those from the placebo group, were allowed to take vitamin D supplements of up to 800 IU/d of vitamin D and up to 1500 mg/d of calcium in addition to dietary intake. Moreover, even in situ cancer cases were included. In line with the data described above, a meta-analysis concluded that vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium supplementation did not decrease the risk of all types of cancer.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^111NsF98]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Issues surrounding ergocalciferol use are of note for the United States, where 50 000 IU of vitamin D 2 was the only high-dose preparation available by physician prescription and, therefore, ergocalciferol was widely prescribed. Now, instead, 50 000 IU of vitamin D 3 is available by prescription. In addition to assay issues, widespread use of intermittent high-dose ergocalciferol ("bolus" therapy) appears to alter vitamin D metabolism, with increased 24-hydroxylase activity. Other adverse consequences of high-dose vitamin D therapy, notably increased fall risk, are reported and have led to calls to critically assess daily vs bolus vitamin D therapy.

To summarize, vitamins D 2 and D 3 are not equivalent in raising circulating 25(OH)D, and bolus dosing may have adverse effects on vitamin D metabolism and clinical outcomes. As such, it is to be expected that calls for the use of only cholecalciferol and avoidance of ergocalciferol have been and continue to be published with recent osteoporosis-treatment guidance advising cholecalciferol over ergocalciferol (see Table 4). Despite these recommendations, high-dose ergocalciferol remains widely prescribed in the United States.

Calcifediol

Calcifediol is the intermediate metabolite between cholecalciferol and calcitriol. Several pharmacokinetic studies performed in the last 4 decades have demonstrated its hydrophilic properties, leading to higher solubility in organic solvents, less sequestration in adipose tissue, smaller distribution volume, and shorter half-life when compared to cholecalciferol. By virtue of its hydrophilic properties, calcifediol is readily absorbed via the venous portal system and thus quickly increases circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D 3. In contrast to cholecalciferol, which is mostly stored in fat tissue, 25(OH)D tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the body (20% in muscle, 30% in circulation, 35% in fat, and 15% elsewhere). The administered dose will generally lead to predictable 25(OH)D levels and effective PTH suppression. In cases of toxicity, this form of vitamin D is easier to manage than cholecalciferol. Moreover, the greater affinity of calcifediol for DBP allows for more efficient internalization in cells expressing the megalin-cubilin system of endocytic receptors, such as the parathyroids and the renal tissue.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^111AQbcu]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

"There is at present no consensus regarding the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function, balance, and risks of falls".

In contrast, Bolland et al. concluded from their meta-analysis that the effect estimated for vitamin D on falls lies within the futility boundary, which they defined as not altering relative risk by 15% or more. A recent post hoc analysis of falls in a large New Zealand (VIDA) study revealed that supplementation with 100,000 IU monthly for 3.4 years had no effect on risk of falling or fractures. The mean baseline serum 25OHD level of these subjects was 63 nmol/L, and less than one-third of all participants started with serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L.

High-dose vitamin D supplementation, however, may increase the risk of falling. This was first observed by Sanders et al. in elderly subjects treated with a single oral dose of 500,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or placebo once a year. The vitamin D–treated group had significantly more falls and fractures during the first 3 months after each loading dose during the 4-year treatment period compared with the placebo group. Smith et al. found that supplementation with 300,000 IU of vitamin D 2 annually by intramuscular injection had no effect on fall risk but increased fracture risk. In elderly women with baseline vitamin D deficiency, monthly doses of vitamin D greater than the equivalent of 800 IU/d for 1 year increased the risk of falls from 48% in the group treated with 24,000 IU monthly (equivalent to 800 IU/d) to 67% in the group treated with 60,000 IU/mo (equivalent to 2000 IU/d) and 66% in the group treated with 24,000 IU of vitamin D 3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol per month. The authors concluded from a post hoc analysis that serum 25OHD concentrations higher than 112.5 nmol/L may be associated with an increased risk of falls. Ginde et al. treated 107 long-term care seniors with 100,000 IU of vitamin D 3 per month or placebo for 12 months. The monthly vitamin D decreased the rate of acute infections by 40% (primary endpoint) but doubled the rate of falls (secondary endpoint). Smith et al. examined fall rates in 146 elderly white women (mean baseline serum 25OHD level of 38 nmol/L) treated with a full range of daily vitamin D 3 doses (from 400 to 4800 IU) or placebo for 1 year. Falls were assessed by daily calendar and phone calls every three months. They found a U-shaped association with falls, the nadir of which occurred in the dose range of 1600 to 3200 IU/d. Fall rates in the higher doses, 4000 and 4800 IU/d, were significantly higher than those in the nadir. In contrast, among 91 African American women in the same study, there was no U-shaped association. Rather there was a progressive decline in percentage of fallers with increasing vitamin D dose, with the lowest rate occurring in the women taking 4000 to 4800 IU/d. This study had a small sample size for the number of dose groups but high-quality fall assessment.

### Introduction to the third annual rostand vitamin D symposium [^112Foixc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The role of vitamin D in multiple organ systems has come into sharp focus with recent advances in the understanding of its mechanisms of actions and specific effects of vitamin D preparations that serve as substrates and those that directly activate the vitamin D receptor. Major progress has been made in understanding the interplay between the vitamin D system and the FGF23/Klotho system for regulation of renal phosphate excretion. While recognizing the importance of treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease, the current interests have moved beyond this indication and are focusing on the role of vitamin D receptor and its activators in the basic pathophysiology of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and overall patient outcomes.

### Extraskeletal effects of vitamin D [^117Cy8J8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The presence of vitamin D receptors in diverse tissues like immune cells, beta-cells in the pancreas, and cardiac myocytes has prompted research to evaluate the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the occurrence of immune diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The expression of receptors not only in normal cells, but also in cancer cells including breast, prostate, and colon cancer cells has moreover opened the path to therapeutic exploitation of vitamin D or its metabolites and hypocalcemic structural analogues as pharmaceutical tools in the fight against chronic non-communicable diseases like diabetes, CVD, and cancer.

### Assessment and interpretation of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the clinical environment [^114J61kR]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The unique cis-triene structure of vitamin D and related metabolites makes it susceptible to oxidation, ultraviolet (UV) light-induced conformational changes, heat-induced conformational changes, and attacks by free radicals. Vitamin D(2) is much less bioactive than vitamin D(3) in humans. Metabolic activation and inactivation of vitamin D are well characterized and result in a plethora of metabolites, of which only 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) provide any clinically relevant information. 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3) are commonly known as calcifediol and the 1,25(OH)(2)D metabolites as calcitriol. In this review the current state of the science on the clinical assessment of circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D is described.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^116m7yn8]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: Implementation considerations for vitamin D include commonly used laboratory thresholds and monitoring guidance: For most experts, vitamin D insufficiency is defined as a serum 25(OH)D level between 20â€" 29 ng/mL, deficiency is considered as 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency serum 25(OH)D equal or greater than 30 ng/mL; it is suggested based on low quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 3â€"5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be based on baseline values and therapeutic interventions, with no consensus on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed; current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1â€"5D and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population; the tolerable upper intake levels (UL) proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for the general population is 4,000 IU/day; and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered especially for patients who are on calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or on vitamin D active analogs.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111J9m4h]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Summary of evidence — benefits and harms: The systematic review included 25 trials (49 879 participants) evaluating vitamin D for all-cause mortality across settings including community (n = 17), nursing homes (n = 6), and hospital clinics (n = 2); most used vitamin D3, commonly as a daily dose (13 trials), either alone or with calcium, with follow-up from 12 weeks to 7 years (median 2 years). The evidence suggests vitamin D lowers mortality versus placebo or no D: RR 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–1.00), absolute effect 6 fewer deaths per 1000 people (from 11 fewer to 0 more); community-based studies showed RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99], and among those with low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L]) results were consistent (RR of mortality 0.88 [95% CI, 0.46–1.67]). For fractures, trials reporting participants with fractures (43 585 participants) found RR 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94–1.08) with an estimated absolute effect of 1 fewer per 1000 people (from 5 fewer to 6 more).

### Conventional treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^115DAeFG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism consists of oral calcium and either activated vitamin D or vitamin D supplements at varying doses. Although adjusting dosing of calcium and/or activated vitamin D or vitamin D itself, the serum calcium should be obtained weekly or monthly depending on the clinical situation. Calcium supplementation in hypoparathyroidism usually consists of calcium carbonate because it is 40% elemental calcium by weight. However, calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is indicated for patients with achlorhydria and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Many clinicians prefer to uptitrate the activated form of vitamin D to reduce the amount of calcium supplementation.

### Calcifediol (Rayaldee) [^1115Cszu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) is a prohormone of the active form of vitamin D3, calcitriol (1,25‑dihydroxyvitamin D3). Calcifediol is converted to calcitriol by cytochrome P450 27B1 (CYP27B1), also called 1-alpha hydroxylase, primarily in the kidney. Calcitriol binds to the vitamin D receptor in target tissues and activates vitamin D responsive pathways that result in increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and reduced parathyroid hormone synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In repeat-dose clinical studies with RAYALDEE, increased levels of serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D were associated with corresponding increases in serum total 1,25‑dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations and reductions in circulating plasma intact PTH observed within the first two weeks of RAYALDEE treatment [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^112tE3pb]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The putative pleiotropic benefits of vitamin D supplementation warrant further in-depth exploration with adequately powered multi-centre randomised trials.

This would require reliable assessment of baseline vitamin D status and metabolites with standardised assays. The most effective and safe method of supplementation with respect to preparation, dose, route and frequency of administration are all important considerations. In addition, an appropriate population should be identified who are most likely to benefit from supplementation and stratification of the population or a priori subgroups may need to be considered. Finally, relevant patient-centred primary and secondary endpoints will need to be selected.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with Charcot arthropathy: a single-center analysis [^1139E4bn]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D in the body is derived from dietary sources and through synthesis in the skin after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The biologically active form of vitamin D is 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D 3 (calcitriol). This is derived from the biologically inactive form of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), which is hydroxylated to 25(OH)-vitamin D 3 (calcifediol) in the liver and again hydroxylated to the active form 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) in the kidneys. Once converted to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, its effect on bone metabolism is through the regulation of serum calcium and phosphate. In addition, vitamin D receptors on chondrocytes and osteoblasts have been found to stimulate endochondral ossification, leading to calcification of the osteoid matrix produced by osteoblasts. Thus, deficiency in vitamin D may result in diseases related to mineral incorporation such as rickets and osteomalacia.

Given the involvement of the kidneys in the processing of vitamin D, patients with impaired renal function often have impaired vitamin D metabolism known as renal osteodystrophy. This can result in low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcitriol levels, in addition to vitamin D resistance due to loss of vitamin D receptors in the parathyroid gland and impaired binding of vitamin D to the vitamin D receptors. In the current study, 13 patients (23%) had documented renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis). Of these patients, 4 (31%) were deficient, 5 (38%) were insufficient, and 4 (31%) were sufficient in vitamin D. Although not all the renal-impaired patients were deficient in vitamin D, it is important to recognize that even with sufficient serum vitamin D levels these patients may still be functionally deficient in vitamin D because of vitamin D resistance at the level of the vitamin D receptors and also the inability to create the active form 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) in the kidneys. Patients with renal impairment who are deficient in vitamin D are often treated with the active form 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D 3 (calcitriol) or a related analog for these reasons. These patients may suffer from primary or secondary osteoporosis in addition to primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, all factors that may contribute to the previously established increased prevalence of Charcot arthropathy in renal-impaired patients.

### Blood biomarkers of vitamin D status [^111Pgz2L]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

In the past quarter century, more than 50 metabolites of vitamin D have been described. To date, only a few of these have been quantified in blood, but this has widened our understanding of the pathologic role that altered vitamin D metabolism plays in the development of diseases of calcium homeostasis. Currently, awareness is growing of the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in the general population in association with an increased risk of several diseases. However, for many researchers, it is not clear which vitamin D metabolites should be quantified and what the information gained from such an analysis tells us. Only 2 metabolites, namely, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], have received the greatest attention. Of these, the need for measuring serum 1,25(OH)2D is limited, and this metabolite should therefore not be considered as part of the standard vitamin D testing regimen. On the other hand, serum 25(OH)D provides the single best assessment of vitamin D status and thus should be the only vitamin D assay typically performed. Currently, numerous formats exist for measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This article reviews the currently available methods for serum 25(OH)D quantitation and considers important issues such as whether both the D2 and the D3 forms of the vitamin should be assayed, whether total or free concentrations are most important, and what measures should be taken to ensure the fidelity of the measurements.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^116EuZDo]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — calcium and phosphorus metabolism and bone: In a vitamin D–sufficient state [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)-D) levels of > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)], net intestinal calcium absorption is up to 30%, and during active growth it can reach 60% to 80%; in a vitamin D–deficient state, intestinal calcium absorption is only ~10% to 15% and total maximal reabsorption of phosphate decreases. In conditions of deficiency, low ionized calcium stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases calcium reabsorption in renal tubules and increases 1-α-hydroxylase activity, causing increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25(OH)2-D] synthesis; increased PTH also causes phosphorus loss in urine and a decreased calcium×phosphorus product, resulting in decreased bone mineralization.

### CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 polymorphisms modulate vitamin D metabolism in colon cancer cells [^113zBzon]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a well-studied agent for cancer chemoprevention and treatment. Its chief circulating metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is converted into the active hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP27B1 in kidney and other tissues. 1,25D is then deactivated by CYP24A1 and ultimately catabolized. Colorectal carcinoma cells express CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 that locally regulate 1,25D with potential implications for its impact on carcinogenesis. While 1,25D inhibits cancer growth, the effects of polymorphic variations in genes encoding proteins involved in 1,25D homeostasis are poorly understood. Using an RXR-VDR mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) biologic assay system, we measured vitamin D metabolite uptake and activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway in colon cancer cells that expressed one of five CYP27B1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) or four CYP24A1 SNPs. Compared with the wild-type control, four of five CYP27B1 SNPs reduced enzymatic activity, whereas one (V166L) increased activity. For CYP24A1, all tested SNPs reduced enzyme activity. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses supported the results of M2H experiments. The observed SNP-directed variation in CYP functionality indicated that vitamin D homeostasis is complex and may be influenced by genetic factors. A comprehensive understanding of 1,25D metabolism may allow for a more personalized approach toward treating vitamin D-related disorders and evaluating risk for carcinogenesis.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, AACE/ACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to advise older adults, individuals with increased skin pigmentation, or those exposed to insufficient sunlight to increase their vitamin D intake from vitamin D-fortified foods and/or supplements to at least 800–1,000 IU/day.

### From vitamin D to hormone D: fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system essential for good health [^111Mq8q3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

New knowledge of the biological and clinical importance of the steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and its receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has resulted in significant contributions to good bone health. However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases. Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health. Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D(3), as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least 9-fold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid). Now, research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) initiates the physiologic responses of ≥ 36 cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3,) researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in ≥ 10 extrarenal organs. This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, including its potential for contributions to good health in 5 physiologic arenas in which investigators have clearly documented new biological actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D(3) intake (defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations) should be reevaluated, taking into account the contributions to good health that all 36 VDR target organs can provide.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113ZBgH4]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of 1,25(OH) 2 D may contribute to the diagnosis of conditions with low calcitriol levels, such as 1α-hydroxylase deficiency, or those associated with high 1,25(OH) 2 D levels, such as hereditary vitamin D–resistant rickets, granulomatous conditions (sarcoidosis and tuberculosis), and the hypophosphatemic syndromes.

Available evidence to date is rather limited to determine whether free or bioavailable 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH) 2 D is the better biomarker of 25(OH)D availability to local tissues and of its effect on target organs in special situations. The extremely low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D found in mice and humans with genetic absence of DBP without implications on calcium homeostasis is the best argument for the free "vitamin D" hypothesis.

Assessment of Other Metabolites

Improvements in LC-MS/MS have triggered a revolution in small-molecule clinical chemistry, particularly the analysis of steroid hormones. The additional sensitivity and selectivity provided by the recently emerged LC-MS/MS techniques make it now feasible to measure most of the circulating vitamin D metabolites of value to clinicians and physiologists in human and animal studies. A comprehensive analysis can now assay 8 metabolites simultaneously (cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D, 3-epi-25(OH)D, 24,25(OH) 2 D, 25,26(OH) 2 D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, 1,24,25(OH) 3 D, and 25(OH)D-26,23-lactone) by judicious use of liquid-liquid-extraction and immune-extraction steps. Besides specific clinical situations, a few previous reports have also highlighted a potential role for vitamin D metabolites, in particular of the 24,25 to 25(OH)D ratio, in better-predicting fracture risk as compared to only 25(OH)D levels.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^1136hzEY]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In healthy individuals, hypervitaminosis D is usually defined as "exogenous" as it develops after uncontrolled use of megadoses of vitamin D or its metabolites or analogues, as in case of high dose of calcifediol leading to a faster increase in 25(OH)D serum levels compared with cholecalciferol but easier to manage than cholecalciferol in case of toxicity for its hydrophilicity and lesser sequestration in adipose tissue. On the other hand, excessive production of calcitriol in granulomatous disorders, lymphomas, primary hyperparathyroidism, and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia results in "endogenous" hypervitaminosis D.

VDT is defined by a biochemical phenotype with markedly elevated calcifediol concentrations (> 150 ng/mL or > 375 nmol/L), along with dihydroxylated metabolites (24,25(OH) 2 D 3; 25,26(OH) 2 D 3, 25(OH)D 3–26,23-lactone), unless the causal agents are vitamin D analogues, such as paricalcitol. Calcitriol levels may be in the normal reference range or even reduced in exogenous VDT while elevated in endogenous VDT. PTH levels can be very low or undetectable. VDT thus results in severe hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Pathogenetically, hypercalcemia is a consequence of high calcifediol levels in exogenous VDT (with calcifediol at pharmacological concentrations overcoming VDR affinity disadvantages and/or displacing 1,25(OH)D 2 from DBP), while high calcitriol levels cause endogenous VDT. Exogenous factors that interact with VDT risk include dosage, calcium in the diet or as a supplement, vitamin D intake with the diet, social status (ie, neglected patients), artificial UV light treatment sessions, quantity of supplement use, and time of exposure. Endogenous risk factors comprise age, sex, vitamin D status, hypersensitivity syndromes, and the pharmacogenetics of the vitamin D response and metabolism. This is why there is no clear cutoff above which VDT occurs and below which it does not.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — differential diagnosis is broadly classified into 3 categories: parathyroid hormone related (hypoparathyroidism due to various causes either congenital or acquired; pseudohypoparathyroidism: the parathyroid hormone is not able to act due to defective PTH receptor), vitamin D related (vitamin D deficiency due to poor nutritional intake, malabsorption, liver disease or kidney disease leading to defective 25-hydroxylation and 1, α-hydroxylation respectively; 1, α-hydroxylase deficiency leading to deficient active form of vitamin D; vitamin D resistance due to defective vitamin D receptor), and nutritional calcium deficiency.

### Circulating conjugated and unconjugated vitamin D metabolite measurements by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry [^114PuQHb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Phase I metabolism of vitamin D represented by various hydroxylated metabolites has been extensively characterized, arriving at a consensus for phase I pathways and circulating concentrations. Conventionally, vitamin D status is evaluated by measuring circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the sum of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3, which circulate at stable ng/mL concentrations due to their long half-life of several weeks. Both 25OHD3 and 25OHD2 are metabolized to bioactive 1,25-dihydroxy metabolites that circulate at much lower (pg/mL) concentrations. Inactivating hydroxylation of 25OHD3 occurs at the C-24 position to form 24,25(OH) 2 D3. Another phase I metabolic conversion, the C-3 epimerization of 25OHD3 and 25OHD2, has been characterized in forming 3-epi-25OHD3 or D2 which circulates at about 5% to 10% of 25OHD levels.

### Health effects of vitamin D [^111TQfc9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing data suggest that many or most adults in the United States and Europe would benefit from vitamin D supplements. This review summarizes the benefits of vitamin D with the strongest evidence today from randomized controlled trials for fall and fracture prevention. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms. Prospective epidemiological studies supported by strong mechanistic evidence suggest a reduction of cardiovascular disease (incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality) and colorectal cancer, extending to weaker evidence on immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits of vitamin D.

Measurement of vitamin D

25OHD levels are measured in ng/ml or nmol/l (1 ng/ml is equivalent to 2.5 nmol/l). However, several technical problems should be recognised when measuring vitamin D levels:
There are two main types of assays used for measuring 25OHD-the immune-based assay (commonly used in clinical practice) and the chromatography-based assay (commonly considered the gold standard for research). The utilisation of different methods among laboratories obviously leads to a great variability in test results. This has therefore led to the recent introduction of the standard reference material for vitamin D by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.
Total circulating 25OHD is the sum of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3, but not all the immunoassays used in clinical practice are able to detect 25OHD2, which can lead to underestimation of 25OHD levels.
Potential confounders of 25OHD measurement may be present, which can falsely elevate 25OHD, such as other vitamin D metabolites, which are relatively abundant and can account from 2 to 20% of the 25OHD measured.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

Conclusions

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the VDR has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of the evaluation of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international societies and guidelines can differ due to the different approaches used, including clinical perspectives (level of cutoff at which no individual has an undesirable outcome) or public health perspectives (level of cutoff at which 97.5% of individuals do not have an undesirable outcome). Another critical issue is the lack of an accepted laboratory test assay standardization, and this prevents a proper interpretation of data reported by different studies, resulting in enabling rational data pooling and implementation of meta-analyses focused on vitamin D influence in various clinical outcomes of interest. Thus, 25(OH)D laboratory assays should be monitored in their performance through external quality assessment plans providing target reference values from standardized measurement procedures.

- Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 2D) and bone mineral content by the photon-absorption technique were determined in eight patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets treated for at least 24 months with oral sodium phosphate and high-dosage ergocalciferol. Mean 25-OH-D2 level was 129. 5 ±
67. 5 ng/mL; the level of 25-OH-D3 was 10. 5 ±
5. 8 ng/mL. These values were significantly higher than in normal subjects. Serum 1, 25–2D was 16. 9 ±
8. 5 pg/ml in the eight patients, significantly lower than 47 ± 16 pg/mL in 27 age-matched controls. Values indicative of significant demineralization were found in seven of the eight phosphate-treated patients, who had no radiologic evidence of rickets. These results suggest that any theory of the pathogenesis of this disorder must account for inappropriate renal vitamin D metabolism and for renal hyperphosphaturia.

The failure of high-dosage oral phosphate and ergocalciferol to fully correct demineralization may suggest a role for calcitriol 2D3) as a therapeutic agent.

### Elevated 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels… [^1155rM2i]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- It is generally agreed that the kidneys are the only site of 1-hydroxylation of vitamin D and that the abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis is caused by increased production of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. We describe a patient with sarcoidosis with hypercalcemic nephropathy and end-stage renal disease undergoing long-term maintenance hemodialysis who was initially seen with hypercalcemia and elevated serum levels of 1, 25–2D. Prednisone administration resulted in decreased serum calcium and 1, 25–2D levels. These results confirm the recent evidence for extrarenal production of 1, 25–2D in sarcoidosis and illustrate the importance of altered vitamin D metabolism in the development of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.
