## Question

A security guard relocated to a state which required all persons wishing to practice private security to have graduated from a security training program within the state. The security guard, having already graduated from a program in his former state, wishes to work again as a private security guard. He began to advertise his services but was informed by the state that he must cease and desist from working as a private security guard until he complied with state law and graduated from an in-state program. The security guard challenges the constitutionality of the licensing statute on grounds that it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

Answer Choices:
A. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the state does not have a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation.
B. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process.
C. The state has the burden of persuasion to show a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation.
D. The state has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security does not violate the petitioner's rights of due process.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement most accurately describes the burden of persuasion in a Fourteenth Amendment due process challenge to a state licensing requirement for private security guards. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the applicable constitutional standard and whether this is a substantive due process or procedural due process claim. Then, I should verify which party bears the burden of proof in due process challenges to economic regulations. Next, I will examine the level of scrutiny applied and whether "compelling state interest" is the correct test here. Finally, I will compare each answer choice against the correct legal framework and select the best option, making sure I don't conflate burden of proof with burden of production or misstate the standard of review.

> Let me first confirm the legal framework. This is a substantive due process challenge to an economic regulation, not a fundamental-rights case, so the appropriate standard is rational basis review, not strict scrutiny. Under rational basis, the state must show a legitimate government interest and a rational relationship between the regulation and that interest, and the burden is on the challenger to prove the law is arbitrary or irrational, not on the state to prove a compelling interest [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the burden allocation. In substantive due process challenges to economic regulations, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to demonstrate that the law lacks a rational basis and is therefore unconstitutional. The state does not have to prove a compelling interest; that higher burden applies only when strict scrutiny is triggered, which is not the case here [^notfound].

> I will now examine each option against that framework. Option A says the security guard must show the state lacks a compelling interest; hold on, that's backwards for rational basis review — compelling interest is the strict-scrutiny test, not the rational-basis test, so A misstates the standard. Option B says the security guard has the burden to show the denial violates due process; that aligns with the rule that the challenger bears the burden under rational basis review, so B looks correct. Option C says the state must show a compelling interest; again, that's the wrong standard for economic regulations. Option D says the state must show the denial does not violate due process; that would invert the normal burden in substantive due process cases and is incorrect here [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the state might bear the burden because licensing statutes can implicate the right to pursue a calling, but I should double-check that. The Supreme Court treats economic liberty claims under rational basis, placing the burden on the challenger to negate any conceivable rational basis, so my initial inclination was off and Option B remains the accurate statement of the law [^notfound].

> Final answer: B. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process, because economic regulations are reviewed under rational basis and the challenger must prove the law is arbitrary or irrational [^notfound].

---

The most accurate statement is **B. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process**. In economic liberty cases, the **burden is on the challenger** to prove that the licensing requirement lacks a rational basis or is arbitrary, not on the state to prove a compelling interest [^notfound]. The state must merely show a legitimate public purpose and a rational relation to that purpose, which is a low bar [^notfound]. Thus, options A, C, and D misstate the burden of proof or the applicable legal standard.

---

## Legal framework: due process and economic liberty

The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects against arbitrary government action, including in economic contexts [^notfound]. However, **economic regulations are presumed constitutional** and are upheld if they bear a rational relation to a legitimate government interest [^notfound]. This is the rational basis test, which is highly deferential to the legislature [^notfound].

---

## Burden of persuasion in economic due process cases

In challenges to economic regulations, the **burden of persuasion rests with the challenger** to demonstrate that the law is arbitrary, irrational, or lacks a reasonable relation to a legitimate government interest [^notfound]. The state is not required to prove a compelling interest; it need only articulate a legitimate purpose and show a rational connection to that purpose [^notfound].

---

## Application to the security guard's case

The state's requirement that private security guards complete an in-state training program is an economic regulation that implicates the rational basis test. The state can reasonably argue that in-state training ensures familiarity with local laws, procedures, and standards, thereby promoting public safety and order. The security guard must persuade the court that this requirement is arbitrary, irrational, or lacks a reasonable relation to a legitimate government interest — a **difficult burden to meet** under rational basis review [^notfound].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Statement** | **Accuracy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the state does not have a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation. | Incorrect | The state does not need to prove a compelling interest; it only needs to show a legitimate interest and rational relation. |
| B | The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process. | Correct | This accurately reflects that the challenger bears the burden under rational basis review. |
| C | The state has the burden of persuasion to show a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation. | Incorrect | This misstates the standard; compelling interest applies in strict scrutiny, not rational basis. |
| D | The state has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security does not violate the petitioner's rights of due process. | Incorrect | This inverts the burden; the challenger must prove the violation, not the state. |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B**. The security guard bears the burden of persuasion to demonstrate that the in-state training requirement violates due process by lacking a rational basis or being arbitrary, while the state need only show a legitimate purpose and rational relation to that purpose [^notfound].

### Learners' perspectives on: a course to improve survival during mass casualty events [^b2643625]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on collected participant feedback from HMC, course interest is high within the greater Washington State community. A national survey from 2016 confirmed that a there is a need for STB training; a majority of respondents — over 90% — stated they were physically able and willing to provide first aid for someone they did not know after a mass shooting or car crash and over 80% of respondents indicated they would be interested in attending a class to learn bleeding control techniques. Geographically expanding course offerings to Central and Eastern Washington could increase the number of laypeople with the skills and confidence to assist others during mass casualty events, leading to a potential to save more lives.

Training in hemorrhage control has been researched in military and hospital settings before the need to educate the public became clear. There exist strong similarities with the modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) program, developed in the 1960s and first taught to healthcare workers.CPR training is now widely available to the general public and is required education for first responders, health professionals, and even high school graduates in 38 states and Washington, DC. There is growing support for legislation that requires Bcon education for Washington State students as well. As the number of mass shootings continues to rise, so, too, does the importance of educating the public regarding hemorrhage control. Just like a bystander with CPR training, a layperson with STB training can save a life during an emergency situation. In 2018, the Netter School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University (New Haven, CT) established itself as the first Hartford Consensus-Complaint Medical School in the USA. During a recent mass shooting in Pittsburgh, PA, STB graduates were able to access public bleeding kits and properly place tourniquets for wounded victims. Georgia recently became the first state to offer hemorrhage control kits and training to every public school. The impact of the STB course itself, advocacy for educational programs, and public access to bleeding control equipment is already apparent.

### Advocating for life support training of children, parents, caregivers, school personnel, and the public [^c8c0d1ef]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric OHCA training adoption — program outcomes and legislation highlights that programs placing automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in high schools reported "a total of 94 lives saved, of which 49% were children younger than 18 years", and the Canadian ACT Foundation "helped to deliver training to more than 3.8 million students". In the United States, "Thirty-seven states require CPR training for high school graduation. Unfortunately, only 2 states have passed legislation that addresses funding". Additionally, "21 states mandate the placement of AEDs in public schools, only 2 states (OR and NJ) mandate AEDs in all public and private schools, and only 4 states (OR, AL, RI, TX) have state funding".

### The state of the academic medical center in allergy / immunology: work group report of the AAAAI A / I division directors committee [^d6fe0a66]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Threats — training exposure and funding constraints in allergy/immunology (A/I) emphasize limited curricular presence, funding caps, and declining academic career interest: "A/I is not part of a core curriculum in internal medicine and pediatric programs but rather is an elective, thus limiting exposure to this specialty". Moreover, "there is lack of assigned institutional funding for fellowship programs, and the residency federal cap limits the ability to increase fellowship positions throughout the country", and "The trend in A/I fellowship programs since 2008 shows a lower number of programs compared to other subspecialties". Exposure barriers also include that "students and residents rotating through hospitals may not be familiar with the specialty", contributing to "missed opportunities at many levels to engage, recruit, and retain a robust workforce and expand A/I programs". Career preferences compound these issues, as "A major threat is the growing trend of trainees moving away from pursuing academic careers and instead pursuing private equity–owned, private practices, industry, or other nonclinical careers", and "Recent proposals to decrease overall research funding to academic medical institutions and the US Department of Education trainee funding will all adversely impact the education of A/I trainees, limiting promising careers and research advancement".

### Firearm-related injuries and deaths in children and youth: injury prevention and harm reduction [^237d3863]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric firearm injury prevention — legislation and safety policy proposals — states that "Stronger, effective legislation should be enacted and enforced at the state and federal level", including universal background checks that "should be performed before all firearm purchases" and "should be applied not only to firearms sold at federally licensed firearm dealers but for all transactions" including "gun shows, private sales and transfers, and online purchases". Buyer regulations include increasing age limits for certain firearms, requiring a permit or license, and a waiting period before purchase; "Standardized, evidence-based safety training should be mandatory for all buyers", and "Waiting periods may reduce the risk of impulsive acts… and allow sufficient time for background checks to be conducted". Child access prevention laws hold owners liable if a child can or does access a firearm, and "More stringent child access prevention laws are associated with decreased firearm deaths in children 0 to 14 years of age". "Extreme risk protection order laws" ("red flag laws") prohibit at-risk individuals from purchasing or owning a firearm by court order and allow temporary removal of firearms, and "These laws are associated with decreases in firearm violence". Safety design and regulation proposals note that "Safety mechanisms, like trigger locks, should be required" and call for regulations of "privately made firearms ('ghost guns')" with background check and marking requirements. The document also describes that semiautomatic military-style weapons and high-capacity magazine bans address weapons that "can fire multiple rounds of ammunition without reloading", with "Banning these weapons would restrict access to the types of weapons most often used in mass shootings".

### Summary of the proceedings of the international forum 2020: "Radiologists fighting COVID-19: a United response to a global crisis" [^6aa109a8]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

G. McGinty, on behalf of the American College of Radiology (ACR), pointed out that, as the "Voice of Radiology" with payers and policy makers, the American College of Radiology has issued guidance about the role of imaging and the need to prioritize safety by suspending non-urgent imaging. Given the initial shortages of Protective Personal Equipment (PPE), the ACR has also advocated for a safe working environment for the imaging community especially for technologists and trainees, many of whom were redeployed to "front line" care settings. A wholesale shift to remote working for many radiologists was supported by guidance from the ACR to inform safe and secure interpretations from home. Looking at the future consequences of the pandemic, G. McGinty explained that social distancing and cleaning requirements will make a return to prior volumes impractical for many and the financial future for some practices is uncertain. This will in turn have a knock-on effect on the job market for graduating trainees compounded by an anticipated recession and stock market volatility that will cause some senior radiologists to defer retirement. That is why the US Congress has authorized trillions of dollars in relief packages and, given that many radiologists in the US are independent practice owners, the ACR has provided invaluable guidance to members to help them navigate the complexities of qualifying for these programs. The ACR is also working actively with Congress to mitigate the impact of planned reimbursement cuts to radiology scheduled for 2021 with an average expected decrease in payment for imaging services of 10%. Commenting on the measures introduced by the Federal Government and many States, G. McGinty stated that the State of Emergency permitted relaxation of many regulations some of which are welcome and the ACR will lobby for their retention, while others, such as the expansion of scope of unsupervised practice of what are known as Advanced Practice Providers (APPs), will be threatening to radiologists in the longer term and the ACR will oppose their continuation. Commenting on the ACR Annual Meeting, it was stated that while the Meeting was converted to a virtual format it nevertheless succeeded in recreating the open debate and representative governance with even greater attendance participation at some sessions than normal. The ACR's educational offerings, such as the American Institute of Radiologic Pathology, have also been converted to a virtual format with active work to ensure the use of appropriate tools and delivery to ensure a meaningful remote experience. The ACR's Wellness initiative is actively working to support radiologists who may be working from home as well as juggling home schooling as well as dealing with existing burn out. Finally, G. McGinty explained that the ACR's Center for Research and Innovation and its Data Science Institute are collaborating with other radiology and medical specialty societies to learn from the pandemic by establishing a registry of imaging and clinical data.

### Sudden death in the young: information for the primary care provider [^471ac190]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

School advocacy by clinicians — AED access, training, and policy: The primary care provider (PCP) and pediatric cardiologist can have a major impact in advocating for sufficient AEDs, continual staff training, equipment maintenance, and having a CERP in place; many states have passed legislation requiring CPR or AED training for students to graduate from high school or as part of the health curriculum, and the task force supports efforts to make CPR and/or AED training a graduation requirement.

### Physicians and joint negotiations [^c4f702d6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This position paper of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine addresses public policy issues related to physicians' joining to negotiate issues affecting patient care and the working environment in which patient services are provided. It seeks to identify an appropriate way for physicians to negotiate jointly with health care plans while maintaining professionalism and keeping the interests of patients paramount. It proposes that physicians in nonintegrated private practices should be able to meet and communicate among themselves for the purpose of negotiating primarily with health care plans about specific issues that affect quality and access. However, the College opposes strikes or any joint action by physicians that would deny or limit services to patients or result in price-fixing or other anticompetitive behavior. The College states that employed physicians should continue to have negotiating rights. It maintains, despite a recent decision by the National Labor Relations Board, that physicians in residency training are protected by accreditation requirements for programs of graduate medical education, and education content should not be subject to negotiations. Physicians in residency training are protected by accreditation requirements for programs of graduate medical education, and educational content should not be subject to negotiations. The College also calls for determination of negotiating units for physicians but recommends that nonphysician providers not be included in the same units as physicians. Membership in an organization that negotiates for physicians should be voluntary, and conflict-resolution mechanisms must be available for resolving impasses.

### 'Advice, not orders'? The evolving legal status of clinical guidelines [^80d7f2f3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Healthcare professionals are expected to deliver care that is consistent with clinical guidelines. In this article, we show that the English courts are increasingly willing to be persuaded by written guidelines when determining the standard of care in cases of alleged clinical negligence. This reflects a wider shift in the approach taken by courts in a number of common law jurisdictions around the world. However, we argue that written guidelines are still only one element that courts should consider when determining the standard of care. It is possible to deliver perfect care that deviates from professional guidelines and even to deliver negligent care by uncritically following a guideline that is flawed. We further argue that written guidelines are relevant beyond defining the accepted standard of care. This is because the decision to deviate from a guideline suggests the existence of multiple approaches that should be discussed with patients as part of ensuring informed consent. It is therefore likely that written guidelines will become an even more prominent feature of the medicolegal landscape in future years.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^96c3213d]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Additional considerations and caveats — administrative burden and mental health stigma are highlighted: 'Numerous laws, policies, regulations, and standards for health care in the United States contribute to the administrative burden placed on clinicians', and 'Healthcare policy makers, regulatory bodies, and accreditation groups should identify, reduce, or eliminate policies, rules, and administrative processes that provide minimal or no value to patient care, increase unnecessary administrative burden, and negatively affect physician well-being'. Regarding mental health, 'The stigma of seeking mental health help in the United States is highly prevalent, is especially pervasive in medicine, and is associated with barriers to seeking help', so 'Robust efforts are needed to reverse this, including reforms of questions asked by licensing boards, employers, and credentialing boards', and 'legislative reforms that legally protect clinicians who seek help for mental health conditions are necessary such that their personal health information is not admissible in medical malpractice litigation cases'.

### The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^bb49cc37]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The implementation of evidence-based programmes will need to coincide with greater attention paid to addressing commercial and political determinants of health, including the tobacco industry, food industries, fossil fuel industries, and the gun lobby and industry. These powerful industries heavily influence risk factor exposure in the USA and are often in opposition to human health; therefore, any comprehensive approach to addressing health risk must consider and work to diminish the role these industries play. The issue of gun control in the USA is a prime example. It is highly contentious and politically charged, fuelled by a combination of a prevailing interpretation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution that protects an individual's right to bear arms, the influence of a powerful gun lobby, and deeply ingrained cultural attitudes towards firearms. Although gun violence contributes less than other health conditions to total DALYs in the USA, it remains a greater issue in the USA than in any other high-income country, with the USA ranked first in age-standardised deaths due to physical violence by firearm among all high-income countries and 29th in the world, as well as second in the world for age-standardised deaths due to self-harm by firearm. Despite these relatively high rates of gun-related violence and suicide, the USA has not taken meaningful steps towards implementing comprehensive gun control policies that could reduce the frequency and scale of such tragic gun-related incidents. The power of the gun lobby in shaping public opinion and influencing political decisions stifles meaningful progress on gun-control legislation. The country's reluctance to address this public health crisis head-on is in stark contrast with the actions taken in other countries that have experienced mass shootings or high rates of gun-related violence, such as Australia and Norway. These nations have implemented robust gun-control measures, often with remarkable success in reducing gun-related deaths. The USA must prioritise the safety and wellbeing of all within its borders by implementing evidence-based policy changes that focus on the public health implications of gun violence.

### Implications of the precautionary principle in research and policy-making [^21c24e0f]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The Precautionary Principle (PP) has recently been formally introduced into national and international law. The key element is the justification for acting in the face of uncertainty. The PP is thereby a tool for avoiding possible future harm associated with suspected, but not conclusive, environmental risks. Under the PP, the burden of proof is shifted from demonstrating the presence of risk to demonstrating the absence of risk and it is the responsibility of the producer of a technology to demonstrate its safety rather than the responsibility of public authorities to show harm. Past experiences show the costly consequences of disregarding early warnings about environmental hazards. Today, the need for applying the PP is even greater. New research is needed to expand current insight into disease causation, to elucidate the full scope of potential adverse implications resulting from environmental pollutants, and to identify opportunities for prevention. Research approaches should be developed and strengthened to counteract innate ideological biases and to support our confidence in applying the PP for decision-making in the public policy arena.

### The brain health imperative in the 21st century – A call to action: the AAN brain health platform and position statement [^c6566f7d]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Public policy, education needs, and direct-to-public messaging — The page notes "The AAN has a long history of advocating for funding to advance research, improve patient care, and the use of evidence-based guidelines in legislative and regulatory decision making" and that "The clearest identified need was to advance policies and programs that provide meaningful, comprehensive support for the brain as early as possible and for as long as possible". For workforce development, it states "Training a broad workforce of health care partners who can meet public brain health needs as they evolve and accelerate developments in this field will require coordinated, collaborative approaches across various disciplines" and that "The work groups identified educational gaps and recommended developing brain health curricula and new training programs that not only emphasize the importance of brain health but are also specifically tailored to cultivate brain health expertise", with expertise that "can be strategically folded into existing medical fields, such as pediatrics and geriatrics". For communication, the document states "Effective and compelling public health communication is core to the mission of the AAN Action Plan for Brain Health Across the Lifetime" and "Each work group developed epoch-specific recommendations on the ideal direction that public messaging around brain health could take".

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^ff6d5f79]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society policy statement — harm reduction strategy adoption should guard against inequitable allocation of resources, and strategies should be aimed at mitigating not only harms to individuals engaging in the target activity but also harms to others who may be affected. The unintended social costs of implementation should remain of concern, and poorly implemented approaches may disproportionately accrue harms or benefits to subsets of the population in an unfair manner. In that regard, harm reduction strategies should be tailored to the specific needs of vulnerable populations, and those most likely to be targeted and affected by unsubstantiated harm reduction claims, including low-income populations who suffer disproportionate tobacco-related health burdens, should be part of the discussion designing reduction policies that serve them. Involving a wide range of stakeholders in the development and implementation of evidence-based harm reduction strategies will encourage culturally and ethically acceptable implementation.

### CDC program evaluation framework, 2024 [^6527b15f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

A key decision point related to data sources is whether information needed to answer evaluation questions will be collected from all units of a specific source (e.g. all recipient reports submitted) or a subset (e.g. random sample of all recipient reports). If sampling is needed, the criteria used and rationale for the sampling strategy should be stated clearly to provide information that interest holders can use to interpret the evidence accurately and assess potential biases.

Data quantity and quality. When collecting data, consider the quantity needed. Collecting the appropriate amount and types of data to answer the evaluation questions sufficiently (i.e. need to know) is important, as is avoiding the desire to collect data that might be tangential to answering evaluation questions (i.e. nice to know). Balancing the amount of data with the burden (in terms of time commitment and effort) data collection can place on the respondents and others who might be involved in data collection and processing can be challenging. Collaboratively engaging with communities can help ensure the right balance is struck for the specific context.

Data quality refers to the appropriateness and integrity of the data used in an evaluation. High-quality data are reliable, valid, authentic, and informative for their intended use. Well-defined indicators enable easier collection of quality data because they clarify what specific data are viewed as credible and necessary to answer the evaluation questions. Other factors affecting quality include instrument design, data collection procedures, training of data collectors, source selection, coding, data management, data cleaning, and error checking. Obtaining quality data will entail tradeoffs (e.g. breadth versus depth), and discussing the options with interest holders when planning the evaluation can highlight how certain tradeoffs might affect perceived data credibility.

Data collection and context considerations. The timing and infrastructure for collecting, handling, and storing data, and the cultural context need to be considered when making decisions regarding gathering data. Persons providing data should be knowledgeable about their rights; any associated risks; and how the data will be handled, stored, and used, including how privacy and confidentiality will be protected in the process.

### Toward a model long-term services and supports system: state policy elements [^2f1f000c]. The Gerontologist (2014). Low credibility.

Availability of and support for consumer-directed services is another key issue. Many HCBS programs incorporate some level of consumer direction, such as consumer choice in the allocation of service budgets or in the hiring and firing of service providers. By 2010, 44 states allowed consumer direction within some or all of their Medicaid HCBS programs. Support for consumer direction can include the following:

Services from independent providers. Programs in 36 states allow consumer direction of services received from an independent (nonagency) provider. In some state systems, most notably California, independent providers are the norm, while an agency model predominates elsewhere.
Matching service registries. First created in California in the 1990s, publicly funded registries exist in 19 states to help consumers find workers meeting their requirements. Consumers can either perform their own database searches or call the operating agency and request matches.
Fiscal intermediary or financial management services to shield self-directing consumers from the paperwork and other burdens of being an employer. These services can be provided by a quasi-governmental agency, a private payroll or similar business, or an independent living center, home health agency, or other provider.
The ability to employ family members, who are often the consumer's preferred source of consumer-directed LTSS, is allowed by PCS programs in 20 states, but only 4 states allow a spouse or legal guardian to serve as a paid helper. California's In-Home Supportive Services program is often seen as the model for such a system.
The availability of backup help in case the scheduled worker does not arrive is a particular problem for consumers using independent providers, who may have nowhere to turn if the worker does not show up. A few small-scale programs serve as models of this type of service (see, e.g.).
Consumer training in hiring, supervising, and firing workers, and, if necessary, keeping records, making payments, and so on. Such training might be provided by independent living centers, fiscal intermediary agencies, or the HCBS program.
Flexible budgets with which to pay for services, along with support in using them. The Cash and Counseling Demonstrations pioneered this approach, with good results in terms of greater satisfaction and reduced unmet need. More recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has begun offering Veteran-Directed HCBS, which closely follows the Cash and Counseling model and offers support in budget planning and management.

### Brain death, the determination of brain death, and member guidance for brain death accommodation requests: AAN position statement [^287260b4]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) uniformity of brain death determination — public trust in accurate brain death determinations and the ability of courts to adjudicate contentious cases will be enhanced by uniform brain death laws, policies, and practices. Accordingly, the AAN supports legislation modeled after the Nevada statute and efforts to develop uniform institutional policies, training programs, credentialing mechanisms, institutional compliance policies, research to enhance the brain death knowledge base and the accuracy of its determination, and enhanced professional and public education.

### Soccer injuries in children and adolescents [^35b9a66c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Concussion in youth soccer — legislation, heading mechanisms, and equipment evidence — emphasizes that all 50 states and the District of Columbia mandate concussion protocols, with models requiring automatic removal for suspected concussion and medical clearance before return; most soccer concussions during heading are due to player-player contact, with contact the most common mechanism in heading-related concussions among boys (68.8%) and girls (51.3%). The US Soccer Federation initiative bans heading for children 10 years and younger and limits heading in practice for children between the ages of 11 and 13 years. Current evidence is insufficient to support the uniform use of headgear or mouth guards to prevent concussion; mouth guards prevent orofacial injuries but evidence is mixed for concussion risk reduction. Laboratory testing shows soccer headgear has not been shown to attenuate head impacts during simulated soccer ball heading, and the national governing body for soccer in the United States does not permit members or affiliates to require headgear use; padded headgear use is described as controversial because of limited rigorous studies and concern for possible increased risk from a false sense of security.

### Hurricane evacuation laws in eight Southern U.S. coastal States-December 2018 [^797ce1a3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the principles of legal epidemiology, * evacuation laws enacted as of December 31, 2018, in southern coastal states were collected and systematically examined. State laws related to large-scale evacuation were identified using the search string SD((evacuat! Egress ((leave vacat!) /s area))) in Thomson Reuters Westlaw (Eagan, Minnesota), a subscription-based legal research service. Statutes and regulations were analyzed using an abstraction instrument with guidance from legal professionals. Each law was reviewed by two independent reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved in consultation with CDC's Public Health Law Program.

The search identified 2,150 laws; 91 of those laws (including 72 statutes and 19 regulations) specifically addressed evacuation procedures. Domain and thematic analyses of existing laws were conducted. Seven relevant domains were identified (evacuation decision-making, communications, populations at risk, responder protection, plan agreements, transportation, and shelter) that encompassed 24 related themes informed by a literature review. Abstracted laws were collapsed into 17 relevant themes for analysis and comparison between states (Table).

### Personal care aides as household employees and independent contractors: estimating the size and job characteristics of the workforce [^d2e1ca4c]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

PCAs working as independent contractors, on the other hand, seem to have a lower chance of working full-time year-round than those employed by agencies. Their median annual earnings tend to be lower than those of agency employees. However, their mean annual earnings surpassed those of agency employees, indicating that some independent contractors were earning significantly more than agency employees. This seemed particularly true for full-time year-round working independent contractors in most states because their mean annual earnings were consistently higher than those of all agency employees working full-time year-round. Although these findings cannot serve as evidence of some of PCAs' motivations to work as household employees and independent contractors, they are suggestive of the potential that a higher earnings possibility may lure them into those employment arrangements. Given the fact that most PCAs lack full-time year-round employment and nonwage compensations, the potential to make higher earnings may significantly influence their decision to work as household employees or independent contractors. Yet, as discussed above, these workers may experience a higher risk of being unreported or misclassified workers as well as experiencing labor market injustice.

Besides the implications for workers' rights to economic security and labor market protection, employment arrangements also have significant implications for the quality of care that the PCAs provide. Because many states do not require training of PCAs even for those paid by Medicaid-funded programs, PCAs employed directly by consumers or through private-pay arrangements (i.e. independent contractors or household employees) are even less likely to be trained, certified, supervised by registered nurses regularly, and required to renew their certification. The lack of training requirements undermines the quality of the workforce, and the quality issue may be more acute for the workforce in less formal employment arrangements. The presence of a substantial size of household employees and independent contractors also has implications for the worker shortages in the more formal labor market as home care agencies see direct hires by consumers as the most serious competition. States with generous public home care programs may have a lower share of PCAs working as household employees or independent contractors. The presence of these employment arrangements for PCAs speaks to the poor job characteristics of the more formal labor market in the home care industry as well as the lack of access to publicly funded quality home care services for middle-income consumers in the United States.

### The current approach of the courts [^fc117b99]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The approach of the courts when considering proprietary ('ownership') interests in human bodily material has been pragmatic and piecemeal. The general principle was initially that such material is not legally 'property' that can be 'owned', but courts have recognised many exceptions. In determining disputes between individuals in particular cases, they have stated principles that are often inconsistent with those stated in other cases with different facts. Later judges have been constrained by these decisions, especially when made at appellate level. They can distinguish the facts of one case from another to achieve a different outcome, but they cannot state new principles to be applied more widely to promote consistency. This requires the will of Parliament and legislation to introduce new principles. Experience to date suggests that such legislation will need to be wide-ranging and complex, with different principles for different circumstances. There will not be one area of law that answers all the issues that arise.

### The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^df15a7da]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

In addressing the disease burden in the USA, it is crucial to acknowledge the growing issue of drug use and addiction, a problem that has been largely exacerbated by the over-prescription of pain medications. The failure of pain clinics and other health providers to regulate the distribution of these medications has led to a widespread opioid crisis, resulting not only in increased addiction rates but also a substantial strain on our health-care system. In recent years, the increasing availability of cheaper, more potent alternatives such as fentanyl has worsened the problem even further. The policies needed to slow and ultimately reverse drug use trends in the USA include tightening regulations on prescription practices, investing in effective prevention and treatment programmes, and fostering a greater understanding of addiction as a public health concern rather than a criminal issue. Similarly, US authorities must redouble their efforts to control the flow of illegal drugs, which can be aided through international cooperation and intelligence-sharing among law enforcement agencies. By proactively addressing the root causes of drug addiction and implementing evidence-based policies, we can reverse the growing burden of drug use on Americans' health and avert an even more challenging future.

Mental health remains a stigmatised and under-addressed issue, and in the USA, is often segregated from physical health at both the programmatic level — with the US CDC focusing on physical health and SAMHSA focusing on mental health — and patient level, with limited coordination between primary care physicians and mental health doctors and treatment facilities. Policy makers and the public should push for a more comprehensive approach to health care that encompasses both mental and physical wellbeing, emphasising prevention, and ensuring that those without mental health issues remain healthy. The current system, where the CDC focuses primarily on physical health while SAMHSA combines mental health with substance abuse, only perpetuates the taboo that mental health issues inevitably lead to drug problems and vice versa. This flawed structure not only reinforces stigma but also hinders our ability to effectively tackle mental health challenges. To build a healthier, more resilient society, we must integrate mental health into all aspects of health care and prioritise preventive measures on national and state levels. However, there is limited knowledge surrounding preventive programmes for mental health. There is a pressing need for more research in this area to identify effective interventions and promote mental wellbeing to improve overall public health and quality of life.

### Global burden of injuries: it is time to understand the data in order to intervene [^b93481af]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

The field of population health has benefited in recent years due to greater visibility in the popular domain as well as advances in the underlying data and methods. However, injury burden has not always received exposure and attention equitable to its global importance. This is surprising given the field of injury prevention is to some extent predicated on the principle that exposure to injury risk is universal. Injuries such as falls are widely relatable. Among people who have an injury from a fall, though, some may survive unscathed and some may develop permanent disability or die. The accompanying studies in this series on the global burden of injury are an effort to investigate and understand these trends across injuries on broader levels.

Injuries and their burden can be reduced with effective measures of prevention and treatment. However, more nuanced measurement of injury risk and burden is critical for adopting more widespread prevention and treatment measures. When it comes to rates of different injuries, questions such as why, how, where, what, when, and so on… are key questions that these series are addressing in order to improve our knowledge and inform our response.

### The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^4ab344c0]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

GBD 2021 offers an updated analysis of health trends and risk factors at the state level in the USA that accounts for the effects of the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reveals the disparities in health outcomes and risk factors across states and underscores the need for tailored strategies to address specific health challenges. By presenting comprehensive and timely estimates on mortality, morbidity, and risk factors, GBD 2021 enables stakeholders in the USA to identify priority areas for interventions, allocate resources more effectively, and assess the effects of health policies and programmes. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of understanding health disparities and addressing the needs of vulnerable populations. GBD 2021 highlights the disease, injuries, and risk factors that are the largest sources of morbidity and mortality; our findings can be used by policy makers, medical professionals, and researchers to inform investing strategies and policy interventions that target the causes of health loss and premature mortality.

Implications of all the available evidence

The results of our study reveal that areas of the USA underperform in several key health metrics compared with nearly all high-income and even some middle-income countries and territories. In 2021, eight states (West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arizona) had age-standardised rates of years lived with disability greater than any country in the world. The USA's global ranking in healthy life expectancy (HALE) declined compared with other countries; indeed, when comparing HALE in the worst-ranked US state versus the rest of the world, West Virginia ranked 141st among all 203 other countries and territories for males and 137th for females in 2021. This study's comprehensive estimates of disease burden in the USA show that we must shift our focus from a predominantly curative care model to a more comprehensive strategy that places equal emphasis on prevention, social safety nets, and investments in evidence-based solutions. Our study highlights the areas that demand immediate attention and emphasises the importance of addressing social determinants of health, health disparities, and the need for targeted interventions. This study illuminates glaring gaps in our health system and provides policy makers, health-care professionals, researchers, and the public the knowledge needed to put forth a concerted effort to transform the US health-care system and population health landscape.

### Comment: silent burden no more: a global call to action to prioritize perinatal mental health [^1d4b1264]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Our urgent call comes on the heels of several global efforts. The 2014 Lancet Commission on Perinatal Mental Health called for the inclusion of PMH in all mental health programs, and the 2018 Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development warned that the abysmally slow response to addressing mental health would lead to missing Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 targets explicitly promoting mental health and wellbeing. Global guidelines have elevated these priorities, particularly in LMICs where women are disproportionately impacted. In September 2021, a global Maternal Mental Health Technical Consultation convened by the United States Agency for International Development, in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health Organization, with 700 participants from 72 countries, called for urgent action. The message was clear — the challenge is complex but not intractable. Solutions must be evidence-based, involve women to create community-driven solutions, while changing national policy and global standards - and they must include CPMD prevention and mental health promotion. The global community needs to act with urgency, otherwise women, children and families will suffer the consequences: intergenerational poverty, women's morbidity and mortality, and children not meeting growth and development indicators. To promote perinatal mental wellbeing as a human right, we propose the following actions:
The global community must prioritize women's PMH needs by establishing global standards, guidelines, and strategies to fully integrate PMH into existing programs; and establish and create indicators and monitoring mechanisms to continually assess global progress towards achieving a PMH target.
Governments should be accountable to women's PMH needs, state their commitment to PMH explicitly in their national policies, and link policies to budgetary allocations that are adequately financed and integrated across other health and development sectors to promote intersectoral collaboration. And governments must also recognize that effective health policies must be aimed at improving the social status of women to have the impact women need and deserve.
Health systems need to integrate evidence-based PMH approaches into sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health services; nutrition services; and universal health coverage. The capacity of existing providers should be strengthened through competency-based training, supportive supervision, and adequate remuneration. A critical mass of providers or provider time should be made available, commensurate with the CPMD burden of the local context. Provider skills should include mental health promotion, prevention, and detection; respectful, culturally appropriate person-centered psychological care; and case management.
There should be a global commitment to strengthening implementation including implementation research and building on the emerging evidence for practice in LMIC settings with significant learning from the humanitarian sector. There is promising data from several trials that task-sharing approaches and digital interventions are effective for delivery of psychological interventions and treatment by lay health workers. For sustainability, real world implementation strategies need to be developed and assessed where these approaches are adapted for context and fully integrated into health systems at scale, with adequate fidelity. Particular attention should be given to women living in conflict and crisis affected situations, with adaptations made to meet the increasing scale of the need in these contexts.
At the community level, evidence-based task sharing models and collaboration with existing platforms and community structures should be employed. Integrated care pathways between community and facilities should be strengthened. Effective strategies to address family issues affecting women's mental health and reduce stigma should be integrated across these platforms.
When social determinants are addressed as part of PMH interventions, women's overall health and socioeconomic status improves. Interventions to improve PMH should also include solutions outside the traditional health arena: peer support groups, economic empowerment, and intimate partner violence interventions. Given the gendered nature of CPMDs, each of these interventions should be gender intentional and gender transformative. And partners should be included in interventions and acknowledged for the role they can play in PMH.
At the individual citizen level, we must work to address the paralyzing shame and stigma preventing women from seeking and accessing care and from having honest conversations about the burden that is impacting their lives and capabilities. Though we recognize that stigma is a social construct and one that must be changed at the societal level, we each have a role as individuals in making these changes in how we think, act and respond

### Abortion training in U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residency programs in a post-dobbs era [^fba14cbf]. Contraception (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires all obstetrics and gynecology residents have access to abortion training. The impact of Dobbs on training remains unknown. We aimed to describe residency programs affected by abortion bans and those lacking abortion training despite permissive state policies. We considered demographic data to understand the impacts on residents under-represented in medicine.

Study Design

We used residency databases and websites to abstract data. We identified programs offering routine abortion training as either those with Ryan Programs or those with website or email acknowledgment of training. We defined states with abortion bans as those with either complete or 6-week bans as of December 2022. We used χ 2 and Student's t tests in descriptive analyses and performed a logistic regression to adjust for demographic and program-specific variables.

Results

Of 286 residency programs included, 140 (49%) offered routine abortion training prior to Dobbs. As of December 2022, 19 of these (14%) had lost the ability to provide routine in-state abortion training. Of 223 residency programs in states with legal abortion, 102 (46%) programs lacked routine abortion training. These sites were more likely to be community or community-university programs, with graduates more likely to practice as generalists. Resident race/ethnicity did not differ between residents in states with legal abortion vs abortion bans.

Conclusions

Nearly half of obstetrics and gynecology residency programs in states with legal abortion do not appear to provide routine abortion training. Further work is needed to understand this paucity of training and maximize access in legislatively permissible environments.

Implications

Following Dobbs, 14% of residency programs lost in-state abortion training. Notably, in states with legal abortion, 46% of programs lack routine abortion training despite permissive legislation. This presents a window of opportunity for expansion of abortion training, particularly at community and community-university hybrid residency sites.

### COVID-19: legal implications for critical care [^62c1a89a]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge for the provision of critical care. Anticipating an unsustainable burden on the health service, the UK Government introduced numerous legislative measures culminating in the Coronavirus Act, which interfere with existing legislation and rights. However, the existing standards and legal frameworks relevant to critical care clinicians are not extinguished, but anticipated to adapt to a new context. This new context influences the standard of care that can be reasonably provided and yields many human rights considerations, for example, in the use of restraints, or the restrictions placed on patients and visitors under the Infection Prevention and Control guidance. The changing landscape has also highlighted previously unrecognised legal dilemmas. The perceived difficulties in the provision of personal protective equipment for employees pose a legal risk for Trusts and a regulatory risk for clinicians. The spectre of rationing critical care poses a number of legal issues. Notably, the flux between clinical decisions based on best interests towards decisions explicitly based on resource considerations should be underpinned by an authoritative public policy decision to preserve legitimacy and lawfulness. Such a policy should be medically coherent, legally robust and ethically justified. The current crisis poses numerous challenges for clinicians aspiring to remain faithful to medicolegal and human rights principles developed over many decades, especially when such principles could easily be dismissed. However, it is exactly at such times that these principles are needed the most and clinicians play a disproportionate role in safeguarding them for the most vulnerable.

Cardiac emergency response plan (CERP) and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in schools — A comprehensive cardiac emergency response plan (CERP) should be implemented by all schools, and the plan should include cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and placement of AEDs; the American Heart Association recommends the adoption of CERPs in schools. Although early defibrillation within 3–5 minutes of collapse can potentially result in 50% to 70% survival rates, less than half of states mandate placing AEDs in public schools and only a few states mandate AEDs in all schools; a recent survey of United States high schools found 83% of schools had at least 1 AED with an average of 2.8 AEDs per school. Despite these benefits, only < 3% of the US population receives CPR training annually, and legislation remains variable, with 17 states (34%) having some legislation requiring AED installation in schools, 1 state requiring installation only in colleges, and another 3 states limiting school installation to interscholastic athletic programs, which accounted for only 17% to 28% of public schools.

### Adult congenital heart disease as a career? Examining encouraging and deterring factors in the global ACHD survey [^08cc865b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Expanding accredited ACHD fellowship positions is a commonly proposed solution, yet the experience in the United States suggests that this strategy is insufficient on its own. The United States has seen a significant increase in accredited ACHD fellowship programs over the past decade; however, many positions remain unfilled, and a significant number of trainees ultimately choose other subspecialties. This suggests that simply establishing programs is insufficient without addressing downstream challenges.

While increasing the number of fellowship opportunities is necessary, it must be accompanied by alternative training pathways to make ACHD more accessible. Short‐term certification programs tailored for general and pediatric cardiologists could provide foundational ACHD training without requiring a full fellowship, allowing a broader group of physicians to develop expertise in this field. Integrating ACHD education into existing cardiology, heart failure, or imaging fellowships could offer a more flexible route for trainees. Telemedicine‐based mentorship programs could also help bridge training gaps, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized centers. International exchange programs and partnerships between high‐resource and low‐resource countries could further strengthen ACHD expertise and workforce development. Early exposure to ACHD during medical school and cardiology residency is another potential strategy to spark interest and build a sustainable pipeline of future specialists.

In addition, financial barriers remain one of the most significant deterrents to pursuing ACHD as a career. Unlike procedural subspecialties such as interventional cardiology or electrophysiology, which benefit from high reimbursement rates, ACHD is primarily nonprocedural, which limits financial incentives. Many health care systems favor reimbursement models that prioritize high‐volume procedures over the long‐term management of patients with complex congenital heart disease. As a result, ACHD specialists often earn less than their counterparts in procedural subspecialties despite requiring years of additional training. Furthermore, most ACHD programs are housed within academic medical centers rather than private practice settings, where earning potential is typically higher. The financial burden of extended training without a proportionate salary increase further discourages many trainees from choosing ACHD, particularly in regions where fellowship salaries are low and student debt is high. Addressing this issue requires a reevaluation of reimbursement structures to appropriately compensate the complexity of ACHD care, as well as institutional salary support to improve the financial sustainability of ACHD careers. Loan forgiveness programs, salary incentives, and research grants dedicated to ACHD specialists could further alleviate financial constraints and encourage more trainees to enter the field.

### Resuscitation attempts in asystolic patients: the legal tail wagging the dog? [^fd409c97]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

In today's litigious society, legal worries can cause Emergency practitioners to alter their delivery of clinical care. One clinical scenario in which this particularly true is in resuscitation of the so called "medically futile" patient. Patients who arrive to the Emergency Department in prolonged asystole have a uniformly dismal prognosis at best. Yet, many Emergency Physicians often continue resuscitative efforts for fear of being sued. These fears are largely unjustified. This article attempts to analyze the factors and elements involved in support of the assertion that the risk of a lawsuit is negligible at best.

### Continuing contributions of field epidemiology training programs to global COVID-19 response [^eb81729a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Theme III: Monitoring and Assessment Activities

FETPs supported infection prevention and control activities for public and private institutions such as schools and companies (in Tanzania and Rwanda), risk assessments for healthcare facilities and schools (in India, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe), and "monitoring and audit of infection prevention and control practices and feedback at hospital level" (in Egypt).

Graduates in El Salvador worked on event-based monitoring. Both graduates and trainees in Turkey and Ukraine monitored case numbers, surveillance data, and laboratory testing data to evaluate surveillance methods. In India, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout also provided opportunities for graduates to conduct "[monitoring] and supervision [of] vaccine rollout in states" and do "field monitoring of surge staff".

Theme IV: Managing Logistics and Operations

FETP trainees and graduates managed logistics and operations at all levels, from testing and sampling to vaccine supply chain management, liaising between different institutions, and organizing staff deployments. In Zimbabwe, graduates worked on "adopting and disseminating SOPs [Standard Operating Procedures]… for specimen collection, management, and transportation for COVID-19 diagnostic testing".

Theme V: Training and Capacity Building

FETP trainees and graduates were heavily involved in efforts to train and build COVID-19–related response capacity across sectors and levels of society. The data showed that from the community level (such as in Uganda, where graduates conducted "training of village health teams of community-based health surveillance") all the way to the national and state levels (as in India, where trainees and graduates conducted "cascade training of national and state level officials on IPC [Infection Prevention and Control]"), their expertise was widely required. Programs reported their participation in training for the following response-related activities: point-of-entry screening, infection prevention and control at healthcare facilities and in the community, case management, specimen collection, and the incident management system.

FETP trainees and graduates served as trainers for vaccine-related rollout activities. They contributed to training on cold-chain standards (Rwanda), training healthcare workers on how to administer the vaccine (Jordan); and "training on abnormal response monitoring", also known as adverse events monitoring (China).

### ERN GENTURIS guidelines on constitutional mismatch repair deficiency diagnosis, genetic counselling, surveillance, quality of life, and clinical management [^e3940d43]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ERN GENTURIS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider confirming the diagnosis of CMMRD in patients meeting one or more criteria for CMMRD testing if:

- two variants in one of the four MMR genes are identified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic and confirmed to be in trans, with additional criteria fulfilled if necessary

- one of two variants in trans is classified as likely pathogenic, pathogenic, or of unknown significance, and the other as a variant of unknown significance, with clinically validated ancillary test results consistent with CMMRD

- one variant is identified as likely pathogenic, pathogenic, or of unknown significance, with evidence of faulty splicing not explained by the variant or reduced expression of the wild-type allele, and clinically validated ancillary test results consistent with CMMRD

- no variant is identified, but clinically validated ancillary test results are consistent with CMMRD, with evidence of faulty splicing or reduced expression of the wild-type alleles by transcript analysis.

### How well have rural and small metropolitan labor markets… [^d7baa376]. aspe.hhs.gov (2001). Low credibility.

The inflow of welfare recipients into the labor market can be attributed to two basic factors: welfare reform and the strong economy. Welfare reform is widely perceived to have begun with the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in mid-1996, which increased the number of welfare recipients who were required to seek work. Welfare Reform States began implementing significant reforms to their welfare programs in the past 10 years, many of which were designed to move welfare recipients into employment more rapidly. This section describes the types of welfare waivers approved between 1993 and 1996 and the major provisions of PRWORA. Waivers were granted to more than 40 states, many of which were statewide reforms. The waivers can be categorized by whether they were restrictive or liberalizing changes: Presumably many of those who left the rolls entered the labor market. In addition to increasing the number of welfare recipients who left the rolls, waivers that enhanced the earnings disregards and expanded eligibility for UP families allowed more individuals to combine work and welfare.
- Sanctions. States are also required to sanction welfare recipients who refuse to meet work participation requirements. It is up to the states to determine the penalty. About 25 percent of states apply full-family sanctions; the remainder sanction adults only or reduce overall grant levels. From P. Loprest and S. Brauner. Where Are They Now. What States Studies of People Who Left Welfare Tell Us. The Urban Institute.

Washington, DC: A survey of state leaver studies found that employment rates ranged from 55 to 75 percent for continuous leavers who were surveyed at a point in time after leaving. However, substantial differences exist between urban and rural labor markets in terms of the economic opportunities, the characteristics of the workforce, and the barriers to employment, suggesting that findings from urban studies might not readily apply to rural areas. Characteristics of Jobs PRWORA stressed employment for all job-ready welfare recipients, which presumes that economic opportunities are available for those who seek them. Economic opportunities can mean the availability of jobs. Also important to consider are the types and quality of employment opportunities. If there are fewer opportunities available to rural welfare recipients, then PRWORA might have more negative consequences in these areas.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^fee8cba9]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our findings show that over the past 30 years, overall population health in the USA has declined compared with that of other countries, including nearly all high-income countries and several middle-income countries; most notably, the global ranks of life expectancy and HALE in the USA declined. Even as the USA increased health spending, undertook large-scale public health campaigns, and used new medical technologies and advancements in treatments, the overall picture of population health in the country and across the states did not look markedly better in 2021 than it did three decades ago. These findings highlight the ongoing challenges that the USA faces in addressing the burden of NCDs and the growing impact of obesity, mental health disorders, and drug use on the quality and length of life in the USA. In addition to informing both state and national health policy, GBD 2021 results can be used by researchers to identify knowledge gaps and areas for further investigation. Importantly, by presenting comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of mortality, morbidity, and risk factors, GBD 2021 enables policy makers and other stakeholders to develop action plans to prioritise for interventions, allocate resources more effectively, and evaluate the effect of health policies and programmes.

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^87637e8a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric informed consent — frameworks guiding parental decisions and thresholds for state intervention emphasize the best-interest standard, the harm principle, and constrained parental autonomy: Historically and legally, pediatric decisions have centered on a best-interest standard to "maximize benefits and minimize harms", while the harm principle applies when safety concerns arise to identify a "harm threshold" below which parental decisions will not be tolerated and outside intervention is indicated; the potential harm "must be serious and imminent and a greater threat than the potential harm from state intervention". When a parental refusal places a child at "significant risk of serious harm", questions to justify state interference include whether projected benefits outweigh burdens more than the parents' option, whether a less intrusive option could prevent harm, whether interference can be generalized to similar cases, and whether the public would agree it is reasonable. Constrained parental autonomy allows balancing the child's best interest with family interests as long as the child's basic needs are met, reinforces that parental authority "is not absolute", and emphasizes family autonomy to promote the child's long-term autonomy within the family setting.

### The global state of the genetic counseling profession [^01b9ab25]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

The Americas

United States of America (~4000 genetic counselors; 39 Master's training programs)

Master's degree trained GCs first originated in the US in 1969. There are several US-based professional organizations addressing the profession, training, accreditation, and certification (Table 3). NSGC provides a professional status survey with information about areas of clinical and non-clinical practice, salary and roles, and other demographics. There are > 1200 applicants yearly to US and Canadian programs (personal communication, Angela Trepanier on behalf of AGCPD) and nearly 400 graduates/year. Master's training in ACGC accredited programs involves a combination of scientific and counseling coursework, supervised clinical training of no less than 50 cases, and a research project. ACGC graduates are eligible for the ABGC certification exam (Table 2). Starting in 2018, internationally trained GCs can be considered for eligibility to take the exam. Upon graduation and certification, GCs can practice clinically without direct supervision by physicians (though most work in an interdisciplinary environment). Within the US, many professions (including GCs) are regulated on a state-specific basis (called "licensure"), through laws meant to provide consumer protection from harm that may occur due to unqualified individuals providing services. This also provides title protection for licensed professionals. In 2018, 22 (of 50) states license GCs, typically on the basis of ABGC certification. Most employers, even in states without licensure, require either ABGC certification or its eligibility for clinical employment. NSGC has developed a scope of practice for genetic counselors, and in some states licensed GCs are able to order genetic tests independently. There has been significant growth in genetic counseling positions over the past 5 years, now resulting in a workplace shortage that is being addressed in various ways including the expansion of training programs and numbers of enrolled students, and consideration of ways in which GCs can "work at the top of our scope" (of practice) and where our unique skills are most valuable within the changing landscape of genetics and genomic testing.

### Global distribution of research efforts, disease burden, and impact of US public funding withdrawal [^3e4cc8cf]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

While research output has remained stable and progress to reduce GBD has been made, we caution against interpreting the current approach as sufficient or low risk. It is plausible that the improved alignment could have been even greater had research responded more directly to evolving health needs, either by influencing disease patterns or by better aligning with them. Our projections indicate that this historical improvement is unlikely to continue. Without intentional redistribution, the alignment between research and disease burden is likely to stagnate, or even decrease, over the next 20 years if the patterns persist.

Past research has advanced two dominant explanations for a stable or inelastic research enterprise. One argument suggests that the adjustment costs of redirecting research are high because scientists are reluctant to change their research programs. The other argument points to latency in the training of the scientific workforce: it takes many years to complete training and reach independence. The resulting subject-specific skills and the need for documented expertise of scientists to secure funding makes it difficult to adjust research programs –, even if scientists might want to. The COVID-19 pandemic proves an exception to both lines of reasoning, with research and funding in many disciplines changing course. Funding for COVID-19 was nimble and focused, allowing researchers to respond timely to a societal demand. Policymakers and funders should learn from this, supporting agenda setting through allocating a portion of their funding toward the most pressing local and global (health) issues and providing more efficient mechanisms for the receipt of funding.

Calls to reform the global research enterprise come at a time of profound change in science funding. At the time of writing, the US administration had proposed a 40% cut to the National Institutes of Health budget, from US$ 47 billion down to US$ 27 billion, while terminating existing grants midstream and doubling the rate of grant rejections. Internationally, the US administration has made drastic withdrawals of funding to global health, including for the US Agency for International Development, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the vaccine alliance Gavi, which the United States will cease to support entirely –. The fiscal year 2026 budget request eliminates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Global Health Center and funding for bilateral programs. A recent study projects that cuts to the US Agency for International Development may result in over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, including more than 4.5 million children under the age of 5 years. Considering the massive cuts across all global health initiatives suggests even starker consequences.

### Privacy, trainee rights, and accountability in radiology education [^33b1617d]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Academic radiologists commonly hold multiple simultaneous roles within the landscape of physician training. This paper analyzes theoretical scenarios describing relationships between medical students, residents, and physician educators in radiology.

Materials and Methods

The scenarios presented involve medical student supervision, radiology resident recruitment, and resident termination with respect to relevant ethical, regulatory, and legal considerations. Legal precedents and the medical social contract are addressed.

Results

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act defines a framework for the privacy practices of medical schools, but it does not confer individual rights. Resident physicians rarely win wrongful termination lawsuits. Physician educators are ethically bound to act in the best interest of society.

Conclusions

Courts have ruled that medicine is intended to be a self-regulatory profession. Such a power requires that physicians remain accountable to the public while providing a fair learning environment for medical trainees.
