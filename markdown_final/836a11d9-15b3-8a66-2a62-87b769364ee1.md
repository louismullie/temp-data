## Question

What are troponin levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what troponin levels are, including what they measure, how assays differ, how to interpret results, and how to apply them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biology and why troponin is specific to the heart. Then, I should verify the assay types and performance characteristics, especially high-sensitivity assays. Next, I will review diagnostic thresholds and the universal definition of myocardial injury. After that, I need to check how to interpret dynamics and sex-specific cutoffs. Finally, I will consider prognostic implications, common non-ACS causes, and practical algorithms for ED use, and I will close with limitations and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the biology. Cardiac troponin I and T are structural proteins of the cardiac sarcomere that regulate contraction; they are not normally abundant in blood, so their detection in plasma indicates cardiomyocyte injury or necrosis, which is why they are the preferred biomarkers for myocardial injury across clinical contexts [^116Eoxpd].

> Wait, let me verify the assay evolution. Conventional assays could detect troponin only when levels were clearly elevated, but high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays detect concentrations in the single-digit ng/L range and meet two key criteria: a coefficient of variation ≤ 10% at the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and detectable levels in more than half of healthy individuals, which enables earlier and more precise detection of myocardial injury [^1161jJyc].

> I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds. Myocardial injury is defined by a troponin value above the 99th percentile URL for the specific assay, and the injury is acute if there is a dynamic rise and/or fall of troponin; importantly, the 99th percentile must be determined for each assay and is often sex-specific because women have lower baseline values than men, which improves diagnostic equity [^116Eoxpd] [^112xkZ8S] [^113KZZr3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single value. I need to check the role of kinetics. Absolute changes in troponin over 1–3 hours outperform relative changes for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction, and serial measurements are essential to distinguish acute injury from chronic elevation; algorithms using 0/1-hour or 0/3-hour hs-cTn sampling are validated to rapidly rule in or rule out MI in the ED [^113wmqdC] [^1125VYuT] [^111RzF4V].

> Let me consider prognostic meaning. Even small troponin elevations carry adverse prognostic information beyond ACS: in a large UK cohort, any positive troponin was associated with a 3.2-fold higher 3-year mortality, with the excess risk concentrated early; similarly, in suspected ACS cohorts, hs-cTn levels correlate with 30-day and longer-term events, supporting risk stratification even when MI is not confirmed [^115JfLWG] [^114jMR9w].

> But wait, what if the elevation is not due to ACS? I should double-check the differential. Non-ACS causes of troponin elevation are common and include heart failure, myocarditis, tachyarrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, renal dysfunction, and hypertensive crises; importantly, these non-ACS troponin elevations still portend worse outcomes and warrant evaluation of the underlying condition rather than automatic antithrombotic therapy for MI [^11219eGm] [^115GygnK].

> Next, I should review practical ED algorithms. Guidelines recommend obtaining hs-cTn as the preferred biomarker in all patients with suspected ACS, with results available within about 60 minutes; validated 0/1-hour or 0/3-hour pathways using very low cutoffs (for example, hs-cTnT < 5–6 ng/L at 0 hours with appropriate delta criteria) can safely rule out MI and allow discharge, while higher values or dynamic changes trigger observation and further workup [^1114sRZk] [^111xC3aF] [^111RzF4V].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In chronic kidney disease, baseline troponin is often elevated, so diagnosis of acute MI relies on a dynamic rise or fall rather than a static threshold; in older adults, even minor troponin elevations carry high mortality, reinforcing the need to interpret any positive result in clinical context rather than dismissing it as "mild" [^115c98w9] [^115JfLWG].

> Let me reconsider limitations and pitfalls. Assay variability and lack of standardization across platforms complicate cross-site comparisons, and biological variability necessitates attention to delta criteria; additionally, hs-cTn increases detection of chronic or non-ACS injury, which can reduce specificity if clinicians rely on a single value without integrating symptoms, ECG, and imaging [^111mpjL8] [^112ZyEw4] [^114grbem].

> In summary, troponin levels reflect cardiomyocyte injury detected by increasingly sensitive assays; interpretation hinges on assay-specific 99th percentile URLs (often sex-specific), serial dynamics, and the clinical context, with hs-cTn enabling rapid, accurate rule-out and risk stratification while reminding us that any elevation — ACS or not — signals higher risk and deserves a structured evaluation of the cause [^116Eoxpd] [^1114sRZk] [^115JfLWG].

Troponin levels are a measure of **cardiac troponin I or T** in the blood, proteins released when heart muscle is injured [^113DQUf3]. High-sensitivity assays detect even small elevations, so **any rise above the 99th percentile upper reference limit** indicates myocardial injury [^116Eoxpd], not just myocardial infarction [^1156S99x]. Levels are interpreted using **serial measurements** to assess rise or fall, with sex-specific cutoffs improving diagnostic accuracy [^113KZZr3]. Troponin is the gold standard for diagnosing acute MI [^1156S99x] and provides strong prognostic information across many conditions, but elevations can occur in non-ACS settings, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^11219eGm].

---

## Biochemistry and physiology of troponin

- **Structure and function**: Troponin is a protein complex (troponin C, I, and T) that regulates muscle contraction; cardiac troponin I and T are specific to the heart [^113DQUf3].

- **Release into circulation**: When cardiomyocytes are injured, troponin I and T leak into the bloodstream, where they can be detected by immunoassays [^113DQUf3].

- **Kinetics**: Troponin rises within 3–6 hours of injury, peaks at 24–48 hours, and can remain elevated for 7–14 days, enabling both early and late detection of myocardial injury [^117W1jjM].

---

## Clinical significance of troponin levels

Troponin is the **preferred biomarker** for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (MI) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) because of its high sensitivity and specificity [^1156S99x]. Elevated troponin indicates myocardial injury but **does not specify the cause**; clinicians must correlate with symptoms, ECG, and imaging to distinguish type 1 MI (plaque rupture) from type 2 MI (supply-demand mismatch) or non-ischemic injury [^116Eoxpd] [^112brj5w].

---

## High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays

High-sensitivity assays detect **very low troponin concentrations** and are defined by:

- **Analytical sensitivity**: Detectable in ≥ 50% of healthy individuals [^113DQUf3].

- **Precision**: Coefficient of variation ≤ 10% at the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) [^113DQUf3].

- **Clinical utility**: Enable earlier detection of MI, improve risk stratification, and support rapid rule-out strategies [^114jMR9w] [^111RzF4V].

---

## Interpretation of troponin levels

Interpretation relies on **serial measurements** and clinical context:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Interpretation** | **Action** |
|-|-|-|
| Rise/fall pattern with ischemia | Acute MI (type 1 or 2) | - ACS management <br/> - Consider revascularization [^115zAaqw] |
| Rise/fall without ischemia | Acute myocardial injury (non-ACS) | Identify and treat underlying cause [^115GygnK] |
| Stable elevation | Chronic myocardial injury | Evaluate for structural heart disease, CKD, or chronic ischemia [^113DQUf3] |

---

Sex-specific 99th percentile URLs improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in women who have lower baseline troponin levels [^113KZZr3].

---

## Factors influencing troponin levels

Several factors can elevate troponin **outside ACS**:

- **Non-ischemic cardiac conditions**: Myocarditis, pericarditis, tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, cardiomyopathies [^11219eGm].

- **Systemic conditions**: Sepsis, renal dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, stroke, extreme exertion [^11219eGm] [^117Fb3SZ].

- **Assay-related factors**: False positives from heterophilic antibodies or analytical interference [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **high-sensitivity troponin** as the preferred biomarker for MI diagnosis, with serial testing at 0 and 1–3 hours to detect dynamic changes [^1114sRZk] [^111xC3aF]. Clinicians should integrate troponin with clinical assessment, ECG, and imaging to guide management [^112brj5w].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Specificity**: Elevations can occur in non-ACS conditions, reducing specificity and risking overdiagnosis [^114grbem].

- **Standardization**: Variability between assays and lack of harmonized reference populations complicate interpretation [^111mpjL8].

- **Clinical context**: Requires careful integration to avoid misclassification and inappropriate treatment [^113MGDSh].

---

Troponin levels quantify cardiac troponin in blood and are the **cornerstone for detecting myocardial injury** [^1156S99x]. High-sensitivity assays enable early, precise detection, but results must be interpreted in clinical context to distinguish MI from other causes of injury and guide appropriate management [^111oAaRe].

Conclusions

Troponin presently has several important diagnostic and prognostic roles in clinical medicine. While high‐sensitivity troponin assays are not yet available in the US, it is imperative that clinicians, researchers, and laboratorians begin to understand and consider the strengths, limitations, and unique characteristics of these assays to develop the evidence that will both enable informed implementation into clinical practice and guide future research aimed at harnessing their potential. With the advent of high‐sensitivity troponin assays, the roles for troponin testing may expand, potentially allowing for detection of very low levels of troponin in healthy individuals that are meaningful in a variety of clinical scenarios. However, with greater sensitivity comes the responsibility to integrate laboratory biomarker data with clinical data. While troponin is highly specific for myocardial necrosis, it provides no information on the etiology of myocyte death. Thus, more research and cross‐disciplinary collaboration are necessary to determine new thresholds and to establish parameters for high‐sensitivity troponin testing in practice. This will allow for clinicians to appropriately use these new and more powerful troponin assays.

### New features of troponin testing in different clinical settings [^114RtLDP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponin measurements also provide information concerning prognosis and the effect of early intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The recent development of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays permits detection of very low circulating levels. Use of sensitive troponin assays improves overall diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and these assays provide strong prognostic information in stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. However, increased sensitivity comes with a cost of decreased specificity, and serial testing, as well as clinical context and judgment, is likely to become increasingly important in the interpretation of troponin assay results.

### Use and misuse of cardiac troponins in clinical practice [^111oq5Sx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins are very sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. Elevated troponin levels in the setting of acute coronary syndrome are diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction and provide guidance to clinicians with regard to appropriate use of intensive medical and revascularization therapies. However, elevated troponin levels are commonly seen in several noncoronary ischemia presentations and create considerable confusion among clinicians in these settings. In this review article, we discuss the utility of troponins in various clinical settings and present a "common sense" approach to interpreting troponin elevation outside the setting of acute coronary syndrome.

### Cardiac troponin as a novel tool for cardiovascular risk prediction in ambulatory populations [^115DsWzs]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Assays for cardiac troponin have become increasingly sensitive, and are now able to detect very low concentrations of circulating cardiac troponin in a substantial proportion of stable patients who are not suspected of having an acute myocardial infarction. These low concentrations of cardiac troponin are frequently well within the range of what is considered normal but are nonetheless associated with a significant increase in the risk of major cardiovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease. The strength and consistency of these associations, and the fact that adding cardiac troponin to traditional risk factors improves the accuracy of existing cardiovascular risk prediction algorithms, raises the possibility of using cardiac troponin for therapeutic decision-making in ambulatory populations. Cardiac troponin is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular risk on the population level, but a specific intervention that can mitigate cardiac troponin-associated risk has not been identified. Thus, the therapeutic implications of cardiac troponin elevations for individual patients remain unclear. Ongoing research seeks to better understand the underlying cause of cardiac troponin release and to identify therapeutic interventions that can effectively mitigate cardiac troponin-associated cardiovascular risk. The development of high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin offers the opportunity to gain tremendous insight into the causes and consequences of chronic myocardial injury, and may, in the future, help guide therapy directed at improving the outcomes of ambulatory patients at high risk for cardiovascular events.

### Sensitive troponin assays [^111S2W3b]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Sensitive troponin assays have been developed to meet the diagnostic goals set by the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI). The analytical advantages of sensitive troponin assays include improved analytical imprecision at concentrations below the 99th percentile and the ability to define a reference distribution fully. Clinically, the improved sensitivity translates into the ability to diagnosis MI earlier, possibly within 3 h from admission and the ability to use the rate of change of troponin (Δ troponin) for diagnosis. Very sensitive assays may, in appropriately selected populations (perhaps with the addition of Δ troponin), allow diagnosis on hospital admission or within 1–2 h of admission. An elevated troponin level occurring in patients without suspected acute coronary syndromes has, in all studies to date in which outcome has been examined, been shown to indicate an adverse prognosis whatever the underlying clinical diagnosis. Failure of elevation means a good prognosis allowing early, safe hospital discharge, whereas a raised value requires investigation and should help prevent clinically significant pathology being overlooked. Sensitive troponins do present a challenge to the laboratory and the clinician. For the laboratory, the diagnosis of MI requires a change in troponin value. For the clinician, the challenge is to shift from a simplistic yes/no diagnosis of MI based on a single troponin value to a diagnosis that utilises early troponin changes as part of the clinical picture, and to relate the new class of detectable troponin elevation in patients with ischaemic myocardial disease to existing clinical guidelines and trial evidence.

### Increasingly sensitive assays for cardiac troponins: a review [^114grbem]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac troponins are the preferred biomarkers for diagnosis of myocardial infarction because of their high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury. However, acute and chronic conditions distinct from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) commonly lead to small elevations in troponin levels, with few data available regarding management of care for patients with such conditions. Recently developed highly sensitive troponin assays will likely lead to a substantial increase in the proportion of detectable troponin levels attributable to non-ACS conditions. Novel algorithms with highly sensitive assays, incorporating baseline troponin values and changes in values over 1 to 2 hours, may allow rapid exclusion of myocardial infarction and help to address specificity concerns but must be validated in appropriate target populations. Enhanced detection of very low troponin levels with highly sensitive assays has made feasible several potential new indications for troponin testing, including in the ambulatory setting, where assessment for low-level chronic myocardial injury may enhance risk stratification for heart failure and cardiac death.

### A test in context: interpretation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays in different clinical settings [^111oAaRe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have the ability to detect minute troponin concentrations and resolve minor changes in biomarker concentrations. Clinically, this allows for the ability to rapidly identify or exclude acute myocardial injury in the setting of acute chest discomfort-thus providing more rapid evaluation for acute myocardial infarction-but the improvements in troponin assays also create avenues for other applications where troponin release from the cardiomyocyte might confer prognostic information. These situations include cardiovascular risk assessment across a wide range of clinical circumstances, including apparently-well individuals, those at risk for heart disease, and those with prevalent cardiovascular disorders. The optimal hs-cTn threshold for each circumstance varies by the assay used and by the population assessed. This review will provide context for how hs-cTn assays might be interpreted depending on the application sought, reviewing results from studies leveraging hs-cTn for applications beyond "acute myocardial infarction diagnostic evaluation".

### Fundamental concepts of effective troponin use: important principles for internists [^114diFCC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Troponin testing is an essential component of our diagnostic approach to patients in acute medical care settings. With the advent of high-sensitivity troponin assays, its importance will extend to patients in chronic disease settings. Although elevated troponin levels provide diagnostic information, inform treatment decisions, and influence patient prognosis, proper interpretation of the values is essential. This requires an understanding of the operating characteristics of troponin testing; the likelihood ratios associated with a positive/negative test result and the pre- and post-test probabilities related to individual clinical settings. These principles will become more important as high-sensitivity assays become introduced over the coming years in the United States. This article reviews the important principles of troponin testing focusing in particular on acute settings and is aimed at internal medicine and hospital specialists.

### Troponins: redefining their limits [^116MPZ2D]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) depends on a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins in the appropriate clinical context. Conventional troponin assays lack sensitivity and precision at the low serum concentrations observed in the early hours after the onset of chest pain. New, highly sensitive troponin assays may offer improved certainty in these early hours. Many of these assays can detect troponins reliably at serum concentrations that occur in patients with chronic stable heart disease and even in asymptomatic healthy individuals. Indiscriminate use of these previously undetectable concentrations for the early diagnosis of acute MI will be accompanied by reduced specificity. However, they are likely to improve risk stratification of patients with chronic heart disease. This review focuses on the available highly sensitive troponin assays and their likely use in the diagnosis of acute MI and risk stratification of patients with heart disease.

### High-sensitivity assays for troponin in patients with cardiac disease [^1154vzR1]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Troponin is a widely used biomarker in patients with cardiac disease. The use of troponin is well established in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but troponin measurement is also used in other acute and nonacute settings. In patients with suspected AMI, early decision-making is crucial to allow rapid treatment and further diagnostic evaluation. Current guidelines recommend serial measurements of troponin with a cut-off concentration at the 99th percentile to triage patients in the emergency department. Newer, high-sensitivity assays for troponin enable the detection of distinctly lower concentrations. Using these assays and very low cut-off concentrations, several rapid diagnostic strategies have been reported to improve diagnosis in acute cardiac care. Furthermore, noncoronary and nonacute applications of troponin assays - for example as a biomarker in patients with heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or stable coronary artery disease - are on the horizon and might improve individual risk stratification. In this Review, we provide an overview on the development of high-sensitivity assays for troponin, and their application in patients with cardiac disease.

### Increasingly sensitive troponin assays: is perfect the enemy of good? [^113fC7Zb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

For over 20 years, cardiac troponin has been the gold standard biomarker for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with acute chest pain. 1 Refinement in assay technology led to the development of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) assays able to measure troponin concentrations in a least 50% of healthy individuals with high precision (coefficient of variation of ≤ 10%) at the 99th percentile. 2 When compared with conventional troponin assays, hs‐cTn assays improve the speed and accuracy of myocardial infarction (MI) diagnosis, 3 rule out MI more efficiently, reduce costs, 3, 4 and identify a greater number of patients at high risk for future cardiovascular events. 5 hs‐cTn assays are now used globally, frequently embedded within several validated algorithms for ruling in or out non–ST‐segment–elevation MI (NSTEMI). 6 These algorithms have attempted to find the perfect balance of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing NSTEMI while maintaining efficiency.

Notably, there are important distinctions among hs‐cTn assays. Although all hs‐cTn assays are expected to measure troponin in at least 50% of healthy adults, substantial differences in sensitivity and precision may exist between assays at low troponin concentrations. With this in mind, several preclinical assays have been developed that have remarkable low‐end sensitivity able to measure troponin concentrations in > 99% of healthy individuals with 10% analytical variation at concentrations < 1 ng/L. 7 Whether hs‐cTn assays with this degree of sensitivity and precision could improve clinical outcomes when compared with other less sensitive hs‐cTn assays has been relatively unexplored; in theory, greater sensitivity might improve negative predictive value, but at the expense of specificity. Thus, clinical data evaluating hs‐cTn assays with such sensitivity are crucial.

### High-sensitive troponin T measurements: what do we gain and what are the challenges? [^117Ap8qe]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) I and T are structural proteins unique to the heart. Detection of cTn in peripheral blood indicates cardiomyocyte damage. As acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most important cause of cardiomyocyte damage, cTns have become an integral part in the diagnosis of AMI. For this indication, cTns are superior to all other biomarkers and therefore are the preferred marker for the diagnosis of AMI. However, cTn indicates and provides an estimate of cardiomyocyte damage irrespective of its cause. The major limitation of contemporary cTn assays is that they are often not elevated during the initial hours of AMI. Recent advances in assay technology have led to more sensitive and precise cTn assays that will have a profound impact on clinical practice. High-sensitive cTn (hs-cTn) assays have two differentiating features from contemporary cTn assays: (i) detection of cTn in a majority of healthy persons and (ii) precise definition of what is 'normal' (= the 99th percentile). Recent multicentre studies have shown that hs-cTn assays improve the early diagnosis of patients with suspected AMI, particularly the early rule-out. To achieve best clinical use, cTn has to be interpreted as a quantitative variable. Rising and/or falling levels differentiate acute from chronic cardiomyocyte damage. The terms 'troponin-positive' and 'troponin negative' should therefore be avoided. 'Detectable' levels will become the norm and will have to be differentiated from 'elevated' levels. The differential diagnosis of a small amount of cardiomyocyte damage and therefore minor elevations of cTn is broad and includes acute and chronic cardiac disorders. The differential diagnosis of larger amount of injury and therefore more substantial elevations of cTn is largely restricted to AMI, myocarditis, and a rare patient with tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1166z793]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

With advances in technology, a new era in troponin assays is approaching. Previous‐generation troponin assays have been used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndrome patients and for risk stratification to guide triage decisions and aid in treatment selection. – New, high‐sensitivity troponin assays represent an important advance with added sensitivity for cardiac myocyte necrosis, – but there remains a need for judicious interpretation with these tests. These new troponin assays could have several distinct roles in clinical practice: (1) facilitation of earlier diagnosis and rule out of myocardial infarction (MI); (2) risk stratification in acute cardiac conditions and prognostic information in stable disease states; and (3) therapeutic monitoring and drug toxicity evaluation. However, because they are not specific for the etiology of cardiac cell death, the clinician has an increasing responsibility to interpret each test in clinical context. When commercially available in the United States (US), these high‐sensitivity analyses are expected to offer both advantages and disadvantages to practicing clinicians and to enhance current roles of the troponin assay as well as to open doors to new uses for troponin testing. However, they will also create new challenges in clinical applications, epidemiology, and research. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential clinical and research roles of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and the challenges they may create.

### Prevalence, determinants, and clinical associations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients attending emergency departments [^112rExhA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Significance

- Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration is common in patients presenting to the emergency department without suspected acute coronary syndrome.
- The vast majority of these elevated cardiac troponin concentration reflects myocardial injury rather than myocardial infarction.
- Cardiac troponin concentration is strongly associated with age, comorbidity, adverse physiology at presentation, and worse outcomes.

### Identifying survivors of sepsis at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes [^115BP7zh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated troponin levels are found in approximately 50% of critically ill patients and have been associated with adverse outcomes. Hence, elevated troponin levels may be useful for future risk stratification in survivors of sepsis as suggested by this study. However, the appropriate troponin cutoff levels remain to be determined. There are legitimate concerns that indiscriminate troponin testing or use of highly sensitive assays will return many positive results of uncertain clinical significance that may result in subsequent procedures and treatments of questionable therapeutic value. Among the 39,590 eligible patients in this study, only a third had troponins drawn during hospitalization and were ultimately included in this study (see Figure 1 in the article by Garcia and colleagues). Speculating about the factors behind the clinical decision to obtain a troponin level versus not is intriguing, and one wonders how the 25,544 patients who did not have a troponin level measured differed from patients included in this study who did and had "normal" levels. Comparing cardiovascular outcomes in such groups will be necessary on the path forward to validating troponin and determining appropriate cutoff values for long-term cardiovascular risk prognostication in survivors of sepsis.

In conclusion, the association of increased troponin levels with adverse incident cardiovascular outcomes after sepsis is an intriguing finding that may signal a significant step toward identifying survivors of sepsis at high-risk for these outcomes. Future studies will show whether troponin levels alone or perhaps in combination with other biomarkers (e.g. markers of persistent inflammation or immunosuppression) will accurately identify patients that may benefit from targeted preventative interventions after hospital discharge.

### Myocardial injury in the era of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: a practical approach for clinicians [^115GygnK]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Traditionally, elevated troponin concentrations were synonymous with myocardial infarction. But with improvements in troponin assays, elevated concentrations without overt myocardial ischemia are now more common; this is referred to as myocardial injury. Physicians may be falsely reassured by the absence of myocardial ischemia; however, recent evidence suggests that myocardial injury is associated with even more detrimental outcomes. Accordingly, this article reviews the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and management of myocardial injury.

Observations

Current epidemiological evidence suggests that myocardial injury without overt ischemia represents about 60% of cases of abnormal troponin concentrations when obtained for clinical indications, and 1 in 8 patients presenting to the hospital will have evidence of myocardial injury. Myocardial injury is a concerning prognosis; the 5-year mortality rate is approximately 70%, with a major adverse cardiovascular event rate of 30% in the same period. The differential diagnosis is broad and can be divided into acute and chronic precipitants. The initial workup involves an assessment for myocardial ischemia. If infarction is ruled out, further evaluation includes a detailed history, physical examination, laboratory testing, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and (if there is no known history of structural or valvular heart disease) an echocardiogram. Unfortunately, no consensus exists on routine management of patients with myocardial injury. Identifying and treating the underlying precipitant is the most practical approach.

Conclusion and Relevance

Myocardial injury is the most common cause of abnormal troponin results, and its incidence will likely increase with an aging population, increasing prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, and greater sensitivity of troponin assays. Myocardial injury represents a challenge to clinicians; however, given its serious prognosis, it warrants a thorough evaluation of its underlying precipitant. Future strategies to prevent and/or manage myocardial injury are needed.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration and risk of first-ever Cardiovascular outcomes in 154, 052 participants [^111Y44hC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Elevated cardiac troponin concentration, well within the normal range, was associated with an increased risk of incident CVD outcomes in the general population. This association was strongest for fatal CVD and persisted after adjustment for conventional CVD risk factors. Further research on cardiac troponin as a useful marker of risk prediction seems warranted.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Meta-analysis of published studies suggests that people with elevated circulating troponin concentrations in absence of clinically manifest myocardial injury are at a relatively high risk of developing cardiovascular events.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future research is needed to clarify the predictive value of cardiac troponin measurements in relation to conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to troponin levels, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to ensure that clinicians are familiar with the analytical performance and the 99th percentile upper reference limit defining myocardial injury for the cardiac troponin assay used at their institution.

### Cardiac troponin level elevations not related to acute coronary syndromes [^11219eGm]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, cardiac troponins (cTn) have emerged as the preferred biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of myocardial injury. In conjunction with typical clinical findings of ischaemia, elevated cTn levels in blood confirm a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, neither cTnT or cTnI are exclusively released as a result of ischaemic myocardial cell necrosis, but also with numerous nonischaemic acute and chronic cardiac conditions, such as myopericarditis, toxic injury, or severe cardiac overload. With the advent of high-sensitivity assays, causes of cTn elevation not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have become common findings in patients with chest pain and in those with acute or chronic systemic disorders. Elevated cTn levels in blood are associated with increased rates of cardiac events and mortality, independently of the underlying disease. However, the clinical conditions leading to cTn release in patients who do not have ACS, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these individuals, are largely unknown. Here, we provide an overview of the many causes and the prognostic importance of the release of cTn not related to ACS. We also recommend strategies to discriminate between ischaemic and nonischaemic cTn elevation, and describe the clinical evaluation of these patients.

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^11647yxB]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

An association between an increase in troponin level and plaque rupture, acute coronary obstruction, and reduced myocardial perfusion is well established. The troponin assay is recognised by American and European guidelines as the preferred biomarker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

Over the past two decades, assays for troponin have undergone vast improvements, allowing fast detection of troponin at low levels with increased precision. These improved assays have led to a substantial increase in the number of patients with a positive troponin result of uncertain significance.

The troponin test has been used as a prognostic marker for all cause mortality in people suspected of having had a coronary event. Some evidence suggests a direct relation between the magnitude of the increase in troponin and mortality over a limited range of troponin levels. Clinicians generally assume that higher troponin levels signify higher mortality. Additionally, it is often difficult to know how to manage elderly people when a high troponin level is detected. This dilemma is partly due to the uncertain prognostic implication of a positive troponin result in older people and partly to a disinclination to investigate those in this group aggressively.

Decisions about the management of people with small increases in troponin levels, particularly if they have a non-cardiac presentation, can be difficult. It would be helpful to understand the prognostic implications of these small increases compared with larger increases when choosing treatment.

We describe how the prognostic impact of an increased troponin level varies with age, particularly in very elderly people, and investigate the prognostic importance of very small troponin levels compared with larger levels.

### Troponins in acute coronary syndromes [^115zAaqw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins have replaced creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Expert recommendations set the diagnostic decision-limit for each assay at the 99th percentile of troponin levels in an apparently healthy reference population, which due to a lack of standardization, will vary depending upon the manufacturer. Among patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), even low-level elevations of cardiac troponin T or I correlate with higher risk of death and recurrent ischemic events compared to patients with levels of troponin below the decision limit. Renal failure does not appear to diminish the prognostic value of troponins among patients with a high clinical probability of ACS. Moreover, patients with elevated levels of troponin derive the most benefit from more intense medical therapy with antithrombin and antiplatelet medications, as well as an early invasive management strategy. Whereas cardiac troponins are extremely specific for myocardial necrosis, they do not discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies of myocardial injury. Clinicians must, therefore, determine whether a patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with ACS. Combining troponin with other cardiac biomarkers may offer complimentary information on the underlying pathobiology and prognosis in an individual patient. Future generations of troponin assays may detect specific posttranslational modifications of troponins that may increase the analytic sensitivity for myocardial damage and offer insight into the timing and mechanism of myocardial injury.

### Cardiac troponins [^115NvB8M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins I and T are proteins integral to the function of cardiac muscle. They are very sensitive markers for the detection of myocardial damage, and the ability to assay their serum levels accurately and quickly have revolutionized the concepts of minor myocardial injury and infarction. They are also powerful prognostic indicators of future adverse cardiac events. Limitations, more of troponin T than I, include decreased specificity in renal failure and skeletal muscle disease. Rapid, whole blood assays are now available that can be done at the patient's bedside. This review discusses the cardiac troponins, their biochemistry, the assays for them currently available, and their roles in the evaluation of cardiac disease in the Emergency Department (ED).

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for cardiovascular risk stratification in the general population [^1131EceE]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponins (cTns) I and T have long been the most successful cardiac-specific circulating biomarkers in cardiovascular (CV) medicine, having changed dramatically the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, while being independent predictors of outcome in several cardiac conditions and non-cardiac conditions. The latest-generation high-sensitivity (hs) cTn assays demonstrate both enhanced diagnostic performance and improved analytical performance, with the ability to measure detectable concentrations in a substantial proportion of the asymptomatic and presumably healthy populations. Given this unique analytical feature, recent evidence suggests that hs-cTn can be used for the stratification of CV risk in the general population. High-sensitivity cTn predicts future CV events, are responsive to preventive pharmacological or lifestyle interventions, change in parallel to risk modifications, and offer incremental risk prediction when added to well-established prognosticators. The implementation of CV risk stratification and prevention strategies incorporating hs-cTn requires further investigation to define the optimal target populations, timing of measurement, and preventive interventions.

### Cardiac troponin: fragments of the future? [^114yzqgB]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponin is the gold standard biomarker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Development of high-sensitivity troponin platforms has revolutionized triage of chest pain patients, but specificity for type 1 AMI remains a clinical limitation. Consequently, differentiating type 1 AMI from other forms of myocardial injury is a common conundrum, heightened by the risks associated invasive coronary angiography. The troponin complex is a dynamic structure comprising of 3 subunits which variably fragment prior to measurement in the blood. Documenting the fragmentation patterns of cardiac troponin may help identify the cause of myocardial injury. This review explores the biology underlying troponin fragmentation and summarizes multiple lines of evidence that it can improve the specificity for diagnosis of type 1 AMI.

Assay Development

High‐sensitivity troponin assays detect concentrations of the same proteins that conventional sensitivity assays are aimed at detecting, just in much lower concentrations. Before 2009, there was no agreed‐on definition of what constituted a high‐sensitivity assay or a consensus on nomenclature for these much more sensitive tests, but that seems to have been resolved in 2012. High‐sensitivity assays, by expert consensus, should have a coefficient of variance (CV) of < 10% at the 99th percentile value in the population of interest. To be classified as high‐sensitivity assays, concentrations below the 99th percentile should be detectable above the assay's limit of detection for > 50% of healthy individuals in the population of interest. Using these criteria, there are several contemporary assays that are available on an experimental basis in the US but presumably would soon be available clinically as well. The assays and their characteristics are shown in Table 1. Just as with the conventional‐sensitivity assays, there are a growing number of companies that are producing high‐sensitivity assays (most are producing troponin I assays; however, there is a single troponin T assay, both conventional and high sensitivity, allowing for standardization across centers). As shown in Table 1 there is wide variability in assay characteristics between manufacturers. This prevents comparison between assays and often between clinical centers and hospital systems for conventional troponin assaysand will be no less a challenge with the advent of high‐sensitivity troponin testing. This problem is just one of several that face the high‐sensitivity assays.

Table 1.
Analytic Comparisons of Contemporary High‐Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin Assays *

Importantly, just as with the earlier troponin assays, interpretation of high‐sensitivity troponin values needs to have basis in the 99th percentile value in the general population. Using this value in clinical practice, for each assay, has previously been shown to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of troponin and serves to minimize false‐positive testing. However, determination of this value and, more specifically, the population in which to derive this value consistently, is not universally agreed on. Previous research to determine the 99th percentile for high‐sensitivity troponin assays has yielded different values for the same assay based on different sample populations. Nonetheless, there should be collaboration at clinical centers among physicians and laboratory managers to identify the 99th percentile value for the preferred assay, from either the assay manufacturer's guidelines or laboratory reference literature. This will aid in consistent interpretation of the test.

Screening

While elevated troponin might signal worse prognosis among patients with known CAD or CHF or who are otherwise at significant risk, high‐sensitivity assays may provide a means of screening a general population of patients for cardiac dysfunction. In a prospective observational cohort of general patients randomly enrolled from a large metropolitan area (Dallas Heart Study), elevated levels of high‐sensitivity troponin were associated with greater rates of structural heart disease, including left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, as well as all‐cause mortality within a median follow‐up of 6.4 years. In a nationwide prospective cohort study of ambulatory older adults (≥ 65 years) without heart failure, high‐sensitivity troponin values (both baseline and absolute change over 2 years) were associated with incident heart failure and cardiovascular death over a median follow‐up of 11.8 years(Table 4). Thus, in a general population, high‐sensitivity troponin might play a role in screening for structural and coronary heart disease, potentially prompting further evaluation and more aggressive primary prevention measures. However, there are several obstacles to overcome before such a clinical strategy could be used. Biological variability will have to be further explored and quantified to establish reasonable threshold change values. Standardization of high‐sensitivity troponin assays would be extremely important to allow for appropriate interpretation of troponin values with time and across different medical systems.

### Physical activity, exercise and cardiac troponins: clinical implications [^117Fb3SZ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponins constitute essential components of the cardiac contractile apparatus and are released into the bloodstream following cardiomyocyte injury. Because of their cardiac specificity, cardiac troponin I or T are the recommended biomarkers for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. However, cardiac troponin concentrations also frequently increase acutely after strenuous prolonged exercise, making the interpretation of cardiac troponin test results in patients presenting with acute chest pain challenging. This acute troponin response following exercise is commonly considered to be physiological and without adverse long-term consequences, but the possibility of exercise-induced, minor myocardial injury that may become clinically relevant if repeated over decades, has not been ruled out. Attempts to biochemically differentiate between physiological cardiac troponin release versus release after acute ischemic myocardial injury has so far proved largely unsuccessful, but future measurement of specific troponin fragments could be promising. Cardiac troponins also provide strong prognostic information across the spectrum of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD). In the chronic setting, low-level elevation of cardiac troponins has been associated with adverse outcome, and concentrations even within the normal range provide independent information concerning risk of developing heart failure (HF) and CVD death. Exercise exerts many beneficial effects on the CV system, and longitudinal observational data from epidemiological studies suggest that higher physical activity (PA) is associated with lower concentrations of cardiac troponins. Conversely, a sedentary life-style has been associated with higher cardiac troponin concentrations and a parallel increase in the risk of HF. Serial measurement of cardiac troponins using high sensitivity assays for monitoring the effect of life-style intervention, including PA appears promising.

### Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^112W1ABT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^116PpnmW]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated whether troponin concentrations at presentation or their kinetics differed sufficiently to discriminate between myocardial injury and infarction. We report a number of observations that are relevant to practice. First, troponin concentrations at presentation are similar in patients with myocardial injury and those with infarction regardless of the diagnostic classification. Second, the use of recommended rule-in thresholds above the 99th percentile provides only marginal improvements in the PPV and specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Troponin thresholds > 1000 ng/L would be required to achieve a PPV of ≥ 75%. Third, the magnitude and rate of change of troponin can help differentiate type 1 from type 2 myocardial infarction and acute or chronic myocardial injury. Although we observed important differences in troponin kinetics, the troponin concentration at presentation provides only limited discrimination between type 1 myocardial infarction and other causes of myocardial injury or infarction. Clinical context may be more helpful than any given rule-in threshold to guide the triage and initial management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in practice.

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^116ebNz4]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study examines the implications of a raised troponin level in a large sample of patients undergoing troponin testing for any clinical reason across a wide range of ages. A raised troponin level is highly clinically meaningful, regardless of age, even if only slightly above normal. The inclusion of more than 250 000 patients in this study allowed assessment of the prognostic power of troponin across a wide range of levels, and across the whole spectrum of ages. We found that even minor increases in troponin had major prognostic implications in patients both with and without acute coronary syndromes (ACS). An unexpected inverted U shaped relation was found between troponin level and mortality in those patients admitted to hospital. For patients without ACS, multivariable adjustment led to reversion to the expected direct positive relation between troponin level and mortality. In the group with ACS, the inverted U shaped relation was present after multivariable adjustment in patients who were managed invasively, but reverted to a direct positive relation between troponin level and mortality in patients managed non-invasively.

Interpretation of troponin results in real life clinical practice, outside the confines of clinical trials, is often challenging. Troponin levels are measured in patients presenting to the emergency department, not only for chest pain but often for a wide variety of presentations. Consequently, sometimes the troponin test is positive in isolation, with no other indication to suggest myocardial ischaemia but with clear evidence of another diagnosis, such as pneumonia. In such situations, clinicians may decide to focus on treating the primary diagnosis and not pursue the possibility of incidental or secondary coronary artery disease. Evidence suggests considerable under-recognition in hospital patients of cardiovascular disease and other conditions leading to fatal myocardial infarction.

Additionally, relatively few finely stratified prognostic data are available in elderly patients. For such patients invasive treatment has not been clearly shown to lead to improved mortality compared with medical management. Because complication rates from procedures are higher in elderly patients, these patients are often managed conservatively.

### Diagnosing acute myocardial infarction with troponins: how low can you go? [^112uMDZL]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent consensus guidelines state that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be diagnosed in the context of a troponin rise above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) with the optimal imprecision of the assay (coefficient of variation, CV) being ≤ 10%. However, at the 99th percentile, modern assays do not have a CV ≤ 10%. Objective The authors compared the prognostic implications of placing the diagnostic troponin cut-off at the 99th percentile and at the lowest concentration with a CV ≤ 10% (functional sensitivity).

Methods

The authors prospectively recruited 804 patients presenting to the Emergency Department of a university-affiliated teaching hospital with suspected ACS. All patients underwent 12 h troponin T testing and were followed up by telephone and chart review. Outcomes Death or AMI (excluding the index event) and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) within 6 months.

Results

Troponin T elevation below the functional sensitivity predicted the risk of death and AMI (adjusted OR 4.6, p = 0.039) and MACE (adjusted OR 11.10, p < 0.0001) independently of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score and creatinine levels. Utilising the 99th percentile cut-off, an extra 17 MACEs could be predicted per 1000 patients treated at a cost of identifying 11 patients who would not have developed an event.

Conclusions

The results suggest that adopting the lower troponin cut-off would reduce the proportion of 'false negatives' (patients with negative troponin who develop MACE) from 9.6% to 8.9%. Whether this reduction in 'false negatives' justifies the increase in 'false positives' warrants further investigation and discussion.

Key Points for Practice
- The term myocardial injury should be used to describe at least one increased cardiac troponin level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
- The term acute MI should be used to describe an acute myocardial injury in the presence of suspected acute myocardial ischemia. Recommendations The term myocardial injury should be used to describe at least one increased cardiac troponin level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit, which can be further defined as acute if the values continue to fluctuate. Temporary myocardial injury that occurs as a result of revascularization procedures is called procedural myocardial injury.

In patients with a healthy baseline cardiac troponin level, procedural myocardial injury can be diagnosed when there is an increased cardiac troponin level. In patients with a baseline troponin level greater than the 99th percentile, procedural myocardial injury can be diagnosed when there is an increase in cardiac troponin levels of more than 20% of the patient's baseline, but levels subsequently remain stable or decrease. MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention is defined as a cardiac troponin level more than five times the 99th percentile in patients with a healthy baseline. MI related to coronary artery bypass grafting is defined as a cardiac troponin level more than 10 times the 99th percentile in patients with a healthy baseline. Isolated Q waves can meet the criteria if the troponin level is less than 10 times the 99th percentile, as long as the levels are elevated and rising.

The term MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries should be used to describe patients with MI but no angiographic findings of obstructive coronary artery disease. Similar to MI, diagnosis of this condition, which has a prevalence of up to 8%, suggests an ischemic cause of the injury. Increased cardiac troponin levels are a common occurrence in patients in the intensive care unit. Increased cardiac troponin levels in the presence of decreased ejection fraction can occur because of sepsis caused by endotoxin; once appropriately treated, myocardial function will return to normal. After recovery, physicians should use their best judgment regarding further assessment for coronary artery disease or structural heart disease.

### Present and future of cardiac troponin in clinical practice: a paradigm shift to high-sensitivity assays [^116UaJ9t]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite its wide utilization and central role in the evaluation of patients with potential ischemic symptoms, misconceptions and confusion about cardiac troponin (cTn) prevail. The implementation of high-sensitivity (hs) cTn assays in clinical practice has multiple potential advantages provided there is an education process tied to the introduction of these assays that emphasizes the appropriate utilization of the test. Several diagnostic strategies have been explored with hs-cTn assays, including the use of undetectable values, accelerated serial hs-cTn sampling, hs-cTn measurements in combination with a clinical-risk score, and the use of a single hs-cTn measurement with a concentration threshold tailored to meet a clinical need. In this document we discuss basic concepts that should facilitate the integration of hs-cTn assays into clinical care in years to come.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^114VNnTp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Despite increases in accuracy and earlier detection with new troponin assays, there are new problems for the diagnosis of MI with these assays. Previously, the use of troponin for the diagnosis of AMI was more straightforward in that an elevated value was deemed an AMI, whereas a value below a set threshold was not. Research with high‐sensitivity assays shows both a nominal level of high‐sensitivity troponin at baseline in apparently healthy individuals and the presence of biological variability over time. These features affect how clinicians use the high‐sensitivity assays (currently commercially available in Europe but not yet in the US). Some have proposed that an absolute change value over time should be used to diagnose AMI. The threshold is based on testing of reference populations, which vary widely among industry producers. There is also variation in how reference populations are defined, thus adding more questions to what threshold values might be for these new assays. Others have suggested using a percent change in troponin, a delta troponin. Keller and colleaguescompared the use of a relative change in troponin within the first 3 hours of presentation for chest pain, with a baseline absolute value, and found that using the relative change in troponin at 3 hours significantly increased the positive and negative predictive values for these high‐sensitivity assays. Reichlin et al, in a prospective observational study, evaluated the utility of an absolute change versus a relative change in high‐sensitivity troponin from baseline to 2 hours after presentation. In their analysis, an absolute change of high‐sensitivity troponin was more accurate than relative change for diagnosis of MI. Mueller et alalso found that absolute change (within 3 to 6 hours) in high‐sensitivity troponin had superior diagnostic value (c‐statistic 0.898 versus 0.752, P < 0.0001) compared with relative changes in the same period. However, for either strategy, establishment of thresholds will be difficult, as will be standardization across assays.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113GPby9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While the new assays can provide more accurate, rapid detection of myocardial necrosis, they do not indicate the cause of cell death. Improved assay performance will have to be accompanied by improved clinical evaluation of patients to effectively interpret the results and apply them in clinical practice. The universal definition of MI(Table 3) was a broad consensus developed by representatives from the American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation that provided increased structure and clarity around the diagnosis of MI in the era of a troponin gold standard. Importantly, it firmly established the importance of clinical symptoms in conjunction with elevated troponin levels occurring with a characteristic rise and/or fall to establish type 1 MI. It also allowed for diagnosis in the setting of sudden cardiac death, as well as enhanced categorization for periprocedural MIs. As sensitivity and precision of troponin assays have improved, false‐positive results due to assay imprecision are becoming less of a problem. However, the pressure on clinical perspective in interpretation of positive troponin results has increased, given that there is a large differential diagnosis generated by a positive troponin assay (Figure).

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^115fg1rc]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

This study (TROP-RISK) used data from the contributing biomedical research centres in the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative and presents data from more than a quarter of a million patients in routine clinical practice who undergo troponin measurement for clinical reasons. In young patients, a positive troponin result is associated with a very high mortality risk. Elderly patients have a very high mortality when the troponin level is negative, and even higher when the level is positive. A positive troponin result is therefore highly clinically meaningful, regardless of age, with the excess mortality associated with a raised troponin level being heavily concentrated in the first few weeks.

The assembly of sufficiently large sets of real world clinical data can cast light on patterns of disease that are impossible to define adequately in a single centre study or multicentre trial. Our analysis uncovered an unexpected inverted U shaped relation between troponin level and mortality in patients with ACS. This relation may be driven in part by the changing case mix as the troponin level increases; a higher proportion of these patients undergo invasive management.

In a population of all patients in whom troponin is assessed for clinical reasons, this biomarker can risk stratify between high and low mortality risk for all age groups. Although even weakly raised troponin levels had marked prognostic significance, clinical decisions should depend on the underlying disease and not simply on the degree of increase in troponin.

### Elevated troponin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: possible mechanisms [^112FuShy]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected more than 1.8 million people worldwide, overwhelmed health care systems owing to the high proportion of critical presentations, and resulted in more than 100,000 deaths. Since the first data analyses in China, elevated cardiac troponin has been noted in a substantial proportion of patients, implicating myocardial injury as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to severe illness and mortality. Accordingly, high troponin levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. This brief review explores the available evidence regarding the association between COVID-19 and myocardial injury.

### Do serial troponins predict the need for cardiac evaluation in trauma patients after ground-level fall? [^114XF9up]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We found that the initial serum troponin does have clinical value in identifying and underlying cardiac issue in patients who present after ground-level fall; however, serial troponin testing is likely of little value. Further, we demonstrated that using a cut-off of > 50 ng/L as a marker of clinical concern would improve the utility of the test and likely reduce unnecessary delays in the care of otherwise healthy patients.

### Rising and falling high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in diagnostic algorithms for patients with suspected myocardial infarction [^113jXTDf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the trajectory of change is different for rising and falling patterns, considering that most individuals usually have low absolute troponin concentrations, which may still be quantified using hs‐cTn assays. Thus, the chance of larger absolute and relative changes in the situation of dynamic troponin is higher in those with rising troponin. On the contrary, in patients with a falling troponin pattern, the relative difference will be much smaller with prolonged time from the event as the slope flattens. Because the diagnosis of acute MI is based on a relevant troponin dynamic (the Universal Definition of MI defines stable troponin by a relative change of < 20%), the likelihood to diagnose MI in patients with falling troponin might similarly be reduced. In summary, this complicates the diagnosis and management of patients and underlines the importance of diagnostic management beyond the evaluation of troponin, including a carefully taken history of symptoms, an ECG, repeated sampling, and imaging modalities.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: cohort study [^11584PR5]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The consensus statement on the universal definition of myocardial infarction recommends that an increase in plasma troponin concentration above the 99th centile of a normal reference population is used to confirm the diagnosis. Despite this guidance, lowering the diagnostic threshold for troponin remains a highly contentious issue, with clinicians uncertain as to whether the benefits of improved sensitivity will outweigh problems that might arise from reduced specificity.

The Global Task Force for the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarctionand the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistryrecommend the 99th centile as the diagnostic threshold where assay precision can be shown with a coefficient of variation of ≤ 10% at this concentration. Currently few assays are able to meet these precision criteria at the diagnostic threshold and nearly all institutions therefore select a diagnostic threshold above the 99th centile where the coefficient of variation is ≤ 10% to minimise the risk of false positive results and an inappropriate diagnosis of myocardial infarction. We recently showed that the introduction of a sensitive troponin I assay halved the rate of recurrent myocardial infarction and death in patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome and a small increase in plasma troponin concentration. Despite improved sensitivity, this assay did not have the recommended level of precision at the 99th centile of 0.012 µg/L. We therefore reduced the threshold from 0.200 µg/L to 0.050 µg/L, the lowest concentration at which the coefficient of variation was ≤ 10%, for the clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

A recent statement from the Biochemistry Group of the Global Task Force for the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction represents a change in position, with the recommendation that the 99th centile be adopted as the diagnostic threshold for current sensitive troponin assays irrespective of whether the coefficient of variation is less than 10% at this concentration. This recommendation is based in part on modelling exercises that suggest assays with imprecision of up to 20% do not affect diagnostic accuracy. To determine the potential impact of this change in guidance on clinical practice, we evaluated the relation between plasma troponin concentration, assay precision, and clinical outcomes in our previous cohort of consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

3 HIGH‐SENSITIVITY CARDIAC TROPONIN AND POINT‐OF‐CARE ASSAYS

Cardiac troponins are key regulatory proteins found upon the thin filament of the myocardial sarcomere and are released into the circulation following myocardial injury or necrosis (Figure 1). Unlike biomarkers previously used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, cardiac troponins are highly specific for myocardial injury. Acute myocardial injury is defined as a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin with at least one value above the assay‐specific 99th percentile URL. As cardiac troponin concentrations differ in males and females, sex‐specific 99th percentile URLs are recommended for all assays. Cardiac troponin concentrations above the assay‐specific 99th percentile URL with a less than 20% change on serial measurements are used to define those with chronic myocardial injury. Chronic myocardial injury is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and arises as a consequence of coronary artery disease, structural heart disease or chronic kidney disease, amongst other conditions.

High‐sensitivity assays are now able to accurately and precisely quantify very low levels of cardiac troponin even in healthy persons, allowing earlier detection of changes in cardiac troponin concentrations. The analytical precision of an assay is determined by the assay coefficient of variation in replicate measurements as the standard deviation divided by the mean concentration expressed as a percentage. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) defines a high‐sensitivity assay as one that has a coefficient of variation ≤ 10% at the sex‐specific 99th centile URL, and can measure cardiac troponin above the assay limit of detection in more than half of healthy females and males within a reference population. Until recently, only central laboratories were able to achieve these requirements, and samples had to be processed by trained laboratory technicians, with recommended turnaround times of around 1 h from sampling to reporting. This is often not met as the time to transfer specimens to the laboratory is often longer, even in secondary or tertiary hospitals where the central laboratory is on site. Furthermore, there are often delays in actioning the results in the electronic patient record, even when they are reported efficiently.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1156S99x]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical approach for diagnosing myocardial injury and infarction — Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are the preferred biomarkers recommended to both rule-in and rule-out myocardial injury, and thus to define MI and each specific subtype of MI. Detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values is essential and a key early component along with other clinical elements to establish the diagnosis of acute MI. Criteria for determining a pathological rise between 2 serial cTn values are assay-dependent and continue to evolve.

### A review of causes and systemic approach to cardiac troponin elevation [^115BZZSC]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The first American College of Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology task force published recommendations for a universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) in 2000 based on the measurement of troponin (Tn). Although this rapid and highly sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of Tn elevation in absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. In 2007, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation task force proposed a new definition for acute MI based on detection of Tn and associated clinical evidence. The goal of this article is to review the universal definition of acute MI and to differentiate type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and non-acute coronary syndrome Tn elevations. The prognosis and a clinical approach to this differential diagnosis will be developed.

### Sex-specific thresholds of high-sensitivity troponin in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^113KZZr3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Should international guidelines recommend the use of sex-specific thresholds for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction? Although we did not directly compare a uniform 99th centile threshold against the sex-specific threshold in this trial, our study does provide some helpful insights into the use of sex-specific thresholds. First, use of sex-specific thresholds identifies similar proportions of women and men presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome with myocardial injury. Second, women and men reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay with sex-specific thresholds were at similar risk for subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. Therefore, use of a lower 99th centile in women appropriately identified a group of women who were at risk for cardiovascular events. Conversely, women and men with hs-cTnI concentrations below their respective sex-specific diagnostic thresholds had similar rates of cardiovascular events, suggesting that the use of a higher 99th centile for men did not inappropriately exclude myocardial injury in those who may have benefited from being identified and treated.

### Trajectories of cardiac troponin in the decades before cardiovascular death: a longitudinal cohort study [^115D5rYD]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rate of change and individual cardiac troponin trajectories in relation to cardiovascular death

We evaluated the absolute cardiac troponin level at baseline combined with the relative- and absolute change in cardiac troponin levels over a 10-year period in relation to the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular death. In 4,965 individuals, we had two troponin measurements available with a 10-year time frame between the first two measurements. We observed that those with lowest cardiac troponin level at baseline and with the lowest relative- or absolute cardiac troponin increase were at lowest risk, and those with highest cardiac troponin level at baseline and with highest relative- or absolute cardiac troponin increase were at highest risk (Fig. 2, P < 001 for both relative- and absolute rate of change groups). Cumulative incidence of cardiovascular death at 10 years between relative- and absolute rate of change groups was similar (Group 1 to 4 for baseline cardiac troponin level combined with relative change over time: 0.5%, 1.1%, 1.7%, 3.9% (Fig. 2 A); Group 1 to 4 for cardiac troponin level combined with absolute change over time: 0.5%, 1.4%, 1.5%, 3.6% (Fig. 2 B)).

### The clinical need for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for acute coronary syndromes and the role for serial testing [^114mAfpD]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponin is the biomarker of choice for the serologic diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. International cardiology and laboratory medicine guidelines have suggested that the cutoff concentration be set at the 99th percentile of a healthy population, with an assay imprecision of 10% or less. Unfortunately, most commercial troponin assays do not have the sensitivity and precision to reliably detect troponin in sera of healthy subjects. Therefore, there is a need to develop troponin assays with higher sensitivity, which cannot be achieved while also improving the assay's precision.

Methods and Results

Novel prototype analytical testing devices have been developed that are 5- to 10-fold more sensitive than existing commercial troponin assays. These tests should enable an earlier detection of myocardial infarction relative to the time of presentation and detect a higher percentage of emergency department chest pain patients who are at risk for short-term major adverse cardiac events. However, use of a high-sensitivity troponin assay will also result in detection of more patients who have cardiac necrosis due to a nonischemic etiology.

Conclusions

Serial troponin testing will be necessary to determine the clinical significance of low levels of troponin release with use of high-sensitivity assays. Guidelines will need to be established to determine a change in troponin results that is statistically and clinically significant, and new considerations for the time interval needed between blood collections. This will enable the use of future high-sensitivity troponin assays to be more valuable.

### Use of high-sensitivity troponin assays predicts mortality in patients with normal conventional troponin assays on admission-insights from a meta-analysis [^116wSPx3]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Use of high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) assays can detect small levels of myocardial damage previously undetectable with conventional troponin (c-Tn) assays. However, prognostic utility of these hs-Tn assays in prediction of mortality remains unclear in the presence of nonelevated c-Tn levels on admission. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess mortality risk of patients with hs-Tn elevations in the setting of normal c-Tn levels.

Hypothesis

Patients with hs-Tn elevations with normal c-Tn levels on admission blood samples, drawn to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), have a higher mortality risk than those without hs-Tn or c-Tn elevations.

Methods

A search was made of the PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases. Studies evaluating patients with suspected ACS that reported mortality rates for those with elevated hs-Tn levels but normal c-Tn levels on admission were included. A random-effects model was used to pool event rates, and data were reported in odds ratios (95% confidence interval).

Results

Four studies (N = 2033, mean age 64–75 years, 49%-70% male) revealed that nearly 32% of suspected ACS patients with normal c-Tn levels on admission had elevated hs-Tn levels. Elevated hs-Tn levels conferred a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality vs normal hs-Tn levels (odds ratio: 4.35, 95% confidence interval: 2.81–6.73, P < 0.01), with negligible heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%).

Conclusions

Elevation of hs-Tn levels predicted a higher risk of mortality in patients with suspected ACS and may aid in the early identification of higher-risk patients in this setting. Future studies are needed to investigate further optimal management strategies.

Table 2.
Potential Utility and Challenges of the High‐Sensitivity Troponin Assay

With the increased sensitivity of these new assays and the evaluation of their precision and sensitivity in healthy populations (although not completely agreed on), investigators have discovered biological variability in the low detectable levels of healthy individuals. Biological variability is a type of preanalytic variation due to changes over time in normal individuals. These changes may be secondary to circadian rhythm, monthly changes, or seasonal changes inherent to a species. In addition there is random biological fluctuation around an inherent set point that may be specific to an individual. This certainly affects the utility of these new assays and should inform the use of threshold values and change values that might be used for diagnostic and prognostic clinical evaluation. Wu et al demonstrated a mean biological variability in healthy individuals using the Singulex cTnI assay in the range of ≈10% over 4 hours and ≈15% over 8 weeks. With this level of variability, the authors calculated a reference change value of 81% for increasing serial assays and −45% for decreasing serial assays to define abnormality. Vasile et al, using the Roche hs‐Troponin T assay, showed that mean delta values within 24‐hour studies were ± 58%, while values over multiple days could vary by ± 90%. Given this biological variability, the authors determined that a short‐term (eg, 4 hours) change of 85% or long‐term (eg, 8 weeks) change of 315% would be necessary to be reasonably certain that abnormality was present. Sharnhorst et aland Frankenstein et alalso evaluated healthy individuals and found similar values for variability and reference change values.

This variation raises numerous questions about the clinical use of these tests. Biological variability would alter how high‐sensitivity troponin assays are interpreted in nearly all clinical applications in which > 1 value is measured. Due to variability with time in an individual and detectable levels at healthy state, further study and statistical testing are needed to determine what levels of change are necessary and sufficient to signal an abnormality, rather than either biological variability or imprecision. Also, European guidelines for the diagnosis of MI indicate that appropriate thresholds, reference values, and change values should be determined for each high‐sensitivity assay.

### Elevated troponin and myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit: a prospective study [^117W1jjM]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponin is specific to the myocardium, and levels in the serum rise 3–4 hours after the occurrence of cardiac symptoms in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, elevated levels of troponin indicate myocardial damage but not the mechanism of damage. The diagnosis of MI has thus evolved following the introduction of routine troponin testing, resulting in the redefinition of MI by the joint European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) in 2000. Based on this consensus document, any amount of myocardial damage, as detected by serum troponin and associated with evidence of ischemia, should be considered an MI.

It is increasingly recognized that elevated troponin levels occur in many patients who do not have evidence of flow-limiting coronary artery disease. In addition to nonthrombotic cardiac conditions (myocardial contusion, infiltrative myocardial diseases), nonthrombotic noncardiac diagnoses (sepsis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, renal failure) are also associated with elevated levels of troponin. Given this observation, it is generally considered inappropriate to use elevated troponin levels as the only diagnostic criterion for MI. The ESC/ACC consensus document defines MI not only based on a typical rise and fall in biomarkers but also requires the presence of one of the following: ischemic symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with myocardial ischemia, or need for a coronary artery intervention.

### Highly sensitive cardiac troponins: the evidence behind sex-specific cutoffs [^111YV6Qd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Measurement of cardiac troponins — troponin T and troponin I — first emerged into clinical practice in the 1990s. Even with these earliest assay iterations, they were more specific for myocardial injury than prior biomarkers, including when used in patients with decreased renal function. 1 Compared with creatinine kinase and myoglobin, cardiac troponin I and T are expressed only in cardiac myocytes, and the cardiac troponins are detectable in the serum or plasma of blood within hours after myocardial injury. 1 Elevation of cardiac troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) is an indicator of myocardial injury. 2, 3, 4 Along with symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, and imaging evidence, acute changes in cardiac troponins are a key component in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI). 4

The limit of detection (LOD) of cardiac troponin T and I assays has historically been above the 99th percentile URL and typically undetectable in the healthy population. However, with newer, highly sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) and highly sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs‐cTnI) assay development, the LOD is now lower than the 99th percentile URL. 5 In addition, the analytic precision of these highly sensitive assays at levels near the LOD has improved substantially. Now for the first time, we are able to reliably detect sex‐specific differences in troponin levels within a healthy population. 5, 6 This development is incorporated into the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, 4 which recommends use of sex‐specific URLs for the highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays for clinical use.

Myocardial infarction definition — 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL): The 99th percentile URL is designated as the decision level for the presence of myocardial injury and must be determined for each specific assay, and clinicians should be aware there is still no expert opinion or consensus about specific criteria for how the 99th percentile URL should be defined; significantly lower values in women support that sex-specific 99th percentile URLs are recommended for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, whereas at present, age-dependent cut-off points are not recommended for clinical use and clinicians should instead focus on changing values during serial measurements of cardiac troponin (cTn) for the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury, including MI.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116Eoxpd]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Biomarker detection of myocardial injury and infarction — cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are myocardial cell proteins and are the preferred biomarkers; high-sensitivity (hs)–cTn assays are recommended for routine clinical use. Myocardial injury is defined when cardiac troponin (cTn) exceeds the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL); the injury is acute with a newly detected rising and/or falling pattern of cTn values above the 99th percentile URL, or chronic when cTn levels remain persistently elevated. The boxed criteria specify that detection of an elevated cTn value above the 99th percentile URL defines myocardial injury and that the injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values. Elevated cTn indicates myocardial cell injury but does not specify the mechanism, and it is not clinically possible to distinguish which increases of cTn are due to which mechanisms. Histological evidence of myocardial injury with myocyte death can occur in nonischemic conditions, and myocardial injury with myocyte death caused by myocardial ischemia is designated as an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

### Elevated serum cardiac troponin in non-acute coronary syndrome [^113Esrh5]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins (CTn) are the most sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury and risk stratification. The assay for troponin T (cTnI) is standardized, and results obtained from different institutions are comparable. This is not the case with troponin I (cTnT), and clinicians should be aware that each institution must analyze and standardize its own results. Elevated cTn levels indicate cardiac injury, but do not define the mechanical injury. The differentiation of cTn elevation caused by coronary events from those not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is tiresome, at times vexing, and often costly. Elevation of cTn in non-ACS is a marker of increased cardiac and all-cause morbidity and mortality. The cause of these elevations may involve serious medical conditions that require meticulous diagnostic evaluation and aggressive therapy. At present, there are no guidelines to treat patients with elevated troponin levels and no coronary disease. The current strategy of treatment of patients with elevated troponin and non-ACS involves treating the underlying causes.

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: the challenges and opportunities [^114Swbqg]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods to improve the safety, accuracy and efficiency of assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary symptoms have occupied decades of study and have supported significant changes in clinical practice. Much of the progress is reliant on results of laboratory-based high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays that can detect low concentrations with high precision. Until recently, point-of-care (POC) platforms were unable to perform with similar analytical precision as laboratory-based assays, and recommendations for their use in accelerated assessment strategies for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome has been limited. As POC assays can provide troponin results within 20min, and can be used proximate to patient care, improvements in the efficiency of assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome is possible, particularly with new high-sensitivity assays.

### Association of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration with cardiac outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^114jMR9w]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing is widely used to evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. A cardiac troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/L identifies patients at presentation as low risk, but the optimal threshold is uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate the performance of a cardiac troponin I threshold of 5 ng/L at presentation as a risk stratification tool in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases from January 1, 2006, to March 18, 2017.

Study Selection

Prospective studies measuring high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in which the diagnosis was adjudicated according to the universal definition of myocardial infarction.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The systematic review identified 19 cohorts. Individual patient-level data were obtained from the corresponding authors of 17 cohorts, with aggregate data from 2 cohorts. Meta-estimates for primary and secondary outcomes were derived using a binomial-normal random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. Performance was evaluated in subgroups and across a range of troponin concentrations (2–16 ng/L) using individual patient data.

Results

Of 11 845 articles identified, 104 underwent full-text review, and 19 cohorts from 9 countries were included. Among 22 457 patients included in the meta-analysis (mean age, 62 [SD, 15.5] years; n = 9329 women [41.5%]), the primary outcome occurred in 2786 (12.4%). Cardiac troponin I concentrations were less than 5 ng/L at presentation in 11 012 patients (49%), in whom there were 60 missed index or 30-day events (59 index myocardial infarctions, 1 myocardial infarction at 30 days, and no cardiac deaths at 30 days). This resulted in a negative predictive value of 99.5% (95% CI, 99.3%-99.6%) for the primary outcome. There were no cardiac deaths at 30 days and 7 (0.1%) at 1 year, with a negative predictive value of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.7%-99.9%) for cardiac death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration of less than 5 ng/L identified those at low risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death within 30 days. Further research is needed to understand the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this approach to risk stratification.

### Highly sensitive cardiac troponins: the evidence behind sex-specific cutoffs [^113RnT1H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Emergence of various highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays into clinical practice provides a new tool for clinicians diagnosing acute coronary syndrome. These assays also create a challenge for laboratories and clinicians who have yet to familiarize themselves with sex-specific cutoffs. Healthy men and women, studied across various age groups and geographic locations, have notable differences in baseline values of highly sensitive cardiac troponin I and T, leading to establishment of sex-specific upper reference limits and cutoffs. Several differences in cardiac physiology, size, and structure may account for baseline differences in highly sensitive cardiac troponins and outcomes between the sexes. The clinical utility of implementing sex-specific cutoffs for diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome remains unclear. Presently, the only prospective study failed to show improved outcomes for men or women with use of sex-specific cutoffs; however, a major limitation is the frequent lack of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive interventions prescribed to women with low-level troponin elevations. Based on the current literature, we posit that there may nonetheless be clinical value in the use of sex-specific cutoffs for evaluating suspected acute coronary syndrome, especially in select patient populations such as younger women who tend to have lower baseline values of highly sensitive cardiac troponins. Future studies should prospectively evaluate differences in diagnostic, pharmacologic, and interventional management in men and women using myocardial infarctions classified with sex-specific cutoffs of the highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays.

### Recommendations for the use of cardiac troponin measurement in acute cardiac care [^113MGDSh]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The release of cardiomyocyte components, i.e. biomarkers, into the bloodstream in higher than usual quantities indicates an ongoing pathological process. Thus, detection of elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers in blood is a sign of cardiac injury which could be due to supply-demand imbalance, toxic effects, or haemodynamic stress. It is up to the clinician to determine the most probable aetiology, the proper therapeutic measures, and the subsequent risk implied by the process. For this reason, the measurement of biomarkers always must be applied in relation to the clinical context and never in isolation. There are a large number of cardiac biomarkers, but they can be subdivided into four broad categories, those related to necrosis, inflammation, haemodynamic stress, and/or thrombosis. Their usefulness is dependent on the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements, the discriminatory limits separating pathology from physiology, and their sensitivity and specificity for specific organ damage and/or disease processes. In recent years, cardiac biomarkers have become important adjuncts to the delivery of acute cardiac care. Therefore, the Working Group on Acute Cardiac Care of the European Society of Cardiology established a committee to deal with ongoing and newly developing issues related to cardiac biomarkers. The intention of the group is to outline the principles for the application of various biomarkers by clinicians in the setting of acute cardiac care in a series of expert consensus documents. The first of these will focus on cardiac troponin, a pivotal marker of cardiac injury/necrosis.

### Novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^113VzSYL]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay can safely identify two-thirds of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome as low risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death in the emergency department. Diagnostic pathways that harness the potential of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing by incorporating cardiac troponin concentrations within the reference range to risk stratify patients miss fewer events than pathways that rely on the 99th centile to rule out myocardial infarction.

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^112FJiMW]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Distortion of the troponin-mortality link

The extent of the association between troponin level and mortality in patients with ACS has not been previously explored using troponin on a continuous scale. Previous studies had sample sizes that were 35-fold to 170-fold smaller. These small numbers led to studies grouping patients with troponin values above about 5×ULN, or more than 2.5% of the maximum detected troponin level. The studies showed a relatively linear association between troponin level and mortality risk. Our study is large enough to allow analysis of high levels of troponin without grouping, across a population of patients who had troponin measured for clinical reasons.

Mortality increased from very low troponin levels to middle range levels, but above about 70×ULN a significant and progressive decline in mortality was seen in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Patients with the very highest troponin levels had mortality comparable to those with normal troponin levels after the first month of follow-up. Possibly the paradoxical decline in mortality at very high troponin levels in patients with ACS may be due in part to a changing case mix as troponin levels increase. In addition, a higher proportion of patients with the highest troponin levels undergoes invasive management. In keeping with this, when we stratified patients with ACS according to invasive or non-invasive management, the inverted U shaped relation between troponin level and mortality remained inverted in the group receiving invasive management; however, it became a direct positive relation in the non-invasive group.

Overall, invasive management was associated with lower hazard ratios than non-invasive management in patients with ACS and raised troponin levels. One explanation for this is that patients with underlying disease that lends itself to revascularisation and patients who are fit enough to undergo invasive management have a lower mortality than other groups. Possibly, revascularisation has improved prognosis in this patient group. Angiography, followed by coronary revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, when appropriate, improves clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality in patients with ACS. Findings from our study may reflect a substantial improvement in prognosis conferred by revascularisation in appropriate patients.

### The prognostic value of troponin in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes: a meta-analysis [^1141KUge]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to compare the prognostic value of an abnormal troponin level derived from studies of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Background

Risk stratification for patients with suspected ACS is important for determining need for hospitalization and intensity of treatment.

Methods

We identified clinical trials and cohort studies of consecutive patients with suspected ACS without ST-elevation from 1966 through 1999. We excluded studies limited to patients with acute myocardial infarction and studies not reporting mortality or troponin results.

Results

Seven clinical trials and 19 cohort studies reported data for 5,360 patients with a troponin T test and 6,603 with a troponin I test. Patients with positive troponin (I or T) had significantly higher mortality than those with a negative test (5.2% vs. 1.6%, odds ratio [OR] 3.1). Cohort studies demonstrated a greater difference in mortality between patients with a positive versus negative troponin I (8.4% vs. 0.7%, OR 8.5) than clinical trials (4.8% if positive, 2.1% if negative, OR 2.6, p = 0.01). Prognostic value of a positive troponin T was also slightly greater for cohort studies (11.6% mortality if positive, 1.7% if negative, OR 5.1) than for clinical trials (3.8% if positive, 1.3% if negative, OR 3.0, p = 0.2)

Conclusions

In patients with non-ST elevation ACS, the short-term odds of death are increased three- to eightfold for patients with an abnormal troponin test. Data from clinical trials suggest a lower prognostic value for troponin than do data from cohort studies.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^115RRzAg]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the 99th percentile is the recommended diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction, some guidelines also advocate the use of higher troponin thresholds to rule in myocardial infarction at presentation. It is unclear whether the magnitude or change in troponin concentration can differentiate causes of myocardial injury and infarction in practice.

Methods

In a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we identified 46092 consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations at presentation and on serial testing were compared between patients with myocardial injury and infarction. The positive predictive value and specificity were determined at the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold of the upper reference limit for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction.

Results

Troponin was above the 99th percentile in 8188 patients (18%). The diagnosis was type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction in 50% and 14% and acute or chronic myocardial injury in 20% and 16%, respectively. Troponin concentrations were similar at presentation in type 1 (median [25th-75th percentile] 91 [30–493] ng/L) and type 2 (50 [22–147] ng/L) myocardial infarction and in acute (50 [26–134] ng/L) and chronic (51 [31–130] ng/L) myocardial injury. The 99th percentile and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold upper reference limit gave a positive predictive value of 57% (95% CI, 56%-58%), 59% (58%-61%), and 62% (60%-64%) and a specificity of 96% (96%-96%), 96% (96%-96%), and 98% (97%-98%), respectively. The absolute, relative, and rate of change in troponin concentration were highest in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction (P < 0.001 for all). Discrimination improved when troponin concentration and change in troponin were combined compared with troponin concentration at presentation alone (area under the curve, 0.661 [0.642–0.680] versus 0.613 [0.594–0.633]).

Conclusions

Although we observed important differences in the kinetics, cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation are insufficient to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury or infarction in practice and should not guide management decisions in isolation.

### Using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T for acute cardiac care [^1115Rs6x]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The recent approval of the fifth-generation cardiac troponin T assay, which has characteristics clinically of a high-sensitivity assay, has led to concern that the problems of increased sensitivity will be greater than the benefits. This will not be the case if cardiology, emergency medicine, and laboratory medicine combine to develop procedures for use of the assay. We advocate sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit values of 15 ng/L for men and 10 ng/L for women. We suggest a 2-hour rule-out strategy, including a value less than the 99th percentile upper reference limit and the lack of a change in values of < 4 ng/L. Those with values > 100 ng/L and or a changing pattern of values ≥ 10 ng/L are a population much more likely to have acute myocardial infarction. Most of the increment in elevated values will occur not in those with acute coronary problems but in those with primary cardiac disease like heart failure and those with primary noncardiac problems. The former belong on a cardiac service because they are at high risk.

### Highly sensitive cardiac troponins: the evidence behind sex-specific cutoffs [^111wbuMt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Emergence of various highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays into clinical practice provides a new tool for clinicians diagnosing acute coronary syndrome. These assays also create a challenge for laboratories and clinicians who have yet to familiarize themselves with sex‐specific cutoffs. Healthy men and women, studied across various age groups and geographic locations, have notable differences in baseline values of highly sensitive cardiac troponin I and T, leading to establishment of sex‐specific upper reference limits and cutoffs. Several differences in cardiac physiology, size, and structure may account for baseline differences in highly sensitive cardiac troponins and outcomes between the sexes. The clinical utility of implementing sex‐specific cutoffs for diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome remains unclear. Presently, the only prospective study failed to show improved outcomes for men or women with use of sex‐specific cutoffs; however, a major limitation is the frequent lack of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive interventions prescribed to women with low‐level troponin elevations. Based on the current literature, we posit that there may nonetheless be clinical value in the use of sex‐specific cutoffs for evaluating suspected acute coronary syndrome, especially in select patient populations such as younger women who tend to have lower baseline values of highly sensitive cardiac troponins. Future studies should prospectively evaluate differences in diagnostic, pharmacologic, and interventional management in men and women using myocardial infarctions classified with sex‐specific cutoffs of the highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays.

Myocardial injury classification using cardiac troponin (cTn) — elevated values are organized by cTn dynamics and ischemia. "Elevated Cardiac Troponin Value(s) > 99th percentile URL" with "Troponin rise and/or fall" and "With acute ischemia†" is labeled "Acute myocardial infarction", whereas "Without acute ischemia†" is labeled "Acute myocardial injury"; if the "Troponin level stable", the label is "Chronic myocardial injury". Stability is defined as "Stable denotes ≤ 20% variation of troponin values in the appropriate clinical context", and the footnote clarifies that "Ischemia denotes signs and/or symptoms of clinical myocardial ischemia".

### Recommendations for institutions transitioning to high-sensitivity troponin testing: JACC Scientific expert panel [^113PmAt8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) I or T methods have been in use in certain regions for years but are now increasingly globally adopted, including in the United States. Accordingly, inevitable challenges are created for institutions transitioning from conventional cardiac troponin (cTn) assays. hs-cTn assays have higher analytic precision at lower concentrations, yielding greater clinical sensitivity for myocardial injury and allowing accurate recognition of small changes in troponin concentration (rise or fall) within a short time frame. Although much of the knowledge regarding troponin biology that was applicable with older troponin assays still holds true, considerable education regarding the differences between conventional cTn and hs-cTn is needed before medical systems convert to the newer methods. This includes a basic understanding of how hs-cTn testing differs from conventional cTn testing and how it is best deployed in different settings, such as the emergency department and inpatient services. This Expert Panel will review important concepts for institutional transition to hs-cTn methodology, providing recommendations useful for education before implementation.

### Cardiac troponin T levels for risk stratification in infarction… [^1173deVE]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponin T results were positive at enrollment in 1, 127 of the 12, 666 patients. Compared with patients with normal troponin T levels, those with elevated levels were significantly older and more often had an anterior infarction, lower systolic blood pressure and a higher heart rate. In addition, patients with positive test results were more likely to have clinical signs of heart failure at enrollment. Patients with positive troponin results at the time of enrollment in the study had chest pain significantly longer than the patients with negative results. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with troponin T elevation. Patients with elevated levels also had significantly more cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, asystole, electromechanical dissociation, moderate or severe bleeding and blood transfusion. Cardiogenic shock occurred in 9.

0 percent of those with positive troponin T levels compared with
3. 7 percent of those with negative results. Congestive heart failure was present in 23. 4 percent of the patients with elevated troponin T levels. In contrast, it was present in 16. 4 percent of those with normal levels. editor's note: Troponin T, as opposed to creatine kinase or troponin I, is elevated in patients with multivessel disease or transient myocardial ischemia. Studies have confirmed that the troponin T level is useful for the detection of minor myocardial damage. The troponin T level has been found to reflect the gradual transition between minor myocardial damage and small acute myocardial infarction. Troponin has a higher sensitivity as a marker for irreversible myocardial injury than does the MB fraction of creatine kinase because it is not elevated in patients with skeletal muscle disease or injury. Troponin is present in myocardial tissue at higher levels than CK-MB.

The second-generation troponin T assays are highly sensitive and serve as a specific marker for minor myocardial damage. The troponin T level can also be elevated in patients with severe congestive heart failure. — r. s.

### Role of troponin in patients with chronic kidney disease and suspected acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review [^115c98w9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high prevalence of elevated serum troponin levels, which makes diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) challenging.

Purpose

To evaluate the utility of troponin in ACS diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis among patients with CKD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 2014.

Study Selection

Studies examining elevated versus normal troponin levels in terms of their diagnostic performance in detection of ACS, effect on ACS management strategies, and prognostic value for mortality or cardiovascular events after ACS among patients with CKD.

Data Extraction

Paired reviewers selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and graded strength of evidence (SOE).

Data Synthesis

Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of troponin T for ACS diagnosis ranged from 71% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 31% to 86% (6 studies; low SOE). The sensitivity and specificity of troponin I ranged from 43% to 94% and from 48% to 100%, respectively (8 studies; low SOE). No studies examined how troponin levels affect management strategies. Twelve studies analyzed prognostic value. Elevated levels of troponin I or troponin T were associated with higher risk for short-term death and cardiac events (low SOE). A similar trend was observed for long-term mortality with troponin I (low SOE), but less evidence was found for long-term cardiac events for troponin I and long-term outcomes for troponin T (insufficient SOE). Patients with advanced CKD tended to have worse prognoses with elevated troponin I levels than those without them (moderate SOE).

Limitation

Studies were heterogeneous in design and in ACS definitions and adjudication methods.

Conclusion

In patients with CKD and suspected ACS, troponin levels can aid in identifying those with a poor prognosis, but the diagnostic utility is limited by varying estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: the challenges and opportunities [^1161jJyc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of troponin and use of troponin assays

To understand the significant changes in this practice area, it is important to be aware of two key events that occurred following the introduction and subsequent development of cTn assays. First, the change from diagnosis using creatine kinase MB to cTn increased the risk of a biochemical false-positive from 0.044% (classified as abnormal when more than twice the 97.5th reference limit) to 1% (abnormal when above the 99th percentile). The second is the improvement in troponin assays. Early assays had inadequate sensitivity for detection of troponin. Progressive improvements in assay sensitivity combined with the use of the 99th percentile resulted in previously undiagnosed myocardial injury being detectable in a range of clinical conditions. Currently, hs-cTn assays are in routine clinical use in many laboratories and are defined by two criteria. First, the coefficient of variation (CV) at the 99th percentile upper reference limit should be ≤ 10%, and second that measurable concentrations should be attainable at a concentration at or above the assay's limit of detection (LoD) for > 50% of healthy individuals. Hence, hs-cTn assays represent the reference analytical standard against which diagnostic strategies must now be compared.

To date, in each clinical situation where troponin elevation has been detected and where myocardial infarction (MI) or ACS is not suspected, the troponin elevation has been shown to be prognostic. More troponin is worse than less troponin and no troponin is better than any troponin. Troponin measurement remains an excellent rule-out test. Use of the term 'troponinitis' is trivialising and clinically dangerous. Any elevated troponin requires explanation, yet not necessarily catheterisation or a cardiologist review.

Evidence for the clinical use of hs-cTn assays in patients presenting with chest pain has recently been reviewed and recommended for the early rule-out of MI. Such assays have also been described within rapid predictive algorithms by the European Society of Cardiologyand although data are included about POC hs-cTn assays, the recommendations at the time of writing are for use of laboratory-based assays. This is congruent with recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelinesthat suggest further evaluation of the performance of POC cTn assays using whole blood samples (rather than stored plasma samples) is required before clinical use.

### Are maternal serum troponin I levels affected by vaginal or cesarean delivery? [^1122nVQh]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Our objective was to describe the change in the level of troponin I in patients who undergo a vaginal or cesarean delivery. We obtained troponin I levels on admission and 1 hour after delivery in women undergoing vaginal and cesarean deliveries. Exclusion criteria included < 37 weeks' gestation, a history of cardiac disease, hypertension, or cardiac symptoms. The troponin I level used to indicate myocardial ischemia was 2.0 ng/mL; levels were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. The median age of women in the vaginal versus the cesarean group were 25.6 years and 34.4 years, and the median gestational age for both groups was 39.6 weeks. The median troponin I level before and after vaginal delivery was < 0.3 ng/mL and before and after cesarean was < 0.3 ng/mL. The highest level of troponin I in either group was 0.3 ng/mL. Troponin I is not elevated as a result of undergoing a vaginal or cesarean delivery. We conclude that troponin I may be used as a reliable marker to diagnose myocardial ischemia in postpartum women.

The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing. These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed.

### Cardiac troponins and chronic kidney disease [^114V3etq]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The prevalence of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, and acute myocardial infarction contributes significantly to the steep mortality rate in this population. Diagnosing an acute coronary syndrome in these patients is often difficult though essential. Traditional diagnostic tools such as symptoms and electrocardiographic manifestations are not entirely helpful in patients with CKD, and physicians are often left to rely on laboratory analysis of biomarkers such as cardiac troponin. However, troponin levels are increased in patients with renal failure in the absence of clinical myocardial ischemia, making their interpretation problematic. Several theories have been proposed for the mechanism of elevated troponin levels in CKD. Irrespective of our uncertainty regarding mechanism, studies have shown that there is a strong prognostic implication of elevated troponin levels; and that it is predictive of increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. Troponin levels rise over 6–8 h in the setting of acute myocardial injury; hence, it is imperative to obtain these levels sequentially in patients with CKD in whom a clinical cardiac event is suspected. A distinct rise and fall in the levels over baseline strongly support the diagnosis of acute myocardial necrosis. Despite uncertainties regarding increased troponins in patients with CKD, their value remains clear.

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^115JfLWG]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the relation between age and troponin level and its prognostic implication.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Five cardiovascular centres in the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative (UK-NIHR HIC).

Participants

257 948 consecutive patients undergoing troponin testing for any clinical reason between 2010 and 2017.

Main outcome measure

All cause mortality.

Results

257 948 patients had troponin measured during the study period. Analyses on troponin were performed using the peak troponin level, which was the highest troponin level measured during the patient's hospital stay. Troponin levels were standardised as a multiple of each laboratory's 99th centile of the upper limit of normal (ULN). During a median follow-up of 1198 days (interquartile range 514–1866 days), 55 850 (21.7%) deaths occurred. A positive troponin result (that is, higher than the upper limit of normal) signified a 3.2 higher mortality hazard (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 3.2) over three years. Mortality varied noticeably with age, with a hazard ratio of 10.6 (8.5 to 13.3) in 18–29 year olds and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.6) in those older than 90. A positive troponin result was associated with an approximately 15 percentage points higher absolute three year mortality across all age groups. The excess mortality with a positive troponin result was heavily concentrated in the first few weeks. Results were analysed using multivariable adjusted restricted cubic spline Cox regression. A direct relation was seen between troponin level and mortality in patients without acute coronary syndrome (ACS, n = 120 049), whereas an inverted U shaped relation was found in patients with ACS (n = 14 468), with a paradoxical decline in mortality at peak troponin levels > 70×ULN. In the group with ACS, the inverted U shaped relation persisted after multivariable adjustment in those who were managed invasively; however, a direct positive relation was found between troponin level and mortality in patients managed non-invasively.

Conclusions

A positive troponin result was associated with a clinically important increased mortality, regardless of age, even if the level was only slightly above normal. The excess mortality with a raised troponin was heavily concentrated in the first few weeks.

### Elevated troponin and myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit: a prospective study [^116Mg5B6]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Interpretation of results

Analysis of troponin levels

In accordance with the US National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry draft guidelines on biomarkers of the acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, a single cutpoint at the lowest analytical value with 10% coefficient of variation was used. Using these guidelines, cardiac troponin T values above 0.04 μg/l were considered evidence of myocardial necrosis and levels of 0.04 μg/l or less were considered to represent no evidence of myocardial necrosis.

Classification of myocardial infarction

The definition of MI in the ICU was adapted from the joint ESC/ACC redefinition of acute MI. The consensus document defines MI through pathologic findings, or the presence of a typical rise and gradual fall in troponin or a more rapid rise and fall in creatine kinase-MB with one of the following: ischemic symptoms, development of pathologic Q waves on ECG, ischemic ECG changes (ST-segment elevation or depression), or a coronary artery intervention.

We made two adaptations to the proposed criteria. First, we adapted the biomarker criterion because the troponin rise can be missed in the absence of patient communication, and an elevated troponin can be discovered following the peak level and after an event has occurred. In addition, troponin can remain elevated for up to 14 days and in practice is not always remeasured to ensure that it is decreasing. Consequently, we accepted either a typical rise or a typical fall in troponin to satisfy this criterion. Second, although the summary section of the consensus document did not include imaging techniques as a criterion for diagnosing MI, it is included in the text. We introduced the presence of new or presumed new cardiac wall motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiography or radionuclide imaging, in combination with elevated biomarkers, to diagnose MI in the ICU. Without this additional echocardiogram criterion, physicians might miss the diagnosis of MI in patients who have suffered an MI. This may occur because ICU patients with an elevated troponin are invariably unable to communicate ischemic symptoms, and some may have an uninterpretable ECG, a chronic left bundle branch block, or infarction in a territory of the ECG that has low sensitivity for MI.

Using these a priori criteria, two investigators (IQ, DJC) were provided with all available 12-lead ECGs and troponin measurements for each patient, and echocardiogram results. With the investigators blinded to each other's assessments, patients were then independently classified as having MI or no MI during their ICU stay.

### Highly sensitive cardiac troponins: the evidence behind sex-specific cutoffs [^111oZetd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Utility of Sex‐Specific Cutoffs

Sex‐specific differences in the hs‐cTnT and hs‐cTnI 99th percentile URL are now recognized, but the clinical implication of using sex‐specific cutoffs compared with a single cutoff remains unclear. We still do not know for certain whether routine clinical use of sex‐specific cutoffs of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays will improve the diagnosis of small MIs or MINOCA in women in a clinically meaningful way. The improved sensitivity for identifying women at risk for future adverse cardiovascular events may be offset by the increased number of women needing to undergo further evaluation for their elevated troponin levels. In addition, the increased identification of women who are at risk may come at the possible expense of identifying fewer men who are at risk for myocardial injury using sex‐specific cutoffs. Only a handful of studies to date have evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing MI in men and women using the sex‐specific cutoffs as compared with a single cutoff, and there are few data on whether clinical decisions guided by sex‐specific cutoffs can lead to improved outcomes. 44, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 Prospective studies are even more sparse. Details on the design of the studies that evaluated utility of sex‐specific cutoffs are outlined in Table 3. 44, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T compared with standard troponin T testing on emergency department admission: how much does it add in everyday clinical practice? [^111obTok]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

During the past 2 decades cardiac troponin (cTn) has emerged as the criterion biomarker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and during recent years the analytical sensitivity and assay precision at the low measuring range of cTn assays has been continuously improved to fulfill the analytical criteria of current guidelines, – that is, a total coefficient of variation (CV) of < 10% at the 99th percentile of troponin concentrations of a healthy reference population (= the recommended upper reference limit [URL]). Recently, the first assay that fulfills these criteria in routine clinical laboratories has been introduced for routine cTn testing outside the United States, the so‐called high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) assay.hs‐cTn assays permit precise measurement of cTn concentrations in a significant number of apparently illness‐free individuals and thus more precise calculation of the 99th‐percentile cTn concentration in reference subjects. – These assays measure cTn in the single‐digit range of nanograms per liter, with some research assays even below 1 ng/L.– It has been postulated that hs‐cTn assays will improve early AMI diagnosis, and the first clinical studies in preselected and highly preselected chest pain patient populations indeed demonstrated a significant improvement in early diagnostic sensitivity for AMI. – However, the clinical benefits of hs‐cTn testing in everyday clinical practice are still a matter of debate, and, therefore, we investigated this issue in a large consecutive emergency department (ED) population in which cTnT testing was requested liberally by the attending physician by parallel measurement of standard cTnT (fourth‐generation cTnT assay) with the new hs‐cTnT assay.

### Utility of absolute and relative changes in cardiac troponin concentrations in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^113wmqdC]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), among other criteria, also require a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin (cTn) levels. It is unknown whether absolute or relative changes in cTn have higher diagnostic accuracy and should therefore be preferred.

Methods and Results

In a prospective, observational, multicenter study, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of absolute (Δ) and relative (Δ%) changes in cTn in 836 patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of AMI. Blood samples for the determination of high-sensitive cTn T and cTn I ultra were collected at presentation and after 1 and 2 hours in a blinded fashion. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnosing AMI was significantly higher for 2-hour absolute (Δ) versus 2-hour relative (Δ%) cTn changes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% confidence interval], high-sensitivity cTn T: 0.95 [0.92 to 0.98] versus 0.76 [0.70 to 0.83], P < 0.001; cTn I ultra: 0.95 [0.91 to 0.99] versus 0.72 [0.66 to 0.79], P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve-derived cutoff value for 2-hour absolute (Δ) change was 0.007 μg/L for high-sensitivity cTn T and 0.020 μg/L for cTn I ultra (both cutoff levels are half of the 99th percentile of the respective cTn assay). Absolute changes were superior to relative changes in patients with both low and elevated baseline cTn levels.

Conclusions

Absolute changes of cTn levels have a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for AMI than relative changes, and seem therefore to be the preferred criteria to distinguish AMI from other causes of cTn elevations.

### Elevated troponin and myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit: a prospective study [^113AFwkc]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

Because cardiac troponin is a sensitive and specific measure of myocardial necrosis, it is the preferred biomarker for use in the diagnosis of acute MI. Although an elevated troponin indicates myocardial necrosis, it does not always indicate MI. Thus, in the ICU setting, where elevated troponin is frequently observed, additional evidence of myocardial ischemia can be obtained by using a 12-lead ECG. In this single centre prospective cohort study of predominantly medical ICU patients, 47% of critically ill patients had at least one elevated troponin measurement but only 26% met diagnostic criteria for MI based on a typical rise or fall in elevated troponin measurements and ischemic changes on a 12-lead ECG, with ECGs performed as clinically indicated. Patients with MI had significantly higher troponin levels than did those without MI. Patients who were diagnosed with MI had twofold increased rates of ICU and hospital mortality. The presence of an elevated troponin measurement alone was not associated with adverse outcomes, but the presence of MI was independently predictive of hospital mortality.

The incidence and prevalence rates of elevated levels of troponin cited in the literature vary widely, ranging from 15% to 70% of patients. Recent studies have examined the frequency of elevated troponin levels excluding those patients with underlying coronary heart disease; a 55% prevalence of elevated levels of troponin was reported, of which 72% of patients with an elevated troponin did not have flow-limiting coronary artery disease based on stress echocardiography or autopsy. The variability in frequency rates observed in our study and other studies is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of ICU populations and the threshold at which a troponin measurement is considered positive. The current troponin threshold recommended by the ESC/ACC has been defined for noncritically ill populations, and whether this threshold differs in the ICU setting is unknown. Furthermore, the various troponin assays are not standardized and, although it is recommended that levels exceeding the 99th percentile be considered positive, this level varies according to manufacturer.

### Do serial troponins predict the need for cardiac evaluation in trauma patients after ground-level fall? [^116iAPkt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Falls are the most common mechanism of injury in US trauma centers, with an estimated annual cost of US$50 billion in 2015. The majority of patients who present after ground-level fall are not injured. However, a subset of patients have life-threatening injuries that must be rapidly identified, and in some, the fall is a symptom of an underlying illness that must be identified to prevent further complications. Given the increasing prevalence of falls in our aging population, modest improvements in the evaluation have the potential to improve both patient care and reduce healthcare costs.

The initial goals in the evaluation of a patient after ground-level fall are twofold, to rapidly identify and treat injuries, and to determine the cause of the fall. Falls are classically divided into mechanical (eg, tripping over a rug in the dark) and syncopal in etiology (a loss of consciousness leading to fall). For syncopal or pre-syncopal falls, 10% are estimated to be from a cardiac etiology. It is critically important to identify this group as they have the greatest association with subsequent sudden cardiac death. Thus, many institutions have developed a 'syncopal workup' protocol which is applied liberally in patients with any suspicion of syncope.

At our urban level 1 trauma center, all patients with suspected syncope after fall undergo a full history and physical examination, ECG, chest X-ray, and basic laboratory testing including troponin level testing using a highly sensitive assay. Some of these patients also undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients with an initial serum troponin T level above the laboratory-defined normal value (19 ng/L) have repeat levels drawn every 4–6 hours until the troponin level peaks. This practice for the troponin levels was adapted from the approach to patients with concern for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. However, although elevated troponins have been shown to be associated with increased adverse events after syncope, the optimum use of serum troponin levels in patients after ground-level fall is not well defined. Therefore, the aims of our study were (1) to understand the relationship between initial troponin level and need for further cardiac workup or adverse cardiac outcomes, (2) to understand the impact of serial troponin values on the same outcomes, and (3) to clarify the relative association of higher cut-off troponin values with the outcomes of interest.

### Efficacy of high-sensitivity troponin T in identifying very-low-risk patients with possible acute coronary syndrome… [^111RzF4V]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Can a negative high-sensitivity troponin assay at 0 and 3 hours following emergency department presentation identify patients at less than 1% risk of 30-day adverse cardiac events. Findings In this multicenter evaluation, a single high-sensitivity troponin level less than 6 ng/L ruled out myocardial infarction, while serial levels at 19 ng/L or less identified patients at less than 1% risk of 30-day adverse cardiac events. The upper reference level for the hsTnT assay, defined as the 99th percentile, was established as 19 ng/L in a separate healthy US cohort. Patients were considered ruled out for acute myocardial infarction if their hsTnT level at 0 hours and 3 hours was less than the upper reference level. Gold standard diagnoses were determined by a clinical end point committee. Evaluation of assay clinical performance for acute myocardial infarction rule-out was prespecified; the hypothesis regarding 30-day ACE was formulated after data collection.

Results In 1301 healthy volunteers, the upper reference level was 19 ng/L. In 1600 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, a single hsTnTlevel less than 6 ng/L at baseline had a negative predictive value for AMI of 99. 4%. Conclusions and Relevance A single hsTnT level less than 6 ng/L was associated with a markedly decreased risk of AMI, while serial levels at 19 ng/L or less identified patients at less than 1% risk of 30-day ACE. Troponin trajectory was evaluated in greater detail in 974 patients with an hsTnT level of 19 ng/L or less at 0 and 3 hours. For most of these patients, the hsTnT result did not cross the LoQ margin during the 3 hours but had either both measures less than or both greater than the LoQ.

We also evaluated sex-specific URLs and found diagnostic performance was largely unchanged, in contrast to a prior report with high-sensitive troponin I reporting a doubling of the female AMI rate with sex-specific URLs. 24, 25.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blunt chest trauma, more specifically with respect to evaluation for cardiac injury (cardiac biomarkers), EAST 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain troponin I level measurement routinely in patients with suspected blunt cardiac injury. Admit patients to a monitored setting and obtain serial laboratory monitoring if the troponin I level is elevated.

5 CONCLUSION

Despite the prognostic implications of troponin levels in ACS, current guidelines for urgent revascularization in NSTEMI patients do not incorporate this biomarker in their decision‐making process regarding treatment. In our study, we have demonstrated an association between hs‐cTnI levels upon admission and overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Furthermore, we identified a subgroup that is at a heightened risk of mortality according to their initial hs‐cTnI level. Interestingly, this association becomes less significant when early reperfusion strategy is considered. These findings may suggest that initial hs‐cTnI levels could be an additional factor when determining reperfusion strategies in NSTEMI patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the impact of early reperfusion strategies on mortality in NSTEMI patients categorized by their initial presenting troponin levels.
