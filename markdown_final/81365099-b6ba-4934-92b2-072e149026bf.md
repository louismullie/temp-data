## Question

How should a patient with alcoholic fatty liver and a FibroScan result of F4 be managed, given that he has stopped drinking and is on naltrexone for addiction management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage alcoholic fatty liver disease with a FibroScan showing F4 in a patient who has stopped drinking and is on naltrexone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what F4 on transient elastography means and whether this implies compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis. Then, I should verify the immediate staging workup, including MELD-Na, endoscopic variceal screening, and baseline labs. Next, I need to check the safety of naltrexone in cirrhosis and clarify when to continue versus stop it, followed by evidence-backed alternatives. After that, I should reinforce abstinence and integrated care, implement cirrhosis-specific management and surveillance, adjust the monitoring strategy given the limitations of FibroScan in F4, consider transplant referral thresholds, and finish with risk mitigation, education, and a concise final recommendation backed by guidelines.

> Let me first confirm what an F4 FibroScan implies in this context. An elastography-based F4 stage is consistent with cirrhosis, but I should not jump to conclusions about disease activity until I determine if the patient is compensated or decompensated based on clinical history and exam for ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or jaundice, because management and medication safety hinge on that distinction.

> I should double-check the initial staging workup now. I will calculate MELD-Na for short-term risk, review INR, bilirubin, creatinine, albumin, and CBC, assess for portal hypertension surrogates such as thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly, and arrange an upper endoscopy to screen for esophageal varices in newly recognized cirrhosis, as well as initiate HCC surveillance planning given the baseline risk in cirrhosis, keeping in mind that ALD-cirrhosis has roughly a 3% annual HCC incidence [^notfound].

> Wait, I should verify the role and safety of naltrexone here before making a recommendation. Naltrexone is effective for AUD but carries hepatotoxicity warnings and should be avoided in acute hepatitis or liver failure; prescribing in cirrhosis requires cautious judgment, close monitoring of LFTs, and a low threshold to stop if injury emerges, with FDA labeling and APA guidance emphasizing these risks and contraindications [^1143Uras] [^111idaHM]. In compensated cirrhosis without active hepatitis, I can consider continuation with careful monitoring and a conservative approach to dosing, acknowledging evidence gaps on exact dose adjustments; in decompensated disease or active hepatitis, I should hold or discontinue naltrexone and pivot to an alternative agent while supporting abstinence with nonpharmacologic interventions [^1143Uras] [^111idaHM].

> Hold on, I should ensure appropriate pharmacologic alternatives are ready if naltrexone is not suitable. Acamprosate is preferred in advanced liver disease because it is renally cleared and FDA-approved for maintenance of abstinence, which helps in cirrhosis when hepatic metabolism is a concern, while baclofen has supportive safety and efficacy data in ALD and can be considered under hepatology oversight; gabapentin can be an adjunct for craving and insomnia in select patients as part of a comprehensive plan, recognizing the primacy of psychosocial treatments [^11431eEB] [^114bBu3X].

> Let me emphasize the cornerstone now, and I should confirm I am aligning with guidelines. Complete and sustained abstinence is the single most important determinant of outcome in ALD cirrhosis, with integrated addiction-hepatology care strongly recommended; I will engage a multidisciplinary team, ensure counseling and peer support, and incorporate relapse prevention strategies alongside pharmacotherapy where appropriate [^notfound] [^112eMUf9].

> Next, I will implement cirrhosis-specific care systematically. I need to screen for and manage portal hypertension with endoscopy and consider nonselective beta-blockers if medium or large varices are present or high-risk features exist, undertake HCC surveillance with ultrasound every 6 months with or without AFP and escalate to CT/MRI if nodules are detected, optimize nutrition with high-protein intake and vitamin repletion, and promptly treat complications such as encephalopathy with lactulose with or without rifaximin as indicated, while watching renal function closely given hepatorenal syndrome risk [^notfound] [^1174n6dr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I could simply follow FibroScan values longitudinally to judge regression in F4, but I should correct that based on current guidance. In established cirrhosis, elastography has a ceiling effect and should not be used as a standalone test to infer fibrosis regression or progression; instead, I will interpret liver stiffness trends in the total clinical context and rely on composite assessments including MELD-Na, albumin, platelets, imaging, and decompensation events, using repeat elastography as an adjunct rather than a primary endpoint and considering WFUMB data on prognostication in compensated disease [^114jpBVq] [^113biJp8] [^114UXPa7].

> I will now examine transplant eligibility and timing. If MELD-Na is 15 or higher or any decompensation is present, I should refer for liver transplant evaluation, and I need to remember that while abstinence duration is important, it should not be the sole determinant of candidacy; concurrent, documented addiction care strengthens the application and supports post-transplant outcomes [^113wevFS] [^112eMUf9] [^113BtqwE].

> I need to ensure thorough risk counseling and monitoring. I will educate the patient on naltrexone's opioid overdose vulnerability after discontinuation and the danger of attempting to override opioid blockade, discuss overdose prevention if relevant, and reinforce that relapse in cirrhosis can precipitate rapid decompensation with high short-term mortality in severe presentations, while arranging periodic clinical follow-up with labs and semiannual HCC surveillance to detect complications early [^1143Uras] [^112vRs18] [^113BtqwE].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the plan into a clear recommendation, and I should double-check it aligns with guidance. This patient requires urgent hepatology referral for formal cirrhosis staging and management, continuation of naltrexone only if compensated cirrhosis without active hepatitis with close monitoring, otherwise transition to acamprosate with integrated psychosocial therapy, rigorous portal hypertension and HCC surveillance pathways, and unwavering abstinence support as the central therapeutic driver of survival while assessing for transplant when MELD-Na is 15 or higher or decompensation occurs [^113wevFS] [^111idaHM] [^11431eEB] [^113BtqwE].

The best management for a patient with alcoholic fatty liver and F4 fibrosis who has stopped drinking and is on naltrexone is to maintain **lifelong abstinence** [^113BtqwE] and continue naltrexone [^114yDfTU] with regular LFT monitoring, alongside **standard cirrhosis care**: screen for varices and HCC, manage complications, provide nutritional support, and monitor for decompensation. If decompensation occurs, refer for **liver transplantation evaluation** [^113BtqwE]. Naltrexone is appropriate in compensated cirrhosis but should be discontinued if acute hepatitis or liver failure develops [^111idaHM] [^116Tkmub].

---

## Alcohol abstinence and relapse prevention

- **Abstinence**: Lifelong abstinence is the cornerstone of management and significantly improves survival and reduces complications [^113BtqwE].
- **Naltrexone**: Continue as first-line therapy to reduce relapse risk and heavy drinking days [^114yDfTU] [^116vLf6i].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor LFTs and clinical status to detect hepatotoxicity or decompensation [^1143Uras].

---

## Management of cirrhosis (F4 fibrosis)

### Surveillance and monitoring

- **HCC surveillance**: Ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months [^111zCJZZ].
- **Variceal screening**: Upper endoscopy at diagnosis; repeat every 2–3 years if no varices, or annually if small varices [^112Th1Mi].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, INR, creatinine, and sodium every 3–6 months [^116o9TN8].

---

### Management of complications

- **Ascites**: Sodium restriction, diuretics (spironolactone ± furosemide), and therapeutic paracentesis as needed [^111zCJZZ].
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Lactulose and rifaximin [^112Th1Mi].
- **Variceal bleeding**: Non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol) or endoscopic variceal ligation [^111zCJZZ].
- **Nutritional support**: High-protein diet (1.2–1.5 g/kg/day), adequate calories, and vitamin supplementation (especially B vitamins and vitamin D) [^114Ga5P5].

---

## Role of liver transplantation

For the **indication**, consider decompensated cirrhosis or complications (refractory ascites, recurrent variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or HCC within Milan criteria) [^113BtqwE]. Regarding the **abstinence requirement**, most centers require at least 6 months of abstinence and participation in addiction treatment before listing [^113wevFS].

---

## Safety and monitoring of naltrexone in advanced liver disease

Regarding **safety**, naltrexone is generally safe in compensated cirrhosis; avoid it in acute hepatitis or liver failure [^111idaHM]. For **monitoring**, obtain regular LFTs and discontinue if significant hepatotoxicity or decompensation occurs [^116Tkmub].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **team-based approach** coordinates hepatology, addiction medicine, nutrition, and primary care to optimize outcomes and prevent relapse [^112eMUf9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Management aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Alcohol abstinence | - Lifelong abstinence <br/> - Continue naltrexone |
| HCC surveillance | Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months |
| Variceal screening | - Endoscopy at diagnosis <br/> - Repeat per findings |
| Ascites management | - Sodium restriction <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Paracentesis |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | - Lactulose <br/> - Rifaximin |
| Nutritional support | - High-protein diet <br/> - Vitamin supplementation |
| Liver transplantation | Consider if decompensated |
| Multidisciplinary care | - Hepatology <br/> - Addiction <br/> - Nutrition <br/> - Primary care |

---

Optimal management includes **lifelong abstinence**, continued naltrexone with monitoring, standard cirrhosis care, and multidisciplinary support; consider transplantation if decompensation occurs [^111g1tAh].

### Advances in the understanding and management of alcohol-related liver disease [^113BtqwE]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological trends indicate recent and predicted increases in the burden of disease. Disease progression is driven by continued alcohol exposure on a background of genetic predisposition together with environmental cofactors. Most individuals present with advanced disease despite a long history of excessive alcohol consumption and multiple missed opportunities to intervene.

Increasing evidence supports the use of non-invasive tests to screen for and identify disease at earlier stages. There is a definite role for public health measures to reduce the overall burden of disease. At an individual level, however, the ability to influence subsequent disease course by modifying alcohol consumption or the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains limited due to a comparative lack of effective, disease-modifying medical interventions.

Abstinence from alcohol is the key determinant of outcome in established ALD and the cornerstone of clinical management. In those with decompensated ALD, liver transplant has a clear role. There is consensus that abstinence from alcohol for an arbitrary period should not be the sole determinant in a decision to transplant. An increasing understanding of the mechanisms by which alcohol causes liver disease in susceptible individuals offers the prospect of new therapeutic targets for disease-modifying drugs. Successful translation will require significant public and private investment in a disease area which has traditionally been underfunded.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, specifically concerning naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend planning and monitoring the transition from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Transitioning from an antagonist (naltrexone) to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist. This is because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment, thus eliminating the possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Methadone or buprenorphine should be started with initial low doses, as patients transitioning from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids. The transition should not be made until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system, which is approximately 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence [^115XCXjv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although naltrexone, an opiate-receptor antagonist, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of alcohol dependence, its efficacy is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of naltrexone as an adjunct to standardized psychosocial treatment. We randomly assigned 627 veterans (almost all men) with chronic, severe alcohol dependence to 12 months of naltrexone (50 mg once daily), 3 months of naltrexone followed by 9 months of placebo, or 12 months of placebo. All patients were offered individual counseling and programs to improve their compliance with study medication and were encouraged to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

- **Results**: There were 209 patients in each group; all had been sober for at least five days before randomization. At 13 weeks, we found no significant difference in the number of days to relapse between patients in the two naltrexone groups (mean, 72.3 days) and the placebo group (mean, 62.4 days; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, -3.0 to 22.8). At 52 weeks, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the percentage of days on which drinking occurred and the number of drinks per drinking day.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence.

### Management of alcohol use disorder in patients with cirrhosis in the setting of liver transplantation [^115BLCbA]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been steadily increasing over the past decade. In parallel, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) has been increasing at an alarming rate, especially among young patients. Data suggest that most patients with ALD do not receive AUD therapy. Although liver transplantation is the only curative therapy for end-stage ALD, transplant candidacy is often a matter of debate due to concerns about patients being under-treated for AUD and fears of post-transplantation relapse affecting the allograft.

- **Diagnosis, predictors, and effects of relapse**: In this review, we discuss the predictors and effects of relapse.
- **Behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapies**: We propose an integrative, multidisciplinary, and multimodality approach for treating AUD in patients with cirrhosis, especially in the setting of liver transplantation. Notably, this approach considers the utility of AUD pharmacotherapy in patients on immunosuppressive medications and those with renal impairment after liver transplantation.
- **Comprehensive definition of relapse**: We propose a comprehensive and objective definition of relapse using contemporary biomarkers to guide future clinical trials.

Future research using the proposed approach and definition is warranted with the goal of optimizing AUD treatment in patients with cirrhosis, the transplant selection process, and post-transplantation care of patients with AUD.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112BgUFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver diseases that occur in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. NAFLD includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected NASH.

The goals of treatment include:

- **Correction of underlying risk factors**: Addressing obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia.
- **Avoidance of factors that promote liver disease progression**: Ensuring patients abstain from alcohol and avoid hepatotoxic drugs.
- **Specific treatment of NASH**: Considering potential treatments like vitamin E or pioglitazone.

This comprehensive approach aims to improve patient outcomes by effectively managing the condition through tailored interventions.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^117PLnHE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of steatosis typically precedes the development of fibrosis, but the influence of fat accumulation on the progression of fibrosis is not well known. The long-term survival of patients with isolated steatosis is clearly reduced compared to that of abstinent controls. After a mean follow-up of approximately 10 years, patients with alcoholic steatosis died more frequently than those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (74% vs. 25%) and more patients developed cirrhosis (21% vs. 1%). Twenty-five percent of the observed deaths among heavy drinkers were associated with cirrhosis, and 75% were attributed to other diseases related to alcohol.

Patients with underlying severe fibrosis or cirrhosis and heavy alcohol intake can present a form of acute-on-chronic liver failure called alcoholic hepatitis (AH). This is characterized by an abrupt rise in serum bilirubin levels, jaundice, and liver-related complications. Previously, it was considered that AH could occur in patients with mild underlying liver disease. However, more recent studies using tru-cut needles have shown that the majority of patients with severe AH have underlying cirrhosis. Patients with severe forms of AH show high short-term mortality around 30–50% at 3 months. Patients with AH disclosed the fastest progression of fibrosis and consequently an increased risk of liver-related death. Among other factors, obesity is an independent risk factor for progression to cirrhosis. Heavy drinkers who are overweight for at least 10 years have a 2-fold risk of developing cirrhosis.

### Noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis [^116cCegg]. Hepatology (2006).

As novel therapies for liver fibrosis evolve, non-invasive measurement of liver fibrosis will be required to help manage patients with chronic liver disease. Although liver biopsy is the time-honored gold standard for measurement of liver fibrosis, it is poorly suited to frequent monitoring because of its expense and morbidity, and its accuracy suffers from sampling variation. At present, serum markers and imaging methods are available and increasingly in use as alternatives to biopsy. However, many questions remain about their indications, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, and more investigation is required before they are put into widespread use. The development of safe, inexpensive, and reliable noninvasive fibrosis measurement tools remains a research priority in clinical hepatology.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^117LTqtE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent cause of advanced liver disease in Europe and is the leading cause of death among adults with excessive alcohol consumption. There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of ALD; the relative risk of cirrhosis increases in subjects who consume more than 25 g/day. The burden of alcohol-attributable liver cirrhosis and liver cancer is high and entirely preventable. Health agencies should develop population-based policies to reduce the prevalence of harmful and/or hazardous alcohol consumption and foster research in this field to provide new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Disease progression of patients with ALD is heavily influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Non-invasive methods for diagnosing fibrosis have opened new perspectives in the early detection of advanced ALD in asymptomatic patients. Alcoholic hepatitis, the most severe form of ALD, carries a high short-term mortality rate (around 30–50% at 3 months). Corticosteroids improve short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, but the duration of therapy should be adapted to the early response.

Liver transplantation is the best option for patients with severe liver dysfunction. However, alcohol relapse after transplantation remains a critical issue, and drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol use disorder, specifically in the evaluation of liver disease, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining noninvasive blood and/or imaging studies to assess the severity of fibrosis in patients with asymptomatic alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). It is recommended to use the Fibrosis-4 score, a blood-based marker, and hepatic transient elastography for detecting fibrosis in patients with ALD.

The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Identification of people with NAFLD is crucial for effective management. The use of defined pathways for investigating suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease, which includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (Recommendation 1, Table 1).

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); hypertriglyceridemia; low HDL; increased waist circumference or high blood pressure. NAFLD is highly prevalent in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome. The presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome (Recommendation 2, Table 1).

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3,688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease.

### Historical features are poor predictors of liver fibrosis in Canadian patients with chronic hepatitis C [^112eBrRi]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2001). Low credibility.

The progression of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) is related to host factors, including age, gender, and alcohol consumption. Due to the morbidity and potential mortality associated with liver biopsy, a noninvasive method of assessing hepatic fibrosis is needed. This study aimed to assess the utility of historical features in predicting fibrosis using published rates of fibrosis progression.

The charts of 239 untreated patients with HCV were reviewed. Patients who had a liver biopsy and whose duration of infection could be estimated (n = 106) were categorized according to gender, age at infection (greater than 40 years), and peak alcohol consumption (equal to or greater than 50 g/day). Estimates of fibrosis were calculated using the product of the interval between infection and biopsy and published rates of fibrosis progression. These estimates were compared with liver biopsies staged according to the Metavir system (F0-F4; F0 = no fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis).

The mean age of patients was 42 ± 8 years, 61% were male, and 36% consumed more than 50 g of alcohol daily. The mean duration of infection was 19 ± 9 years (range, 1–40), and ALT was elevated more than 1.5 times the upper normal limit in 63% of patients.

- **Study results**:
	- When patients were classified into those with mild (F0-F2) and severe (F3-F4) fibrosis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of an estimate of mild fibrosis were 60%, 55%, 78%, and 34%, respectively.
	- An estimate of severe fibrosis showed a sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 60%, positive predictive value of 34%, and negative predictive value of 78%.

Overall, there was an agreement between fibrosis estimates and liver biopsy staging.

### Alcoholic liver disease [^112Th1Mi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent type of chronic liver disease worldwide. ALD can progress from alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), which is characterized by hepatic inflammation. Chronic ASH can eventually lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, and in some cases, hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In addition, severe ASH, with or without cirrhosis, can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, which is an acute clinical presentation of ALD that is associated with liver failure and high mortality.

Most individuals consuming more than 40g of alcohol per day develop AFL; however, only a subset of individuals will develop more advanced disease. Genetic, epigenetic, and non-genetic factors might explain the considerable interindividual variation in the ALD phenotype. The pathogenesis of ALD includes hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, acetaldehyde-mediated toxicity, and cytokine- and chemokine-induced inflammation.

Diagnosis of ALD involves assessing patients for alcohol use disorder and signs of advanced liver disease. The degree of AFL and liver fibrosis can be determined by ultrasonography, transient elastography, MRI, measurement of serum biomarkers, and liver biopsy histology. Alcohol abstinence achieved by psychosomatic intervention is the best treatment for all stages of ALD. In the case of advanced disease such as cirrhosis or HCC, liver transplantation may be required. Thus, new therapies are urgently needed.

### Outpatient management of alcohol-related liver disease [^111zCJZZ]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease has become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States, partly due to an increase in the prevalence of high-risk drinking behavior and alcohol use disorder, particularly among young women. Achieving sustained alcohol abstinence might not only prevent the development and progression of alcohol-related liver disease but could also lead to clinically significant improvements, even in the advanced stages of the disease. In this series paper, we discuss the diagnosis and outpatient management of alcohol-related liver disease, with an emphasis on treatment options for alcohol use disorder and the assessment of nutritional status.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**:

	- **Vulnerability to opioid overdose**: After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc) if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment. Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them about this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).

	- There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of naltrexone hydrochloride. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on continuing opioid use, to override the effects of the drug.

### Treatment of alcohol use disorders in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^114bBu3X]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are one of the leading causes of disease and disability in almost all European countries. Among alcohol-related diseases, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most common. Presently, alcohol is the most frequent cause of liver cirrhosis in the Western world. The cornerstone of treatment for ALD is achieving total alcohol abstinence and preventing relapse, as medical and surgical treatments for ALD are limited when drinking continues. This narrative review summarizes treatments for AUDs, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of AUDs in patients with ALD.

- **Medical management, psychosocial and pharmacological interventions**: These interventions are analyzed, highlighting their limits and options in AUD patients.

- **Management setting for AUD patients with advanced liver disease**: The review discusses the most appropriate setting for managing these patients.

- **Indications for liver transplantation in AUD patients**: The review also addresses the indications for liver transplantation in AUD patients.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive management plan that includes measures to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following a naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours.

The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

- **Intravenous**: Inject 0.2 mg naloxone.
	- Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal.
	- If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone.
	- Observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NAFLD [^114SvcKf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting approximately a billion individuals. NAFLD is a slowly progressive disease that may evolve in a subset of patients toward cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. Liver fibrosis severity is the strongest predictor of clinical outcomes. The emergence of effective therapeutics highlights the need to identify patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, who are most at risk of developing complications, and to target them for therapy. Liver biopsy has been the reference standard for this purpose; however, it is not suitable for large-scale population evaluation due to its well-known limitations, such as invasiveness, rare but severe complications, and sampling variability. Hence, there have been significant efforts to develop simple noninvasive tools that can be utilized in routine clinical settings and drug development.

Noninvasive approaches are based on the quantification of biomarkers in serum samples or the measurement of liver stiffness using ultrasound- or magnetic resonance-based elastography techniques. This review provides a roadmap for the future development and integration of noninvasive tools in clinical practice and drug development in NAFLD. We discuss the principles for their development and validation and their use in clinical practice, including the diagnosis of NAFLD, risk stratification in primary care and hepatology settings, and prediction of long-term liver-related outcomes.

### Fibrosis and alcohol-related liver disease [^114wcZPU]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Histological fibrosis stage is one of the most important prognostic factors in compensated and decompensated alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). Morphological assessment of fibrosis is useful for patient stratification, enabling individualized management, and for evaluation of treatment effects in clinical studies. In contrast to most chronic liver diseases, where fibrosis is portal-based, fatty liver disease (FLD) of alcoholic or non-alcoholic etiology (NAFLD) is associated with a centrilobular pattern of injury which leads to perivenular fibrosis and/or pericellular fibrosis.

Progression of FLD drives expansive pericellular fibrosis, linking vascular structures and paving the way for the development of cirrhosis. At the cirrhotic stage, ongoing tissue damage leads to increasing fibrosis severity due to parenchymal loss and the proliferation of fibrous scars. Histologic fibrosis staging systems have been devised, based on topography and the extent of fibrosis, for most chronic liver diseases. The utility of histological staging is reflected in different risks associated with individual fibrosis stages, which cannot be reliably distinguished by non-invasive fibrosis assessment.

In contrast to NAFLD, ALD-specific staging systems that enable the standardized prognostication required for clinical management and trials are lacking. Although morphological similarities between NAFLD and ALD exist, differences in clinical and histological features may substantially limit the utility of established NAFLD-specific staging systems for prognostication in ALD. This review summarizes morpho…

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^1121xAxU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

NAFLD and NASH are increasingly recognized as significant causes of cirrhosis and its complications. In this context, the presence of multiple components of metabolic syndrome and advanced fibrosis are considered risk factors for liver-related mortality. Although weight loss through lifestyle modification can be effective and is always recommended, its efficacy is limited and not sustained.

While very few drug treatments are available for NASH, numerous clinical trials of pharmacological agents targeting one or more pathways in the pathogenesis of NASH are currently underway. Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of NASH, treatment options may require a combination of different drugs. Additionally, the duration of treatment may necessitate long-term maintenance. In this context, one could envision a short-term, intense 'induction' treatment regimen followed by a long-term, potentially lifelong maintenance regimen.

As we develop these regimens, it is crucial not only to establish their efficacy and safety but also to demonstrate improvement in patient-reported outcomes. Finally, these regimens must be cost-effective and provide long-term value to patients and society.

### Treatment of alcoholic liver disease [^114Ga5P5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major cause of liver-related mortality in the US and worldwide. The correct diagnosis of ALD can usually be made on a clinical basis in conjunction with blood tests, and a liver biopsy is not usually required. Abstinence is the hallmark of therapy for ALD, and nutritional therapy is the first line of therapeutic intervention. The role of steroids in patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis is gaining increasing acceptance, with the caveat that patients be evaluated for the effectiveness of therapy at one week. Pentoxifylline appears to be especially effective in ALD patients with renal dysfunction/hepatorenal syndrome. Biologics such as specific anti-TNFs have been disappointing and should probably not be used outside of the clinical trial setting. Transplantation is effective in patients with end-stage ALD who have stopped drinking (usually for ≥ 6 months), and both long-term graft and patient survival are excellent.

### Practical diagnosis of cirrhosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using currently available non-invasive fibrosis tests [^117V62YU]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Despite significant improvements, 43% of F4 patients from the validation set were included in the F34 group of our study algorithm, and therefore could not be differentiated from F3 patients. This subgroup of difficult-to-diagnose cirrhosis was expected, as no fibrosis tests could clearly delineate cirrhotic from non-cirrhotic patients. Because the probability of cirrhosis progressively increased with the results of each fibrosis test, we moved from the classical approach of a sequential use of fibrosis tests, which were interpreted with diagnostic thresholds and provided a final semi-quantitative classification, to a more quantitative approach. This new approach consists of a personalized assessment of the individual probability of cirrhosis based on the fibrosis test results.

The risk prediction charts we developed allow clinicians to choose their level of requirement, which may vary according to the clinical situation. For example, a physician may require a very low risk to exclude cirrhosis in a patient. Conversely, to include a patient in a clinical trial, a physician may accept a screen failure rate of 30%, indicating a 70% probability of cirrhosis. Such variability in choice is not possible with a sequential algorithm where test thresholds are fixed, emphasizing the high interest in our risk prediction charts for clinical practice. Finally, this risk assessment approach aligns with the personalized medicine models developed in other medical specialties, such as cardiovascular prediction.

### Current and future therapeutic regimens for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^116YigZq]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are rapidly becoming among the top causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and indications for liver transplantation. Other than lifestyle modification through diet and exercise, there are currently no approved treatments for NASH/NAFLD. Although weight loss can be effective, it is difficult to achieve and sustain. In contrast, bariatric surgery can improve metabolic conditions associated with NAFLD and has been shown to improve liver histology.

To have approved regimens for the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, several issues must be addressed. First, all stakeholders must agree on the most appropriate clinical trial endpoints for NASH. Currently, resolution of NASH (without worsening fibrosis) or reduction of fibrosis stage (without worsening NASH) are the accepted endpoints by the regulatory authorities. It is important to recognize the prognostic implication of histologic features of NASH. Although histologic NASH has been associated with advanced fibrosis, it is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality. In contrast, there are significant data to suggest that fibrosis stage is the only robust and independent predictor of liver-related mortality.

In addition to the primary endpoints, several important secondary endpoints, including noninvasive biomarkers, long-term outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes, must be considered. In 2018, a few phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of NASH have been initiated.

### Alcohol-associated liver disease: Integrated management with alcohol use disorder [^111g1tAh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in many regions worldwide. Around 75% of patients with cirrhosis are unaware of their disease until they are referred to the emergency department. An innovative, non-invasive screening approach is required for an earlier diagnosis of liver fibrosis. In patients with ALD, the physician is inevitably dealing with two major disorders: the liver disease itself and the alcohol use disorder (AUD). Focusing only on the liver disease will inevitably lead to failure because transient improvements in liver function are rapidly overturned if the patient returns to alcohol consumption.

For this reason, integrated models of care provided by hepatologists and addiction specialists are an effective approach; however, they are not widely available. There are multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies for AUD. Progress has recently been made in the management of patients with severe alcohol hepatitis (AH) who have improved survival through a better understanding of the concept of response to medical treatment, improved survival prediction, and the advent of early liver transplantation.

The emerging concept is that listing for transplantation a patient with severe ALD could lead to adjusting the duration of abstinence according to the severity and evolution of liver dysfunction and the patient's addictive profile.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114Maziq]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ideally, second-stage non-invasive testing should be delivered in the community to reduce unnecessary referrals to secondary care for individuals with a false positive simple NIT. However, where these services are unavailable in the community, patients should be referred to secondary services for further workup.

The overwhelming majority of liver-related complications in patients with NAFLD occur in those with cirrhosis. Non-invasive tests (NITs) have high negative predictive values for advanced fibrosis and can reliably exclude the presence of cirrhosis. Long-term follow-up studies have shown that patients with low-risk NITs have a very low risk of liver-related events in the short to medium term. Their main morbidity lies in cardiovascular disease and non-hepatic malignancy. One recent long-term follow-up study of 1,057 patients demonstrated that individuals with NAFLD and a FIB-4 score < 1.3 had a very low incidence rate for liver-related events, recording 2.6 per 1,000 patient years. Therefore, for these patients, the focus should be on lifestyle advice and cardiovascular risk reduction, aiming to improve their overall quality and length of life.

NAFLD can progress to advanced fibrosis in a significant proportion of patients in the medium term, especially those with, or who develop, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those who gain weight. Individuals with these risk factors should be targeted for proactive lifestyle modification, optimized treatment for T2DM, and cardiovascular risk reduction. Accordingly, manage those at low risk of significant liver-related events by focusing on lifestyle and cardiovascular interventions.

### Rates of and factors associated with placebo response in trials of pharmacotherapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MuCvz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

It is important to understand the extent of the placebo effect in designing randomized controlled trials for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to accurately calculate sample sizes and define treatment endpoints.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the placebo groups from randomized controlled trials of adults with NASH that provided histologic and/or magnetic resonance image-based assessments. Trials were identified through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus, from each database's inception through January 2, 2018.

- **Results**: We identified 39 randomized controlled trials, comprising 1,463 patients who received placebo. Histologic assessment data (the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores, NAS) were available from 956 patients; magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were available from 295 patients and magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction measurements from 61 patients. Overall, 25% of patients given placebo had an improvement in NAS by 2 or more points (95% CI, 21%-29%) with a small amount of heterogeneity (I² = 27%). Improvements were observed in steatosis scores of 33% ± 3% of patients, in hepatocyte ballooning scores of 30% ± 3% of patients, in lobular inflammation scores of 32% ± 3% of patients, and in fibrosis scores of 21% ± 3% of patients, with a moderate amount of heterogeneity among trials (I² range, 51%-63%). Patients given placebo had a statistically significant improvement in NAS (by 0.72 ± 0.19), with a large degree of improvement.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^115Rq5w5]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Liver biopsy has long been an important tool for assessing the degree of liver fibrosis. Information on the presence and degree of liver fibrosis is useful before making therapeutic decisions or predicting disease outcomes. The need to stage liver fibrosis, however, should decrease as treatment options become more successful, as has occurred with viral hepatitis. In recent years, noninvasive tests have demonstrated a reasonable ability to identify significant fibrosis, particularly cirrhosis, and it is not surprising that liver disease specialists and patients favor a noninvasive approach. However, only those tests with the highest diagnostic accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and availability should be implemented. Apart from their diagnostic accuracy, the potential ability of these tests to predict disease outcomes, a more relevant endpoint, should be compared with that of liver biopsy. Indeed, the use of a standardized system to evaluate the utility of biomarkers would facilitate their implementation in clinical practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol-related liver disease, and more specifically with respect to the assessment of liver fibrosis, AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend the use of blood and imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment as the initial tests. These tests are intended to detect significant to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis before considering liver biopsy for assessing fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver disease. The guidelines recognize that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard.

### Evaluation of liver fibrosis: "Something old, something new… " [^114eadTQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatic fibrosis is a central pathological healing process in progressive chronic liver disease. For many years, fibrosis was thought to be irreversible. The first notion of the regression of liver fibrosis appeared in the medical literature in 1979 when Perez-Tamayo, analyzing the activity of liver collagenase, presented data supporting that cirrhosis could be reversible. During the last three decades, fibrosis has been widely accepted as a dynamic process with a strong potential for significant resolution. Substantial evidence originated from data showing that successful treatment of the underlying liver disorders could reverse fibrosis and probably even cirrhosis.

Moreover, the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver injury and insights into fibrogenesis led to the development of novel therapeutic approaches and advanced drug targets, especially for patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (CHB) or C (CHC). Scientific attention is currently focused on new anti-fibrotic therapies, aiming at fibrosis reversibility and cirrhosis regression. It is therefore important, now more than ever, to ensure accurate and prompt assessment of hepatic fibrosis in therapeutic trials of chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy still remains the reference for assessing fibrosis, but it is now accepted that it is not a "gold standard". The dynamic process of fibrosis should be best measured as a continuous variable, and classical histological staging systems do not permit this.

### Rezdiffra [^114yiN9z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 8 presents the Month 12 histopathology results comparing REZDIFFRA with placebo, evaluating two key outcomes: the percentage of patients with resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening liver fibrosis, and the percentage of patients with at least one stage improvement in liver fibrosis without worsening steatohepatitis. Two pathologists, Pathologist A and Pathologist B, independently analyzed the liver biopsies for each patient. Both the 80 mg once daily and the 100 mg once daily dosages of REZDIFFRA exhibited improvement on these histopathology endpoints at Month 12 compared to placebo. A statistical analysis incorporating the independent readings from both pathologists indicated that REZDIFFRA achieved statistical significance on both histopathology endpoints for both doses.

An examination of age, gender, diabetes status (Yes or No), and fibrosis stage (F2 or F3) subgroups did not reveal differences in response to REZDIFFRA among these subgroups. The majority of patients in the trial were white (89%); there were too few patients of other races to adequately assess differences in response by race.

Beginning at Month 3 and continuing through Month 12, there was a trend of greater reductions from baseline in average ALT and AST levels in the REZDIFFRA groups compared to the placebo group.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^1178wBgh]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent cause of advanced liver disease in Europe and is the leading cause of death among adults with excessive alcohol consumption. There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of ALD. The relative risk of cirrhosis increases in subjects who consume more than 25 g/day. The burden of alcohol-attributable liver cirrhosis and liver cancer is high and entirely preventable. Health agencies should develop population-based policies to reduce the prevalence of harmful and/or hazardous alcohol consumption and foster research in this field to provide new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Disease progression of patients with ALD is heavily influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.

Non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis have opened new perspectives in the early detection of advanced ALD in asymptomatic patients. Alcoholic hepatitis, the most severe form of ALD, carries a high short-term mortality (around 30–50% at 3 months). Corticosteroids improve short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, but the duration of therapy should be adapted to early response. Liver transplantation is the best option for patients with severe liver dysfunction. However, alcohol relapse after transplantation remains a critical issue, and the drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened.

### Rifaximin-α for liver fibrosis in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (GALA-RIF): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113g32yy]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

GALA-RIF, an 18-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, showed that rifaximin-α did not lead to the regression of liver fibrosis in patients with biopsy-confirmed alcohol-related liver disease. However, rifaximin-α seemed to reduce the progression of liver fibrosis, possibly due to the attenuation of liver inflammation, despite a higher self-reported alcohol consumption in the rifaximin-α group during the trial. Our results suggest that rifaximin-α might be beneficial in patients with asymptomatic alcohol-related liver disease by preventing progression to decompensated cirrhosis.

Alcohol-related liver disease is the most prevalent cause of cirrhosis in the United States and Europe, and liver fibrosis is the main prognostic factor contributing to liver-related morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, non-invasive tests such as transient elastography and blood-based biomarkers have allowed for the early identification of liver fibrosis in patients with asymptomatic alcohol-related liver disease. This has facilitated a rapidly growing need for pharmaceutical treatments that can prevent progression to cirrhosis. In this trial, 550 mg of rifaximin-α twice daily over 18 months significantly reduced the progression rate of liver fibrosis in the per-protocol population, with a number needed to treat of six. Furthermore, rifaximin-α seemed to reduce histological hepatic inflammation and improved non-invasive markers of fibrosis, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. The gut microbiome and gut-barrier function are altered in patients with alcohol-related liver disease.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^115uBT5n]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment for MASLD.

Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factors. A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes.

In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification — including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise, and discouraging alcohol consumption — as well as optimal management of comorbidities, including the use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated, is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorder in patients with end-stage alcoholic liver disease [^112hYRw7]. Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Between 14% and 30% of the world's population is affected by alcohol use disorder (AUD), with excessive alcohol consumption being the most common cause of liver disease in the Western world. The clinical picture of alcoholic end-stage liver disease is extremely complex, as manifestations such as alcohol withdrawal syndrome, craving, and physical dependence, alongside extrahepatic alcohol-related diseases, merge with the complications of advanced cirrhosis. This complexity renders AUD recognition and assessment difficult, and its management arduous, as many drugs commonly used to treat complications like alcohol withdrawal syndrome are often contraindicated by the presence of hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.

Achieving and maintaining abstinence is the mainstay of managing patients with AUD and end-stage liver disease. Psychosocial interventions are an essential component of treatment to achieve these goals. However, these interventions alone often prove insufficient in AUD patients, and even more so in those with end-stage liver disease due to inadequate adherence resulting from poor functional and physical status. Pharmacological treatments need to be associated, but options are greatly limited in end-stage liver disease because many GABA-ergic drugs can favor the development of hepatic encephalopathy, and drugs undergoing extensive liver metabolism should be avoided or used with the greatest caution. Because of these limitations, managing end-stage AUD is extremely challenging and requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach.

### The natural history of alcohol-related liver disease [^1174n6dr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) in light of recent data that synthesize existing knowledge on this topic and outline new research cohorts to enhance our understanding of progression and outcomes in ArLD.

Recent findings indicate that ArLD occurs after reaching a certain threshold of alcohol consumption. However, the presence of comorbid factors, particularly obesity, lowers this threshold. The most common stage of ArLD is alcohol-related steatosis, which is associated with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (3% per year). Non-liver-related morbidity is more likely (4% versus 1% per year). In contrast, alcohol-related steatohepatitis or cirrhosis poses a greater risk, with higher rates of both non-liver and liver-related mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs at approximately 3% per year among people with ArLD cirrhosis.

These findings enable a better understanding of ArLD to accurately counsel patients and guide public health policies. Awareness of the limitations of the available data, as highlighted in a recent systematic review, should inform the design of further research. This research should focus on the multiple interacting factors that may cause ArLD to regress or progress.

### Cirrhosis improvement to alcoholic liver fibrosis after passive abstinence [^115CyLEV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We present a rare case of long-term alcoholic liver disease that progressed from alcoholic liver fibrosis to alcoholic liver cirrhosis, and following passive abstinence, the patient's condition improved to alcoholic liver fibrosis. A 70-year-old Japanese man who had consumed large amounts of alcohol since he was 20 years old received a liver biopsy at the age of 48, in 1991, for the evaluation of liver dysfunction. The biopsy indicated alcoholic liver fibrosis, stage 2. Eight years later, a second biopsy indicated alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The patient continued to drink until a cerebral haemorrhage in 2000 led to left hemiparesis. Thereafter, he had to accept passive abstinence. He received follow-up liver biopsies in 2001 and 2002, both of which indicated improvement of the fibrosis.

### Rifaximin-α for liver fibrosis in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (GALA-RIF): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113Czjpy]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol is the leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide. The gut–liver axis is considered a key driver in alcohol-related liver disease. Rifaximin-α improves gut-barrier function and reduces systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rifaximin-α with placebo in patients with alcohol-related liver disease.

GALA-RIF was an investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, phase 2 trial conducted at Odense University Hospital in Denmark. Eligible participants were adults (aged 18–75 years) who had a history of alcohol overuse (at least 1 year with ≥ 24 g of alcohol per day for women and ≥ 36 g of alcohol per day for men), biopsy-proven alcohol-related liver disease, and no previous hepatic decompensation. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) through a web-based randomisation system to receive oral rifaximin-α (550 mg) twice daily or matched placebo for 18 months. Randomisation was done in blocks of four and stratified according to fibrosis stage and alcohol abstinence. Participants, sponsors, investigators, and nurses involved in the study were masked to the randomisation outcome.

- **Primary endpoint**: A histological decrease from baseline to 18-month treatment of at least one fibrosis stage, according to the Kleiner fibrosis score. The study also assessed the number of patients with progression by at least one fibrosis stage from baseline to 18 months. Primary analyses were done in the per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat populations; safety was also evaluated.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^115ntJca]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The widely accepted European definition of NAFLD emphasizes the absence of excessive alcohol consumption (stated as ≥ 30 g per day for men and ≥ 20 g per day for women), and a quantitative alcohol history is essential for diagnosis. Patients with NAFLD should have a regular reassessment of their alcohol consumption. There are additive and synergistic interactions between alcohol and cardiometabolic risk factors in the progression of fatty liver disease. Much of the evidence linking alcohol to health outcomes relies on cohort studies where alcohol consumption was measured only once at baseline. However, it is recognized that alcohol consumption fluctuates widely over the life course. In view of this, we recommend that patients with NAFLD should have a quantitative alcohol history taken at regular intervals.

The transition from compensated to decompensated disease is associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality. In people with alcohol-related liver disease, continued drinking is a stronger risk factor for decompensation than any histological or laboratory parameters. Both alcohol use and obesity have been shown to correlate with the progression of portal hypertension in chronic liver disease.

In patients with NAFLD who do not have cirrhosis, the 2016 NICE clinical guideline reported insufficient evidence to restrict alcohol consumption beyond the national recommended advisory limits. However, alcohol can be a source of additional dietary calories, and minimizing use may avoid further weight gain.

### Evaluation of liver fibrosis: "Something old, something new… " [^113MEQUz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In the past decade, several non-invasive methods for assessing hepatic fibrosis have been published, resulting in more non-invasive tests than histologic scoring systems. These non-invasive tests were introduced to estimate the likelihood of advanced liver fibrosis in patients with chronic viral liver disease at presentation and on follow-up to assess fibrosis regression post-treatment. These tests were later applied in alcoholic (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

There are three general categories of non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis: 1) serologic panels or tests; 2) combinations with other serum tests and/or clinical features (such as age and gender) in complex algorithms; and 3) imaging-based techniques. Today, non-invasive methods are widely available. Their most important advantages are the absence of contraindications and dangerous complications for the patients, and their reproducibility. In contrast to liver biopsy, many non-invasive methods can effectively evaluate fibrosis extent in the whole organ, not only in a part of it. Their potential ability to identify and differentiate between advanced fibrosis stages, the high specificity and sensitivity to diagnose cirrhosis, and their easy application make them a useful tool in daily clinical practice. Their role becomes more significant because their diagnostic accuracy can be increased if they are combined, i.e. a serological panel may be used in conjunction with an imaging technique.

Campral® is indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at the initiation of treatment. Treatment with Campral should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support.

The efficacy of Campral in promoting abstinence has not been demonstrated in subjects who have not undergone detoxification and not achieved alcohol abstinence prior to beginning Campral treatment. The efficacy of Campral in promoting abstinence from alcohol in polysubstance abusers has not been adequately assessed.

### Extended-release naltrexone/bupropion and liver health: Pooled, post hoc analysis from four randomized controlled trials [^111F1wcY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Sustained weight loss improves liver histology in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This post hoc analysis of four phase III, 56-week, randomized controlled trials investigated if extended-release naltrexone and bupropion (NB) affects alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index in adults with overweight or obesity. Two thousand and seventy-three subjects (NB = 1310; placebo = 763; 79.0% female; 81.6% Caucasian) had a baseline mean weight of 101 kg, body mass index of 36.2 kg/m², ALT of 26.9 IU/L, and FIB-4 of 0.79. At 56 weeks, NB-treated subjects experienced more weight loss than the placebo group (8.7 vs. 3.2 kg, respectively, P < 0.0001). Weight loss, independent of treatment, was associated with improved ALT and FIB-4 (P < 0.0001). There was a significant independent effect of NB on change from baseline for FIB-4 (P < 0.0001), but not for ALT (P = 0.54).

Categorical ALT response (from above to within normal ranges: 10–40 IU/L for men; 7–35 IU/L for women) and achievement of 25% and 50% reduction in ALT were greater for NB versus placebo and were independently affected by weight loss (P < 0.0001), but not by the treatment. NB-associated weight loss may improve liver health by normalizing ALT values for those with high baseline levels.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1143Uras]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed. In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1175mSjp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not using oral naltrexone for the treatment of OUD except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence. Its use should be reserved for patients who can comply with special techniques to enhance adherence, such as observed dosing. It is recognized that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces but does not eliminate issues with medication adherence.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^111TpW3i]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis treatment includes nonpharmacological options. Currently, lifestyle modification is the first-line recommendation for the treatment of NASH. In this context, lifestyle modification should lead to sustained weight loss. Although diet and exercise can lead to weight loss, less than 15% of patients can maintain the weight loss in the long run. Furthermore, a small amount of weight loss (3–5%) can lead to improvement of hepatic steatosis. On the other hand, 7–10% weight loss is required to see improvement in necroinflammation and fibrosis in NASH.

Additionally, exercise may also play a beneficial role. It was recently shown that either aerobic or resistance exercise, in moderate intensity, 3–4 times a week, 20–40 minutes per session, is ideal for fat mobilization from the liver. It should be noted that increased physical activity should be accompanied by a healthier diet in order to achieve the desired goals. As noted previously, the sustainability of weight loss through lifestyle modification is quite limited.

### Long-acting injectable naltrexone induction: A randomized trial of outpatient opioid detoxification with naltrexone versus buprenorphine [^116qwbph]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). High credibility.

At present, there is no established optimal approach for transitioning opioid-dependent adults to extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) while preventing relapse. This study conducted a trial to examine the efficacy of two methods of outpatient opioid detoxification for induction to XR-naltrexone.

Participants were 150 opioid-dependent adults randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of two outpatient detoxification regimens: naltrexone-assisted detoxification or buprenorphine-assisted detoxification, followed by an injection of XR-naltrexone.

- **Naltrexone-assisted detoxification**: This lasted 7 days and included a single day of buprenorphine followed by ascending doses of oral naltrexone along with clonidine and other adjunctive medications.
- **Buprenorphine-assisted detoxification**: This included a 7-day buprenorphine taper followed by a week-long delay before administration of XR-naltrexone, consistent with official prescribing information for XR-naltrexone.

Participants from both groups received behavioral therapy focused on medication adherence and a second dose of XR-naltrexone.

Compared with participants in the buprenorphine-assisted detoxification condition, participants assigned to naltrexone-assisted detoxification were significantly more likely to be successfully inducted to XR-naltrexone (56.1% compared with 32.7%) and to receive the second injection at week 5 (50.0% compared with 26.9%). Both models adjusted for primary type of opioid use, route of opioid administration, and morphine equivalents at baseline.

These results demonstrate that naltrexone-assisted detoxification is more effective in preparing opioid-dependent individuals for long-term treatment with XR-naltrexone compared to buprenorphine-assisted detoxification.

### Does knowledge of liver fibrosis affect high-risk drinking behaviour (KLIFAD): an open-label pragmatic feasibility randomised controlled trial [^115xGPjo]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

While the study was not powered to show a statistical difference in key indicators of behavior change related to alcohol intake, there were very promising trends. At six months, the intervention group was more likely to reduce or stop drinking and reduce the AUDIT category compared to the control group. In the intervention group, 41% reduced the AUDIT category to a level that no longer indicated alcohol use disorder, compared to 21% in the control group. The finding of normal or elevated liver stiffness did not lead to unintended negative effects such as an exacerbation in alcohol consumption. This study suggests that biomarker feedback may improve outcomes, and there is an increasing body of data supporting this. A recent systematic review suggested that providing feedback to patients based on markers of liver injury is an effective way to reduce harmful alcohol intake.

A feasibility study invited 1,128 individuals with hazardous or harmful drinking from nine primary care practices in the UK to have a liver fibrosis test using the Southampton Traffic Light (STL) test; of them, 38% (n = 393) attended to have STL. The follow-up AUDIT score at 8–12 months was available for 77% (303); 50% (n = 76/153) with evidence of liver damage reduced drinking, compared to 35% (n = 52/150) without liver damage. A prospective cohort control study invited 156 individuals who self-identify as high-risk drinkers and presented to community alcohol services to have liver fibrosis tested using TE. Of the invited individuals, 56% (n = 87) attended TE appointments, and 38% had raised LSM.

### Mechanisms of synergy between alcohol and hepatitis C virus [^111Zdsms]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), extensive literature has emerged on alcohol and HCV interaction.

- **Goal**: To understand the impact of alcohol and HCV infection on the severity of liver disease and the mechanisms of interaction between the two.

- **Study**: Of 1269 articles (1991 to 2006) searched through MEDLINE and cited cross-references, 133 were thoroughly reviewed to assess:

- **Prevalence** of combined alcohol use and HCV
- **Severity** of liver disease
- **Treatment** response
- **Mechanisms** of interaction between HCV and alcohol

Data on study design, patient demographics, diagnostic tests used, and study outcomes were extracted for critical analysis.

- **Results**: Prevalence of HCV is 3-fold to 30-fold higher in alcoholics compared with the general population. Patients with HCV infection and alcohol abuse develop more severe fibrosis with a higher rate of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer compared with nondrinkers. Increased oxidative stress seems to be the dominant mechanism for this synergism between alcohol and the HCV. Abstinence is the key to the management of liver disease due to HCV and alcohol. Data have shown that lower response rates to interferon in alcoholics with HCV infection are likely due to noncompliance.

- **Conclusions**: Alcoholics with HCV infection have more severe liver disease compared with nondrinkers. Patients should be encouraged to enroll in rehabilitation programs to improve treatment adherence and response.

### Alcohol consumption in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Convenient vs. inconvenient truths [^117FER9J]. American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the role of modest alcohol consumption in patients with non-alcohol induced fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains a significant challenge, with no clear guidance on counseling regarding alcohol use. Conventionally, the strong association of alcohol excess and the development of complications related to chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has led practitioners to advocate complete abstinence for those with NAFLD. New evidence published in this issue of the Red Journal challenges this historic paradigm by showing that modest, non-binge wine consumption (< 70g/week) is associated with a significantly lower risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis on biopsy compared with complete abstinence. This finding comes from a well-characterized single-center cohort of nearly 200 patients with NAFLD.

### Rifaximin-α for liver fibrosis in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (GALA-RIF): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^111UbTUw]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

We identified potential participants from a clinical study that screened for alcohol-related liver fibrosis in individuals from primary and secondary care who had alcohol overuse. This was defined as consuming 24 g or more per day for at least 1 year in women, and 36 g or more per day for at least 1 year for men. Sex was identified through medical records. Patients with a history of hepatic decompensation or any known liver disease were excluded. Based on the screening results, patients at risk of having liver fibrosis underwent a liver biopsy. We included patients aged 18 to 75 years with liver fibrosis and histological features consistent with alcohol-related liver disease based on the histological assessment of liver biopsy samples.

In the protocol, patients were required to have an Ishak score of 1–4 for liver fibrosis on biopsies. However, in an amendment of the study protocol, we replaced the Ishak score with the Kleiner score for fibrosis (F1–F4) because no accepted fibrosis grading system for alcohol-related liver disease existed at the time of the study initiation. Since then, European guidelines on the management of alcohol-related liver disease proposed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) scoring systems as alternatives for fibrosis staging due to the large histological overlap between alcohol-related liver disease and NAFLD. For participant inclusion, we used the histological assessment by the on-call pathologist at the hospital. Women of child-bearing potential were required to use a safe contraceptive and provide a negative pregnancy test.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^113wevFS]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major indication for liver transplantation worldwide. Patients needing a transplant due to ALD often present at the time of transplantation with multisystemic effects of long-term ethanol abuse. These comorbidities include malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, non-immune hemolytic anemia, peripheral and central nervous system abnormalities, nephropathy, muscle wasting due to alcoholic myopathy, and others. Therefore, the integral care of the transplanted patient with ALD ideally requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Most liver programs require a six-month period of abstinence prior to the evaluation of alcoholic patients. The rationale for this strategy is to allow disease regression in patients with recent alcohol abstinence and to ensure proper alcohol counseling to prevent relapse after liver transplantation. As with other causes of decompensated liver disease, patients are listed if the MELD score is ≥ 15. In patients with ALD, the survival benefit among transplant recipients arises only from this threshold. Alcohol abstinence is a critical issue, and the drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened by physicians using tools of proven reliability. However, there is no consensus concerning the definition of alcohol relapse. For some experts, any drinking is considered a relapse, whereas others define excessive drinking as a relapse because only this drinking pattern is associated with alcohol-induced liver injury.
