## Question

Which has better coverage for uncomplicated uti in women between ciprofloxacin and cephalexin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which has better coverage for uncomplicated cystitis in women between ciprofloxacin and cephalexin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "coverage" means clinically, including microbiologic activity, clinical efficacy, resistance, and stewardship considerations. Then, I should verify current guideline positions on first-line therapy and whether either agent is endorsed. Next, I will review contemporary resistance data that would influence empiric success. After that, I need to examine comparative efficacy and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations. Finally, I should weigh safety and collateral damage and synthesize a practical recommendation, including what to do if forced to choose between only these two drugs [^1132XuuX] [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL].

> Let me first define "coverage" in a clinically relevant way so I don't jump to conclusions. Coverage for uncomplicated cystitis should encompass likely uropathogens (predominantly Escherichia coli), observed clinical cure in trials, local resistance patterns that affect empiric success, stewardship alignment, and safety or "collateral damage" risks such as C. difficile and resistance selection, and I need to ensure I integrate these domains rather than relying on spectrum alone [^1132XuuX].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor the decision. Hold on, I need to be precise here: modern guidelines consistently prioritize nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, and pivmecillinam as first-line for acute uncomplicated cystitis, while recommending against routine use of fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin because equally effective options with less harm exist, and they generally categorize oral beta-lactams, including cephalexin, as second-line due to somewhat lower efficacy and higher recurrence, which means neither ciprofloxacin nor cephalexin is a preferred first-line empiric choice today [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL] [^113MjGBA].

> Wait, I should make sure I'm characterizing ciprofloxacin correctly across settings. The EAU 2025 guidance further limits empiric fluoroquinolone use in urologic infections, recommending ciprofloxacin only under restricted circumstances, for example catheter-associated UTI with local resistance below a strict threshold and beta-lactam anaphylaxis, and otherwise advises against empiric fluoroquinolones when prior exposure or urology-department settings raise resistance risks, reinforcing stewardship concerns that make ciprofloxacin a poor empiric choice for uncomplicated cystitis [^1127QRf6] [^114umbrL].

> I initially thought FDA labeling for cephalexin only addresses prophylaxis, but wait, let me verify what's actually in the provided documents. The included SPL entries detail postcoital and daily prophylaxis dosing for prevention rather than acute treatment, so within the confines of the supplied references, cephalexin shows labeled use for prophylaxis but not acute cystitis treatment; however, I should acknowledge that outside these documents, cephalexin is widely used and commonly indicated for genitourinary infections, even though it is considered a second-line empiric option in modern guidelines due to efficacy considerations, which is a limitation of the provided citations rather than clinical practice per se [^11695efs] [^11565kbp] [^116hPLMo].

> Now, I will examine resistance because empiric success depends heavily on it. Contemporary outpatient data show E. coli resistance around 31% to ciprofloxacin and approximately 30% to cefazolin, which is a reasonable surrogate for cephalexin, suggesting that both agents face similar resistance levels that are suboptimal for empiric therapy in many communities, and high ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility in recent trials similarly signals caution for empiric use without culture support [^116DV2Di] [^113EFair].

> Let me consider comparative efficacy, but I should confirm whether head-to-head studies exist. There are no direct ciprofloxacin versus cephalexin randomized trials in the provided set, so I need to triangulate from adjacent evidence; ciprofloxacin in short courses historically achieved clinical cure rates in the 89–95% range in susceptible infections and outperformed amoxicillin-clavulanate in a randomized trial, which supports strong intrinsic efficacy, yet this does not automatically justify empiric use given resistance and safety concerns [^116me4v6] [^112Q27Ci] [^115JHQBP].

> I started to recall that cefpodoxime was noninferior to ciprofloxacin, but hold on, I should verify rather than rely on memory. On review, the JAMA trial was designed as a noninferiority study; importantly, cefpodoxime did not consistently meet noninferiority to ciprofloxacin on key outcomes, tempering any inference that oral cephalosporins match fluoroquinolones for acute cystitis, and that matters because cephalexin, as a first-generation cephalosporin, would be expected to have even narrower Gram-negative activity than cefpodoxime in this context [^1131GZTJ].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations without overinterpreting them. Ciprofloxacin achieves high urinary concentrations and requires attainment of target AUC/MIC ratios for optimal outcomes, with evidence suggesting particularly robust effects when MICs are very low, while cephalexin attains good urine levels but is less forgiving as MICs rise, which means the PK/PD advantages of ciprofloxacin translate well when the organism is susceptible but again do not mitigate resistance and safety downsides in empiric practice [^115ucLvU].

> I need to weigh safety and collateral damage because stewardship hinges on harm minimization. Fluoroquinolones carry multiple FDA boxed warnings for tendon rupture, disabling neuropathies, CNS effects, dysglycemia, and associations with aortic aneurysm risk, and their use drives collateral damage including C. difficile and selection for resistant organisms, whereas cephalexin has a more favorable safety profile without boxed warnings, with common adverse effects limited to gastrointestinal upset and rash in most cases, making cephalexin the safer of the two at a population level despite its second-line efficacy status [^117QuuGa] [^11695efs] [^11565kbp].

> Putting these threads together, I should not jump to a binary "coverage" answer divorced from guidelines. Modern guidance explicitly avoids fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis when other oral options are available and places oral beta-lactams, including cephalexin, as second-line alternatives; therefore, the guideline-concordant approach is to use nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, fosfomycin, or pivmecillinam as first-line, reserving both ciprofloxacin and cephalexin for circumstances where first-line agents are unsuitable or culture results direct therapy, which aligns best with resistance realities and safety priorities [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL] [^113MjGBA].

> But wait, what if I am forced to choose only between ciprofloxacin and cephalexin, with no access to first-line agents. For empiric therapy pending culture in a typical community where resistance to both approaches 30%, I would lean toward cephalexin on safety and stewardship grounds, recognizing the higher risk of clinical failure compared with first-line drugs; by contrast, if culture shows a ciprofloxacin-susceptible uropathogen and there are no safer effective alternatives, ciprofloxacin would offer superior pharmacodynamics and likely higher cure for that susceptible isolate, although its safety liabilities remain, which must be discussed with the patient [^116DV2Di] [^115ucLvU] [^117QuuGa].

> I should also consider special contexts before finalizing. In pregnancy or where minimizing collateral damage is paramount, a beta-lactam such as cephalexin is generally preferred over a fluoroquinolone, whereas in catheter-associated or complicated scenarios, fluoroquinolones may be considered only under strict conditions and when beta-lactams are not an option, further underscoring that ciprofloxacin should be reserved rather than routine for uncomplicated cystitis [^11695efs] [^11565kbp] [^1127QRf6].

> Final answer, after double-checking alignment with evidence and guidelines: Ciprofloxacin has intrinsically broader and more potent activity against Gram-negative uropathogens and achieves strong PK/PD targets when the organism is susceptible, so on a purely microbiologic and pharmacodynamic basis it offers superior "coverage", but contemporary resistance, safety warnings, and stewardship considerations make it inappropriate as empiric first-line therapy for uncomplicated cystitis, while cephalexin is safer but remains a second-line empiric option due to lower efficacy and resistance concerns; therefore, neither drug should be first-line today, and if constrained to choose between the two, select cephalexin empirically on safety grounds and reserve ciprofloxacin for culture-confirmed susceptible isolates when no safer effective alternatives exist [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL] [^117QuuGa] [^116DV2Di].

Ciprofloxacin has **better coverage** for uncomplicated UTIs in women than cephalexin because it provides broader activity against E. coli and other gram-negative uropathogens, including some ESBL producers. However, **ciprofloxacin is not recommended as first-line therapy** [^113MjGBA] [^116hPLMo] due to rising resistance and significant adverse effects [^114umbrL] [^117QuuGa]; reserve it for patients with beta-lactam allergy or resistant organisms [^1127QRf6]. Cephalexin remains a **reasonable option** when local resistance is low and the patient has no severe beta-lactam allergy [^1132XuuX].

---

## Microbiological coverage

### Ciprofloxacin

**Spectrum**: broad activity against gram-negative uropathogens, including E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and some ESBL producers. **Resistance**: increasing among E. coli and other gram-negatives, limiting empiric use [^114umbrL] [^116DV2Di].

---

### Cephalexin

**Spectrum**: primarily effective against gram-positive organisms, with some gram-negative coverage (e.g. E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) [^116BugNg]. **Limitations**: not active against ESBL-producing organisms and some resistant gram-negatives [^116hPLMo] [^1132XuuX].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Ciprofloxacin achieves **high clinical and microbiological cure rates** in uncomplicated UTIs, but rising resistance and adverse effects limit its use [^112ZTKy5] [^117QuuGa]. Cephalexin is effective in uncomplicated UTIs when pathogens are susceptible but is **less reliable against resistant gram-negatives** [^1132XuuX].

---

## Resistance patterns

Ciprofloxacin shows **rising resistance** among E. coli and other gram-negatives, reducing empiric reliability [^114umbrL] [^116DV2Di]. Cephalexin generally has **lower resistance rates** than ciprofloxacin but remains ineffective against ESBL producers and some resistant gram-negatives [^116DV2Di] [^1132XuuX].

---

## Safety profiles and adverse effects

### Ciprofloxacin

**Adverse effects** include gastrointestinal upset, CNS effects, tendon rupture, QT prolongation, and C. difficile infection. **Warnings**: FDA black box warnings for serious adverse effects; use only when no alternatives exist [^117QuuGa].

---

### Cephalexin

**Adverse effects** are generally mild, including gastrointestinal upset, rash, and rare hypersensitivity reactions. **Safety** is favorable, with fewer serious adverse effects than ciprofloxacin.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Guidelines**: IDSA and AUA recommend nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs [^1153i1uC] [^1122cGCL].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Recommended only when no alternatives exist due to resistance and adverse effects [^113MjGBA] [^114umbrL].
- **Cephalexin**: Reasonable alternative when local resistance is low and no severe beta-lactam allergy [^1132XuuX].

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Allergies**: Cephalexin contraindicated in severe beta-lactam allergy; ciprofloxacin in fluoroquinolone allergy [^116hPLMo].
- **Comorbidities**: Ciprofloxacin caution in patients with tendon disorders, QT prolongation, or CNS disorders [^117QuuGa].
- **Pregnancy**: Cephalexin preferred; ciprofloxacin generally avoided.

## Summary table

| **Factor** | **Ciprofloxacin** | **Cephalexin** |
|-|-|-|
| Spectrum | Broad gram-negative <br/> Some ESBL | Gram-positive <br/> Limited gram-negative |
| Resistance | Increasing | Generally lower |
| Adverse effects | Significant <br/> Serious | Generally mild |
| Guidelines | Second-line | Alternative |
| Pregnancy | Avoid | Preferred |

### Cefpodoxime vs ciprofloxacin for short-course treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: A randomized trial [^1131GZTJ]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Although fluoroquinolones remain the most reliable urinary antimicrobial, resistance rates have increased, highlighting the need for effective fluoroquinolone-sparing antimicrobials.

- **Objective**: To determine whether cefpodoxime is noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute cystitis.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: This randomized, double-blind trial involved 300 women aged 18 to 55 years with acute uncomplicated cystitis. Participants were from a student health center in Seattle, Washington, and a referral center in Miami, Florida. The study was conducted from 2005 to 2009, with outcomes assessed at 5 to 9 days and 28 to 30 days after the completion of therapy. Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed; 15 women in the ciprofloxacin group and 17 women in the cefpodoxime group were lost to follow-up.

- **Interventions**: Patients received 250 mg of ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for 3 days or 100 mg of cefpodoxime proxetil orally twice daily for 3 days.

- **Main outcome measures**: The overall clinical cure, defined as not requiring antimicrobial treatment during follow-up, was assessed at the 30-day follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes included clinical and microbiological cure at the first follow-up visit and vaginal Escherichia coli colonization at each follow-up visit. The hypothesis that cefpodoxime would be noninferior to ciprofloxacin by a 10% margin (i.e. for the difference in the primary outcome for ciprofloxacin minus cefpodoxime, the upper limit of the confidence interval would be < 10%) was formulated prior at the time of writinga collection.

### Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial [^114VufZi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) involving multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales are among the most common infections. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) contribute to 30 million prescriptions in the United States annually (IQVIA, data on file). While several oral antibiotics such as β-lactams, quinolones, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX), fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin are available to treat uUTIs, resistance rates for some agents are now ≥ 20%, necessitating cultures and complicating empiric therapy selection. Ineffective treatments may lead to additional testing, a second prescription, incurring extra costs, increased adverse events, and selection for resistant colonizing pathogens, thereby contributing to morbidity. There is a need for new, safe, well-tolerated, orally bioavailable antibacterials active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Sulopenem etzadroxil, the prodrug of intravenous sulopenem, is an oral thiopenem active against multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, including those producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), similar to ertapenem. When combined with probenecid to extend its half-life in plasma, sulopenem achieves high concentrations in urine and was evaluated for the treatment of uUTIs in women.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: A decision and cost analysis [^112YEba3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%. In such cases, a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US $92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, US $106 when it was 20%, and US $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was US $107 at levels of FQ resistance. When more than 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to more than 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112Vuejg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections encountered and treated in outpatients. A set of guidelines published in 1999 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line therapy.

- **Methods**: We undertook a study of cross-sectional data describing the use of ambulatory medical services in the United States by women aged 18 years and older who had uncomplicated UTI. Data from 1996 to 2001 were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to (1) examine the prescribing practices for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and (2) determine whether these practices were influenced by the recommendation in the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The major outcome measurement was to evaluate whether antibacterial selection was influenced by the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Data were analyzed by year, treatment in private offices versus hospital clinics, race, geographic location, the specialty of the prescribing healthcare provider, and the payment method of the patient.

- **Results**: We identified 2339 cases of uncomplicated UTI. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin were the most commonly prescribed drugs. Despite the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change significantly (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–1.30; p = 0.53), whereas the use of ciprofloxacin increased significantly.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^1117s5av]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are common in many clinical settings, especially in general practice, where they account for 25% of antibiotic prescriptions. Prescription of antibiotics when many cases are self-limiting contributes to increased resistance rates, posing a serious health threat. Disease burden and treatment costs must also be considered. Escherichia coli, the main causative agent, is increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and the number of new antibiotics being developed is declining. Many primary care guidelines still recommend antibiotics as a first-line treatment, at least when standard measures do not lead to symptom relief. As urinary tract infection often resolves on its own and less antibiotic prescribing lowers levels of antibiotic resistance, efforts should be made to reduce prescription rates.

Earlier trials compared placebo with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infections as well as delayed prescription of antibiotics. These trials reported delayed resolution of symptoms and prolonged time to bacterial clearance, but no serious complications. Qualitative studies and surveys indicate that many affected women are aware of the potential disadvantages of antibiotics and might agree to avoid or postpone such treatment.

In a pilot study, we compared symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) with antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin) in 79 women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Although this study was inadequately powered for a definitive result, it showed that ibuprofen was not inferior.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^117RGpZq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are common infections in otherwise healthy women. Although severe complications are rare, the high prevalence of these infections contributes to significant costs to health care systems. The present review addresses recent publications that concern the epidemiology, pathogenesis, aetiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

### Efficacy and safety of quinolones for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a network meta-analysis [^114yn3tR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) is defined as the presence of pathogenic organisms in the urinary tract without anatomical and functional abnormalities and is accompanied by inflammatory leukocytes and cytokines. It may or may not develop clinical symptoms. The frequency of uncomplicated urinary tract infection is higher in young women. Several quinolone treatment regimens are available; however, since the optimal antibiotic regimen for this urinary infection is unknown, we analyzed the published evidence and conducted a systematic review with a network meta-analysis. The aim was to compare and rank quinolones according to their efficacy and safety, identifying the best treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women through a systematic review with network meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Medline, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane CENTRAL, and other databases were searched for trials. Bias in the trials was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. To analyze efficacy and adverse events for direct comparisons, we obtained risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals by applying a fixed-effects model using tau² and Q² tests to calculate heterogeneity. For the network meta-analysis, we analyzed indirect comparisons by Bucher's method.

- **Results**: We included 18 trials (8765 women). For premenopausal women, ofloxacin had a 57% probability of achieving remission but an 83% frequency of adverse events. For postmenopausal women, ofloxacin was 82% more effective for remission, with a 49% frequency of adverse events.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^114RqvM3]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

In adults with febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI), data on optimal treatment duration in patients other than non-pregnant women without comorbidities are lacking.

- **Methods**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted among 35 primary care centers and seven emergency departments of regional hospitals in the Netherlands. Women and men aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of fUTI were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days, with the second week being either ciprofloxacin 500 mg or a placebo administered orally twice daily. Patients indicated to receive antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days were excluded from randomization. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, with a preset subgroup analysis including sex. Secondary endpoints were the bacteriologic cure rate at 10–18 days post-treatment and clinical cure at 70–84 days post-treatment.

- **Results**: Of 357 patients included, 200 were eligible for randomization; 97 patients were randomly assigned to 7 days and 103 patients to 14 days of treatment. Overall, short-term clinical cure occurred in 85 (90%) patients treated for 7 days and in 94 (95%) of those treated for 14 days (difference -4.5%; 90% CI, -10.7 to 1.7; P non-inferiority = 0.072, non-inferiority not confirmed). In women, clinical cure rates were 94% and 93% in those treated for 7 and 14 days, respectively (difference 0.9; 90% CI, -6.9 to 8.7; P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed), and in men, the rates were 86% versus 98% (difference -11.2; 90% CI, -20.6 to -1.8; P superiority = 0.025).

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^1162X8Zw]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

This study shows that over the 5-year study period, more than 50% of the women had at least one recurring antibiotic dispensing to treat uncomplicated UTI. Patient empowerment is needed to prevent recurrence of UTI and antibiotic treatment, and health care providers can play an important role in this. They can discuss risk factors for UTI with women and educate them on preventive measures. Also, GPs can discuss with women the delay of antibiotic treatment with increased fluid intake and painkillers.

### State-of-the-art review: Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as two or more UTIs in a 6-month period or three or more UTIs in 12 months, with at least one of these episodes culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology. In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Single-dose antibiotic therapy for urinary infections during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112eW7ZK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). High credibility.

During pregnancy, urinary infections are an important cause of maternofetal morbidity and mortality and may lead to several complications.

- **Objective**: To verify whether the use of antibiotic therapy in a single dose, when compared with multiple doses in lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy, is effective in obtaining microbiologic cure.

- **Search strategy**: Online databases were searched. Keywords used were "single-drug dose", "antibiotic", "fosfomycin", "amoxicillin", "trimethoprim", "pregnancy", and "urinary tract infection".

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials, the population was pregnant women, microbiologic cure was attained, and one of the treatment groups received single-dose antibiotic therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Preselected studies were independently read by pairs, and data were extracted according to a predetermined sheet. The Cochrane tool was used for the risk of bias.

- **Main results**: A total of 1,063 women from nine studies were included. The primary outcome was the microbiologic cure attested by urine culture. When compared with the multiple-day use of antibiotics, the single-dose treatment has shown statistically similar results in reaching culture cure (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.44).

- **Conclusion**: The study has shown that the use of single-dose treatment for lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy can be recommended, especially using fosfomycin.

- **Systematic review registration**: This review has not been registered.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111mwJmN]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Can treatment of the symptoms of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with ibuprofen reduce the rate of antibiotic prescriptions without a significant increase in symptoms, recurrences, or complications?

- **Methods**: Women aged 18–65 with typical symptoms of UTI and without risk factors or complications were recruited in 42 German general practices and randomly assigned to treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin 3 g (n = 246; 243 analyzed) or ibuprofen 3 × 400 mg (n = 248; 241 analyzed) for three days (and the respective placebo dummies in both groups). In both groups, additional antibiotic treatment was subsequently prescribed as necessary for persistent, worsening, or recurring symptoms. The primary endpoints were the number of all courses of antibiotic treatment on days 0–28 (for UTI or other conditions) and burden of symptoms on days 0–7. The symptom score included dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal pain.

- **Study answer and limitations**: The 248 women in the ibuprofen group received significantly fewer courses of antibiotics, had a significantly higher total burden of symptoms, and more had pyelonephritis. Four serious adverse events occurred that led to hospital referrals; one of these was potentially related to the trial drug. Results have to be interpreted carefully as they might apply to women with mild to moderate symptoms rather than to all those with an uncomplicated UTI.

- **What this paper adds**: Two-thirds of women with uncomplicated UTI treated symptomatically with ibuprofen recovered without any antibiotics.

### Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial [^113EFair]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Results

- **Patients**: After the sample size was readjusted due to a higher-than-expected rate of ciprofloxacin resistance, 1802 patients were screened. Of these, 1671 were randomized, increasing the number from the initially targeted 1364. Eleven patients did not receive the study drug, resulting in a safety population of 1660 patients.

Prior to unblinding, patients from two centers were excluded from the efficacy population because of data integrity concerns, leaving 1579 patients in the MITT population. Among them, 1071 had a study uropathogen at baseline. Of these, 286 (26.7%) had a ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible organism, and 785 (73.3%) had a ciprofloxacin-susceptible organism.

### Correction to: Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial [^115ucLvU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

An error appeared in the 2 September 2022 issue of the journal (Dunne et al. "Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial". Clin Infect Dis; 76(11): 66–77). In the "Discussion" section of the manuscript, several of the in-text citations are incorrect. The correct references should be listed as follows:

Why would ASB occur sooner post-treatment among sulopenem-treated patients than among those treated with ciprofloxacin? One possible explanation is that ciprofloxacin has a greater impact on vaginal flora than a β-lactam such as sulopenem, and that this in turn influences the rate of bladder recolonization. Similar observations have been made in 2 previous studies of uUTI and in a recent mouse model of UTI [18–20]. The area under the curve (AUC) 0–24 of ciprofloxacin in plasma after 250 mg twice daily dosing is approximately 9.6 μg × h/mL [12]. An AUC 0–24/MIC of approximately 125 is required for achieving clinical and microbiologic success with ciprofloxacin [22], and this ratio would be achieved for organisms with an MIC < 0.06 μg/mL. Consistent with this potential effect and assuming equal tissue and plasma concentrations, a lower rate of ASB was seen only in those ciprofloxacin-treated patients whose baseline uropathogens had MICs < 0.06 µg/mL. This effect would not be relevant for organisms in the urine, where concentrations of ciprofloxacin are significantly higher than in plasma, but rather for those organisms among colonizing flora of the perineum and vagina, potential sources of bladder recolonization.

### Inequality in quality? Regional and educational differences in treatment with fluoroquinolone in urinary tract infection of 236,376 Swedish patients [^112mMzKt]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Low credibility.

In an international effort to reduce antibiotic resistance, which is partly suggested to be the effect of inappropriate antibiotic use, several quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use have been proposed. This study presents geographical and educational differences in fluoroquinolone prescriptions in the treatment of urinary tract infections in women.

- **Methods**: The age-adjusted ratio of women who were dispensed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin) among all 236,376 women dispensed any of the following antibiotics used in the treatment of lower urinary tract infection was studied: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, pivmecillinam, trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin. Only the first prescription from July 2006 to June 2007 was studied. Prescription data were linked to information on geographical area, marital status, country of birth, and educational attainment, allowing for multivariate analysis of the importance of these factors.

- **Results**: The rate of fluoroquinolone prescriptions varied from 29.5% to 17.1% across the 21 regions in Sweden. Middle-aged women with ≥ 15 years of schooling were more often prescribed fluoroquinolones compared to those with only 9 years of schooling (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.34).

- **Conclusion**: Quality indicators in healthcare should be developed with consideration of the overall level of adherence to guidelines and whether there are regional, socioeconomic, or other differentials in their distribution in the population. Such differentials in healthcare quality might further contribute to inequalities in health.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^1127QRf6]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to administer ciprofloxacin only if the local resistance is less than 10% and:

- **The entire treatment is given PO**:
	- Ciprofloxacin should be administered orally for the full course of treatment.

- **Patient does not require hospitalization**:
	- The treatment is recommended for patients who can be managed outside of a hospital setting.

- **Patient has anaphylaxis to β-lactam antibiotics**:
	- Ciprofloxacin is suggested as an alternative in cases where patients have a known severe allergic reaction to β-lactam antibiotics.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common issue for which young women seek medical attention, leading to significant morbidity and healthcare costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in adult patients should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is neither pregnant nor elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomical abnormalities of the genitourinary tract.

Most of these infections are caused by Escherichia coli, which is generally susceptible to many oral antimicrobials; however, resistance is increasing, particularly against commonly used agents like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in areas with a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin can be justified. From a public health perspective, nitrofurantoin is a viable empiric treatment for mild cystitis due to its lack of cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for the empiric treatment of cystitis.

Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may also be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy due to the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX remains effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, provided the uropathogen is known to be susceptible.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection: Results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^116kRbyZ]. BMC Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI) are usually treated with antibiotics; however, there is little evidence for alternative therapeutic options. This pilot study aimed to make a rough estimate of the equivalence of ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in terms of symptom resolution and to demonstrate the feasibility of a double-blind randomized controlled drug trial in German general practices.

- **Methods**: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial in 29 German general practices. Eighty otherwise healthy women aged 18 to 85 years, presenting with at least one of the main UTI symptoms — dysuria and frequency — without any complicating factors, were randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen 3 × 400 mg orally or ciprofloxacin 2 × 250 mg (+1 placebo) orally, both for three days.

	- The intensity of main symptoms — dysuria, frequency, and low abdominal pain — was recorded at inclusion and after 4, 7, and 28 days, scoring each symptom from 0 (none) to 4 (very strong). The primary endpoint was symptom resolution on Day 4. Secondary outcomes included the burden of symptoms on Days 4 and 7 (based on the sum score of all symptoms), symptom resolution on Day 7, and frequency of relapses. Equivalence margins for symptom burden on Day 4 were pre-specified as ± 0.5 sum score points. Data analysis was done by intention to treat and per protocol. Randomization was carried out on the patient level by computer program in blocks of six.

- **Results**: Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (ibuprofen n = 40, ciprofloxacin n = 39).

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^115YQtQ4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the study was terminated before the planned sample size was reached; yet, noninferiority of fosfomycin for the primary endpoint was demonstrated, supporting its use for this indication. Continuation of the trial until the planned sample size would have provided more precision for the secondary endpoints. Second, the study was performed in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance, and practices in other countries may differ concerning the broadness of empirical antibiotic treatment, duration on IV treatment, and the IV–oral switch. Nevertheless, eligibility was conditional on susceptibility to both fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin. Therefore, we consider our findings — specifically, the noninferiority of fosfomycin to ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment — valid in such settings for fosfomycin-susceptible isolates. Third, for feasibility and safety reasons, we used a treatment duration of 10 days for all patients, even though 7 days of ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated sufficient for treating acute pyelonephritis and gram-negative bacteremia. Lastly, implementing fosfomycin use for step-down treatment requires reliable susceptibility testing. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of E. coli to fosfomycin, as measured with automated panel tests, seems to correlate poorly with the clinical and microbiological efficacy of fosfomycin for the empirical treatment of cystitis. Future improvements in routine fosfomycin susceptibility testing may affect the targeted use of fosfomycin, although theoretically, it would lead to a higher…

### Urinary tract infection: Traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, although it is usually prescribed for the alleviation of symptoms. The management of acute uncomplicated UTI, or cystitis, is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of isolated uropathogens. Traditionally, the first-line treatment for acute uncomplicated UTI has involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies.

Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to consider in selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, the spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence in the community, potential for adverse effects, and the duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels.

In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTIs among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^114jxgu6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Baseline variables at admission and randomization were collected using participant questionnaires and from the electronic patient file (Supplemental Material, Protocol S1). Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an IV–oral switch to fosfomycin–trometamol every 24 hours as a powder for solution, equivalent to 3g fosfomycin, or ciprofloxacin 0.5g every 12 hours as capsules. Patients received an identical placebo for both active substances to ensure blinding, using a double-dummy procedure. The duration of antimicrobial treatment was set at 10 days, consisting of 2–5 days of empirical IV treatment and the remaining 5–8 days of oral study treatment.

Patients were asked to register the intake of study medication and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in a paper diary. A physical appointment was planned 6–10 days after the study treatment was finished to assess early endpoints and to collect urine; a telephone appointment at 30–35 days was set to assess late endpoints. At inclusion and during both follow-up meetings, structured questionnaires were obtained regarding urinary tract and systemic symptoms, antimicrobial use, health status, and healthcare consumption.

- **Outcomes**: The primary endpoint was clinical cure at days 6–10 post-end of treatment (PET). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with the reduction of all initial local and systemic fUTI-related symptoms, without the requirement of additional antibiotic therapy for UTI (except for antibiotic prophylaxis). In the case of an indwelling catheter, local symptoms were not counted.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^111C6177]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent medical conditions among women seeking primary care, with about 20–40% of women experiencing a recurrence during their lifetime.

- **Objective**: To provide insight into the patterns of recurring annual dispensing for antibiotics commonly used for UTI treatment in women aged 18 years or older, during a 5-year follow-up period in the Netherlands.

- **Methods**: The Dutch Foundation of Pharmaceutical Statistics collects dispensing data from more than 90% of all community pharmacies. Pharmacies with complete data from 2011 to 2017 were included. Women aged 18 years or older, with a first dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim in 2012 and a dispensing of any medication in 2017, were selected. For each year between 2013 and 2017, the proportions of women with recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim were calculated and stratified for age categories.

- **Results**: Within 1,517 eligible community pharmacies, 463,821 women aged 18 years or older were dispensed one of the antibiotics in 2012, and 239,292 women still visited the same pharmacy in 2017. About 56% of them received at least one recurring dispensing during the 5 years of follow-up. Each year, about 20% of the source population had at least one recurring dispensing. Approximately 2% of the source population had at least one recurring dispensing in each year of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Over the 5-year study period, more than 50% of the source population had at least one recurring dispensing for uncomplicated UTI.

### Single-dose fluoroquinolone therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing single-dose to 3-day fluoroquinolone regimens [^116me4v6]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of single-dose versus 3-day fluoroquinolone treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI).

- **Methods**: Adult women with acute uncomplicated UTI were randomized to receive either a single dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), 3 days of gatifloxacin (200 mg daily), or 3 days of ciprofloxacin (100 mg twice daily). Patients were assessed at four points during the study: before treatment (within 48 hours before the initiation of the study medication), at the end of treatment (by telephone contact on day 3), and twice after treatment completion (5 to 9 days after treatment for the test-of-cure visit and 29 to 42 days after treatment for only patients with a bacteriologic response of eradication at the test-of-cure visit).

- **Results**: The bacterial eradication rate for the single-dose gatifloxacin, 3-day gatifloxacin, and 3-day ciprofloxacin groups was 90%, 95%, and 89%, respectively. The clinical efficacy rate was 93%, 95%, and 93%, respectively, for microbiologically assessable patients at the test-of-cure visit. Eradication of the most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, was achieved with both gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Single-dose gatifloxacin was equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin in both microbiologic and clinical efficacy.

- **Conclusions**: Single-dose and 3-day gatifloxacin were microbiologically and clinically equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute UTI among women. Single-dose gatifloxacin may offer advantages over 3-day fluoroquinolone therapy for uncomplicated UTI.

### Antibiotic use in hospital urinary tract infections after FDA regulation [^117QuuGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The FDA issued a "black box" warning regarding the risks of fluoroquinolones in 2008, with updates in 2011, 2013, and 2016.

- **Objective**: To examine antimicrobial use in hospital-treated UTIs from 2000 to 2020.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study with interrupted time series analysis.

- **Participants**: Patient encounters with a diagnosis of UTI from January 2000 to March 2020, excluding diagnoses of renal abscess, chronic cystitis, and infection of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or prostate.

- **Main measures**: Monthly use of fluoroquinolone and non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics were assessed. Fluoroquinolone resistance was assessed in available cultures. Interrupted time series analysis examined level and trend changes of antimicrobial use with each FDA label change.

- **Key results**: A total of 9,950,790 patient encounters were included. From July 2008 to March 2020, fluoroquinolone use declined from 61.7% to 11.7%, with similar negative trends observed in inpatients and outpatients, age ≥ 60 and < 60 years, males and females, patients with and without pyelonephritis, and across physician specialties. Ceftriaxone use increased from 26.4% of encounters in July 2008 to 63.6% of encounters in March 2020. Among encounters with available culture data, fluoroquinolone resistance declined by 28.9% from 2009 to 2020. On interrupted time series analysis, the July 2008 FDA warning was associated with a trend change (-0.32%, p < 0.001) and level change (-5.02%, p < 0.001) in monthly fluoroquinolone use.

Conclusions during this era of "black box" warnings, there was a decline in fluoroquinolone use.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of nonsystematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

- **Objectives**: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

- **Search strategy**: We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference lists of identified articles, reviews, and books, and searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared were selected. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or those designed for prevention of urinary tract infections were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The quality of all selected trials was assessed, and data were extracted by the reviewers. The main outcome measures were the persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status, and adverse drug reactions.

### Urinary tract infections: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^116BApmD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the authors review the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. They review the pathophysiology and describe the initial diagnostic workup, spending some time discussing the urine dipstick. The authors discuss whether hospital antibiograms are useful in making the initial antibiotic choice.

- **Recommendations and treatment**: The section reviews the recommendations and highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The authors also discuss the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, which may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs may be inappropriate, contributing to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomatology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture-proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women, 16% in older women in the community, and as high as 50% for older women in long-term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

The date of the most recent search was 7 May 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible, we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain, or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days; and prevention studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: Best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^1122cGCL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the ACP 2021 guidelines recommend initiating a short course of antibiotics. Options include nitrofurantoin for 5 days, TMP/SMX for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose in female patients with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^117EfW6S]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Discussion - Principal findings**: While initial symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen reduced the overall number of antibiotic treatment courses in women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection by 67% compared to immediate antibiotic treatment with fosfomycin, this strategy resulted in a higher burden of symptoms and more cases of pyelonephritis. Two-thirds of the women in the ibuprofen group, however, recovered without antibiotic treatment. Within 28 days, 34% of the ibuprofen group received antibiotic treatment for persistent or worsening symptoms compared to 14% of the fosfomycin group.

These findings are similar to those in the pilot study. In our trial, lower antibiotic consumption was "bought" at the expense of a higher burden of symptoms until day seven in the ibuprofen group, with an area under the curve ratio of 140%. Although, to our knowledge, ibuprofen has not previously been compared with placebo in women with urinary tract infection, it is likely to be effective for symptom relief. While in our trial 67% of women in the ibuprofen group recovered without antibiotics, in a previous randomised controlled trial comparing antibiotics with placebo, 54% of those in the placebo group recovered, and in another trial, 28% recovered without any antibiotics within a week. A protocol on a similar urinary tract infection trial has been published recently, comparing mecillinam with ibuprofen in a higher dose (3×600 mg).

Regarding safety aspects, there were more cases of pyelonephritis in the ibuprofen group, and the same trend was observed in worsening symptoms and febrile urinary tract infections.

### Outpatient antibiogram and predictors of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant urinary tract infections [^116DV2Di]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Rising antibiotic resistance has transcended hospital boundaries and impacted individuals with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). Scant data on antibiotic resistance in outpatient settings exist, and most studies in the United States (U.S.) have identified predictors of resistance in acute-care settings.

- **Objective**: Determine the antibiogram among Escherichia coli isolates and factors associated with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistant gram-negative urinary isolates.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Two primary care safety-net clinics in Houston, TX, between November 2018 and March 2020.

- **Population studied**: Patients aged 18 and older presenting with provider-suspected uncomplicated or complicated UTI.

- **Outcome measures**: Resistance and predictors of resistance to UTI-relevant antibiotics.

- **Results**: Among 1265 cultures collected, 372 (28.4%) were positive. E. coli (50.3%) and Group B Streptococcus (18.6%) were detected most frequently. Our patient population consisted mostly of Hispanic (75.7%) females (92.5%) born outside the U.S. (67.3%) with a mean age of 47. Among patients with E. coli isolated (n = 189), antibiotic resistance was highest to ampicillin (63%), TMP-SMX (44%), ciprofloxacin (31%), and cefazolin (30%); no or low resistance against amikacin (0%), fosfomycin (0%), and nitrofurantoin (2.7%) was detected. Approximately 12% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive. Having a prior UTI caused by a TMP-SMX resistant gram-negative organism and being born outside the U.S. increased the odds of resistant infections.

For measures of the primary endpoint at other time points, two-sided 95% unstratified confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed for the observed difference in overall success rates between the treatment groups; no conclusion of noninferiority was made. An assessment of the primary endpoint was performed in which the urine culture collected at the follow-up visit demonstrated < 10² colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of the baseline uropathogen in addition to other endpoint criteria. Kaplan–Meier curves for time to symptom resolution were provided.

Differences in baseline patient characteristics between treatment groups were analyzed using the χ² or Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for ordinal and continuous variables, and the χ² test for analyses of superiority of the primary endpoint.

### Gaps in knowledge and recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113BSLEM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The focus of this review is to present recent literature and gaps in knowledge surrounding the future treatment and prevention of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women.

Recurrent urinary tract infections are common, significantly reduce quality of life, and create a substantial economic burden on the healthcare system. They disproportionately affect postmenopausal women. Antibiotics, which are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of uncomplicated rUTIs, have become problematic, as there is a global rise in allergy and resistance to these agents. Their use is associated with further antimicrobial resistance. In recent decades, several alternative, non-antibiotic approaches have been evaluated.

There is a critical need for a concerted and standardized methodology for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring women with rUTIs. Novel non-antibiotic alternative treatment and preventive measures for UTIs are desperately required to address the global issue of antibiotic resistance in all age groups, specifically older women. Research efforts have sought to develop alternative and more effective techniques, many of which appear promising but require additional evaluation and validation through clinical trials.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^116fcpV2]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Our results demonstrate that more than half of the women who continued visiting the same pharmacy at the conclusion of the study period experienced at least one recurring dispensing of a guideline antibiotic for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) during the five years of follow-up. In the subsequent year, the proportions of another UTI dispensing ranged between 20% and 23%, consistent with the earlier reported range of 20–40% for recurring UTIs (reUTIs). A Finnish study among women aged 17–82 years reported a 44% UTI recurrence within one year. In these studies, reUTIs were defined as three or more episodes in 12 months. Our definition of recurring UTIs was less stringent, counting at least one recurring prescription of a UTI antibiotic.

Approximately 2% of the women in our study received at least one recurring dispensing every year during the five years of follow-up. Most of these women were aged 51–70 years, an age category predominantly associated with menopause, which has been reported as a risk factor for UTIs.

As UTI is among the most prevalent medical conditions affecting women in primary care, and approximately 60% of women experience symptomatic acute bacterial cystitis in their lifetime, UTIs contribute significantly to the workload in primary care. In recent years, several countries have raised concerns about the increasing workload in general practice, exacerbated by factors such as rising multimorbidity, chronic diseases, an aging population, and the pressure to reduce access to secondary care. Additionally, the escalating costs of the healthcare system necessitate changes in its organization.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections: Network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112ZTKy5]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacies and adverse effects of different antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) have been studied using standard meta-analytic methods with pairwise direct comparisons of antimicrobial treatments: the effects of one treatment are compared to those of either another treatment or placebo. However, for clinical decisions, it is important to know the effectiveness of each possible treatment compared with all relevant alternatives, not just one.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacies and adverse effects of all relevant antibiotics for UTI treatment simultaneously by performing a network meta-analysis using direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

- **Methods**: Using logistic regression analysis, we performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after 1999 that compared different oral antibiotic or placebo regimens for UTI treatment in general practice or outpatient settings. We examined five binary outcomes: early clinical performance, early bacteriological outcomes, late clinical performance, late bacteriological outcomes, and adverse effects. Consequently, a ranking of the antibiotic regimens could be established.

- **Results**: Utilizing a network structure, we were able to compare and rank nine treatments from ten studies. Overall, ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin emerged as the most effective treatments, while amoxicillin-clavulanate was the least effective. In terms of adverse effects, there were no significant differences.

- **Discussion**: The network meta-analysis demonstrates some clear efficacy differences between various antibiotic treatments.

### No. 250-recurrent urinary tract infection [^114rAos1]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, especially concerning antibiotic prophylaxis, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering continuous daily antibiotic prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a quinolone for 6–12 months in patients with 2 UTIs in 6 months or 3 UTIs in 12 months.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have evolved. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Fosfomycin trometamol versus comparator antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZFoxh]. The Journal of Urology (2020). High credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety profile of fosfomycin versus comparator antibiotics in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis. Relevant databases were searched using methods recommended by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We assessed the risk of bias and confounders. The study's primary endpoint was clinical or microbiological success, defined as complete cure and/or incomplete resolution of symptoms at the end of treatment (improvement) and/or microbiological eradication.

After screening 539 articles, 15 were included, which recruited a total of 2,295 adult female patients. Of the studies, 14 were used for microbiological eradication analysis. We used 11 of the 15 articles in a total of 1,976 patients for clinical resolution and 11 in a total of 1,816 patients for safety outcome analysis. No difference was found for clinical resolution in all comparators combined in 11 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,976 patients (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91–1.49, p = 0.13). No difference was found for microbiological eradication in 14 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2,052 patients (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.83–1.30, p = 0.09) or for safety outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,816 patients (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.86–1.58, p = 0.33). Most adverse effects reported for fosfomycin were transient, and single-dose therapy seems to have resulted in better patient compliance.

The study concludes that single-dose oral fosfomycin trometamol is as effective and safe as comparator antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^116TVgfB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events not related to urinary tract infection. In the fosfomycin group, 57 out of 243 women reported 64 adverse events, whereas in the ibuprofen group, 42 out of 241 reported 51 adverse events. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and diarrhoea, were reported more often in the fosfomycin group (15 cases versus 6 in the ibuprofen group). Rashes or vaginal thrush were rare.

Four patients in the ibuprofen group reported serious adverse events that required hospital admission. One event, a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, was likely drug-related; the other three were considered unrelated to the drugs. The woman with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was subsequently found to have an undetected stomach ulcer and alcohol-induced hepatitis. Due to a misunderstanding and curiosity, one woman unblinded herself using the pharmacy emergency number, despite not having symptoms.

Non-participants reported higher symptom scores than participants at the baseline.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analyzed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The US Food and Drug Administration has released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade due to antibiotic resistance and a significant burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment, with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess the concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

- **Study design**: A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, aged 18 to 75 years, were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities to match the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

### Algorithms using previous resistance, prior antimicrobial prescriptions, and patient place of residence enhance empirical therapy for women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^113c6S7e]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate how previous antimicrobial resistance, prior prescription data, and patient place of residence (ZIP code) can guide empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI), guidelines recommend empirical antimicrobial selection for women with symptoms of uncomplicated UTIs. The most commonly used antibiotics are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), nitrofurantoin (NIT), or ciprofloxacin (CIP). Previous antimicrobial resistance and prior prescription data are potential predictors of resistance in subsequent urine cultures for UTIs. Additionally, there is evidence of geographic clustering of antimicrobial resistance for UTIs.

- **Methods**: Retrospective data from women (age ≥ 18) with an assigned diagnosis of UTI, submitting urine cultures as outpatients (2011–2018), were gathered. Univariate analyses and multivariable regression models were used to determine odds ratios for predicting resistance to SXT, NIT, and CIP on the 2011–2017 data. Antimicrobial choice algorithms were created using 2011–2017 results and tested on 2018 data.

- **Results**: In the training cohort, 9,455 women had diagnoses of uncomplicated UTIs and positive urine cultures. The prevalence of resistance for SXT, NIT, and CIP was 19.4%, 12.1%, and 10.3%, respectively. A urine culture with previous resistance, prior antimicrobial prescription within 2 years, and ZIP code were the strongest predictors of a subsequent resistant culture. An algorithm based on these data had a success rate of 92.2%, compared to the provider's choice (87.5%, P < 0.001) or best theoretical outcomes with guidelines (90.0%, P = 0.048).

### Single-dose ciprofloxacin versus 3 days of norfloxacin in uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^112Q27Ci]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

A double-blind, randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin versus 3 days of 400 mg twice daily of norfloxacin in uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women. Patients underwent four visits: baseline, and at 3, 7, and 28 days. The main efficacy variables were clinical and microbiological outcomes at day 7. Analyses were performed on both valid patients and intention-to-treat populations. Two hundred and twenty-six patients (114 receiving ciprofloxacin and 112 receiving norfloxacin) were considered valid for efficacy evaluation.

- **Bacteriologic cure rates**: 91.2% in the ciprofloxacin group and 91.9% in the norfloxacin group.

- **Clinical resolution rates**: 91.2% and 93.8%, respectively.

Both treatments were found to be equally efficacious (P = 0.016).

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^116QDD2T]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

From the women of the source population, 55.7% had at least one recurring dispensing of a UTI antibiotic in one of the five years of follow-up. Consequently, 44.3% of those women still visiting the same pharmacy in 2017 did not return for a recurring dispensing of any of these antibiotics during the follow-up period. Figure 1 shows that, from 2013 to 2017, one in five women of the source population returned to the pharmacy each year for at least one recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim. Of the 52,272 women with a recurring dispensing in 2014, about 56.6% did not have a dispensing in the preceding year, 2013 (data not shown). After 2014, the proportion of women without any dispensing in the preceding years gradually decreased from 39.4% in 2015 to 25.7% in 2017. Figure 2 illustrates, for each follow-up year, the number of women with at least one recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim during the corresponding and previous study years. Among these women with recurring dispensing, the proportions of younger women (aged between 19–30 and 31–50 years) were lower than the proportions of older women.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: A 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^1132XuuX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A panel of international experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 uncomplicated urinary tract infection guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

The focus of this work is the treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities.

- **In vitro resistance prevalence**: The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Predictive utility of prior negative urine cultures in women with suspected recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^113khgMF]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend treating women who have symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection with antimicrobials without performing a urine culture. However, 10% to 50% of women with urinary tract infection symptoms are found to have a negative culture. Urinalysis data are useful to predict a negative culture; we evaluated how a previous negative culture predicts the likelihood of a subsequent negative culture.

We gathered retrospective data on women 18 years old or older with symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection who submitted urine cultures as outpatients from 2011 to 2017. Univariate analysis and multivariable regression models were used to determine the likelihood ratios and risk ratios of predicting a negative culture.

Of the 20,759 patients, 9,271 (44.7%) had a negative culture, defined as less than 10³ CFU/ml, and 6,958 (33.5%) had at least one prior culture, including 4,510 (64.8%) with at least one prior negative culture and 2,634 (58.4%) with a subsequent negative culture. Variables associated with an increased likelihood of another negative culture were a prior negative culture (LR 1.43, 95% CI 1.387–1.475), prior negative culture and negative urinalysis (LR 1.839, 95% CI 1.768–1.913), and vaginal irritation and/or discharge (LR 1.335, 95% CI 1.249–1.427, each p < 0.001). Urinalysis had 83% specificity and 78% positive predictive value. These values were significantly enhanced if the patient had a prior negative culture without a prior positive culture (95% and 87%, respectively).

In conclusion, in women with suspected recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections, prior negative urine culture results can be a significant indicator of subsequent negative culture outcomes, particularly when combined with negative urinalysis findings.

### Amoxicillin-clavulanate vs ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women: A randomized trial [^115JHQBP]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

The high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials among *Escherichia coli* causing acute cystitis in women has led to increased use of alternative antibiotics. One such antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate, has not been well studied. This study aims to compare the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate to that of a 3-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute cystitis in women. The primary hypothesis was that the amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin treatment groups would differ in clinical cure.

This randomized, single-blind treatment trial involved 370 women, aged 18 to 45 years, with symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis and a urine culture with at least 10² colony-forming units of uropathogens per milliliter. Participants were recruited from a university student health center or a health maintenance organization.

Women were randomly assigned to receive either amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for 3 days, with follow-up over 4 months. The main outcome measure was clinical cure. Secondary outcomes included microbiological cure and vaginal *E. coli* colonization at the 2-week follow-up visit.

Clinical cure was observed in 93 (58%) of 160 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared to 124 (77%) of 162 women treated with ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001). Amoxicillin-clavulanate was not as effective as ciprofloxacin, even among women infected with strains susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112ph6V3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. † For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment of pregnant women are available, though the estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported antibiotic treatment, similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

The estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the 3 months before LMP are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study that examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999 concluded similar findings.

### An update on uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^11321799]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women consist of uncomplicated and complicated types. Uncomplicated UTIs, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are prevalent infections in otherwise healthy women and tend to recur frequently. Although severe complications are rare, the high prevalence of uncomplicated UTIs results in significant costs for healthcare systems.

Most scientific evidence has focused on uncomplicated UTIs. This study examines recent developments in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs and recurrent UTIs (reUTI) in women.

A significant increase in antibiotic resistance has been observed in uncomplicated UTIs. As a result, the prudent use of antibiotics in treating uncomplicated UTIs is becoming increasingly important.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Our perceptions of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTIs) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

In 2024, this guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021, and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this guideline in 2021.

The panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on the evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, a greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis.
