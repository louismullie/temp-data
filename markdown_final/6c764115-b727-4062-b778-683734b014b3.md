## Question

Lexapro dose for chf

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosing of escitalopram (Lexapro) in patients with congestive heart failure, including rationale, safety, monitoring, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a heart failure–specific dosing recommendation. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on efficacy and safety in heart failure. Next, I will review cardiovascular safety signals, especially QT effects and hemodynamics. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetics and organ function considerations that might alter dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical dosing and monitoring plan and consider alternatives if escitalopram is not suitable.

> Let me first confirm whether there is a heart failure–specific dosing recommendation for escitalopram. I should double-check the FDA labeling and heart failure guidelines. The FDA labeling provides standard adult dosing for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder but does not include a heart failure–specific dose, and it advises caution in patients with unstable heart disease or altered hemodynamics, reflecting limited systematic evaluation in this population [^116ij65Z] [^114aUDBL]. Hold on, I should verify if any professional society guidance specifies a different dose in heart failure; I do not find a heart failure–specific escitalopram dose in the provided materials, reinforcing that we must extrapolate from general dosing plus safety data in HF trials [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on escitalopram in heart failure. The MOOD-HF randomized clinical trial in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression used escitalopram 10–20 mg daily and found no significant benefit over placebo for the composite of death or hospitalization and no significant improvement in depression scores, suggesting a lack of efficacy signal in this population while documenting general cardiovascular safety over the trial period [^1153MfMs]. Wait, let me verify the comparator and dosing flexibility. Yes, the trial allowed 10–20 mg with investigator titration based on response and tolerability, which supports using the standard adult dose range when escitalopram is chosen despite the neutral efficacy findings [^1153MfMs].

> I will now examine cardiovascular safety signals that could influence dosing in heart failure. Escitalopram produces a modest, dose-related QTc prolongation of about 4.5 msec at 10 mg and about 6.6 msec at 20 mg, with no QTcF > 500 msec observed in pooled analyses, though rare torsade de pointes has been reported in overdose settings, which matters in patients with arrhythmia risk or polypharmacy [^115ES8ZU] [^114SNpsd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought escitalopram might carry the same explicit QT warning as citalopram, but wait, I should verify that distinction. The explicit QT warning and dose cap are for citalopram, not escitalopram, although both can prolong QT and citalopram's label specifically advises avoiding use in decompensated heart failure and limiting to 40 mg/day (or 20 mg/day in certain patients), which informs a conservative stance with escitalopram in HF even though escitalopram lacks the identical boxed warning language [^111xMVfS] [^111ePwLu] [^112JTibZ]. I need to ensure we also consider hemodynamics; escitalopram lacks direct negative inotropic effects described for tricyclics, but caution is warranted in unstable disease states per labeling [^114aUDBL].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetics and organ function that could alter dosing. Escitalopram is hepatically metabolized with a half-life around 27–32 hours and only about 7% renal elimination, so severe renal impairment warrants caution but no routine dose change for mild to moderate renal dysfunction, while hepatic impairment and older age generally justify a maximum of 10 mg daily due to increased exposure and half-life [^116dUMb4] [^111AXeZH] [^113yTxyS]. I should confirm the elderly dosing; yes, 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly, aligning with a conservative approach in older HF patients who often have reduced hepatic clearance and comorbidities [^113yTxyS].

> Now, I should synthesize a practical dosing recommendation. For adults with compensated heart failure and normal hepatic function, start escitalopram at 10 mg once daily, consider increasing to 20 mg after at least 1 week if needed and tolerated, while recognizing that MOOD-HF did not show added clinical benefit and that higher doses increase QT exposure. In older adults or those with hepatic impairment, limit to 10 mg daily, and in severe renal impairment, consider starting at 5–10 mg with cautious titration given limited data [^112yaUQo] [^113yTxyS] [^1153MfMs]. Wait, I should verify the renal point; the label notes no adjustment for mild to moderate renal impairment and advises caution in severe renal impairment, so a 5–10 mg start with slow titration is a reasonable, conservative approach when CrCl is less than 20 mL/min rather than a firm dose reduction rule [^112yaUQo].

> Next, I should review monitoring and precautions. I need to ensure baseline and periodic assessment of mood, suicidality, electrolytes including sodium and potassium, and ECG if there is known conduction disease, bradyarrhythmias, concurrent QT-prolonging drugs, or decompensated HF, given the modest QT effect and hyponatremia risk with SSRIs. Also monitor for bleeding if combined with antiplatelets or anticoagulants and for serotonin syndrome with other serotonergic agents [^11213TqZ] [^117Gyx3Q] [^1166oRkM]. Hold on, I should verify hyponatremia risk modifiers; yes, diuretics and ACE inhibitors can increase risk, which is common in HF regimens, reinforcing the need to check sodium early after initiation and dose changes [^1166oRkM].

> But wait, what if the clinical goal is improvement in HF outcomes or depression in heart failure specifically. I should confirm the comparative evidence base. SSRIs appear safe from a cardiovascular standpoint in HF, but large randomized trials of sertraline (SADHART-CHF) and escitalopram (MOOD-HF) did not demonstrate superiority over placebo for depression or hard outcomes, whereas psychotherapy and collaborative care models show more consistent mood benefits in HF populations, so nonpharmacologic strategies should be prioritized when available [^114MYyQM] [^1153MfMs] [^1171k3WK]. Let me reconsider agent selection; sertraline may be preferred by some experts due to a more favorable QT profile compared with citalopram and escitalopram, though escitalopram is not contraindicated and can be used with caution and monitoring when clinically indicated for depression or anxiety [^1171k3WK] [^112JTibZ].

> Final recommendation: For adults with congestive heart failure who require escitalopram for depression or anxiety, start 10 mg once daily, titrate to 20 mg only if necessary and well tolerated, keep the dose at 10 mg in older adults or those with hepatic impairment, and use extra caution with slow titration in severe renal impairment. Throughout, monitor mood, suicidality, electrolytes, and consider ECG monitoring in patients with arrhythmia risk or on QT-prolonging drugs, while recognizing that MOOD-HF did not show outcome or mood benefits in HF and that nonpharmacologic depression care may be more effective in this population [^112yaUQo] [^113yTxyS] [^1153MfMs] [^1171k3WK].

Lexapro (escitalopram) is **generally safe at standard doses** for patients with stable CHF, but **start low and go slow** is prudent. Begin at **5–10 mg once daily**, titrate cautiously to 10–20 mg if tolerated, and monitor closely for hyponatremia, QT prolongation, and drug interactions. Avoid use in **decompensated HF or with other QT-prolonging drugs**, and correct electrolytes before starting. Evidence from MOOD-HF [^1153MfMs] shows no cardiovascular benefit and no significant mood improvement in CHF, so use only when clearly indicated for depression or anxiety, with close monitoring.

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in CHF

- **Absorption**: Oral bioavailability is ~80% and not affected by food [^115sUNk1].
- **Distribution**: ~56% protein binding; CHF-related hypoalbuminemia may increase free drug and risk of adverse effects.
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; CHF-related hepatic congestion may reduce clearance and raise exposure.
- **Elimination**: Half-life ~27–32 h; ~7% renal excretion [^116dUMb4]; CHF-related renal impairment may reduce clearance.

---

## Clinical evidence in CHF

Evidence from **MOOD-HF** [^1153MfMs] showed no reduction in all-cause mortality or hospitalization with escitalopram vs placebo in CHF with depression, and no significant improvement in depression scores. SADHART-CHF [^114MYyQM] similarly found no significant antidepressant or cardiovascular benefit with sertraline in CHF, supporting cautious SSRI use in this population.

---

## Recommended dosing strategy

- **Initial dose**: 5–10 mg once daily; start at 5 mg in elderly, frail, or those with hepatic/renal impairment [^notfound].
- **Titration**: Increase to 10 mg after 1–2 weeks if tolerated; consider 15–20 mg only if needed and tolerated, with close monitoring.
- **Maximum dose**: 20 mg/day; higher doses increase QT risk without added benefit.

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hyponatremia**: Common with SSRIs in CHF; monitor sodium, especially in elderly or those on diuretics [^1166oRkM] [^114HzLHL].
- **QT prolongation**: Dose-dependent; avoid in decompensated HF or with other QT-prolonging drugs [^117Gyx3Q] [^1151E2rh].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine, omeprazole) can increase exposure; monitor closely.
- **Clinical monitoring**: Regularly assess mood, electrolytes, renal/hepatic function, and ECG if indicated.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidance emphasizes **individualized risk–benefit assessment**, with SSRIs considered when depression/anxiety significantly impair quality of life or adherence, but with careful monitoring for adverse effects. For **alternative antidepressants**, sertraline or mirtazapine may be preferred in some cases due to differing interaction and QT profiles, though evidence in CHF is limited.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** | **Monitoring parameters** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable CHF without significant hepatic/renal impairment | 10 mg once daily | - Mood <br/> - Electrolytes <br/> - Renal/hepatic function <br/> - ECG if indicated |
| Elderly or frail patients | 5 mg once daily initially | - Mood <br/> - Sodium <br/> - Renal/hepatic function <br/> - ECG if indicated |
| Hepatic or renal impairment | 5–10 mg once daily | - Mood <br/> - Electrolytes <br/> - Renal/hepatic function <br/> - ECG if indicated |
| Decompensated CHF or QT risk | Avoid if possible | N/A |

8.5 Geriatric Use

Approximately 6% of the 1144 patients receiving escitalopram in controlled trials of Lexapro in major depressive disorder and GAD were 60 years of age or older; elderly patients in these trials received daily doses of Lexapro between 10 and 20 mg. The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age. Nevertheless, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals to effects of Lexapro cannot be ruled out.

SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Hyponatremia (5.6)].

In two pharmacokinetic studies, escitalopram half-life was increased by approximately 50% in elderly subjects as compared to young subjects and Cmaxwas unchanged [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Of 4422 patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but again, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out.

Concluding remarks and future directions

Despite compelling evidence that several neurohormonal antagonists used in combination have a striking effect to prolong survival in patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, most eligible patients are not receiving all recommended classes of drugs, and treated patients are usually prescribed subtarget doses. Typically, patients are receiving doses that are used for initiation of treatment; these doses are maintained for long periods of time, and no or little attempt is made to achieve target doses or show that patients are intolerant of higher doses. As a result, the vast majority of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction in clinical practice are receiving treatments that have been demonstrated to exert meaningful effect on the natural history of the disease.

The failure of physicians to treat patients with trial‐proven regimens has numerous complex causes. However, an important contributor to the current state of affairs is the fact that physicians can readily claim that the use of subtarget doses is fully compatible with recommendations of current guidelines. Practice guidelines do not describe what regimens are acceptable, adequate or reasonable; thus, most treatments can be labelled as consistent with 'guideline‐directed medical therapy'.

Perhaps, adherence to the trial‐proven regimens might be markedly improved if physicians were asked to document the degree to which a patient's treatment adheres to or deviates from the strategies that were used to demonstrate the benefits of the neurohormonal antagonists that have demonstrated survival benefits. All of the landmark trials were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced‐titration treatment plan to a target dose. Investigators were required to increase the dose at specified increments and intervals to achieve a target dose, even if the patient experienced asymptomatic but unwanted changes in vital signs or laboratory tests. Investigators were also required to make repeated efforts to achieve and maintain target doses, often adjusting concomitant medications to improve the likelihood of tolerance. 'Forced‐titration strategies' were an essential element of every trial that demonstrated a survival benefit.

Drug doses

The active metabolite of the SSRI escitalopram, (S)-citalopram, has a therapeutic window of between 50–130 ng/mL in serum, which corresponds to doses of between 120–313 nM in vitro. The active metabolite of the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline, 10-hydroxynortriptyline, has a therapeutic window of between 70–170 ng/mL, which corresponds to 233–567 nM in vitro. Subsequently, cells were treated with a range of doses, incorporating two therapeutically-relevant doses of each drug and a high drug dose group comparable to those used previously in this cell line.

Escitalopram drug doses were achieved by dissolving escitalopram oxalate (Sigma) in molecular grade ethanol (Sigma) to form a 10 mM stock solution. Escitalopram drug doses (0 nM, 145 nM, 290 nM and 1160 nM) were then formed by dilution of the stock with media, with the relative proportion of ethanol kept constant across all dose groups. Nortriptyline drug doses were achieved by dissolving nortriptyline hydrochloride (Sigma) in RNase free water to form a 10 mM stock solution. Nortriptyline drug doses (0 nM, 267 nM, 534 nM, 1068 nM) were then formed by dilution of the stock in media. To confirm that the drug doses were not toxic, we checked for any effects on cell death using immunohistochemistry. There was no evidence of increased cell death related to any dose in either drug condition (see Supplementary Information).

Culture protocol

Cells were seeded for 24 h on laminin-coated 6 well plates (Nunclon, Roskilde, Denmark). After seeding, cells were treated with media containing varying doses of escitalopram oxalate or nortriptyline hydrochloride for 48 h. At the end of the 48-h drug treatment period, proliferating media was aspirated and 1 mL of Trireagent (Sigma) was added for RNA isolation. Our 48-h drug culture duration represents a midrange between the treatment durations of neural progenitor cells in LINCS (6, 24 and 96 h).

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^114r78zT]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with depression often have several chronic disorders and are more treatment-resistant. These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.

Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo or small drug-placebo differences, hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.

A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into young-old (60–74 years), and old-old (≥ 75 years). Among the old-old, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.

In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons, escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients ≥ 65 years. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD.

In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the old-old with the young-old, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among young-old and old-old patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that old-old and young-old patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.

5.9 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness

Clinical experience with Lexapro in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using Lexapro in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.

In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The recommended dose of Lexapro in hepatically impaired patients is 10 mg/day [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with Lexapro, however, it should be used with caution in such patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Medication dosing for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction-opportunities and challenges [^116odxSF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple drug classes have shown incremental benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Most of these trials were designed to achieve specific doses of the investigational agent. Clinical practice guidelines recommend using the same target dosing of therapies, as tolerated. However, with the increasing number of available therapies, clinicians face the challenge of simultaneously using several drugs, achieving target doses, and managing side effects that are often overlapping. Blood pressure, renal function, hyperkalaemia, and other factors may impede achieving target doses of all medications, leaving clinicians with dilemmas as to how to sequence and dose these various classes of drugs. The guideline-directed eligibility for certain drugs and devices requires stability on maximally tolerated doses of background therapies. However, significant variability exists in dosing achieved in clinical practice. We discuss the existing background data regarding the doses of heart failure medications in clinical trials and in practice, and provide recommendations on how to navigate this complex therapeutic decision-making.

ECG Changes

Electrocardiograms from Lexapro (N = 625) and placebo (N = 527) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). None of the patients in the Lexapro group had a QTcF interval > 500 msec or a prolongation > 60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.2% in the Lexapro and the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.5% in the Lexapro group and 0.2% in the placebo group.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Lexapro should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.

2.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adolescents

The recommended dose of Lexapro is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of Lexapro (10 to 20 mg/day) demonstrated the effectiveness of Lexapro [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks.

Adults

The recommended dose of Lexapro is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of Lexapro demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of Lexapro, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of continuing Lexapro 10 or 20 mg/day in adults patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking Lexapro during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Lexapro for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adults

The recommended starting dose of Lexapro is 10 mg once daily. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

Generalized anxiety disorder is recognized as a chronic condition. The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment of GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. The physician who elects to use Lexapro for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

2.3 Special Populations

10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Lexapro should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.

### Escitalopram oral (escitalopram oral solution) [^116KERU6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Escitalopram

Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by the 1428 patients treated with escitalopram for periods of up to one year in double-blind or open-label clinical trials during its premarketing evaluation. The listing does not include those reactions already listed in Tables 2 & 3, those reactions for which a drug cause was remote and at a rate less than 1% or lower than placebo, those reactions which were so general as to be uninformative, and those reactions reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening. Reactions are categorized by body system. Reactions of major clinical importance are described in the Warnings and Precautions section (5).

14.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg daily escitalopram and 20 mg daily escitalopram to placebo and 40 mg daily citalopram. The 10 mg daily and 20 mg daily escitalopram treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg escitalopram groups were similar on this outcome measure.

In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg daily escitalopram and placebo, the 10 mg daily escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

In a flexible-dose study, comparing escitalopram, titrated between 10 mg and 20 mg daily, to placebo and citalopram, titrated between 20 mg and 40 mg daily, the escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the all of Us research program [^1166oRkM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Although escitalopram (the active stereoisomer of citalopram) has been shown to have superior efficacy compared to citalopram, we found that escitalopram had a higher risk of hyponatremia than citalopram in this study (HR = 1.24 [1.07–1.44]).

The long‐term risk of hyponatremia with paroxetine was among the lowest of the antidepressants we studied, although we noted a higher rate within the first 30 days of paroxetine start (Figure 3 c). In previous studies, paroxetine was often reported to be associated with higher hyponatremia risks. The Canadianand Japanesestudies suggested that paroxetine is among the antidepressants with higher risks; both of these studies only evaluated events soon after the initiation of treatment. Prospective longitudinal studies have also found an increased frequency of hyponatremia within the first 14 days after initiation of paroxetine.

Bupropion was also associated with a lower risk of hyponatremia in this study. In the literature, a case report that described sertraline‐associated hyponatremia specifically highlighted a patient who was subsequently able to tolerate bupropion treatment without any electrolyte abnormalities. However, there are also case reports of bupropion‐induced hyponatremia.

The population‐based nature of our study allows us to assess the potential impact of relevant comorbidities and drug interactions. For example, the risk of hyponatremia for escitalopram appears to be increased when on diuretics as well as ACEi and ARBs. This observation supports findings from a previous study reporting a higher risk for hyponatremia when SSRIs were used at the same time as diuretics and ACEi. Fluoxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, is also known to be associated with a high rate of drug interactions. In our dataset, the risk of hyponatremia with fluoxetine increased with age, especially when compared with sertraline and citalopram. We also assessed the impact of two key clinical covariates, diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure, both of which were associated with higher risks for hyponatremia, as expected. However, when we assessed these two variables in our models, the interaction terms between our study drugs and these two comorbidities were not statistically significant. The P ‐values for the reported possible drug–drug interactions did not pass the multiple‐comparison corrected threshold for statistical significance. Since clinical modifiers are difficult to study, we describe our observations to encourage further investigations.

### Escitalopram oxalate (escitalopram) [^113r4pxs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Changes

Escitalopram oral solution and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with escitalopram oral solution treatment.

ECG Changes

Electrocardiograms from escitalopram oral solution (N = 625) and placebo (N = 527) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). None of the patients in the escitalopram oral solution group had a QTcF interval > 500 msec or a prolongation > 60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.2% in the escitalopram oral solution and the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.5% in the escitalopram oral solution group and 0.2% in the placebo group.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

### Psychiatric and psychological interventions for depression in patients with heart disease: a scoping review [^1171k3WK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our review of randomized intervention trials for depression in patients with cardiac disease has revealed several themes. First, antidepressants, psychotherapy, and care management have all been proven safe and largely — though not universally — effective in treating and improving mood symptoms among patients with elevated depressive symptoms or MDD in CAD or ACS. In HF, however, antidepressant efficacy has not been demonstrated, while psychotherapy and care management generally have been more effective.

Regarding antidepressants, overall, based on existing evidence, SSRIs should be considered a first‐line therapy in patients with cardiac disease who merit treatment based on a diagnosis of MDD, especially those with CAD. SSRIs are the most studied agents in populations with cardiac disease, with efficacy in treating depression in most studies. Sertraline has been the most studied SSRI, and may be preferred because it does not (in contrast to citalopram and escitalopram) prolong the QT interval. 79 Among patients with CAD/outcomes, observational evidence points to possible cardiovascular benefits of SSRIs, 16 and nonresponse of mood symptoms to antidepressants is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes, including an elevated risk of mortality, in patients with cardiac disease. 11, 80 However, at this stage there have been few definitive prospective trials that have found SSRIs to prevent cardiac events, readmissions, or mortality. The EsDEPACS trial did show reduction in major adverse cardiac events and all‐cause mortality over 8‐year follow‐up when escitalopram was used in patients with ACS, 28 showing potential promise in using SSRIs to improve cardiac outcomes, but substantial further study is needed.

As noted, antidepressants have been less effective in HF, with similar response rates in antidepressant and placebo groups. It is possible that "elevated depressive symptoms" measured by depression scales may simply be measuring somatic symptoms common in this chronic disease rather than true depression, that the mechanism of depression differs in patients with HF, or more powerful or individualized interventions are needed in this chronic disease. Study design may also play a role. For example, the SADHART‐CHF trial provided weekly nursing support, which may have improved mood symptoms sufficiently to mask any sertraline‐specific effects. 54 Fortunately, SSRIs do appear to be safe in patients with HF, which still makes them a potentially reasonable approach for individuals when other treatments are not readily available or as an inexpensive complement to psychotherapeutic or care management supportive interventions.

### Citalopram (Celexa) [^1161NZxr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of citalopram hydrobromide PO (also known as Celexa):
- Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: do not discontinue abruptly in any patient.
- Bleeding: use caution in patients taking aspirin, NSAIDs, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Monitor INR in patients on warfarin.
- Exacerbation of acute angle-closure glaucoma: use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. Avoid use if possible.
- Exacerbation of seizure: use caution in patients with seizure disorder.
- Hyponatremia, SIADHs: use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics.
- Prolonged QT interval: use caution in all patients, as citalopram causes dose-dependent QT prolongation. Do not exceed 40 mg once daily.
- Prolonged QT interval: use caution in patients aged > 60 years, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, or patients taking other CYP2C19 inhibitors, as higher citalopram exposures would be expected. Do not exceed 20 mg once daily.
- Reactivation of mania: use caution in patients with bipolar disorder. Screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania before initiating citalopram.
- Serotonin syndrome: use caution in patients taking other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, TCAs, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort). Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
- Sexual dysfunction: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SSRIs have been associated with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory delay or failure in males, and decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm in females.
- Torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias: use extreme caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated HF, or taking other QT-prolonging drugs. Avoid use unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Obtain ECG monitoring when used.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of escitalopram for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram tablets 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of escitalopram was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open-label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 7 years of age.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos) [^116CMq6f]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

ACTOS, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when ACTOS is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of ACTOS must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2 Edema

In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with ACTOS than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.

ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including ACTOS, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, ACTOS should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with ACTOS should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

### Effect of escitalopram on all-cause mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure and depression: the MOOD-HF randomized clinical trial [^1153MfMs]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Depression is frequent in patients with heart failure and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Long-term efficacy and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in these patients are unknown.

Objective

To determine whether 24 months of treatment with escitalopram improves mortality, morbidity, and mood in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Effects of Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibition on Morbidity, Mortality, and Mood in Depressed Heart Failure Patients (MOOD-HF) study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 16 tertiary medical centers in Germany. Between March 2009 and February 2014, patients at outpatient clinics with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 45%) were screened for depression using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Patients with suspected depression were then invited to undergo a Structured Clinical Interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to establish the diagnosis.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive escitalopram (10–20 mg) or matching placebo in addition to optimal heart failure therapy. Study duration was 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The composite primary outcome was time to all-cause death or hospitalization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included safety and depression severity at 12 weeks of treatment (including the titration period), which were determined using the 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (total possible score, 0 to 60; higher scores indicate more severe depression).

Results

A total of 372 patients (mean age, 62 years; 24% female) were randomized and had taken at least 1 dose of study medication when the data and safety monitoring committee recommended the trial be stopped early. During a median participation time of 18.4 months (n = 185) for the escitalopram group and 18.7 months (n = 187) for the placebo group, the primary outcome of death or hospitalization occurred in 116 (63%) patients and 119 (64%) patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.27]; p = 0.92). The mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale sum score changed from 20.2 at baseline to 11.2 at 12 weeks in the escitalopram group and from 21.4 to 12.5 in the placebo group (between-group difference, -0.9 [95% CI,-2.6 to 0.7]; p = 0.26). Safety parameters were comparable between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and depression, 18 months of treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality or hospitalization, and there was no significant improvement in depression. These findings do not support the use of escitalopram in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression.

### Long-term cardiac outcomes of depression screening, diagnosis and treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome: the DEPACS study [^1176JsP1]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The nested randomised controlled trial: EsDEPACS study

Of the 501 screen-positive participants, 55 had no depressive disorder. Of the remaining 446 patients with a diagnosis of major (N = 202) or minor (N = 244) depressive disorder, 300 who met the eligibility criteria and agreed to participate were enrolled in a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of escitalopram, the EsDEPACS study (ClinicalTrial.gov registry number: NCT00419471). Higher participation rates were noted in those with more severe depressive symptoms, resulting in major depressive disorder prevalences of 57.0% (85/149) in escitalopram-allocated and 55.6% (84/151) in placebo-allocated participants, compared to 22.6% (33/146) in the remaining patients with the depressive disorder who were not randomised. The first patient was enrolled in May 2007, and the last patient completed follow-up evaluation in March 2013. Examinations were scheduled at baseline, and in weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 thereafter. The dose of the study drug was 10 mg/day initially and could be changed (from 5 to 20 mg/day) according to the investigators' clinical decision, taking into account response and tolerability after the second evaluation. The mean doses at the last visit were 7.6 (3.7) mg for the escitalopram group and 8.5 (3.9) mg for the placebo group. Adherence was checked by pill counts at every visit, and was defined as acceptable if at least 75%. Adherence to medications was 93.3% and 95.4% in patients receiving escitalopram and placebo, respectively. Depression treatment, including antidepressant use other than study drugs, was not allowed during the study period. With respect to the ethics of the use of placebo in patients with depressive symptoms, the following considerations should be noted: (i) because of the lack of evidence for the effect of depression treatment shortly following ACS at the time the study was designed, the EsDEPACS trial was judged both by funders and an independent ethics review panel to be addressing an issue of clinical equipoise (Kim et al.); (ii) besides providing study drugs, research psychiatrists met with the patients for at least 30 min at every visit and evaluated their psychological symptoms using simple support and reassurance after cardiology treatment; (iii) participants could withdraw from the trial at any point and for any reason; (iv) for participants without remission after the trial, further treatment was facilitated when requested; (v) all participants were approached for the evaluation of psychiatric outcomes 1 year after baseline evaluation (Kim et al.). The details and main results of this trial have been published previously (Kim et al.), in which escitalopram was superior to placebo in treating depression without significant difference in adverse events. The remaining 146 participants who did not meet the eligibility criteria or declined participation in the trial received conventional medical treatment for ACS only (MTO). The MTO and screen-positive but had no depressive disorder participants were recommended treating depressive symptoms wherever possible.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112JTibZ]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): TCAs have numerous documented cardiovascular side effects, including sinus tachycardia and postural hypotension; they also prolong the duration of the QRS interval and QTc interval, and second- and third-degree heart block can develop. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a very low rate of adverse cardiovascular effects, and in prospective studies of patients with HF, post-MI, or unstable angina, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine had minimal to no effect on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic indices of cardiac function. However, in 2011 the FDA issued a safety announcement that citalopram should not exceed 40 mg/d because of the risk of dose-dependent QTc prolongation that could lead to TdP, and the FDA recommended avoiding use in patients with decompensated HF.

### Escitalopram oxalate [^115sUNk1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day.

With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2 to 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent.

Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food.

Distribution

The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable.

Elimination

Biotransformation of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 27 to 32 hours. The oral clearance of escitalopram is 600 mL/min, with approximately 7% of that due to renal clearance.

### Rationale and design of a randomised, controlled, multicenter trial investigating the effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibition on morbidity, mortality and mood in depressed heart failure patients (MOOD-HF) [^117EVUge]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Depression and chronic heart failure (CHF) are common conditions, both of which are clinically and economically highly relevant. Major depression affects 20–40% of CHF patients and predicts adverse outcomes in terms of quality of life, morbidity and mortality as well as health care expenditure, independent of other factors of prognostic relevance.

Aims

The purpose of the MOOD-HF trial is to clarify whether antidepressant pharmacotherapy improves outcome in CHF patients, and if so by which mechanism(s).

Methods

MOOD-HF is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-armed, parallel-group multicenter trial investigating the effects of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram on morbidity and mortality (primary endpoint), severity of depression, anxiety, cognitive function, quality of life and health care expenditure in 700 patients with symptomatic systolic CHF and major depression diagnosed by structured clinical interview. All patients will receive optimised pharmacotherapy for CHF. Duration of follow-up, including close safety monitoring, is 12–24 months from randomisation.

Perspective

MOOD-HF is the first prospective randomised controlled trial to assess the effects of antidepressant pharmacotherapy on hard somatic endpoints, the mechanism(s) of action of SSRI treatment, as well as safety in New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF patients. The results are expected to promote the development of evidence-based recommendations for managing depression in the context of CHF.

Lexapro and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with Lexapro treatment.

ECG Changes

Electrocardiograms from Lexapro (N = 625) and placebo (N = 527) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). None of the patients in the Lexapro group had a QTcF interval > 500 msec or a prolongation > 60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.2% in the Lexapro and the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.5% in the Lexapro group and 0.2% in the placebo group.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

After initiation of pioglitazone, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered.
Pioglitazone is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure.
Initiation of pioglitazone in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated [see and].

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1127mihJ]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Child/adolescent pharmacotherapy — scope of recommendations: While there is clear evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials for the use of fluoxetine (Prozac) in children and adolescents, there is limited evidence meeting the IOM or AMSTAR criteria for other antidepressants, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidepressant for youth, escitalopram (Lexapro). In the panel's review of the evidence for escitalopram, we were unable to recommend for or against this medication, and the panel has elected not to provide a recommendation on the use of Nefazodone (Serzone) as an antidepressant given its lack of clinical relevance for current practice. The panel concludes that the strongest evidence for a pharmacologic treatment for adolescent depression is for fluoxetine (Prozac), and if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.

Laboratory Changes

Escitalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with escitalopram treatment.

ECG Changes

Electrocardiograms from escitalopram (N = 625) and placebo (N = 527) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). None of the patients in the escitalopram group had a QTcF interval > 500 msec or a prolongation > 60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.2% in the escitalopram and the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.5% in the escitalopram group and 0.2% in the placebo group.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day.

With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2–2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent.

Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food.

Distribution

The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable.

Elimination

Biotransformation of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 27–32 hours. The oral clearance of escitalopram is 600 mL/min, with approximately 7% of that due to renal clearance.

### Citalopram hydrobromide [^111xMVfS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION — Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of citalopram).

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for citalopram should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT prolongation and should not be dosed above 40 mg/day. Torsade de Pointes has been reported postmarketing. Citalopram should not be used in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval. Dose escalations over 20 mg/day in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor are not recommended.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro for the treatment of major depressive disorder have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of Lexapro for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of Lexapro was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open- label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for Lexapro.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have been established in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older. Use of Lexapro for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with GAD [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety of Lexapro was similar to adult patients with GAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Safety and efficacy of sertraline for depression in patients with CHF (SADHART-CHF): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline for major depression with congestive heart failure [^112pJNcV]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Sertraline, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, has demonstrated substantial mood improvement in patients with post myocardial infarction or with unstable angina. The impact of sertraline on the prognosis and depression of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) is unknown.

Method

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of MDD in patients with HF. The study is designed also to examine the effects of treating depression on cardiac events and morbidity/mortality in patients with HF. Approximately 500 men and women who are ≥ 45 years of age with current MDD and chronic systolic HF, characterized by left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% and New York Heart Association class ≥ II, comprise the study population. Eligible participants are randomized to either sertraline or placebo for a 12-week acute treatment phase. All patients, regardless of acute treatment phase completion, are followed routinely until the last subject completes 6-month follow-up. Quality of life and certain physiologic parameters, as well as pro-inflammatory and HF biomarkers, that may reflect the impact of sertraline in this particular population are measured at baseline and at the end of the acute treatment phase.

Conclusion

Because of the high prevalence of depression and its significant adverse impact on prognosis of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and HF, the Safety and Efficacy of Sertraline for Depression in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure (SADHART-CHF) trial aims to assess the effects of sertraline on response of depression as well as on the cardiac prognosis of patients with HF.

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Lexapro, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Approximately 6% of the 1144 patients receiving escitalopram in controlled trials of escitalopram oral solution in major depressive disorder and GAD were 60 years of age or older; elderly patients in these trials received daily doses of escitalopram oral solution between 10 mg and 20 mg. The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age. Nevertheless, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals to effects of escitalopram oral solution cannot be ruled out.

SSRIs and SNRIs, including escitalopram oral solution, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Hyponatremia (5.6)].

In two pharmacokinetic studies, escitalopram half-life was increased by approximately 50% in elderly subjects as compared to young subjects and Cmaxwas unchanged [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Of 4422 patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but again, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out.

### Psychiatric and psychological interventions for depression in patients with heart disease: a scoping review [^115wtaoW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Three studies have examined longer‐term effects on major cardiac events. Follow‐up from the EsDEPACS trial found those assigned to the escitalopram group to have lower rates of major adverse cardiac events at 8 years compared with those who had received placebo, 28 but the MIND‐IT trial found no effects on cardiac events at the end of the intervention, 31 or at 8‐year follow‐up, and no effect on all‐cause mortality. However, patients in that study who received any depression treatment (pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy/counseling) had reduced all‐cause mortality compared with those who did not, regardless of randomization status. 32

Finally, the ENRICHD (Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease) study was a psychotherapy intervention trial (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] versus usual care) in 2481 post‐MI patients with MDD in which some participants in the CBT arm (those with severe or persistent depression) were offered supplemental sertraline, and those in the treatment as usual group were sometimes provided SSRIs by their primary clinicians. Among the patients with depression in either condition, risk of death or recurrent MI and all‐cause mortality was significantly reduced in patients prescribed SSRIs, compared with patients who were not (effects of the primary intervention on depression is discussed below, under Psychotherapy). 16

SSRIs for HF

Interventions for patients with HF are outlined in Table 2. Sertraline was studied against placebo in 469 patients with HF in the SADHART‐CHF (Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Congestive Heart Failure) trial. This trial examined sertraline compared with enhanced usual care that included a nurse‐facilitated support intervention. The investigators found no between‐group differences in depression reduction in depression at 12 weeks. 54 Escitalopram was also explored in the MOOD‐HF (Effects of Selective Serotonin Re‐Uptake Inhibition on Morbidity, Mortality, and Mood in Depressed Heart Failure Patients) trial on 372 patients with depression with HF and likewise found no differences in depression scores. 55 In a smaller study, Fraguas and associates studied citalopram in 37 elderly patients with HF with depression, where they found nonsignificant superiority of citalopram over placebo. 56 Regarding cardiac outcomes, the SADHART‐CHF found no effect on cardiovascular events or surrogate markers at 12 weeks 54 and the MOOD‐HF trial found no reduction in all‐cause mortality or hospitalization after 18 months. 55

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lexapro® is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for:

Acute and Maintenance Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents aged 12–17 years (1.1)
Acute Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults (1.2)

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Lexapro (escitalopram) is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Lexapro is indicated for the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of escitalopram for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of escitalopram was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open- label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 7 years of age.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials of escitalopram, there were reports of escitalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 600 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of escitalopram, Lexapro overdoses involving overdoses of over 1000 mg have been reported. As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of escitalopram has been rarely reported.

Symptoms most often accompanying escitalopram overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, included convulsions, coma, dizziness, hypotension, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, somnolence, and ECG changes (including QT prolongation and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdose

Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for Lexapro.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.

### Citalopram hydrobromide [^111ePwLu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.

QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

Citalopram causes dose dependent QT prolongation and should not be dosed above 40 mg/day. Torsade de Pointes has been reported postmarketing. Citalopram should not be used in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval. Dose escalations over 20 mg/day in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor are not recommended.

Drug Interactions

Drugs that Prolong the QT interval: ECG monitoring is recommended with concomitant medications that have demonstrated prolongation of the QT interval (see WARNINGS- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes).

Serotonergic Drugs: Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including citalopram, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when citalopram is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's Wort (see WARNINGS-Serotonin Syndrome). The concomitant use of citalopram with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).

Triptans: There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome).

CNS Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs.

### Escitalopram oxalate (escitalopram) [^111AXeZH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Population Subgroups

Age

Adolescents - In a single dose study of 10 mg escitalopram, AUC of escitalopram decreased by 19%, and Cmaxincreased by 26% in healthy adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age) compared to adults. Following multiple dosing of 40 mg/day citalopram, escitalopram elimination half-life, steady-state Cmaxand AUC were similar in patients with MDD (12 to 17 years of age) compared to adult patients. No adjustment of dosage is needed in adolescent patients.

Elderly - Escitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects ≥ 65 years of age were compared to younger subjects in a single-dose and a multiple-dose study. Escitalopram AUC and half-life were increased by approximately 50% in elderly subjects, and Cmaxwas unchanged. 10 mg is the recommended dose for elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Gender - Based on data from single- and multiple-dose studies measuring escitalopram in elderly, young adults, and adolescents, no dosage adjustment on the basis of gender is needed.

Reduced hepatic function - Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 10 mg is the recommended dose of escitalopram for most hepatically impaired patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Reduced renal function - In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).

Drug-Drug Interactions

In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of escitalopram on CYP3A4, -1A2, -2C9, -2C19, and -2E1. Based on in vitro data, escitalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. While in vivo data to address this question are limited, results from drug interaction studies suggest that escitalopram, at a dose of 20 mg, has no 3A4 inhibitory effect and a modest 2D6 inhibitory effect. See Drug Interactions (7.18) for more detailed information on available drug interaction data.

### Escitalopram oral (escitalopram oral solution) [^116wS16B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day.

With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2–2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent.

Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food.

Distribution

The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable.

Elimination

Biotransformation of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 27–32 hours. The oral clearance of escitalopram is 600 mL/min, with approximately 7% of that due to renal clearance.

### Safety and efficacy of sertraline for depression in patients with heart failure: results of the SADHART-CHF (sertraline against depression and heart disease in chronic heart failure) trial [^114MYyQM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to test the hypothesis that heart failure (HF) patients treated with sertraline will have lower depression scores and fewer cardiovascular events compared with placebo.

Background

Depression is common among HF patients. It is associated with increased hospitalization and mortality.

Methods

The SADHART-CHF (Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart Failure) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day versus matching placebo for 12 weeks. All participants also received nurse-facilitated support. Eligible patients were age 45 years or older with HF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) and clinical depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria for current major depressive disorder). Those with significant cognitive impairment, psychosis, recent alcohol or drug dependence, bipolar or severe personality disorder, active suicidal ideation, and current antipsychotic or antidepressant medications were excluded. Primary end points were change in depression severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score) and composite cardiovascular status at 12 weeks.

Results

A total of 469 patients were randomized (n = 234 sertraline, n = 235 placebo). The mean ± SE change from baseline to 12 weeks in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score was -7.1 ± 0.5 (sertraline) and -6.8 ± 0.5 (placebo) (p < 0.001 from baseline, p = 0.89 between groups, mean change between groups -0.4; 95% confidence interval: -1.7 to 0.92). The proportions whose composite cardiovascular score worsened, improved, or was unchanged were 29.9%, 40.6%, and 29.5%, respectively, in the sertraline group and 31.1%, 43.8%, and 25.1%, respectively, in the placebo group (p = 0.78).

Conclusions

Sertraline was safe in patients with significant HF. However, treatment with sertraline compared with placebo did not provide greater reduction in depression or improved cardiovascular status among patients with HF and depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^1145fyoT]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the frail are vulnerable, medication adverse effects may impact their quality of life and health status to a greater extent compared to healthier adults. Thus, both potential risks and benefits related to treatment need to be equally considered in the context of frailty.

The harms reported in this meta-analysis appear to be minor. However, nausea, fatigue, constipation, and dizziness were more frequent with antidepressants compared to placebo, which may be burdensome for frail older adults who are less able to tolerate perturbations in health due to decreased reserve. Notably, rates of withdrawal due to adverse events in subjects receiving antidepressants was twice the rate for those receiving placebo. In addition, frail older adults with multiple co-morbidities are at risk of polypharmacy. As the number of medications increase, so too does the potential for adverse medication events related to antidepressants.
5 Is there further evidence pertaining to frail populations?

Although frail patients may not be specifically enrolled in randomized controlled trials, other categories of evidence can shed light on frailty response. Here, we consider two sources: (1) examination of medical conditions that are significantly associated with frailty; and (2) observational studies.

We deliberated on two medical conditions that are associated with high rates of frailty — heart failure and Parkinson's disease.

With heart failure, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the overall estimated prevalence of frailty was 44.5% (95% CI: 36.2–52.8%, z = 10.54, p < 0.001). Similarly, a substantial number of individuals with Parkinson's disease would be considered frail, as this illness typically affects mobility.

Two DBRCTs of adults with heart failure found that antidepressants did not improve depression compared to placebo. The Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart Failure (SADHART-CHF) included 469 subjects with a mean age of 62. At 12 weeks, there was no significant difference in depression scores for sertraline compared to placebo. Similarly, the Mortality, Morbidity, and Mood in Depressed Heart Failure Patients (MOOD-HF) trial, which included 372 adults with a mean age of 62 years, showed that there was no significant improvement in depression with escitalopram compared to placebo.

### Escitalopram (Escitalopram oxalate) [^115TvP57]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Approximately 69 patients (6%) of the 1,144 patients receiving escitalopram in controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder and GAD were 60 years of age or older [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]. The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age. Nevertheless, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals to effects of escitalopram cannot be ruled out.

In two pharmacokinetic studies, escitalopram half-life was increased by approximately 50% in subjects 65 years and older as compared to young subjects and Cmaxwas unchanged [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended dosage of escitalopram for elderly patients is 10 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

SSRIs, including escitalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Of 4,422 patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, 1,357 were 60 and over, 1,034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the geriatric and younger patients, but again, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Increased citalopram exposure occurs in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended dosage of escitalopram in patients with hepatic impairment is 10 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

Pharmacokinetics of escitalopram in patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 mL/minute has not been evaluated. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
