## Question

A 45-year-old man presents an urgent care clinic because he coughed up blood this morning. Although he had a persistent cough for the past 3 weeks, he had never coughed up blood until now. His voice is hoarse and admits that it has been like that for the past few months. Both his past medical history and family history are insignificant. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day since the age of 20 and drinks wine every night before bed. His vitals are: heart rate of 78/min, respiratory rate of 14/min, temperature of 36.5°C (97.8°F), blood pressure of 140/88 mm Hg. An indirect laryngoscopy reveals a rough vegetating lesion on the free border of the right vocal cord. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Leukoplakia
B. Polypoid corditis
C. Vocal cord nodule
D. Laryngeal carcinoma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely in a 45-year-old smoker who presents with hemoptysis, a persistent cough, hoarseness, and a rough vegetating lesion on the vocal cord, and wants to understand why laryngeal carcinoma is favored over leukoplakia, polypoid corditis, and vocal cord nodules. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the red flags in the history and exam that raise concern for malignancy. Then, I should verify how the laryngoscopic morphology maps onto benign versus malignant pathology. Next, I will review the differential diagnoses and weigh how each fits the clinical picture. Finally, I should confirm the immediate next steps in evaluation and management, including biopsy and staging imaging, to ensure the reasoning is actionable and evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the red flags. Hemoptysis in a smoker is a high-risk alarm symptom and warrants urgent evaluation for malignancy even when the amount is small, and hoarseness persisting beyond a few weeks in a smoker is itself a red flag that should prompt expedited laryngoscopy and consideration of head and neck cancer, especially when combined with tobacco exposure and alcohol use, which synergistically increase risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx [^1175Tb97] [^112GVJif] [^1124sUiv].

> Wait, let me verify the risk quantification. The patient has a 25 pack-year smoking history and daily alcohol use. Smoking increases the odds of head and neck cancer roughly 2–3 fold, and alcohol acts synergistically with tobacco to further elevate risk, so his baseline risk is substantially elevated even before considering symptoms and endoscopic findings [^112GVJif] [^1124sUiv].

> I will now examine the laryngoscopic morphology. A rough, vegetating lesion on the free edge of a vocal cord is highly concerning for invasive squamous cell carcinoma rather than a benign process. Benign lesions like nodules are typically bilateral, symmetric, and smooth, whereas exophytic, irregular, or ulcerated lesions with increased vascularity are suspicious for malignancy and should be biopsied promptly, particularly when hoarseness has persisted for months and hemoptysis is present [^113Av9FC] [^1136gn8V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the differential and test each option against the data. Leukoplakia can appear as a white patch on the vocal fold and is a premalignant lesion, but it is typically flat or plaque-like rather than vegetating and exophytic, and it does not usually bleed unless frankly dysplastic or malignant, so the morphology here argues against isolated leukoplakia as the primary explanation for hemoptysis [^113Av9FC]. Polypoid corditis, or Reinke's edema, presents with diffuse, bilateral, edematous thickening of the vocal cords and is strongly linked to chronic smoking; it is not focal or exophytic and would be unlikely to cause bleeding, which makes it a poor fit for a solitary vegetating lesion with hemoptysis [^1136gn8V]. Vocal cord nodules are bilateral, symmetric, small, and located at the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of the vocal folds in patients with vocal overuse; they are smooth and non-vegetating, and again would not explain bleeding, so they are inconsistent with the described lesion [^1136gn8V].

> Let me consider the leading diagnosis more carefully. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma accounts for the vast majority of primary laryngeal malignancies, typically arises in smokers, and commonly presents with persistent hoarseness due to glottic involvement; exophytic or ulcerative lesions can bleed, explaining hemoptysis, and the combination of a focal, rough, vegetating glottic lesion with smoking history and alarm symptoms is classic for SCC and mandates urgent biopsy and staging [^11489WeG] [^113Av9FC].

> I should double-check the immediate next steps to ensure the plan is aligned with guidelines. Highly suspicious laryngeal lesions require prompt surgical biopsy with histopathologic evaluation, and patients with suspected laryngeal carcinoma should undergo staging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the neck and chest to define local extent and nodal disease; PET/CT may be added for advanced disease or equivocal nodes, and this approach is supported by radiologic reviews and otolaryngology guidelines for suspected malignancy [^113Av9FC] [^116SdXMM].

> But wait, what if the hemoptysis is actually from a lower airway source rather than the larynx? I need to ensure we do not miss an intrathoracic malignancy. Even with a convincing laryngeal lesion, smokers with hemoptysis have a meaningful rate of concurrent thoracic malignancy, so chest CT and bronchoscopy remain indicated to evaluate the tracheobronchial tree for additional primaries or metastatic disease, particularly when the chest radiograph is normal or nonlocalizing, as bronchoscopy can reveal endobronchial tumors missed on plain films [^113N34KY] [^113uznSR].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal carcinoma, given the patient's smoking and alcohol risk profile, the red flags of hemoptysis and persistent hoarseness, and the laryngoscopic appearance of a rough, vegetating glottic lesion that is morphologically incompatible with benign nodules, polypoid corditis, or flat leukoplakia. Urgent biopsy and cross-sectional staging are indicated to confirm diagnosis and guide oncologic management [^11489WeG] [^113Av9FC] [^116SdXMM].

The most likely diagnosis is **laryngeal carcinoma** (squamous cell carcinoma) [^11489WeG] given the patient's heavy smoking history, persistent hoarseness, and the finding of a rough, vegetating lesion on the vocal cord [^112GVJif]. Hemoptysis further raises suspicion for malignancy [^113N34KY]. Leukoplakia, polypoid corditis, and vocal cord nodules are less likely due to their typical appearances and clinical courses [^1136gn8V]. Definitive diagnosis requires **biopsy and imaging** [^113Av9FC].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Findings on laryngoscopy** | **Likelihood in this patient** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Laryngeal carcinoma (squamous cell carcinoma) | - Persistent hoarseness <br/> - Hemoptysis <br/> - Smoking history <br/> - Alcohol use | Rough, vegetating lesion on vocal cord | High |
| Leukoplakia | - White patch on vocal cord <br/> - Premalignant lesion | White, flat or slightly raised lesion | Moderate |
| Polypoid corditis (Reinke's edema) | - Chronic hoarseness <br/> - Smoking history | Diffuse, polypoid swelling of vocal cords | Moderate |
| Vocal cord nodule | - Hoarseness <br/> - Voice overuse | Small, smooth, bilateral nodules at the junction of anterior and middle thirds of vocal cords | Low |

---

## Analysis of clinical findings

- **Smoking history**: The patient has a 25 pack-year smoking history, significantly increasing the risk of laryngeal carcinoma [^111PH2PK].

- **Persistent hoarseness**: Hoarseness lasting more than three weeks, especially in smokers, is a red flag for malignancy [^notfound].

- **Hemoptysis**: Coughing up blood is a concerning symptom that warrants immediate evaluation for malignancy [^113N34KY].

- **Laryngoscopic findings**: A rough, vegetating lesion on the vocal cord is highly suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of laryngeal cancer [^11489WeG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **laryngeal carcinoma (squamous cell carcinoma)** [^11489WeG]. The patient's smoking history, persistent hoarseness, hemoptysis, and the characteristic appearance of the lesion on laryngoscopy strongly support this diagnosis [^112GVJif]. Immediate referral to an otolaryngologist for biopsy and imaging studies (CT or MRI) is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and stage the disease [^113Av9FC] [^116SdXMM].

Lesions of the mediastinum

The RLNs course within the upper mediastinum, placing them at risk for injury due to a number of mediastinal processes. Numerous pathologies of the cardiovascular structures of the mediastinum (pulmonary artery aneurysm) can present with VCP as can any number of infectious/inflammatory and neoplastic etiologies with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (endocarditis) (Figs. 19, 20, 21, and 22). Mediastinal lesions typically cause VCP as a result of mass effect.

### Pulmonary thromboembolism presenting with hoarseness of voice [^112bFJgU]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A young man in his late 30s with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis presented with complaints of hoarseness of voice persisting for 6months. Chest auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds over the right lung field. An initial chest X-ray showed collapse of the right lung with mediastinal shift towards right. Fibreoptic laryngoscopy revealed sluggish movement of the left vocal cord. CT neck showed focal nodular thickening in the left false vocal cord and thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery. The subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram performed revealed right pulmonary thromboembolism and dilated main pulmonary artery which were treated with anticoagulants. There was a partial improvement of symptoms. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is a life-threatening condition often presenting with dyspnoea, chest pain and haemoptysis. However, atypical presentations can challenge diagnosis and delay treatment initiation. Timely diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation therapy are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes in patients with PTE presenting with unusual manifestations.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough… [^115zWRkW]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic cough can have many causes, but only a few diseases account for most cases 2, 4. 1, 2, 5–7 In adults, postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the most common causes and have been referred to as a "pathogenic triad of chronic cough. " 5 This disease triad accounts for nearly all cases of chronic cough in nonsmokers who have essentially normal chest radiographs and are not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Evaluating Immunocompetent Adults The evaluation of chronic cough should begin with a thorough medical history and a focused physical examination. If the history reveals tobacco smoking, the patient should be instructed to quit smoking. If the history reveals environmental exposures, the patient should be instructed to avoid the triggering substances. If the patient is taking a medication that is known to cause cough, the patient should be switched to another agent.

Bronchogenic carcinoma is a much less likely diagnosis in a patient who has never smoked. However, this cancer remains a valid concern in the patient with a cough that has lasted for several months and a history of current or previous cigarette smoking or exposure to industrial toxins, radon, or secondhand smoke. 1, 10–12 The physician should remember that bronchogenic carcinoma is largely asymptomatic in its early stages, and that the use of chest radiography or other routine screening in smokers is not recommended.
13. Postnasal Drip Syndrome This syndrome should be one of the first conditions considered. Alone or in association with some other condition, postnasal drip syndrome is the most common cause of chronic cough in non-smoking, immunocompetent adults who have a normal chest radiograph. No signs or symptoms are specific to cough caused by postnasal drip syndrome; therefore, the diagnosis cannot be made based on the history and physical examination alone.

Other Causes Chronic bronchitis from exposure to cigarette smoke or other irritants is an important cause of chronic cough. 2 Although chronic bronchitis is a relatively common cause of chronic cough, it accounts for only 5 percent of patients who present for evaluation and treatment, perhaps because many persons with "smoker's cough" do not seek medical care. 1 The initial treatment step is to eliminate tobacco smoke or other environmental irritants. 1 In the absence of these irritants, sputum production and airway inflammation should decrease.

### Hemoptysis: a serendipitous discovery [^111MGMWh]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

The etiology of hemoptysis can sometimes be difficult to identify and requires a complete and sequential approach. It is also important to initially maintain a broad differential diagnosis. We present a patient who had an extremely rare adenoid cystic carcinoma of the nasopharynx as the cause of hemoptysis. This also highlights the importance of having a uniformly systematic approach to bronchoscopic inspection, with careful attention to areas beyond the actual tracheobronchial tree. Often, the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal regions are not as meticulously inspected during bronchoscopy. The fact that careful attention to both nares by bronchoscopic inspection aided the final diagnosis suggests that a thorough examination to these often overlooked areas should be routine.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^113V5KQk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) strong key action statements — Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination to identify factors where expedited laryngeal evaluation is indicated; these include, but are not limited to, recent surgical procedures involving the head, neck, or chest; recent endotracheal intubation; presence of concomitant neck mass; respiratory distress or stridor; history of tobacco abuse; and whether the patient is a professional voice user. Clinicians should advocate voice therapy for patients with dysphonia from a cause amenable to voice therapy.

Key points

The clinical symptom of hoarseness carries with it an extensive differential diagnosis, which is not confined to neoplastic etiologies.
The anatomic course of the recurrent laryngeal nerves differs bilaterally, which impacts the geographic extent of imaging coverage required to diagnose causative lesions.
Laryngeal dysfunction can be caused by lesions located anywhere from the brainstem to the mediastinum.

Using Physical Examination in Identification of RLNP

Physical examination may also be employed prior to ordering a screening test for RLNP in all patients who are suspected of having injury or may be at high risk from consideration of their medical history. The perceptual evaluation of dysphonia using physical examination is important in the diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction before surgery in addition to medical history. Symptoms may include voice hoarseness due to glottal incompetence, dyspnea, stridor, and wheezing without effective relief of symptoms from respiratory treatment. Should unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury be involved, there will be disparities in vocal fold length, which will be demonstrated by high-pitched inspiratory stridor that is confined to the trachea. The patient may present without symptoms, as well, should the paralyzed vocal fold not produce a sufficient obstruction. Under laryngoscopy, the patient should be asked to perform phonation, normal breathing, panting, and repetitive deep breaths without holding the breath. Inspiratory cord adduction of the anterior two-thirds of the vocal folds is consistent with paralysis; however, adduction may also be seen on expiration. Functionality of the vagus nerve should be checked, as a lesion may exist proximal to the branching of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Unilateral vagus dysfunction will present with deviation of the palate to the noninjured side. Additional laboratory tests may be considered to rule out diseases of similar presentation. This includes a pulmonary function test for respiratory illness and neurogenic causes such as syphilis, Lyme disease, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, collagen vascular disease, and myasthenia gravis. If a tumor in the mediastina is suspected, then a chest X-ray film, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging is indicated to identify whether there is an obstruction to the laryngeal nerve. A neck CT scan would also be beneficial for tumors in the neck. Hoarseness may also not involve the recurrent laryngeal nerve, as it may be a symptom of vocal fold hematoma, postoperative laryngitis, postoperative varicose node, and even psychogenic dysphonia, among others. Patients may also be shown to have unilateral RLNP with no observed hoarseness.

### Larynx preservation for patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer [^117P7Zv3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of mild hoarseness, with no associated pain, dysphagia, or stridor. At nasoendoscopy, a lesion was detected involving the whole length of the left vocal cord, with abnormal mucosa also seen in the right ventricle (Fig 1). The left vocal cord movement was impaired. There were no palpable neck nodes. Biopsy under anesthesia revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. He was a current smoker of 30 cigarettes per day (45 pack-year smoking history), and he consumed four standard drinks of alcohol per day. His Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1, and he had no significant comorbidities. Radiologic review of his outside computed tomography scan noted that it was of poor quality, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan was recommended, which showed low-volume T4a disease based on focal thyroid cartilage penetration (Fig 2). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed no evidence of nodal or distant metastasis.

### The relative length of the patient and the primary care interval in patients with 28 common and rarer cancers [^1124aFcB]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The relative contribution of the patient interval in the overall length of the pre-referral interval is also important. Most cancers with two-fold or greater length of patient compared with primary care intervals are characterised by the presence of palpable, visible or noticeable symptoms in most patients – for example, breast (lump), melanoma (pigmented skin lesion), testicular (lump), vulval (vulval ulcer/lesion), endometrial (vaginal bleeding, typically post-menopausal), oropharyngeal (oral ulcer/lesion) and laryngeal (voice hoarseness). These observations advocate the need for either the continuation (where those exist) or the development of new public health interventions aimed at shortening the patient interval associated with those cancers. It should be noted that certain cancers (e.g. laryngeal, oropharyngeal, melanoma and vulval) associated with longest patient intervals also have high patient/primary care interval length ratios.

It should nonetheless be emphasised that, beyond consideration of evidence about the length of patient interval, the selection of symptom – cancer pairs for public health awareness campaigns ought to be informed by a number of factors, including the consideration of the positive predictive value of their common presenting symptoms. Existing campaigns cover symptoms with positive predictive values in the order of 5% – for example, haemoptysis (7.5% and 4.3% for lung cancer in men and women, respectively), haematuria (7.4% and 3.4% for bladder cancer in men and women, respectively), and rectal bleeding (2.4% for colorectal cancer in men). These comparisons provide a pragmatic test about whether other symptom – cancer pairs can be considered as candidates for public health campaigns. Against this background, it should be noted that the positive predictive value of dysphagia for oesophageal cancer in men is 5.7%, whereas that of post-menopausal bleeding for endometrial cancer is 4.0%, that is values that are comparable to those of other symptoms that are already targeted by public health education campaigns. Good-quality evidence about the positive predictive value of oral or vulval ulceration or voice hoarseness in populations of patients consulting in primary care is, however, currently lacking. We strongly support that the selection, design, piloting and implementation of public health awareness campaigns about symptoms likely to be due to cancer require expert multi-disciplinary input (including from epidemiology, psychology and primary care, alongside clinical specialities and other relevant disciplines) and a robust evaluation framework.

### Thymoma with an incidental benign laryngeal mass mimicking laryngeal carcinoma: case report [^1129BwpD]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Thymic carcinomas are rarely seen. Because of recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement, hoarseness is a common presenting symptom. Persistent hoarseness in a male smoker past his fifth decade is also a distinctive symptom for laryngeal carcinoma. Stroboscopic laryngeal examination and biopsy are required for the diagnosis. In this article we describe a case involving a patient with thymic carcinoma who, interestingly, also presented with a benign laryngeal mass with unilateral vocal fold fixation. We emphasize the importance of keeping in mind nonlaryngeal pathologies invading the recurrent laryngeal nerve in patients with persistent hoarseness and a nonspesific laryngeal mass.

Lung cancer intrathoracic spread — structures within the thorax are susceptible to tumor invasion either by local extension or by lymphatic spread, and the most common sites of spread are the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Although nodal metastases rarely cause symptoms, bulky adenopathy in the hila can cause extrinsic airway compression with airway symptoms, and in the subcarinal area, they can compress the midesophagus with resultant dysphagia. More common, symptoms relate to invasion or compression of other structures, including the pleura, nerves, blood vessels, and chest wall, and extension of the primary tumor into the pleura or chest wall causes more localized pain, which may be severe; invasion of the chest wall can cause painful soft tissue masses or rib destruction. Pleural effusion may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor, to implantation of tumor metastasis, or from mediastinal lymphatic obstruction and is typically heralded by dyspnea or chest pain. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy typically is seen in left-sided tumors; the resultant vocal cord paresis causes hoarseness and may predispose to coughing and aspiration, and the right-side recurrent laryngeal nerve is less commonly involved. Superior sulcus tumors are classically associated with some or all the manifestations of Pancoast syndrome. Lung cancer is the most common cause of the superior vena cava syndrome, and patients typically experience facial and neck swelling and, less commonly, may describe dysphagia, cough, headache, dizziness, and blurred vision. The pericardium is the most common site of cardiac involvement by lung cancer either by direct extension or by lymphatic spread, and pericardial effusion, occasionally presenting as pericardial tamponade and arrhythmias, may result.

### A radiologic review of hoarse voice from anatomic and neurologic perspectives [^114QpgKk]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for hoarseness is extensive and includes a multitude of etiologies that span a large geographic area from the brainstem to the mediastinum. Therefore, localizing a causative lesion can be extremely difficult for clinicians and radiologists alike. In this review, we will first discuss the normal anatomy of the larynx and its innervation via the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves. We will then proceed with a guided tour of the various infectious/inflammatory, neoplastic, congenital, and traumatic/iatrogenic causes of hoarseness subdivided by anatomic location (brainstem, skull base, carotid sheath, thyroid, larynx, and superior mediastinum). Along the way, we will discuss the various cross-sectional imaging modalities best suited to detect the often subtle signs of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. With thorough knowledge of these entities, radiologists can impact patient care by suggesting the appropriate imaging test and tailoring their search patterns to detect the subtle findings of laryngeal dysfunction.

Case Presentation

A 65-year-old man with a medical history of anxiety and depression came to the ED with concerns of coughing blood-tinged phlegm for the past 3 days. Four days before the presentation, the patient had a motor vehicle accident as a restrained driver with airbag deployment. The patient struck his chest against the steering wheel. He was evaluated at a level 1 trauma center and underwent a whole-body scan, including a CT scan of the chest, which showed no acute abnormalities. Apart from mild-to-moderate bruising and tenderness on the right side of his face, nose, and anterior chest, the patient was stable and was discharged the next day. After returning home, the patient started coughing blood-tinged phlegm, which became progressively bloodier for the next 3 days, achieving individual posttussive volumes of 1 T of frank blood. In the ED, the patient denied any similar symptoms in the past. He denied any recent or distant known history of malignancy, infections, or travel outside the United States. He lives by himself and previously worked various jobs. He endorsed active tobacco use and smoking 3 to 6 cigarettes per day for the past 20 years with 5 pack-year history. Patient reported consuming one to two alcohol drinks per month.

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management | AAFP… [^117X1XZS]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

4 in recognition of the fact that multiple etiologies, including chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and nonallergic rhinitis, were difficult to differentiate solely by clinical presentation. UACS is the most common cause of chronic cough. 10 Rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, sneezing, itching, and postnasal drainage suggest the diagnosis, but their absence does not rule out UACS. 13 It should be suspected in patients with shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness, but cough can be the only manifestation in cough variant asthma. If the physical examination and spirometry findings are nondiagnostic, bronchial challenge testing should be considered. 14 Resolution of the cough after asthma treatment is also diagnostic. COPD commonly causes chronic cough, but most patients presenting with chronic cough do not have undiagnosed COPD. Signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma also occur in persons with COPD.

Spirometry is diagnostic, and purulent sputum production may also be present. Treatment includes an inhaled bronchodilator, inhaled anticholinergic, inhaled corticosteroid, and a one- to two-week course of oral corticosteroids.
18. Options for Refractory Cough Patients with unexplained chronic cough after evaluation and treatment of common causes should be referred to a pulmonologist or otolaryngologist. The most common causes of chronic cough in children six to 14 years of age are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and UACS. 4, 6, 42 Protracted bacterial bronchitis is characterized by isolated chronic cough, wet/moist cough, resolution of cough with antibiotic treatment, and absence of findings suggestive of an alternative cause. Treatment consists of a two-week course of an appropriate antibiotic, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate. 43, 44.

UACS is rare in children younger than six years, and antihistamines and decongestants are not recommended. 44 GERD does not seem to be as common in children, and empiric proton pump inhibitors are not recommended in the absence of a specific diagnosis. 8 Exposure to tobacco smoke, pets, and environmental irritants should be minimized. Pertussis can be considered but is usually associated with other symptoms, such as a "whoop" sound, apnea, low-grade fever, or vomiting. Less common causes, such as foreign body aspiration, congenital conditions, cystic fibrosis, and immune disorders, should also be considered.

### Risk of cancer in patients with epistaxis and haemoptysis [^114b3TNM]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Several mechanisms may underlie our findings. We found increased risks for cancers of the lung, bronchus, trachea, larynx, pharynx, tongue, and tonsils, likely caused by tumour invasion or compression of blood vessels. Haematological disorders also can lead to bleeding, consistent with the observed increased risk of haematological cancers. At the same time, some of the excess risk observed in the initial 90 days after haemoptysis may have been due to early detection through diagnostic imaging of the thorax.

As the risk of cancer was high for patients with haemoptysis, particularly for smoking- and alcohol-related cancer, it may be reasonable to offer them an extensive diagnostic work-up for cancer. Unfortunately, we lacked information on whether such a work-up would detect more occult cancers, shorten time to cancer diagnosis, and reduce cancer-related mortality. For the last many years, it has been recommended that all patients in Denmark with haemoptysis should be referred to a hospital for a diagnostic cancer work-up. Further research in a potential benefit of extended cancer work-up in patients with airway bleeding is warranted.

Our study has several strengths. All Danish hospitals report inpatient, outpatient and emergency discharge diagnoses to the DNPR. Our ability to (1) identify patients using this comprehensive hospital-based registry, in a national setting with free access to healthcare, and (2) track patients by means of the Civil Registration System permitted unselected patient inclusion and complete follow-up. Cancers were most often histologically verified in the DCR, which is nearly complete and valid due to mandatory reporting throughout the Danish health care system.

Our study population only included patients with epistaxis or haemoptysis managed in a hospital. Most persons with epistaxis are likely not in contact with the health care system. Some of them will receive treatment by general practitioner; and a small proportion of persons are seen at a hospital or outpatient hospital clinic. However haemoptysis and particular recurrent haemoptysis may to a larger extent than for epistaxis lead to consultation with a general practitioner who likely will refer the patient to an X-ray and/or a hospital or outpatient specialist clinic. The positive predictive values of epistaxis and haemoptysis recorded in the DNPR are probably high, but any misclassification would have produced conservative relative effect measures.

Head and neck cancer risk with dysphonia — Smoking is emphasized as a major risk factor and increases the odds of head and neck cancer 2- to 3-fold; concurrent lymphadenopathy or a neck mass should heighten concern; delays in diagnosis can reduce survival rates; and smokers or other at-risk patients with dysphonia "should be assessed with a thorough visual examination of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the larynx and pharynx".

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113N34KY]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer presenting symptoms and diagnostic cues — cough is the most common presentation and may result from endobronchial irritation, parenchymal infiltration, or postobstructive pneumonia. Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomic distribution or relapsing acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should raise concern for neoplasm. Localized or unilateral wheezing may reflect endobronchial obstruction, and pleuritic chest pain should raise concern for invasion of the pleura. Hemoptysis accompanying lung cancer is rarely massive, and hemoptysis may be the presenting symptom of lung cancer even in the setting of a normal or nonlocalizing chest radiograph. Persistent hemoptysis, even in scant amounts, in patients with a history of smoking and COPD should raise concern about the possibility of endobronchial tumor.

### Neck abscess and vocal cord paresis: delayed complications of a self-extruded long fishbone stuck in throat [^117CZv8Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 57-year-old Caucasian man, otherwise fit and well, presented with a 2-week history of dysphagia, odynophagia. Two weeks prior to the presentation, he had felt a fishbone stuck in his throat which was self-extruded after 3 days. Subsequently he developed a right anterior neck swelling and hoarseness. Transnasal endoscopic examination of larynx revealed an injected and oedematous right hemilarynx with right vocal cord paresis. An ultrasound examination of the neck confirmed a collection in the neck on the right side, and frank pus was aspirated from the neck abscess and he responded well to conservative management. Subsequent examination in follow-up had shown complete recovery of vocal cord movement. The patient did not seek medical attention immediately after getting a 5 cm fishbone extruded from the throat which resulted in significant morbidity. All patients should be alerted to the possibility of delayed complications and they should be encouraged to seek urgent medical attention.

### Vocal cord dysfunction: the spectrum across the ages [^112JaVLb]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is an upper airway disorder characterized by exaggerated and transient glottic constriction causing respiratory and laryngeal symptoms. Although the origin of VCD symptoms is in the upper airway, it is frequently misdiagnosed as asthma resulting in significant morbidity. VCD can coexist with asthma or mimic allergic conditions affecting the upper airway. VCD may be difficult to diagnose, because patients are intermittently symptomatic and VCD awareness in the medical community is underappreciated. Once VCD is diagnosed and treated, most patients report significant improvement in their symptoms as well as a decrease in asthma medication use.

### A rare cause of hoarseness: laryngeal verruca vulgaris [^114QUTAZ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Verruca vulgaris is a cutaneous disease manifested with a single or multiple, small painless lesions that may involve keratinized or nonkeratinized epithelium. It can be localized at skin or mucosa. It is a benign lesion; however, it is of importance to discriminate from verrucous carcinoma to plan treatment, especially in those with laryngeal localization. Total excision is adequate in the management of verruca vulgaris; thus, accurate differential diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions. Here, the authors presented a patient with verruca vulgaris which was totally excised by cold-blade surgical excision.

### Tracheal airway obstruction induced by a large glomangioma: discussion of management and literature review [^114uo2Gh]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Case presentation

A man in his early 80s was admitted to the emergency department with respiratory distress and massive haemoptysis. He presented a few days earlier with self-resolving episodes of bloody sputum. His patient history showed an arterial hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, active smoking and moderate alcohol consumption. There was no history of respiratory pathologies, haemorrhagic manifestations of the upper aero digestive tract, coagulopathies, anticoagulants or antiplatelet aggregation therapy.

Emergency upper airway stabilisation and haemostasis were immediately performed in the operating room. The initial endoscopic examination showed an active and significant bleed emerging from a large tumour in the trachea. The patient was therefore intubated with a size five endotracheal tube to insure ventilation.

Taking into account the seriousness of the situation allows surgical tracheotomy between the third and fourth tracheal rings given the location and the lack of knowledge as to the extent of the tumour. A non-fenestrated cuffed tracheal cannula was then introduced.

After securing the airway, an endoscopic examination of the trachea revealed bulging, quite fleshy mass located on the posterior tracheal wall, just below the vocal folds, obstructing approximately 90% of the tracheal lumen and extending 2.5 cm distally (figure 1A). The mass was actively and diffusively bleeding. Haemostasis by electrical bipolar cauterisation was performed, allowing us to control the bleeding; biopsies of the tracheal mass were then performed. After stabilisation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further investigations and management.

Figure 1
(A) Endoscopic view shows the tumour with highly narrowing of the tracheal luminal. (B) Axial CT scan with arterial phase shows the hypervascularity of the tumour. (C) Sagittal CT scan shows the distal extension of the tracheal tumour. (D) Post radiation therapy axial CT scan shows significant reduction of the tumour size.

Preventive intravenous antibiotic with co-amoxicillin 1.2 g, three times daily introduced and local care of the tracheal cannula was carried out regularly. Feeding was done through a nasogastric tube with oral feeding being gradually resumed.

Our institutional tumour board recommended surgical treatment with tracheal resection; the patient refused any form of surgical approach including an endoscopic one. Therefore, an alternative treatment of radiation therapy alone was initiated. The patient presented a second episode of massive bleeding from the tracheal tumour urging surgical haemostasis endoscopically and through the tracheotomy using bipolar cauterisation. The bleeding was controlled without compromising the airway.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^113Av9FC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Suspected malignancy — biopsy approach in dysphonia: Dysphonia may be the presenting symptom in malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract, and surgical biopsy with histopathologic evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of malignancy in upper airway lesions. Highly suspicious lesions with increased vasculature, ulceration, or exophytic growth require prompt biopsy, whereas for superficial white lesions (eg, leukoplakia) on otherwise mobile vocal folds a trial of conservative therapy with avoidance of irritants and treatment of laryngeal candidiasis should be instituted prior to biopsy. Once a diagnosis of cancer has been established, additional surgical management of laryngeal cancer is possible treatment, but discussion of surgical management of laryngeal cancer is beyond the scope of this guideline.

Conclusions

VCP can be caused by any offending lesion in the course of the vagal and recurrent laryngeal nerves, between the medulla oblongata and the aortic arch. Since VCP may be the first presentation of pathology the radiologist has to be aware of (1) the imaging characteristics and mimics of VCP, (2) the expected course of the vagal nerves and recurrent laryngeal nerves, and (3) the different types of pathology that can occur along their course.

### Dieulafoy's disease of the bronchus: rare but potentially fatal: a case report and a review of literature [^114g2EQ6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 41-year-old man was admitted in February 2022 to the pneumology department with sudden onset of massive hemoptysis.

He had a less severe episode of hemoptysis one year ago, concomitant to dental extraction, but was otherwise healthy. He worked as a university professor and was an occasional smoker. Initial clinical examination was normal, aside from sinus tachycardia. Blood biochemistry parameters showed a decrease in hemoglobin level from 14 g/dl to 9 g/dl, indicating blood transfusion.

Bronchoscopy showed bleeding stigma in the right main bronchi and a protruding lesion at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The surface was covered by mucosa and had a white pointed cap (Fig. 1). Blood clots were also noted in the right lower lobe bronchus. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed ground glass opacities at the upper, middle and lower lobes of the right lung (Fig. 2). The right bronchial artery had an ectopic origin from the aortic arche. Further workup with bronchial arteriography revealed no tortuous arteries nor any vascular blush. However, the patient was still coughing up important amounts of fresh blood, approximately 300 mL in an episode, despite prescribing systemic hemostatic treatment.

Nodular protrusion from the mucosa at the entrance of the right upper lobe

Fig. 2
Ground glass opacities of both lungs in computed tomography scans

All of the investigations performed found no evidence of any etiology and vasculitic screen was negative.

Given the findings of the bronchoscopy, we performed an arterial embolization of the right bronchial artery. The left intercostal artery, the left cervico-thoracic artery and the 5th right intercostal artery gave vascular branches to the right hilum and embolization of these arteries was also performed (Fig. 3). However, the procedure failed to prevent the recurrence of his bleeding. The patient developed complications afterwards. He suffered from splenic infarction, bilateral renal infraction and a posterior inferior cerebellar artery stroke, due to spilling of the embolizing agent. The patient also developed acute respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary embolism, proximal on the left side. Ultimately, he required hemostasis surgery.

### A middle-aged man with dyspnea and hoarseness: an unusual case of vocal cord paralysis [^1127sbtJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 49-year-old man was referred to our clinic by an otolaryngologist due to abnormal lung HRCT scan. He had been experiencing progressive shortness of breath for the past year. Initial evaluation by a local pulmonologist included a CT scan and spirometry, which revealed fibrotic changes in the lungs and a restrictive pattern on spirometry. However, due to inadequate follow-up, a definitive diagnosis was not established.

In the preceding two months, the patient developed new-onset hoarseness in addition to worsening shortness of breath. He consulted an otolaryngologist, and video laryngeal stroboscopy (VLS) demonstrated left-sided VCP. To investigate the underlying cause of vocal cord paralysis, further imaging studies, including a neck and chest CT scan and brain MRI, were performed. The brain MRI and neck CT were unremarkable, but the chest CT revealed bilateral upper lobes pleural thickening, parenchymal fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, tracheal dilation and rightward deviation (Fig. 1 a-b). The patient was subsequently referred to our center for further evaluation.

The patient was tall (182 cm) and underweight (55 kg). Physical examination revealed suprasternal notch deepening and platythorax (flattening of the chest cage with reduced anteroposterior diameter). His oxygen saturation was 92% while breathing room air. He had a history of smoking and opium use, both discontinued three years prior. There was no significant past medical history, occupational exposure, or drug history.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmed left-sided vocal cord paralysis (Fig. 2) and rightward tracheal deviation, without mucosal abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage cell differential was normal, and testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Aspergillus via PCR was negative.

There was no clinical or serological evidence of connective tissue disease or vasculitis. Based on typical imaging findings and the exclusion of competing diagnoses, VCP secondary to primary PPFE was considered. Body plethysmography showed a restrictive pattern with an elevated residual volume (RV)/total lung capacity (TLC) ratio, a characteristic feature of PPFE (Table 1).

### Vocal cord gout nodules: a case report and review of the literature [^116RivX2]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Gout nodules (tophi) are formed by a chronic inflammatory reaction in tissues resulting in deposition of urate crystals. They are commonly seen in joints and surrounding tissues, subcutaneous tissues, as well as the pinna and kidney, and are characteristic manifestations of gout. Vocal cord tophi are rarely reported in the literature, and patients often present with hoarseness, progressive dysphagia, and other symptoms. We report a case of a vocal cord mass found by gastroscopy in a patient with a history of gout for more than 20 years. Postoperative pathological findings were vocal cord tophi. Tophi can have serious consequences and should be included in the differential diagnosis of laryngeal masses in patients with a history of gout. Therapy should involve a combination of systemic uric acid-lowering treatment and surgery to improve symptoms and reduce recurrence.

### Vocal cord paralysis: anatomy, imaging and pathology [^117LshNR]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Clinically, vocal cord function can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light can confirm the absence of movement of the affected side. Symptoms of VCP include: hoarseness, vocal fatigue, loss of vocal pitch, shortness of breath and aspiration. However, about 30–40% of patients with unilateral VCP are asymptomatic. In these patients, presence of VCP is an incidental finding and the radiologist may be the first to report it. Due to the wide range of possible locations for lesions that can cause cord paralysis, it may be a first sign of extensive and severe pathology. Radiologists must therefore be able to recognise the imaging findings of VCP.

This review focuses on the anatomy and imaging evaluation of the vagal and recurrent laryngeal nerves and thereby the possible sites for pathology causing VCP. The imaging characteristics and imaging mimics of VCP are discussed and cases from daily practice illustrating various causes of VCP are presented.

### A radiologic review of hoarse voice from anatomic and neurologic perspectives [^117Gfxxj]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysphonia affects one-third of people at some point in their lifetime, and an estimated one in 13 adults experiences hoarse voice annually. Hoarse voice is often used interchangeably with dysphonia; however, the former is a symptom while the latter is a clinical diagnosis. Dysphonia is a broad term for impaired vocal production, including altered quality, pitch, loudness, or effort. Causes for dysphonia can be divided into organic and functional etiologies. Organic dysphonia is due to a physiologic change in vocal production, and is further divided into structural and neurogenic dysphonia. Structural etiologies impact a physical change upon the mechanism of vocal production (i.e. the larynx), while neurogenic etiologies effect via the nervous system (i.e. vagus or recurrent laryngeal nerve or their nuclei). Functional dysphonia is due to vocal overuse or abuse, and can have overlap with organic dysphonia.

Any hoarseness not readily attributable to a benign cause (such as an acute upper respiratory infection) and lasting more than 4 weeks should be further evaluated; this is especially important when there are additional coexisting symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, cough, hemoptysis, unilateral ear/throat pain, neck mass, weight loss, or if there are significant risk factors for head and neck cancer. The first line of investigation is laryngoscopy; however, diagnostic imaging comes into play if a cause is not identified or if further evaluation is warranted.

The biomechanics of phonation is a complex process which can be altered by a wide range of local and systemic processes, many which are not readily apparent on laryngoscopy. The head and neck radiologist must be familiar with the anatomy and pathology of the larynx, as well as the complex supporting laryngeal network. Here, we will briefly review the normal anatomy of the structures of phonation, as well as the course of the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves, then present important etiologies of dysphonia with case examples by location.

### Smokers are less likely than non-smokers to seek help for a lung cancer' alarm' symptom [^114zk7gc]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study 14% of participants had experienced a persistent cough or hoarseness in the past 3 months, of which a fifth were smokers. Smoking status was significantly and independently associated with help-seeking, with smokers less likely to seek help than non-smokers. These findings support previous studies where smokers have avoided medical advice for lung cancer symptoms.

Participants were presented with a 'health survey' rather than a 'cancer survey'. This was done to simulate the circumstances in which new symptoms appear in real life, and avoid participants over-reporting help-seeking as a consequence of being alerted to cancer. It is thus likely that the responses are a good reflection of usual behaviour. We also asked participants about the past 3 months, making recall bias or failings of memory less likely.

A limitation is that we focused on one lung cancer alarm symptom combination (persistent cough or hoarseness). Despite being established symptoms of lung cancer, these are also common symptoms of other benign diseases. In contrast, haemoptysis is comparatively rare and more specific and tends to promote help-seeking. So we may not have captured how participants would react when faced with more 'alarming' symptoms. However, cough and hoarseness are among the most common early symptoms of lung cancer, and so these findings are potentially important. Another limitation is that we did not collect data on whether participants sought help for previous episodes of cough or hoarseness prior to the 3-month window. Research has shown that a previous 'all clear' diagnosis can delay help-seeking for persistent or new symptoms. Renzi et al 's review did not include papers examining the effect of a non-cancer diagnosis on symptoms of lung cancer and so this is a potential area for further investigation.

A 42-year-old man with a significant smoking history presented with chronic expectorative cough and exertional shortness of breath with recent-onset hoarseness. Chest examination was essentially normal and cardiovascular examination was suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Ears, nose and throat evaluation showed left vocal cord palsy and CT scan revealed an aortic arch aneurysm. Ortner's syndrome refers to hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy secondary to a cardiovascular abnormality. Aortic aneurysms usually present with chest pain, back pain or epigastric pain, depending on the site of the aneurysm. An aortic arch aneurysm presenting as hoarseness is extremely rare.

### Laryngitis – diagnosis and management [^1115LeDx]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal inflammation includes a broad spectrum of pathologies, from infectious processes that need to be managed as airway emergencies, to indolent diseases that mimic head and neck cancer. The importance of a thorough history cannot be emphasized enough as it is the most important step toward developing a differential diagnosis. Vocal pathologies often have a noticeable impact on a person's quality of life and daily activities; therefore, it is key to counsel patients on the course of the disease process. Treatment of specific pathologies depends on the causative pathogen or etiology, as well as the age, vocal demands, and clinical characteristics of the individual.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^1167kzad]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination elements for dysphonia: The purpose of this statement is to help clinicians identify the underlying cause of dysphonia, and careful history and physical examination provide important clues to the underlying etiology and can help direct management. The larynx is described as a physiologically complex organ at the intersection of the upper respiratory tract and esophageal inlet, exposed to a variety of pathogens and noxious irritants and at risk for iatrogenic injury, so potential etiologies are very broad and include traumatic, infectious, inflammatory, neurologic, metabolic, neoplastic, congenital, and behavioral factors. The history should include duration, type of onset, potential inciting events, how the condition is affecting the patient, associated symptoms, modifying factors, current medications, habits, concurrent medical conditions, and prior surgery; careful evaluation allows the clinician to categorize dysphonia severity, develop a treatment plan, and prioritize patients who may need escalated care.

### Lymphoma recurrence presenting as vocal cord fixation [^115dB9Bo]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphomas of the larynx are a rare finding. Those with lymphoma of the larynx often present with symptoms such as vocal hoarseness, throat pain, dysphagia, and weight loss. This is a case of a 74-year-old man who presents with new onset of hoarseness and dysphagia. He has a previous history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but was thought to be in remission at the time of presentation. On nasolaryngoscopy, there was a large, right sided, sub-mucosal mass with right vocal cord fixation. Physical exam and computed topography of the neck did not identify any adenopathy. Biopsy confirmed the recurrence of DLBCL isolated to the larynx at the time of diagnosis. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and fully recovered his vocal cord motion with resolution of his hoarseness and dysphagia. Physicians should consider lymphoma in patients presenting with laryngeal complaints especially in patients with a history of lymphoma.

### Unilateral vocal cord paralysis: a review of CT findings, mediastinal causes, and the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerves [^115QMbJV]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Vocal cord paralysis (VCP) may be caused by a variety of mediastinal disease entities, including various neoplastic, inflammatory, and vascular conditions, and may be the presenting symptom of an otherwise clinically occult disease. Familiarity with the spectrum of thoracic diseases that can result in VCP and inclusion of the mediastinum to the level of the aorticopulmonary window (left side) or brachiocephalic artery (right side) in computed tomographic (CT) studies performed for VCP are essential. VCP can be reliably identified at CT by recognizing key findings at the level of the true vocal cords and aryepiglottic folds. Although there are a number of VCP mimics and imaging pitfalls, they can generally be avoided by carefully assessing the scan plane and level and evaluating for additional findings. By understanding and assessing the entire course of the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves, the radiologist can avoid missing causative lesions, many of which have a clinical significance far beyond that of the VCP itself.

### Haemoptysis as the first presentation of COVID-19: a case report [^116g1Lxw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing pandemic that profoundly challenges healthcare systems all over the world. Scientific evidence on this new virus is growing and the clinical characteristics are increasingly understood. Among COVID-19 patients, fever, cough and fatigue are the most commonly reported clinical symptoms. The main reason for hospitalisation is the onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Haemoptysis is rarely reported as a symptom of COVID-19. Only very few cases have been described in literature. Here, we report an unusual case of a man who presented with life-threatening haemoptysis as the first and unique symptom of COVID-19.

### Is investigation of patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph justified? [^1174PhwM]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

Nineteen patients were diagnosed to have malignancy in the 28 patients with bronchoscopy findings suspicious of malignancy (lung, 17; trachea, 1; and larynx, 1). Follow-up bronchoscopies were required in one patient and lung cancer was diagnosed only on the third occasion. Two patients with squamous metaplasia had serial autofluorescence bronchoscopies which ruled out malignancy. FOB was diagnostic of cancer in 14 (54%) of the 26 patients with respiratory tract malignancy (one patient declined FOB).

Twenty-four cancers were diagnosed in the 30 patients who had CT findings suspicious of cancer. Among the 57 patients with abnormal CT scan not suggestive of malignancy, 30 did show unsuspected pulmonary pathology to explain the haemoptysis (bronchiectasis, 16; pneumonia, 11; leiomyoma, 1; pulmonary embolism and bronchiectasis, 1; tuberculosis, 1). The patient with laryngeal carcinoma did not have a CT due to the suspicion of laryngeal cancer at bronchoscopy which was later confirmed by the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeons. CT was suggestive of cancer in 24 (96%) of the 25 patients with respiratory tract malignancy (the patient with laryngeal cancer was referred to the ENT team after bronchoscopy without CT). Investigations carried out following CT and FOB in 16 patients (20 procedures) are listed in table 6.

Table 6
Investigations following CT and fibreoptic bronchoscopy

Among the 26 patients diagnosed to have respiratory tract malignancy in our study, 22 were males (85%) and smokers with an average of 38 pack-years. The median age of these patients was 69 years with age range 33–84 years. Thirteen of these patients reported only streak(s) of haemoptysis. Thirteen patients had only one or two episodes of haemoptysis in total prior to presentation. Seventeen of these patients had haemoptysis lasting less than a week. Only 5 of the 26 patients had recurrent haemoptysis of at least a tablespoonful.

Squamous cell carcinoma

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is by far the most common (98%) primary tumor of the larynx, and can also secondarily involve the larynx when the primary is elsewhere in the oropharynx. SCC generally occurs in men over 50 and was previously associated with smoking and alcohol abuse; however, SCC related to human papilloma virus (HPV) is now more prevalent, and is seen in the younger population with better prognosis. Classification is based on subsite of location in relation to the glottis — supraglottic (20–30%), glottic (50–60%), subglottic (5%), and transglottic (spanning two or more subsites) — and presentation depends on the subsite involved. Glottic lesions often present earlier with dysphonia or aspiration, while subglottic lesions typically present with dyspnea and/or stridor. Purely supraglottic lesions are asymptomatic, thus usually present later with symptoms due to lymphadenopathy or trans-spatial spread, such as tender neck mass, sore throat, dysphagia/odynophagia, or referred ear pain.

Dysphonia — smoking and cancer considerations — dysphonia in smokers is of particular concern because smoking is associated with an increased risk of polypoid vocal fold lesions, leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and head and neck cancer, and thus dysphonia in smokers should prompt expedient laryngoscopy or referral for laryngoscopy as described in KAS 3 (escalation of care); for patients already diagnosed with head and neck cancer, whether they underwent neck radiation is an important historical consideration because it often leads to decline in voice quality.

Case Presentation

A 29-year-old man with a medical history of chronic rhinosinusitis presented with a 6-month history of chronic nonproductive cough and mild exertional dyspnea. Five years ago, at the time of his chronic rhinosinusitis diagnosis, he underwent a chest radiograph that revealed an ill-defined opacity in the middle zone of the left lung, suspicious for neoplasm, and was subsequently lost to follow-up, until he presented now with cough and dyspnea. There was no history of hemoptysis, epigastric discomfort/burning sensation, dysphagia, or post-tussive vomiting associated with cough. Exertional dyspnea was graded as modified Medical Research Council grade 1, and it was not associated with any diurnal or postural variations (orthopnea/trepopnea), chest pain, palpitations, or pedal edema. There was no history of fever, malaise, weight loss, or audible wheeze. The patient had no significant medical history of asthma, COPD, nasal obstruction, urticaria, or other chronic respiratory conditions. He did not smoke and reported no significant occupational or environmental exposures to allergens. There was no history of TB contact or recurrent respiratory infections. Additionally, there was no family history of similar respiratory findings or conditions. During the intervening years, the patient remained asymptomatic until his presentation with the new concerns.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^1111bSyT]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

Low-dose CT lung cancer screening — symptomatic patients and program strategies: We suggest that low-dose CT screening programs develop strategies to determine whether patients have symptoms that suggest the presence of lung cancer so that symptomatic patients do not enter screening programs but instead receive appropriate diagnostic testing regardless of whether the symptomatic patient meets screening eligibility criteria (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In centralized low-dose CT screening programs, the provider that communicates with the patient prior to the low-dose CT should ask about symptoms that would suggest diagnostic testing is indicated, while in de-centralized programs the screening program should assist the ordering provider through educational outreach and/or clinical tools. New symptoms that are poorly explained (eg, coughing, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, hoarseness, bone pains, headaches, vision changes) should prompt consideration of lung cancer, and individuals who present with these symptoms should have diagnostic testing performed unrelated to their screening eligibility.

Case report

A 56 year-old male patient presented with a four-week history of dysphonia (voice hoarseness) and eventual and dysphagia, prompting presentation to his local doctor. He denied any cough, haemoptysis or constitutional symptoms and had no signs of infection. He had no prior history of trauma, surgery, lung disease, vasculopathy or malignancy. There was no personal or family history of connective tissue disease. His only relevant past medical history was idiopathic thrombocytopaenia, with a platelet count as low as 50 × 10⁹/L. On initial investigation, he had a platelet count of 100 × 10⁹/L and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and negative extractable nuclear antigens (ENA). All other blood tests were normal. Repeated blood cultures were negative.

A contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed in the outpatient setting. The bronchial artery pseudoaneurysm was diagnosed on non-angiographic CT. In addition, the CT neck demonstrated indirect features of left RLN palsy including ipsilateral laryngeal ventricle dilatation, medialization of the aryepiglottic fold, medial rotation of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage and mild dilatation of the pyriform sinus (Fig. 1). The coronal reconstruction also showed reduced bulk and pointed morphology of the vocal cord with loss of normal shouldering in the subglottic arch (Fig. 1). The radiological signs were suggestive of RLN palsy in the context of dysphonia and the pseudoaneurysm in the expected location of the left RLN, posteroinferior to the aortic arch involving the tracheo-eosophageal groove. The findings resulted in immediate referral to our tertiary centre for further investigation and management.

Benign inflammatory laryngeal lesions

Repetitive insult to the laryngeal mucosa — such as with singing, yelling, smoking, gastroesophageal reflux — can lead to a number of benign inflammatory lesions, especially of the vocal cords. Although related in etiology, these lesions differ in mechanics of origin and appearance. Vocal cord nodules occur bilaterally and symmetrically at the midpoint of the cords due to high shear force during apposition and subsequent remodeling, similar to a callous. A laryngeal polyp forms after trauma to the submucosal capillary bed, with subsequent exudative inflammatory changes and outpouching of the mucosa (Fig. 5). A laryngeal cyst can appear similar to a laryngocele and may be of two types: retention, due to glandular obstruction and resultant trapped secretions, or epidermoid, which are congenital or due to trauma. Reinke's edema is not a discrete lesion, but is diffuse edema of the vocal cords due to fluid accumulation between the membranous folds (Reinke's space). These lesions do not warrant imaging as they are readily seen by laryngoscopy; however, they may be seen incidentally on head and neck imaging obtained for other reasons.

### Case report of tracheobronchial squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy [^112nmF4B]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Patient 2, a 63-year-old female, initially presented with a productive cough. She had a 60 pack-year history of smoking but had quit 5 years before presentation. Bronchoscopy revealed multiple endotracheal and endobronchial nodules beginning 1 cm below the vocal cords extending to the carina and along the left mainstem bronchus (Fig 1 D; Appendix E1; available as supplementary material online only at). There was no evidence of disease in the right airway. Biopsy revealed SCC in situ with suspected focal invasion. PET CT showed slight FDG uptake in the trachea from the sternal notch to the carina, left mainstem bronchus, and left hilum, consistent with Bhattacharyya stage III. There was no evidence of primary lung tumor or infiltration into bronchus. Given the extensive involvement of the airway, the patient was treated with 66 Gy in 33 fractions using IMRT (Fig 1 F) with 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin and etoposide. Given the difficulty of visualizing disease extent, we used PET CT, bronchoscopy videos, and discussions with the thoracic surgeon and pulmonologist who performed the bronchoscopy to identify anatomic landmarks to demarcate the extent of disease. The internal target volume included the trachea and left mainstem bronchus with a 3 mm CTV margin axially and a 7 mm CTV margin superiorly and inferiorly. There was no elective nodal irradiation. The mean lung dose was 14.2 Gy with a V20 of 27.3% and a V5 of 50.3%. The mean dose to the esophagus was 36.9 Gy with a V55 of 51%.

During treatment, the patient developed moderate dysphagia and esophagitis (RTOG grade 1) and subsequent difficulty with oral intake requiring multiple administrations of intravenous fluids, but able to eat a regular diet throughout therapy. She had grade 3 dermatitis with moist desquamation of the anterior neck. Surveillance bronchoscopies at 4 and 9 months showed no residual or recurrent disease. However, the patient developed hemoptysis at 11 months after chemo-RT. Bronchoscopy at 14 months showed no evidence of disease; however, biopsies of the left mainstem bronchus revealed SCC in situ. Chest CT at this time also revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastatic disease. The patient was hospitalized multiple times with hypoxia, and a chest CT at 16 months revealed an increase in bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease. The patient died at 17 months.

### Hoarseness in adults [^115R2o7U]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hoarseness is a common presentation in primary care practices. Combined with other voice-related changes, it falls under the umbrella diagnosis of dysphonia. Hoarseness has a number of causes, ranging from simple inflammatory processes to less common psychiatric disorders to more serious systemic, neurologic, or cancerous conditions. Medication-induced hoarseness is common and should be considered. The initial evaluation begins with a targeted history and physical examination, while also looking for signs of potential systemic etiologies. Treatment should begin with voice rest, especially avoidance of whispering, and conservative management directed toward a presumptive cause. For example, proton pump inhibitors are appropriate for hoarseness due to reflux, and proper vocal hygiene is recommended for vocal abuse-related indications. In the absence of a clear indication, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, and proton pump inhibitors should not be used for the empiric treatment of hoarseness. Direct visualization of the larynx and vocal folds, commonly mislabeled as vocal cords, should be performed within three months if an etiology has not been determined or if conservative management has been ineffective. Patients who experience symptoms lasting longer than two weeks and who have risk factors for dysplasia (e.g., tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, hemoptysis) may require earlier laryngoscopic evaluation. Voice therapy is effective for improving voice quality in patients with dysphonia if conservative measures are unsuccessful, and it can also be helpful for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals (e.g., vocalists, public speakers). Surgical management is indicated for laryngeal or vocal fold dysplasia or malignancy, airway obstruction, or benign pathology resistant to conservative treatment.

### A radiologic review of hoarse voice from anatomic and neurologic perspectives [^116SdXMM]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

As laryngoscopy can be performed by the otolaryngologist, imaging is used for staging rather than diagnosis. SCC appears as an enhancing soft tissue mass on both computed tomography (CT) and MRI; either may be used for disease surveillance. The lesion is usually isoattenuating to the surrounding mucosa on CT, but may be identified due to architectural distortion and loss of tissue planes (Figs. 6 and 7). On MRI, the lesion is usually T1-hyperintense, T2-hyperintense, and demonstrates high STIR signal due to edema. Positron emission tomography (PET) may be used in conjunction to identify metastatic lymphadenopathy or post-treatment occurrence.

Laryngeal carcinoma. A 59-year-old man with 45-pack-year smoking history presenting with 6 weeks of hoarseness. Axial (a) and coronal (b) contrast-enhanced CT images reveal near-complete obliteration of the laryngeal airway by a polypoid soft tissue mass, which extends inferiorly into the subglottic airway. Note the trace residual airway remnant anteriorly (white arrow). There is asymmetric high attenuation of the right arytenoid cartilage (white arrowhead), consistent with sclerosis and involvement of the lesion. Axial fusion PET/CT image (c) reveals a hypermetabolic mass centered at the larynx (black arrow). Biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma

Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. A 40-year-old man presenting with tender neck mass, dysphagia to solid food, odynophagia, and voice changes. Axial (a) and sagittal (b) contrast-enhanced CT images reveal an enhancing mass at the left oropharynx (arrows) and extensive left-sided lymphadenopathy, including a large level II nodal conglomerate with central areas of necrosis (arrowheads). Biopsy revealed this to be human papilloma virus (HPV)-mediated squamous cell carcinoma. Voice change was attributed to encroachment upon the carotid space resulting in vagal nerve irritation.

Small lesions may be treated locally with laser or radiation ablation; larger tumors usually necessitate laryngectomy and radiation therapy, although supraglottic tumors without vocal cord fixation may be treated with voice-sparing surgery. Compared to similarly staged SCC elsewhere in the head and neck, laryngeal SCC portends a better prognosis, but 15–20% will develop a second primary site SCC that is most certainly fatal.

### Is investigation of patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph justified? [^113uznSR]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Haemoptysis is a common clinical symptom. A small proportion of patients present with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph. The investigation strategy for this group of patients is unclear. The aim of this study is to see whether further investigations for this group of patients are justified.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted of consecutive patients presenting with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph over a period of 56 months irrespective of their smoking status. These patients were investigated by CT of the thorax and fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

Results

275 episodes of haemoptysis with normal chest radiograph were investigated further in 270 patients (60% males). The median age was 60 years. Twenty-six patients were diagnosed to have respiratory tract malignancies (larynx, 1; trachea, 1; lung, 22; carcinoid, 1; and leiomyoma, 1). Eight (31%) of the 26 patients with respiratory tract malignancy had radical treatment. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was diagnostic of cancer in 14 (54%) of the 26 patients with malignancy. CT of the thorax was suggestive of cancer in 24 (96%) of the 25 patients with malignancy.

Conclusion

It is concluded that further investigation of haemoptysis in smokers is justified regardless of the amount or frequency of haemoptysis based on a 9.6% rate of malignancy in this consecutive series. It is recommended that these patients are investigated with CT of the thorax followed by fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112cKeqV]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Dysphagia and history of vegetative plaques [^115HViYz]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 40-year-old African-American woman with a documented history of hidradenitis suppurativa presented with hoarseness, dysphagia, and cough productive of blood and skin for 2 weeks. She describes a 12-year history of throat pain followed by vegetative plaques to the bilateral axilla (Fig 1) for which she had frequented the emergency department for pain management. Previous treatments include surgical excision, bleach baths, and antibiotics with minimal improvement. Trials of prednisone had intermittently alleviated her symptoms. Physical examination revealed oral mucosa without ulceration and hypertrophic surgical scars to the bilateral axilla. Laryngoscopy revealed inflammation of the vocal cord mucosa.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Vegetative pyoderma gangrenosum (VPG)
B. Keloids
C. Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)
D. Pemphigus vegetans
E. Inverse psoriasis (IP)
