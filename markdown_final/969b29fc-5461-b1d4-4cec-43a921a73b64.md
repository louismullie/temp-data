## Question

Step by step strangulated hernia repair?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step guide to strangulated hernia repair. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about preoperative recognition, resuscitation, and imaging decisions. Then, I should verify intraoperative strategy by approach, reduction techniques, and bowel viability assessment. Next, I will examine mesh decisions by contamination class and defect size. After that, I need to check postoperative care, antibiotics, and recurrence prevention. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and summarize a practical algorithm with contingencies, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis and urgency. Strangulation implies vascular compromise of hernia contents, typically bowel, and mandates emergent operative exploration; delays increase the need for bowel resection and mortality, so I should not wait for imaging if the exam is convincing and the patient is unstable or has peritonitis [^826a4b42] [^0ddc28f3] [^5195b59b]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if the hernia is reducible and the patient is stable, urgent rather than emergent repair may suffice, but any signs of ischemia, systemic toxicity, or peritonitis push me to the OR immediately [^5195b59b].

> I need to check the preoperative workup and resuscitation. Stabilize ABCs, start IV fluids, and obtain basic labs including CBC, electrolytes, and lactate; lactate elevation supports ischemia but is neither sensitive nor specific enough to delay surgery when suspicion is high [^5195b59b]. Wait, let me verify imaging decisions: ultrasound can help confirm hernia and contents, but CT is preferred when diagnosis is uncertain, the exam is limited, or I need to assess for obstruction, ischemia, or occult hernias; however, CT should not delay operative management in unstable patients [^5195b59b] [^d668f8f2].

> Next, I should review operative approach selection. Open repair remains the default in many emergencies, particularly with suspected strangulation or need for bowel resection, because it provides direct access and rapid control; however, if expertise and patient factors allow, laparoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, enabling visualization of reduced bowel and contralateral defects, and may reduce wound infection and length of stay in selected patients [^7db43d5f] [^72644340] [^0ed4b4e1]. Hold on, I should verify contraindications to laparoscopy: hemodynamic instability, severe bowel distension, generalized peritonitis, or inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum favor open repair, and these should override a minimally invasive inclination in the moment [^72644340].

> I will now examine open technique specifics. For inguinal hernias, a groin incision with division of the external oblique aponeurosis exposes the hernia sac; for femoral hernias, a transinguinal or preperitoneal approach facilitates both reduction and, if needed, bowel resection without compromising the inguinal canal, and a single incision that allows access to the peritoneal cavity is prudent when strangulation is suspected [^b2eb664f] [^74d203a7]. Let me think about reduction: gentle traction with warm saline and patience is first-line; if irreducible, I should enlarge the hernia ring carefully — ventrolateral for indirect and ventromedial for direct hernias — to avoid neurovascular injury, and consider a relaxing incision when needed [^7979b52e] [^0ed4b4e1].

> For laparoscopic technique, I should confirm port placement and strategy. TAPP is commonly used in emergencies: establish pneumoperitoneum, inspect the hernia and contralateral side, reduce contents with traction and, if needed, division of the hernia ring, then assess viability; bowel resection can be performed intraperitoneally if necessary, and mesh can be placed in the preperitoneal space once viability is secured [^0ed4b4e1] [^7979b52e]. Wait, let me verify feasibility signals: series report high success without conversion when patients are carefully selected and surgeons experienced, but I must be ready to convert if distension, adhesions, or perforation limit progress [^0ed4b4e1] [^2ee863df].

> Now, I need to ensure meticulous assessment of bowel viability. Visual inspection for color, peristalsis, and bleeding from resected edges is essential; if uncertain, I should use Doppler or intravenous fluorescein when available, and err on the side of resection for nonviable segments [^0ed4b4e1]. Hold on, I should verify that laparoscopy allows observation time: after reduction, bowel may recover, and delaying resection decisions until after hernia repair can prevent unnecessary resections in a subset of patients [^eaee00c4].

> Let me consider mesh use by contamination class, because this is where errors occur. In clean fields without ischemia or resection, synthetic mesh is appropriate and reduces recurrence; in clean-contaminated fields with ischemia but no gross spillage, macroporous polypropylene mesh can still be considered with caution; in contaminated fields with necrosis or spillage, primary suture repair is reasonable for small defects, and biologic mesh is preferred if mesh is needed; in dirty fields with perforation and peritonitis, avoid permanent synthetic mesh and plan staged reconstruction when possible [^83fe825e] [^4a619b7d] [^23816930] [^e6b79fea]. I should double-check the evidence: meta-analyses suggest mesh in strangulated inguinal hernias does not increase infection and reduces recurrence, but many studies are low quality and exclude gross contamination, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^1216c391] [^6032d79e] [^e4f26bcd].

> Next, I should review postoperative management. I need to ensure adequate analgesia, early mobilization, and VTE prophylaxis; monitor for wound complications, ileus, and signs of infection; and arrange close follow-up given higher recurrence risk after emergency repairs [^e61ae320]. Wait, let me verify antibiotics: for uncomplicated incarceration without ischemia, standard perioperative prophylaxis suffices; for strangulation with ischemia or resection, extend antibiotics to 48 hours per WSES guidance, recognizing evidence quality is limited [^6765572c].

> I should confirm recurrence prevention counseling. Smoking cessation, weight optimization, diabetes control, and avoidance of strenuous activity during healing reduce complications and recurrence; patients should be educated to seek care promptly for new bulges or pain to mitigate future emergencies [^e61ae320] [^5195b59b]. Hold on, I should verify that mesh choice and technique influence recurrence: underlay or preperitoneal mesh with adequate overlap yields lower recurrence than onlay in many series, and this principle guides my repair selection when feasible in the emergency setting [^a6f0726a].

> But wait, what if the hernia is a femoral or obturator hernia, or the patient is frail with a large defect? Femoral hernias have higher risks of strangulation and resection; a preperitoneal or high approach facilitates both reduction and resection when needed, and I should maintain a low threshold for aggressive management in older adults [^b2eb664f] [^f8a7af1d]. For large ventral defects with contamination, I should consider staged repair with temporary closure and delayed mesh, balancing infection risk against recurrence, and document the plan clearly for follow-up [^e61ae320] [^509829bc].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Suspected strangulation mandates emergent exploration; if reducible and stable, urgent repair is acceptable; choose open versus laparoscopic based on expertise, contamination, and patient factors; reduce contents carefully with ring enlargement as needed; assess viability and resect nonviable bowel; select mesh or suture based on wound class and defect size; provide targeted antibiotics and close follow-up; and plan elective optimization for staged repairs when appropriate, aligning with WSES, HerniaSurge, and EAST guidance [^0ddc28f3] [^826a4b42] [^b817ee2a].

Strangulated hernia repair is a **surgical emergency** that requires rapid recognition, resuscitation, and operative management to prevent bowel necrosis and sepsis [^0ddc28f3]. The key steps are: **immediate diagnosis and resuscitation** with fluids, antibiotics, and readiness for the OR; **open or laparoscopic exploration** to reduce and assess bowel viability; **bowel resection if necrotic**; and **mesh-based hernia repair** when feasible, with primary suture repair reserved for contaminated fields or unstable patients [^83fe825e] [^e6b79fea]. Early surgery within 6 hours reduces bowel resection and mortality, and laparoscopy is safe and feasible in experienced hands [^b817ee2a] [^0ed4b4e1].

---

## Preoperative assessment and preparation

- **Immediate diagnosis**: Clinical suspicion is based on acute pain, tenderness, erythema, skin changes, and signs of obstruction (nausea, vomiting, distension) [^5195b59b].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT can confirm hernia, assess contents, and detect ischemia, but should not delay surgery if strangulation is suspected [^5195b59b].

- **Resuscitation**: Start IV fluids, correct electrolytes, and administer broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. cefuroxime plus metronidazole) [^notfound].

- **Consent**: Discuss risks of bowel resection, stoma, infection, recurrence, and anesthesia complications.

---

## Operative approach

Open surgery is the **traditional approach**, especially with suspected bowel necrosis or contamination, providing direct access for reduction, bowel assessment, and resection [^7db43d5f]. Laparoscopy is increasingly used in experienced centers, offering diagnostic visualization, reduced wound complications, and shorter length of stay; it is particularly useful when viability is uncertain or a contralateral hernia is suspected [^72644340] [^0ed4b4e1].

---

## Intraoperative steps

### Exposure and reduction

Exposure involves making an **appropriate incision** (groin for inguinal/femoral, midline for ventral) and carefully opening the hernia sac to avoid injuring bowel [^e61ae320]. Reduction is achieved with gentle traction; if irreducible, enlarge the hernia ring or perform a relaxing incision to release the incarcerated contents [^7979b52e].

---

### Assessment of bowel viability

Visual inspection assesses color, peristalsis, and mesenteric pulsations; **questionable segments** may improve after reduction and warm compresses. If viability remains uncertain, use intravenous fluorescein or Doppler ultrasound to guide decisions [^notfound].

---

### Management of nonviable bowel

Resection is indicated for frankly necrotic bowel; perform an **end-to-end anastomosis** if feasible, or create a stoma if the patient is unstable or the field is contaminated. Washout thoroughly with saline and consider temporary abdominal closure if contamination is significant [^e61ae320].

---

### Hernia repair

- **Mesh repair**: Preferred in clean or clean-contaminated fields; macroporous polypropylene mesh reduces recurrence without significantly increasing infection risk [^83fe825e] [^6032d79e].

- **Primary suture repair**: Use for contaminated fields, unstable patients, or small defects; accept higher recurrence risk [^e6b79fea].

- **Laparoscopic repair**: TAPP or TEP approaches are feasible in experienced hands, with low recurrence and infection rates [^0ed4b4e1] [^2ee863df].

---

## Postoperative care

Continue antibiotics for 24–48 hours, provide **adequate analgesia**, and monitor for wound infection, seroma, or recurrence. Early mobilization and discharge are appropriate when stable, with close follow-up to detect recurrence or complications [^6765572c] [^57184f76].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications include wound infection, seroma, recurrence, chronic pain, and, rarely, mesh infection; **early intervention** reduces bowel resection and mortality, and laparoscopic repair is associated with lower wound infection and shorter hospital stay [^b817ee2a] [^72644340].

---

Strangulated hernia repair demands **rapid recognition, resuscitation, and operative management** to prevent bowel necrosis and sepsis. Early surgery, careful bowel assessment, and appropriate mesh use are critical to good outcomes.

Patients presenting with acute, complicated abdominal wall hernias are at risk of potentially devastating complications if the diagnosis of strangulation is missed or delayed. Similar to other EGS disease processes, patients requiring surgical intervention for acute complications of abdominal wall hernias are at significant risk of serious postoperative complications. A thoughtful systematic approach to patients presenting with acute issues related to abdominal wall hernia is required.

Introduction

The main risk factors for inguinal hernia are male sex and increasing age. Complications of inguinal hernia include strangulation, intestinal obstruction, and infarction. Recurrence can occur after surgery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of elective treatments for primary unilateral, primary bilateral, and recurrent inguinal hernia in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: expectant management, open mesh repair, open suture repair, totally extraperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic repair, and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) laparoscopic repair.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^0ed4b4e1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 94 patients with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias who were treated by emergency TAPP from January 2017 to December 2019 at our hospital (Department of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University). The patients' characteristics, operative details, duration of hospital stay, incidence of complications, mortality, and recurrence were reviewed.

The criteria for evaluating the feasibility of the laparoscopic technique were the mean operative time, ability to reduce the hernia, rate of conversion to open surgery, and diagnostic rate of contralateral inguinal hernia. The criteria for evaluating the safety of the laparoscopic technique were the mean hospital stay, mortality, morbidity of complications, and hernia recurrence rate.

The inclusion criteria were adult patients with incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias, no previous severe abdominal surgery, no abdominal wall infection, no severe cardiopulmonary function diseases, and a body condition fit for general anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were patients with contraindications for general anesthesia, signs of peritonitis, a definitive diagnosis of bowel perforation before surgery, and severe bowel distension preventing the use of a laparoscopic technique.

Surgical technique

All operations were performed by a single surgeon, and TAPP repair was performed in all cases. After inducing general anesthesia, pneumoperitoneum was established with a Veress needle up to 12 to 14 mmHg. A 10-mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity through the incision just below the umbilicus. A 30° video camera was placed into the abdominal cavity through the 10-mm trocar. Under laparoscopic visualization, two 5-mm trocars were placed at each midclavicular line (1 or 2 cm under the umbilicus). First, we detected the inguinal region and evaluated the hernia contents. The next step was hernia reduction, which involved some technical difficulties. Hernia reduction might be assisted by general anesthesia. If direct traction failed, manual pressure to inguinal region from outside could be applied by an assistant. If the above methods failed, enlargement of the hernia ring with an electronic hook became necessary. The hernia ring was incised ventrolaterally for indirect hernias and ventromedially for direct hernias. After successful reduction, the vitality of the hernia content could be clearly detected. Standard TAPP repair was then performed. Severe incarcerated bowel was detected again in the last step, and bowel resection was performed endoscopically if necessary. We converted to open surgery in patients with bowel perforation. Any accompanying contralateral inguinal hernias were simultaneously repaired by the TAPP approach.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^eaee00c4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

After hernia reduction, the most important step is to assess the vitality of the hernia contents. Our result revealed that the most frequently encountered content in incarcerated hernia was small intestine. If a definite diagnosis cannot be immediately made, TAPP repair can be performed first. Surgery can provide sufficient observation time to make a decision about bowel resection. In some cases, the color of suspected ischemic bowel may recover to normal after hernia repair, thus avoiding unnecessary bowel resection. In our study, bowel resection was only performed in two patients. Unnecessary bowel resections were avoided in nine patients because the color of the incarcerated bowel recovered to normal after the TAPP procedure. Similar results have been reported in other previously published studies.

Laparoscopy provides a good view of the internal abdominal cavity, making it a useful diagnostic technique, especially for those with hernia contents that reduced spontaneously preoperatively. Once the potentially necrotic bowel has spontaneously reduced into the abdominal cavity, the patient may develop bowel perforation, abdominal infection, or even life-threatening sepsis. We can detect the reduced bowel via laparoscopy to avoid these problems. Furthermore, a contralateral inguinal hernia can be diagnosed and repaired simultaneously via laparoscopy.

The conversion rate is one of the criteria used to evaluate the feasibility of the laparoscopic technique. No conversion occurred in our study, suggesting that TAPP repair is feasible for treatment of acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias. Other previously published papers also support our result. Bowel distension was recognized as the reason for conversion. No conversion occurred in our study. The reasons were as follows: first, our patients were strictly selected. Patients with severe bowel distension or patients who had signs of bowel gangrene with abdominal wall infection or peritonitis were excluded; second, all procedures must be performed with great care. Blind traction was forbidden to prevent iatrogenic bleeding or bowel injury. Third, the hernia ring must be cut in patients with severe incarceration. This additional procedure can quickly release the incarceration, resulting in an easy hernia reduction. Furthermore, the surgeon's ability will determine whether the laparoscopic technique can be successfully performed in emergency cases because this technique involves a long learning curve. TAPP repair are recommended to be performed by senior surgeons who have gained sufficient experience in laparoscopic techniques.

The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with acutely incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias require urgent surgical evaluation. Most literature on inguinal hernia management focuses on elective repairs. We aimed to provide evidence-based guidelines for managing inguinal hernias requiring urgent surgical intervention.

Methods

An evidence-based systematic review was performed. Clinically relevant questions regarding defined Population(s), Intervention(s), Comparison(s), and Outcome(s) were selected. These questions centered around the timing of intervention, the use of mesh, the surgical approach, and the use of antibiotics in patients who presented with incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias requiring urgent surgical interventions. A comprehensive literature search was completed from 1946 through March 11, 2024. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used in the creation of the recommendations. Consensus was achieved for all final recommendations.

Results

Of 7,038 articles reviewed, 34 met the inclusion criteria. Early intervention (< 6 hours from symptom onset) was associated with a lower incidence of bowel resection (odds ratio [OR], 0.1 [0.05, 0.29]; p < 0.0001). Hernia repair with mesh was associated with decreased incidence of recurrence (OR, 0.34 [0.13, 0.87]; p = 0.02) and mixed results for surgical site infections. Laparoscopic repairs decreased recurrence rates (OR, 0.75 [0.58, 0.99]; p = 0.03) and had shorter hospital length of stay (mean difference, -3.00 [-5.54, -0.47]; p < 0.01) compared with open repairs. There were not enough studies to address the routine use of postoperative antibiotics. Quality was deemed very low with much of the literature being retrospective studies.

Conclusion

We conditionally recommend early surgical intervention for adult patients presenting with acutely incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias who are deemed to require surgery. We conditionally recommend mesh repairs over primary tissue repairs and laparoscopic approaches over open approaches for this population. No recommendations can be made regarding the routine use of antibiotics.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Incarcerated and strangulated inguinal hernia… [^9314a49e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

INCARCERATED or strangulated inguinal hernias are surgical emergencies and are usually an indication for immediate operation. Individual experiences and reports in the literature have emphasized the risk in delaying operation and the dangers incident to reduction. The pathologic changes in the hernia cannot be determined with complete certainty without exploration. However, for many years the practice at the Cook County Hospital has been to attempt to transform these situations from a surgical emergency to a later elective procedure. The routine procedure is the result of observations and experiences of Dr. Roger T. Vaughan. Accordingly, this survey of 500 cases of incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia was undertaken to determine the results of treatment as followed in this institution. The advantage of an elective operation for a simple inguinal hernia is not to be disregarded if the method used for reduction of an incarcerated hernia is relatively safe. Almost all surgeons.

Groin hernia repair is one of the most common general surgical procedures performed worldwide. Although only a small percentage will become incarcerated or strangulated, this is an indication for repair. Minimally invasive surgery is becoming the standard of care for most procedures, and we believe this to be a safe and feasible approach for incarcerated or strangulated groin hernias. We present a description of our recommended approach with technical details and accompanying video clips to highlight these techniques.

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF ABDOMINAL WALL HERNIA IN THE ACUTE SETTING

Basic principles of acute hernia repair include evaluating the incarcerated contents for evidence of ischemia or necrosis, reducting the hernia contents, and reconstructing the abdominal wall defect. Acute hernia repair surgery can be performed using open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques depending on patient factors and surgeon experience. Laparoscopy can be helpful in assessing bowel perfusion and viability if there are concerns for strangulation. The use of minimally invasive approaches to EGS hernia repair is increasing, is safe, and is associated with decreased wound complications and hospital length of stay. – Regardless of the approach, the goal of a hernia repair surgery should be to perform an operation that yields the greatest chance of a durable repair while minimizing the risk of harm to the patient. In the setting of acute hernia reconstruction, the risks of mesh infection must be weighed against the risk of hernia recurrence (Figure 2).

H. Not every operative intervention involving a hernia will provide the opportunity to perform the "definitive operation". After initial surgical exploration of the abdomen and evaluation of the hernia contents, a determination should be made as to whether the operation will be used as the first in a staged hernia repair approach or if the definitive hernia repair should be performed. The staged repair will adequately address the hernia in the short term but will result in either a high likelihood of recurrence or just provide temporary control of the hernia while the patient can be better optimized for definitive repair in the future. Contraindications to definitive repair include patient instability, sepsis, comorbidities, or large abdominal wall defects that are inappropriate for definitive repair in the acute setting.
I. Definitive hernia repair can be pursued in the absence of clear contraindications. Options for the type of repair depend on wound class (Table 3), as the presence of bowel ischemia or contamination at the time of surgery must be considered. Patient factors should also be a consideration before pursuing definitive repair, including tobacco use, uncontrolled diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis, large volume ascites, severe obesity, and the presence of an unrelated infection that will increase the risks of repair failure in the postoperative period. While the absolute risks of each factor may be hard to estimate for each patient, they should be considered in conjunction with the specific repair being considered.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^d668f8f2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This algorithm developed by the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery (EGS) algorithms working group addresses the initial evaluation and management of ventral abdominal wall and groin hernias presenting in the emergency setting. The algorithm is intended to serve as a bedside reference for clinicians. It is annotated with letters linked to corresponding text that provides the rationale and references to support these recommendations. The algorithm is not a substitute for the clinical judgment and experience of bedside clinicians and should not be considered as the "standard of care". We encourage institutions to use these recommendations to formulate local protocols but recognize that there are patient-specific factors and institutional resource availability that may require deviation from this algorithm.

Abdominal wall hernia includes ventral hernias (umbilical, incisional, epigastric, spigelian) and groin hernias (inguinal, femoral). While the majority of abdominal wall hernias are treated in the elective setting, there is a subset of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute issues, including severe pain, intestinal obstruction, incarceration, and strangulation. Emergency surgery may be required for patients with an abdominal wall hernia, with an incidence of 16 to 19 emergent hernia repairs per 100,000 person-years. Presentation with acute hernia incarceration (inability to reduce hernia contents) warrants prompt repair, and concern for strangulation (compromise of blood supply to the contents), particularly bowel ischemia, is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to avoid the increased morbidity associated with delay in definitive management. Identifying strangulation can be a clinical challenge as physical examination, laboratory, and imaging findings can be nonspecific. Therefore, the evaluation of patients with abdominal wall hernia in the emergency setting and the decision to proceed with operative intervention should be made using a systematic approach.

Introduction

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures are associated with poor prognoses and a higher rate of post-operative complications.

A World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Consensus Conference was held in Bergamo on July 2013, during the 2 nd Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery with the goal of defining recommendations for emergency repair of abdominal wall hernias in adults. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference approved by a WSES expert panel.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral and inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, spigelian and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia may be defined as a hernia in which the contents have become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or adhesions within the cavity. Intestinal obstruction can complicate an incarcerated hernia. In contrast, a strangulated hernia is one in which the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (eg omentum, bowel) s becomes compromised.

Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose purely by physical examination yet require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can lead to bowel resection with longer recovery and its attendant complications. Strangulated hernias can have serious deleterious effects such as, bowel obstruction, bacterial translocation, and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). It poses a significant risk to emergency hernia repair, as there is an increased incidence of surgical field contamination, leading to high rates of post-operative infection and probably recurrence.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but only a fraction of these contaminates ultimately lead to infection. In most patients infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^3976f2a5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acutely incarcerated inguinal hernia is a common acute abdominal disease. The probability of strangulation is 0.29% in all inguinal hernias. The mortality rate may reach about 5% among patients of advanced age who present on an emergency basis. Patients diagnosed with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernia require rapid surgical intervention. Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair has been proven effective in selected inguinal hernia repairs. However, this approach is uncommon and controversial in the treatment of acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias. In this study, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of TAPP repair in the treatment of acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias.

### Mesh repair versus non-mesh repair for strangulated inguinal hernia: systematic review with meta-analysis [^1216c391]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal technique to cure strangulated inguinal hernia remains controversial. The use of mesh in cases of strangulated hernia is still debated due to the potential risk of infection.

Objective

This systematic review aimed to determine whether or not the mesh repair technique is associated with a higher risk of surgical site infection than non-mesh techniques for strangulated inguinal hernias in adults.

Methods

An electronic search of the relevant literature was performed on 15 December 2012 using the following databases: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, and the Web of Science. Articles reporting a comparison between the mesh repair technique and a non-mesh technique to treat strangulated inguinal hernias in adults, and published in the English or French language in a peer-reviewed journal, were considered for analysis. The quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Jadad scoring system. To assess the quality of non-randomized trials, we used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS).

Results

A total of 232 papers was found in the initial search; nine were included in the meta-analysis. The wound infection rate in the mesh repair technique group was lower than in the control group, with a trend towards significance (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–1.07; p = 0.07). The hernia recurrence rate was lower in the mesh repair group (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05–0.78; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

The mesh repair technique is a good option for the treatment of strangulated inguinal hernias in adults, giving an acceptable wound infection rate and fewer recurrences than non-mesh repair. Our study does not allow us to recommend the use of mesh in cases of bowel resection. We emphasize that, except the two RCTs, the results are predicated on patient selection bias by careful surgeons. Further RCTs are required to obtain more powerful evidence-based data.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^bcad81bf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Timing of intervention

Patients should undergo emergency hernia repair immediately when intestinal strangulation is suspected (grade 1C recommendation).

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), contrast-enhanced CT findings, as well as lactate, serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and D-dimer levels are predictive of bowel strangulation (grade 1C recommendation).

Unfortunately, morbidity and mortality rates remain high for patients who undergo emergency repair of abdominal hernias. Early diagnosis of strangulated obstruction may be difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to septic complications. However, in the case of suspected bowel strangulation, the benefits outweigh the risks of surgery and patients should undergo immediate surgical intervention.

A recent study performed by Martínez-Serrano et al. prospectively analysed morbidity and mortality rates following emergency hernia repair. The study population included 244 patients with complicated abdominal wall hernias requiring surgical repair. In this study, the patients were treated according to standardized protocols with detailed actions taken during the pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods. Clinical outcomes were compared retrospectively to that of 402 patients who had undergone similar procedures before the development and implementation of the protocols outlined in the study. Results showed higher rates of mortality in patients with acute complication as their first hernia-related symptom and whose treatment was delayed for more than 24 h. Thus, the authors concluded that early detection of complicated abdominal hernias may be the best means of reducing the rate of mortality.

### Strangulated intercostal liver herniation subsequent to blunt trauma. first report with review of the world literature [^0412bdb1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Traumatic transdiaphragmatic intercostal hernia, defined as an acquired herniation of abdominal contents through disrupted intercostal muscles, is a rarely reported entity. We present the first reported case of a traumatic transdiaphragmatic intercostal hernia complicated by strangulation of the herniated visceral contents.

Following blunt trauma, a 61-year old man developed a traumatic transdiaphragmatic intercostal hernia complicated by strangulation of liver segment VI. Due to pre-existing respiratory problems and the presence of multiple other injuries (grade III kidney laceration and lung contusion) the hernia was managed non-operatively for the first 2 weeks.

The strangulated liver segment eventually underwent ischemic necrosis. Six weeks later the resulting subcutaneous abscess required surgical drainage. Nine months post injury the large symptomatic intercostal hernia was treated with laparoscopic mesh repair. Twelve months after the initial trauma, a small recurrence of the hernia required laparoscopic re-fixation of the mesh.

This paper outlines important steps in managing a rare post traumatic entity. Early liver reduction and hernia repair would have been ideal. The adopted conservative approach caused liver necrosis and required staged procedures to achieve a good outcome.

Question 7.15

What are the indications for emergency surgery?

Recommendation: Patients with parastomal hernias causing strangulation or unresolving obstruction should have urgent surgery.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

Patients who present with an irreducible parastomal hernia with associated obstruction that does not resolve or signs of strangulation require immediate operative intervention. Unlike other abdominal wall hernias, a large proportion of patients who have an operation for a parastomal hernia have this performed as an emergency. This group of patients have a considerable mortality and morbidity.

Question 7.16

What is the operation of choice in the emergency setting?

Recommendation: Emergency surgery for a parastomal hernia is aimed at saving life and not definitive hernia management. Minimal intervention, for example suture repair, that allows the pathology to be dealt with and the patient's life to be saved is recommended.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

In the emergency situation where operative intervention is required for non‐resolving bowel obstruction or bowel ischaemia there are three goals to be met:
save life,
minimize complications,
tissue preservation in order to allow attempt at future definitive repair.

Local suture repair has the advantage of being relatively simple to perform with less morbidity than that associated with an operation involving laparotomy. However, a laparotomy may be necessary in order to allow or facilitate local repair. In a systematic review of retrospective series, the recurrence rate for planned non‐emergency surgery was up to 70%. Despite this it is recognized that this technique may be the only real option in the emergency situation where a 30‐day mortality rate of 10% (> 20% in elderly patients) is reported.

### Effectiveness and safety of mesh repair for incarcerated or strangulated hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6032d79e]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hernia repair with mesh in patients with incarcerated or strangulated hernias is controversial. Moreover, the use of mesh for hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection poses a great dilemma. This study compared the outcomes of mesh and anatomic repairs in patients with acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernias.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published before November 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies were included. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. The treatment outcome was measured by the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI), seroma formation, and hernia recurrence postoperatively.

Results

Two RCTs and six prospective studies with 978 patients were included. No significant difference in SSI incidence was observed between patients with incarcerated hernia from the mesh and anatomic repair groups. Recurrence was significantly lower in mesh repair group than in anatomic repair group (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.45). Only two patients needed to have mesh explantation due to mesh infection. In the setting of hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection, the SSI rate with mesh repair was slightly higher, but most cases of infections were well controlled with conservative antibiotic therapy.

Conclusions

Mesh repair for incarcerated or strangulated hernias was feasible with a great benefit of lower recurrence rates. However, due to limited data, drawing conclusions regarding the use of mesh for hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection was difficult. Further studies with preset criteria for evaluating patients undergoing concomitant bowel resection may help elucidate this issue.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^f5764934]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures may be associated with poor prognosis and a significant rate of postoperative complications.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral or inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, Spigelian, lumbar, and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia is a hernia in which the content has become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or due to adhesions between the content and the hernia sac. Moreover, intestinal obstruction may complicate an incarcerated hernia. A strangulated hernia occurs when the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (e.g. omentum, bowel) is compromised. Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose by physical examination and require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can result in the need for bowel resection with prolonged recovery and increased complication rate. Strangulated hernias may lead to bacterial translocation and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). This condition significantly increases the risks in emergency hernia repair that may lead to an increased incidence of surgical site contamination and recurrence.

An interesting topic is the use of laparoscopy in emergency hernia repair. However, its role in acute settings is not well established yet.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but not all of these contaminations ultimately lead to infection. In most patients, infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

While many factors can influence surgical wound healing and postoperative infection, bacterial burden is the most significant risk factor. According to the likelihood and degree of wound contamination at the time of operation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wound classification stratifies the wound as follows:
Class I = clean wounds
Class II = clean-contaminated wounds
Class III = contaminated wounds
Class IV = dirty or infected wounds (Table 1)

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^45b78c4e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

One of our patients underwent abdominal wall vascular injury during the process of trocar insertion. This accident occurred in the early stage of laparoscopy application in our department and was remedied by ligation with no further problems. No further injury or other intraoperative complications occurred.

The laparoscopic approach may not be applicable to all emergency cases. A consensus has not yet been reached. Based on our evaluation and experience, we consider that TAPP repair can be safely performed in strictly selected patients with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias. We look forward to obtaining further long-term results in the future.

### Mesh versus non-mesh for emergency groin hernia repair [^e4f26bcd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A groin hernia is a collective name for inguinal and femoral hernias, which can present acutely with incarceration or strangulation of the hernia sac content, requiring emergency treatment. Timely repair of emergency groin hernias is crucial due to the risk of reduced blood supply and thus damage to the bowel, but the optimal surgical approach is unclear. While mesh repair is the standard treatment for elective hernia surgery, using mesh for emergency groin hernia repair remains controversial due to the risk of surgical site infection.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of mesh compared with non-mesh in emergency groin hernia repair in adult patients with an inguinal or femoral hernia.

Search Methods

On 5 August 2022, we searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, as well as two trial registers for ongoing and completed trials. Additionally, we performed forward and backward citation searches for the included trials and relevant review articles. We searched without any language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mesh with non-mesh repair in emergency groin hernia surgery in adults. We included any mesh and any non-mesh repairs. All studies fulfilling the study, participant, and intervention criteria were included irrespective of reported outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We based missing data analysis on best- and worst-case scenarios. For outcomes with sufficiently low heterogeneity, we performed meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We analysed subgroups when feasible, including the degree of contamination. We used RoB 2 for risk of bias assessment, and summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 15 trials randomising 1241 participants undergoing emergency groin hernia surgery with either mesh (626 participants) or non-mesh hernia repair (615 participants). The studies were conducted in China, the Middle East, and South Asia. Most patients were men, and most participants had an inguinal hernia (41 participants had femoral hernias). The mean/median age in the mesh group ranged from 35 to 70 years, and from 41 to 69 years in the non-mesh group. All studies were performed in a hospital emergency setting (tertiary care) and lasted for 11 to 139 months, with a median study duration of 31 months. The majority of the studies only included participants with clean to clean-contaminated surgical fields. For all outcomes, we considered the certainty of the evidence to be very low, mainly downgraded due to high risk of bias (due to deviations from intended intervention and missing outcome data), indirectness, and imprecision. Mesh hernia repair may have no effect on or slightly increase the risk of 30-day surgical site infections (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.88; I² = 21%; 2 studies, 454 participants) when compared with non-mesh hernia repair, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of mesh hernia repair compared with non-mesh hernia repair on 30-day mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.28; 1 study, 208 participants). In summary, the results showed 70 more (from 5 fewer to 200 more) surgical site infections and 29 more (from 32 fewer to 175 more) deaths within 30 days of mesh hernia repair per 1000 participants compared with non-mesh hernia repair. The evidence is very uncertain about 90-day surgical site infections after mesh versus non-mesh hernia repair (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.64; 1 study, 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No 30-day recurrences were recorded, and mesh hernia repair may not reduce recurrence within one year (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.03; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Within 30 days of hernia repair, no meshes were removed from clean to clean-contaminated fields, but 6.7% of meshes (1 study, 208 participants) were removed from contaminated to dirty surgical fields. Among the four studies reporting 90-day mesh removal, no events occurred. We were not able to identify any studies reporting complications classified according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification or reoperation for complications within 30 days of repair.

Authors' Conclusions

Our results show that in terms of 30-day surgical site infections, 30-day mortality, and hernia recurrence within one year, the evidence for the use of mesh hernia repair compared with non-mesh hernia repair in emergency groin hernia surgery is very uncertain. Unfortunately, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to very low-certainty evidence and meta-analyses based on small-sized and low-quality studies. There is a need for future high-quality RCTs or high-quality registry-based studies if RCTs are unfeasible.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^3417c339]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) abdominal wall hernias — education, surgical discussion, and peritoneal dialysis (PD) considerations are specified. Practice Point 6.4.2: People with ADPKD who are managed expectantly for abdominal wall hernia should be educated to recognize symptoms of hernia incarceration or strangulation (e.g., acute pain, nausea, vomiting), which should lead to prompt surgical evaluation. Practice Point 6.4.3: Surgical repair of abdominal wall hernias should be discussed in people with ADPKD who elect PD as a mode of KRT, as increased abdominal pressure is a known risk factor for enlargement and complications of hernias. For people with severely enlarged kidneys and/or liver, an advisable approach is to monitor abdominal wall hernias whenever feasible, and people should receive education to promptly recognize signs of acute complications, such as incarceration or strangulation. Surgical repair in people with CKD G5 opting for PD is generally performed before or at the time of catheter insertion, and the feasibility of PD in people with massive kidney and/or liver enlargement, and abdominal wall hernias, should be evaluated carefully before surgical repair is performed. Indications for surgical treatments vary also according to the site of hernias. Femoral hernias are associated with a higher risk of developing complications than are inguinal hernias, and hence surgical repair, rather than watchful waiting, is usually suggested. People also should be counseled about modifying risk factors, including via smoking cessation, medical optimization (e.g., diabetes), and weight loss when indicated.

### Cyanoacrylate for safer mesh fixation during laparoscopic repair of morgagni hernia [^86f09673]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The surgical repair of all Morgagni hernias is recommended to avoid the risk of strangulation of hernia contents. Mesh augmentation repair can reduce the risk of recurrence, but severe injuries have been reported when tacks are used for mesh fixation to the diaphragm. Cyanoacrylate can provide reliable mesh fixation, and in addition, its application is easy and quick by either the transthoracic or laparoscopic approach. This report describes the main steps of laparoscopic mesh augmentation repair of a Morgagni hernia with a focus on atraumatic mesh fixation with cyanoacrylate, which should prevent the potential complications associated with the use of tacks or sutures.

Bittner's overall morbidity was 3.2% and decreased with experience. The scrotal subgroup had a significantly increased rate of sero-hematoma (12.5%), which mandated drainage [3].

TAPP for incarcerated and strangulated inguinal hernia

Statements

Recommendations

In 2001, Leibl et al. [7] published the results of 220 prospectively studied acutely (strangulated) and chronically incarcerated inguinal hernia repairs; 194 of these repairs were accomplished via TAPP. There was no difference in operative time comparing laparoscopic and conventional repair; however, the time of operation was significantly longer compared with elective TAPP repair. Recurrence rate for TAPP repairs of incarcerated hernias were low (0.5%) and was similar to conventional open repair of incarcerated hernias. Other complications, including bleeding, mesh infection (0.1%), organ injury, and death, were similarly low or lower. The authors noted that one advantage of the TAPP technique is that it allows assessment of the viability of the bowel. The time needed for hernia repair allows time for the congested bowel to return to normal or not. A comparison to the prelaparoscopic era shows less frequent bowel resections when performing TAPP.

Resection can be performed, if needed, after repair of the hernia. Leibl's group [7] has extensive experience with TAPP repair of routine hernia, and he cautions that surgeons must be comfortable with this technique in routine hernias before attempting it on a complex incarcerated hernia. Other smaller case series and case reports have shown the viability of the TAPP technique for incarcerated hernias [7–11].

The key step to the operation is the reduction of the sac and its contents. The hernia ring can be enlarged (while preventing injury to the femoral or epigastric vessels) through a ventromedial incision in the case of direct hernias and through a ventrolateral incision in the case of indirect hernias. If resection of nonviable tissue is required, it can be done intraperitoneally (for omentum or appendix) or extraperitoneally (for small bowel) after the repair has been accomplished [8, 10, 11].

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^5ae1e81e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ventral hernias include all hernias arising from a defect in the anterior abdominal wall as epigastric, umbilical, and incisional hernias. Ventral hernias are susceptible for various complications, particularly incarceration and strangulation, that warrant urgent operative intervention which is usually associated with high rates of postoperative recurrence and complications.

The diagnosis of incarceration/strangulation on the verdict of clinical examination alone is not an easy task. Strangulation should be recognized in a timely manner as it warrants immediate surgical intervention. Early operative intervention for strangulated hernia is crucial since any delay in the diagnosis can lead to further compromise of the bowel viability and eventually bowel resection. In addition to the risk of anastomotic leak after bowel resection and anastomosis, strangulation increases the contamination of the operative field which subsequently increases the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) and hernia recurrence.

The World Society for Emergency Surgery (WSES) has issued a grade 1A recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh repair in the cases of incarcerated ventral hernia without signs of bowel strangulation or concurrent intestinal resection. On the other hand, owing to the increased likelihood of SSI in the cases of strangulated hernias with concomitant bowel resection, synthetic mesh repair should be used with caution in these circumstances (grade 2C recommendation).

The use of prosthetic mesh in potentially-contaminated and contaminated settings is not frequently described in the literature. Despite the wide variations of data and the conflicting reports, prosthetic materials are not generally recommended for the repair of ventral hernias in contaminated settings. Choi and colleagues used the records of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program of the United States and evaluated the prosthetic repair of strangulated ventral hernia for more than 33,000 patients in clean-contaminated and contaminated settings. The authors reported that clean-contaminated cases had a significantly higher incidence of wound disruption, and superficial, and deep SSIs along with significantly increased odds for complications overall.

Xourafas et al. evaluated the feasibility of using a synthetic mesh in ventral hernia repair with simultaneous bowel resection. The authors found a significantly higher incidence of postoperative SSI in patients treated with prosthetic mesh compared to those treated without mesh (22 vs 5%).

The present study aimed to review the outcomes following the repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh in compliance with the established clinical guidelines of WSES in terms of the incidence of SSI and recurrence of hernia postoperatively.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and early postoperative complications after current techniques for ventral hernia repair [^31882ba1]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Indications for VHR include pain, cosmesis, and prevention or treatment of complications such as bowel obstruction and strangulation. At our hospital, the mean case volume approaches 110 VHR procedures each year; the vast majority (85–90%) are for incisional hernias.

Before the availability of modern PMs, the rate of postoperative hernia recurrence approached 50%. Current techniques for VHR rely on PM implantation, may be performed during either open surgery or – increasingly – laparoscopic surgery, and consistently achieve favourable results with minimal perioperative morbidity (3.7% overall complication rate) and limited (7.5–10%) recurrence rate.

Open VHR is recommended for large (> 10 cm) abdominal wall defects. The sublay-mesh (Rives–Stoppa) procedure remains the preferred open technique to treat ventral (particularly incisional) hernias. Following skin incision, the surgeon opens the hernial sac, dissects the anterior abdominal structures up to the preperitoneal space, and removes the previous surgical scar, adhesions in the abdominal cavity and the hernial sac itself. The PM is then implanted extraperitoneally in the newly formed space, interposed between the posterior rectus sheath and rectus muscle. Very large hernias with lateral displacement of the rectus abdominis muscles require open repair with the intraperitoneal onlay-mesh (IPOM) technique: after exposure and opening of the hernial sac, adhesions between the abdominal wall and intestinal loops are detached, the hernial sac is removed, and a large PM is positioned from the inside over the breach.

Conversely, laparoscopic VHR involves creation of pneumoperitoneum, introduction of instruments through the trocar ports, and reduction of herniated bowel loops into the peritoneal cavity. The PM is placed intraperitoneally over the defect, without excision of the hernia sac.

With either approach, sutures, fixation screws or an additional second PM may be used to reinforce the repair. Thorough yet easy-to-understand step-by-step graphical explanations of the open and laparoscopic techniques described above are freely downloadable from the dedicatedwebsite.

### WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^0a35b398]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Timing of intervention

Patients should undergo emergency hernia repair immediately when intestinal strangulation is suspected (grade 1C recommendation).

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) signs, contrast-enhanced CT findings as well as lactate, CPK and D-dimer levels are predictive of bowel strangulation (grade 1C recommendation).

Unfortunately, morbidity and mortality rates remain high for patients who undergo emergency repair of abdominal hernias. Early diagnosis of strangulated obstruction maybe difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to septic complications. However, in the case of suspected bowel strangulation the benefits outweigh the risks of surgery and patients should undergo immediate surgical intervention.

A recent study performed by Martínez-Serrano et al. prospectively analyzed morbidity and mortality rates following emergency hernia repair. The study population included 244 patients with complicated abdominal wall hernias requiring surgical repair. In this study, the patients were treated according to standardized protocols with detailed actions to be taken during the pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods. Clinical outcomes were compared retroactively to that of 402 patients who had undergone similar procedures before the development and implementation of the protocols outlined in the study. Results showed higher rates of mortality in patients with acute complication as their first hernia-related symptom and whose treatment was delayed for more than 24 hours. Thus, the authors concluded that early detection of complicated abdominal hernias may be the best means of reducing the rate of mortality.

In 2007, Derici et al. published a retrospective study using univariate and multivariate analysis to investigate factors affecting morbidity and mortality rates in cases of incarcerated abdominal wall hernias. Using univariate analysis, results showed that symptomatic periods lasting longer than 8 hours, the presence of comorbid disease, high American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores, the use of general anesthesia, the presence of strangulation, and the presence of necrosis significantly affect morbidity rates. In contrast, advanced age, the presence of comorbid diseases, high ASA scores, the presence of strangulation, the presence of necrosis, and hernia repair with graft were found to significantly affect mortality rates by univariate analysis; the presence of necrosis, however, was the only factor that appeared to significantly affect mortality rates based on multivariate analysis.

A retrospective study was recently published evaluating the risk factors associated with bowel resection and treatment outcome in patients with incarcerated groin hernias.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^dd18c5d4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In 2014, a SR and meta-analysis including nine studies has been published, investigating the optimal technique to treat strangulated inguinal hernia (mesh vs non-mesh repair). The wound infection rate has been found to be lower in the mesh group than in the control group (OR = 0.46, CI = 95%, P = 0.07). The recurrence rate was found to be lower in the mesh repair group (OR = 0.2, CI = 95%, P = 0.02). Nonetheless, the authors concluded that the study did not allow to currently recommend the use of mesh in case of bowel resection, despite the finding of similar SSI rates with either mesh repair or non-mesh techniques, when comparing bowel resection and no bowel resection (OR = 1.50, P = 0.73).

Emergency hernia repair in "contaminated-dirty surgical field" (CDC wound classes III and IV)

For stable patients with strangulated hernia with bowel necrosis and/or gross enteric spillage during intestinal resection (contaminated, CDC wound class III) or peritonitis from bowel perforation (dirty surgical field, CDC wound class IV), primary repair is recommended when the size of the defect is small (< 3 cm); when direct suture is not feasible, a biological mesh may be used for repair (grade 2C recommendation).

The choice between a cross-linked and a non-cross-linked biological mesh should be evaluated depending on the defect size and degree of contamination (grade 2C recommendation).

If a biological mesh is not available, either polyglactin mesh repair or open wound management with delayed repair may be a viable alternative (grade 2C recommendation).

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^72148c30]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Following the WSES clinical guidelines in conjunction with good clinical judgment, synthetic mesh repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias achieved lower recurrence rate than suture repair. Although mesh hernioplasty was followed by a higher incidence of SSO and seroma formation, the incidence of SSI was comparable in both groups.

Bowel resection, D.M, and previously recurrent ventral hernias were the significant independent risk factors for SSI after repair of complicated ventral hernias. Well-powered randomized trials are needed to reach a strong conclusion about the safety of synthetic mesh when simultaneous bowel resection is conducted; until then, synthetic mesh should be used with caution in these conditions.

Bariatric surgery — incisional hernias are most common with open procedures and may present with pain at an incisional site or a palpable defect that can be difficult to confirm due to body habitus, sometimes requiring CT or ultrasound; repair is usually postponed until significant weight reduction occurs unless signs or symptoms of bowel incarceration or strangulation suggest bowel obstruction.

### Open femoral hernia repair: one skin incision for all [^63d74605]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

We do not presume to be the first to have performed this technique, but we are not aware that it has been formally reported in the literature. More importantly surgical teaching is still centred around the three classical approaches to femoral hernia repair, and, although we do not deny the historical value of these, we feel that awareness of this approach is of value for the surgical trainee.

Although rare, we estimate that we perform approximately 3–4 emergency femoral hernia repairs per year using this technique, and to date collaboratively have performed 78 cases. There have been no complications associated with this technique although we do not suggest that complications associated with any groin hernia operation such as seroma formation and wound infection are significantly decreased with this approach. We are not aware of any hernia recurrences using this technique although the age group and co-morbidities of the patients involved often preclude long term follow up, as do restrictions on clinic space in the current NHS. In terms of post-operative recovery, particularly where strangulated bowel is encountered, the lack of conversion to laparotomy or further skin incisions can only, we believe, contribute to quicker recovery times.

Most importantly however, this simple technique minimises the preoperative debate as to which incision will allow the best approach to the femoral sac, allow for alteration to a simple inguinal hernia repair if necessary, and more importantly obviate the need for further skin incisions if compromised bowel is encountered that requires resection.

### Is the lichtenstein operation of strangulated groin hernia a safe procedure? [^7fbfbcea]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In spite of many published articles describing the hernia repairs, there are only a few original reports concerning the polymer mesh application during emergency procedures for strangulated inguinal hernias. The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of the Lichtenstein and Bassini operations for strangulated groin hernias and to show the changing number of the tension-free repairs.

Methods

From 1997 to 2004, the Bassini procedure was performed in 21 patients, 6 of whom underwent small intestine resection and 2 others required resection of the necrotic omentum. The strangulated intestinal loop or omentum were released in 13 cases. After the repair 1 patient died of shock caused by intestinal necrosis. Of 56 patients who underwent an emergency Lichtenstein procedure, 55 were followed-up. A small intestine resection was performed in 2 cases to correct segmental necrosis. The gangrenous omental appendix of the sigmoid colon was excised in 1 patient, and necrotic omental fragments were resected in 2 cases. The strangulated intestinal loop or omentum was released in 51 patients. All patients were given wide-spectrum antibiotics intravenously.

Results

Between 1997 and 2000 tension-free procedures were performed in half of the patients undergoing emergency operation for strangulated hernia; between 2001 and 2004 such procedures were employed in more than 90% of the cases. In 2 patients we observed a small inflammatory infiltration of the wound that resolved within several days after Lichtenstein repair. A serous fluid collection was present in 2 cases. The treatment consisted of puncture and was successful in both cases.

Conclusions

The use of monofilament polypropylene mesh for strangulated inguinal hernia repair is safe, and the risk of the local infectious complications is low.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^058e0b2f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Laparoscopic treatment for acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernias is uncommon and controversial. In the present study, we assessed the safety and feasibility of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair for the treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernias.

Methods

Patients with acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernias who underwent TAPP repair at the Department of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery (Beijing Chaoyang Hospital) from January 2017 to December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' characteristics, operation details, and postoperative complications were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

In total, 94 patients with acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernias underwent TAPP repair. The patients comprised 85 men and 9 women (mean age, 54.3 ± 13.6 years; mean operating time, 61.6 ± 17.7 min; mean hospital stay, 3.9 ± 2.2 days). No patients were converted to open surgery. Hernia reduction was successfully performed in all patients. The morbidity of complications was 20.2% (19/94). Two bowel resections were performed endoscopically. Nine (9.6%) patients avoided unnecessary bowel resections during laparoscopic procedures. All patients recovered well without severe complications. No recurrence or infection was recorded during a mean follow-up period of 26.8 ± 9.8 months.

Conclusions

TAPP appears to be safe and feasible for treatment of patients with acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernias. However, it requires performed by experienced surgeons in laparoscopic techniques.

### Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias [^de66f2aa]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Contraindications to laparoscopy

An open approach using local anesthesia should be performed when the patient's medical condition makes general anesthesia risky. Patients with prior or planned pelvic operations (for instance, radical retropubic prostatectomy) or pelvic irradiation should undergo open repair. Patients with recurrence from a prior laparoscopic repair usually should undergo open repair, although good results with a TAPP approach have been reported. Finally, patients with a strangulated hernia should undergo open repair because laparoscopic repair is more dangerous, and a primary sutured hernia repair without mesh may be necessary if the field is contaminated. Incarcerated hernia is a relative contraindication because traction on the intestines risks injury and contamination of an otherwise sterile field.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^2288f65d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The decision on the technique of repair was made by the attending staff surgeon in accordance with the WSES guidelines and depending on the degree of contamination of the surgical field and the general condition of the patients. Patients were primarily offered mesh repair unless they were hemodynamically unstable or had significant comorbidities (i.e. ASA III or higher) warranting a quick intervention such as suture repair. In addition, if patients had significant gross contamination of the surgical field (i.e. spillage of intestinal content, CDC class III) rendering the application of synthetic mesh risky, then suture repair was performed.

Follow-up was conducted at the outpatient clinic by a surgical resident to eliminate risk of investigator bias, and then by one of the operating consultants at 1 week, two weeks, one, six, and 12 months postoperatively then every six months after the first year. Surgical site occurrence (SSO) was defined as SSI, cellulitis, necrosis, chronic and/or non-healing wound, serous or purulent drainage, seroma, hematoma, wound dehiscence, or fistula at the surgical site. SSI was defined according to the standard criteria devised by CDC. Recurrence was defined as the re-appearance of the ventral hernia at the site of previous repair as detected by clinical examination during follow-up.

Data collection

The records of the patients were searched for the following data: patients' characteristics as age, sex, ASA grade, and associated comorbidities, type of ventral hernia and type of emergent presentation (incarceration or strangulation), operation performed and whether intestinal resection was done or not, operation time, incidence of SSO, SSI, and recurrence of hernia. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of postoperative SSI. Secondary end points included the incidence of hernia recurrence after the procedure, SSO, and other postoperative complications.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^4bc24483]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In 2009, a retrospective study investigating laparoscopic techniques used to treat incisional hernias in an emergency setting was published. The results of this series also demonstrated the feasibility of laparoscopic surgery to treat incarcerated incisional hernias in an emergency setting.

Additionally, a systematic literature review performed in 2009 identified articles reporting on laparoscopic treatment, reduction, and repair of incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias from 1989 to 2008. It included seven articles on this topic, reporting on 328 cases treated with total extraperitoneal (TEP) or transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. Laparoscopy can also be used to resect bowel, if necessary, or to repair an occult contralateral hernia, present in 11.2–50% of cases. The authors concluded that the laparoscopic repair is a feasible procedure with acceptable results; however, its efficacy needs to be studied further, ideally with larger, multicentre randomized controlled trials.

The retrospective 4-year analysis of 188 patients who underwent emergency surgical repair of strangulated groin hernias (57 laparoscopic and 131 open, including one and ten bowel resections, respectively, P = 0.117) revealed a significant lower wound infection rate (P < 0.018) in the laparoscopic group, without a higher recurrence rate (P < 0.815).

Hernioscopy is a mixed laparoscopic–open surgical technique for incarcerated inguinal hernias. Specifically, it is effective in evaluating the viability of the herniated loop, thus avoiding unnecessary laparotomy.

A prospective randomized study in 2009 aimed to evaluate the impact of hernia sac laparoscopy on the morbidity and mortality of cases with a spontaneous reduction of the strangulated hernia content before the assessment of its viability. Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned to two groups: group A (21 patients managed using hernia sac laparoscopy) and group B (20 patients managed without laparoscopy). The median hospital stay was 28 h for group A and 34 h for group B. Four patients of group B had major complications, whereas there was none observed in group A. Two unnecessary laparotomies and two deaths occurred in group B. The authors concluded that hernia sac laparoscopy seems to be an accurate and safe method of preventing unnecessary laparotomy, and in high-risk patients, it contributes to decreased morbidity.

### Management of asymptomatic pediatric umbilical hernias: a systematic review [^7c96ad82]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated pediatric umbilical hernias are common and most close spontaneously. No formal practice guidelines exist regarding the optimal timing and indications for repair. The objective of this review is to examine the existing literature on the natural history of pediatric umbilical hernias, known complications of repair and non-operative approaches, and management recommendations.

Study Design

A systematic literature search was performed to identify publications relating to pediatric umbilical hernias. Inclusion criteria comprised studies addressing recommendations for optimal timing of repair, evidence examining complications from hernias not operatively repaired, and research exploring the likelihood of pediatric umbilical hernias to close spontaneously. In addition, the websites of all pediatric hospitals in the United States were examined for recommendations on operative timing.

Results

A total of 787 manuscripts were reviewed, and 28 met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Studies examined the likelihood of spontaneous closure based on child's age and size of hernia defect, complications of unrepaired umbilical hernias including incarceration, strangulation and evisceration based on child's age and size of defect, incidence of postoperative complications and current recommendations for timing of repair. In addition, 63 (27.5%) of the United States pediatric hospital websites published a wide range of management recommendations.

Conclusion

Despite the high prevalence of pediatric umbilical hernias, there is a paucity of high quality data to guide management. The literature does suggest that expectant management of asymptomatic hernias until age 4-5years, regardless of size of hernia defect, is both safe and the standard practice of many pediatric hospitals.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^03159f57]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The debate on the optimal management of complicated ventral hernias continues. The use of prosthetic mesh has been considered the standard treatment for elective ventral hernia repair since simple repair with sutures is associated with significantly higher rates of recurrence of hernia that can reach up to 67% on long term follow-up. On another hand, the emergency management of complicated ventral hernias can be more cumbersome owing to the potential contamination of the operative field which can preclude the use of synthetic mesh. Alternatives to synthetic mesh, as bioprosthesis and biosynthetic mesh, appeared to solve the problem; nevertheless, these alternatives are not readily available everywhere because of their cost. This leaves the surgeon on the horns of a dilemma that entails higher risk for SSI when synthetic mesh is used and higher incidence of recurrence when the mesh is abandoned.

The WSES has issued a useful set of recommendations for the emergency repair of complicated ventral hernias including a grade A1 recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh for incarcerated hernias, grade 2C recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh with caution in strangulated hernias with or without concurrent bowel resection, and grade 2C recommendation for using biologic mesh instead of synthetic mesh in the cases of acute strangulation with bowel perforation.

We employed the WSES clinical guidelines for emergency ventral hernia repair on 122 patients and examined the outcome of synthetic mesh repair versus suture repair performed in accordance with the guidelines. Patients included were adults of a mean age of 56 years close to the mean age of paraumbilical hernia reported by Bedewi et al. The majority of the patients had at least one associated comorbidity, yet less than 20% of them had high ASA grade. Umbilical hernias represented around 85% of the ventral hernias included in the study, in accord with Aguirre and colleagues defined this type as the most common type of ventral hernia.

### Open femoral hernia repair: one skin incision for all [^74d203a7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Femoral hernias are relatively uncommon, however they are the most common incarcerated abdominal hernia, with strangulation of a viscus carrying significant mortality. Classically three approaches are described to open femoral hernia repair: Lockwood's infra-inguinal, Lotheissen's trans-inguinal and McEvedy's high approach. Each approach describes a separate skin incision and dissection to access the femoral sac. The decision as to which approach to adopt, predominantly dependent on the suspicion of finding strangulated bowel, is often a difficult one and in our opinion an unnecessary one.

Methods

We propose a technique for open femoral hernia repair that involves a single skin incision 1 cm above the medial half of the inguinal ligament that allows all of the above approaches to the hernia sac depending on the operative findings. Thus the repair of simple femoral hernias can be performed from below the inguinal ligament. If found, inguinal hernias can be repaired. More importantly, resection of compromised bowel can be achieved by accessing the peritoneal cavity with division of the linea semilunaris 4 cm above the inguinal ligament. This avoids compromise of the inguinal canal, and with medial retraction of the rectus abdominis muscle enables access to the peritoneal cavity and compromised bowel.

Discussion

This simple technique minimises the preoperative debate as to which incision will allow the best approach to the femoral hernia sac, allow for alteration to a simple inguinal hernia repair if necessary, and more importantly obviate the need for further skin incisions if compromised bowel is encountered that requires resection.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^9007cffc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic approach

Diagnostic laparoscopy may be a useful tool with the target of assessing bowel viability after spontaneous reduction of strangulated groin hernias (grade 2B recommendation).

Repair of incarcerated hernias — both ventral and groin — may be performed with a laparoscopic approach in the absence of strangulation and suspicion of the need of bowel resection, where an open pre-peritoneal approach is preferable (grade 2C recommendation).

Few studies have focused on the laparoscopic approach to hernia repair in an emergency setting.

In 2004, Landau and Kyzer published a retrospective study investigating the use of laparoscopy in the repair of incarcerated incisional and ventral hernias. The authors argued that laparoscopic repair was feasible and could be safely used to treat patients presenting with incarcerated incisional and ventral hernias.

In 2007, a series of patients with large irreducible groin hernias (omentoceles), treated by laparoscopy without conversions, was published. The authors described a technique to facilitate complete removal of the hernia contents. A laparoscopic transperitoneal repair for large irreducible scrotal hernias, removing as much omentum as possible, was performed. Then, a small groin incision was made to excise the adherent omentum from the distal sac.

Another retrospective study published in 2008 investigated the role of laparoscopy in the management of incarcerated (non-reducible) ventral hernias. The authors concluded that laparoscopic repair of ventral abdominal wall hernias could be safely performed with low subsequent complication rates, even in the event of an incarcerated hernia. Careful bowel reduction with adhesiolysis and mesh repair in an uncontaminated abdomen (without inadvertent enterotomy) using a 5-cm-mesh overlap was an important factor predictive of successful clinical outcome.

### Traumatic abdominal wall hernias: a single-center case series of surgical management [^1aa71d10]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The final concern is the use of mesh. Attempting primary closure of a defect with non-absorbable monofilament sutures is recommended for closing small defects. However, the data from elective primary repairs of incisional hernias have a recurrence rate of up to 40%, similar to our rate of 33%. Contamination due to other injuries or overall patient condition may prohibit the use of a prosthetic in the acute setting, when a primary repair would suffice, accepting the higher recurrence rate. In some instances, absorbable or biologic meshes can be used when there is a concern for contamination in the setting of a large wall defect. Alternatively, the hernia repair can be delayed altogether if the risk of incarceration or strangulation is low. A delayed repair can be performed after 6–8 weeks when the soft-tissue damage and edema have subsided, and a clean field is available. It is well documented that tension-free techniques with mesh reinforcement minimize hernia recurrence rates and therefore is recommended for all delayed TAWH repairs.

To repair a recurrent strangulated umbilical hernia in a cirrhotic patient with refractory ascites, we used a minimally invasive procedure. The laparoscopic repair included a release of the incarcerated small bowel loop and secure of a dual Gortex mesh onto the fascial rim. Our satisfactory long-term results should encourage surgeons to adapt this surgical approach.

### Mesh versus non-mesh for inguinal and femoral hernia repair [^e6ade496]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001. Hernias are protrusions of all or part of an organ through the body wall that normally contains it. Groin hernias include inguinal (96%) and femoral (4%) hernias, and are often symptomatic with discomfort. They are extremely common, with an estimated lifetime risk in men of 27%. Occasionally they may present as emergencies with complications such as bowel incarceration, obstruction and strangulation. The definitive treatment of all hernias is surgical repair, inguinal hernia repair being one of the most common surgical procedures performed. Mesh (hernioplasty) and the traditional non-mesh repairs (herniorrhaphy) are commonly used, with an increasing preference towards mesh repairs in high-income countries.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of different inguinal and femoral hernia repair techniques in adults, specifically comparing closure with mesh versus without mesh. Outcomes include hernia recurrence, complications (including neurovascular or visceral injury, haematoma, seroma, testicular injury, infection, postoperative pain), mortality, duration of operation, postoperative hospital stay and time to return to activities of daily living.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 9 May 2018: Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1950), Ovid Embase (from 1974) and Web of Science (from 1900). Furthermore, we checked the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for trials. We applied no language or publication restrictions. We also searched the reference lists of included trials and review articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of mesh compared to non-mesh inguinal or femoral hernia repairs in adults over the age of 18 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Where available, we collected information on adverse effects. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios, and where possible we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). We presented continuous data as mean difference. Analysis of missing data was based on intention-to-treat principles, and we assessed heterogeneity using an evaluation of clinical and methodological diversity, Chi 2 test and I 2 statistic. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (6293 participants) in this review. All included studies specified inguinal hernias, and two studies reported that femoral hernias were included. Mesh repair probably reduces the risk of hernia recurrence compared to non-mesh repair (21 studies, 5575 participants; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.80, I² = 44%, moderate-quality evidence). In absolute numbers, one hernia recurrence was prevented for every 46 mesh repairs compared with non-mesh repairs. Twenty-four studies (6293 participants) assessed a wide range of complications with varying follow-up times. Neurovascular and visceral injuries were more common in non-mesh repair groups (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.76, I² = 0%, NNTB = 22, high-quality evidence). Wound infection was found slightly more commonly in the mesh group (20 studies, 4540 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.86, I² = 0%, NNTB = 200, low-quality evidence). Mesh repair reduced the risk of haematoma compared to non-mesh repair (15 studies, 3773 participants; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.13, I² = 0%, NNTB = 143, low-quality evidence). Seromas probably occur more frequently with mesh repair than with non-mesh repair (14 studies, 2640 participants; RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.59, I² = 0%, NNTB = 72, moderate-quality evidence), as does wound swelling (two studies, 388 participants; RR 4.56, 95% CI 1.02 to 20.48, I² = 33%, NNTB = 72, moderate-quality evidence). The comparative effect on wound dehiscence is uncertain due to wide confidence intervals (two studies, 329 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.48, I² = 37% NNTB = 77, low-quality evidence). Testicular complications showed nearly equivocal results; they probably occurred slightly more often in the mesh group however the confidence interval around the effect was wide (14 studies, 3741 participants; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.76, I² = 0%, NNTB = 2000, low-quality evidence). Mesh reduced the risk of postoperative urinary retention compared to non-mesh (eight studies, 1539 participants; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.73, I² = 56%, NNTB = 16, moderate-quality evidence). Postoperative and chronic pain could not be compared due to variations in measurement methods and follow-up time (low-quality evidence). No deaths occurred during the follow-up periods reported in the seven studies (2546 participants) reporting this outcome (high-quality evidence). The average operating time was longer for non-mesh repairs by a mean of 4 minutes 22 seconds, despite wide variation across the studies regarding size and direction of effect, thus this result is uncertain (20 studies, 4148 participants; 95% CI -6.85 to -1.60, I² = 97%, very low-quality evidence). Hospital stay may be shorter with mesh repair, by 0.6 days (12 studies, 2966 participants; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.34, I² = 98%, low-quality evidence), and participants undergoing mesh repairs may return to normal activities of daily living a mean of 2.87 days sooner than those with non-mesh repair (10 studies, 3183 participants; 95% CI -4.42 to -1.32, I² = 96%, low-quality evidence), although the results of both these outcomes are also limited by wide variation in the size and direction of effect across the studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Mesh and non-mesh repairs are effective surgical approaches in treating hernias, each demonstrating benefits in different areas. Compared to non-mesh repairs, mesh repairs probably reduce the rate of hernia recurrence, and reduce visceral or neurovascular injuries, making mesh repair a common repair approach. Mesh repairs may result in a reduced length of hospital stay and time to return to activities of daily living, but these results are uncertain due to variation in the results of the studies. Non-mesh repair is less likely to cause seroma formation and has been favoured in low-income countries due to low cost and reduced availability of mesh materials. Risk of bias in the included studies was low to moderate and generally handled well by study authors, with attention to details of allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting.

### Primary tissue repair for inguinal hernias: the shouldice repair technique and patient selection [^27878da7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that approximately one in four men and one in 20 women will develop an inguinal hernia over the course of their lifetime. A non-mesh inguinal hernia repair via the Shouldice technique is a unique approach that necessitates dissection of the entire groin region as well as careful assessment for any secondary hernias. Subsequently, a pure tissue laminated closure allows the repair to be performed without tension. Herein, the authors describe a brief overview of inguinal hernias and discuss the relevant patient evaluation, operative steps of the Shouldice procedure, and postoperative considerations.

### Laparoscopic extraperitoneal approach to acutely incarcerated inguinal hernia [^0be1d4b9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic treatment of acutely incarcerated inguinal hernia is uncommon and still controversial. Those being performed almost all use the transabdominal (TAPP) approach. The authors here present their experience with totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of acutely incarcerated hernia.

Methods

A retrospective review was undertaken to evaluate the authors' experience with this procedure over a 4-year period. There were 16 cases, 5 of which were performed using a conventional anterior repair. These 5 cases were excluded from the review. The surgery for all of the remaining 11 acutely incarcerated hernias was started laparoscopically using the TEP approach. Eight of the cases were completed this way, whereas three were converted to the open procedure. In addition to standard TEP repair techniques, a releasing incision is required for acutely incarcerated direct, indirect, or femoral hernias. With a direct hernia, the opening of the defect is enlarged to allow safe dissection of its contents. A releasing incision is made at the anteromedial aspect of the defect to avoid injury to the epigastric or iliac vessels. With an indirect hernia, several additional steps are required. The epigastric vessels may be divided; an additional trocar may be placed laterally below the linea semicircularis to facilitate dissection of the sac and to assist with suturing of the divided sac; and the deep internal ring is divided anteriorly at the 12 o'clock position toward the external ring, facilitating dissection of the indirect sac. With a femoral hernia, a releasing incision is made by carefully incising the insertion of the iliopubic tract into Cooper's ligament at the medial portion of the femoral ring.

Results

The mean operative time was 50 min (range, 20–120 min), and the length of hospital stay was 5.4 days (range, 1–29 days). During a follow-up period of 9 to 69 months, there was no recurrence, and only two complications. One of these complications was an infected mesh that occurred in a case involving cecal injury. It was treated with continuous irrigation and salvaged. The other complication was a midline wound infection after a small bowel resection for a strangulated obturator hernia.

Conclusions

Familiarity with the anatomy involved leads to the conclusion that the laparoscopic approach, specifically the TEP procedure, can be used without hesitation even in cases of acutely incarcerated hernia.

### Laparoscopic repair of strangulated morgagni hernia [^bad9eba8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Morgagni, an Italian anatomist, described in 1769 a hernia through a defect in the diaphragm immediately behind the sternum. The hernial sac most commonly extends to the right and if large enough may contain colon, omentum and stomach. The defect lies between the sternal and anterior costal fibres of the diaphragm and is reported to represent around 3% of congenital diaphragmatic hernias. It may present in the newborn with respiratory distress however most are not diagnosed until later in life.

In the adult, Morgagni hernias are generally asymptomatic being an incidental finding on imaging or laparoscopy. Some authors recommend repair even in asymptomatic people to avoid the risk of strangulation and emergency surgery. If there were to be radiological evidence of incarcerated tissue then elective operation should be recommended. With the advent of effective laparoscopic repair it is likely that more asymptomatic patients will come to operation.

Morgagni hernias may become symptomatic and various upper GI complaints have been attributed to this type of hernia, including indigestion and flatulence. Rarely, the hernia may present acutely when its contents become strangulated and emergency operation will be necessary.

Laparoscopic repair of Morgagni hernia was first described by Kuster and colleagues in 1992 and has rapidly replaced open transabdominal or transthoracic approaches although most emergency cases are still managed by open operation. There is still some debate as to the merits of resecting the sac and whether primary closure of the defect is preferable to mesh placement. In the case detailed herein, the defect was large and primary closure was not feasible. Polypropelene mesh was carefully tacked in place with a wide overlap onto fascia. This is easily done and is likely to form a strong repair with tissue ingrowth into the mesh fixing it in place. Due to the position of the defect, which will be covered by stomach and omentum, it is unlikely that bowel would become adherent and the use of special mesh was not considered necessary. Fixation of the mesh may be achieved by sutures or tacks, although if tacks are used, care must be taken as there is a report of postoperative cardiac tamponade due to bleeding from an epicardial artery. Unfortunately no significant followup was possible on this patient and further reports will be needed to confirm the durability of this technique.

### Abdominal hernia… [^571a9bf1]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

The first symptom of a hernia is usually a small bulging under the skin that is generally painless but may produce discomfort and get larger during strenuous activities or coughing. At this stage, the hernia is reducible because its contents can be pushed back into the abdomen. However, if the hernia grows, it may become incarcerated. If blood stops flowing through an incarcerated bowel, this results in strangulation, which is accompanied by pain, often with nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Risk factors Family history of hernia Being male Obesity Pregnancy Weight lifting, coughing, straining during bowel movement Cystic fibrosis and chronic lung infections Previous abdominal surgery Complications. A hernia may result in entrapment of other organs or nerves, producing constipation or problems with urination or sexual function.

A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because part of the bowel may become necrotic, resulting in life-threatening peritonitis needing surgical removal of part of the bowel. If you have a hernia and significant abdominal pain, pain over the hernia, or nausea or vomiting, you should seek medical care immediately. Treatment Initial treatment of a minor hernia includes avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous exercises and, sometimes, wearing a support. It used to be thought that all hernias should be repaired. However, recent evidence suggests that repair should be performed only if significant discomfort or pain is associated with the hernia. The operation to repair a hernia is called a herniorrhaphy. When the gap is large, a plastic mesh may be used for reinforcement of muscles of the abdominal wall.

Use of mesh reduces the risk of the hernia recurring, but the mesh material can become infected. In some cases, hernia repairs may be performed laparoscopically, although this approach has not been shown to be better than traditional open operations. TOPIC: SURGERY Pluta RM, Burke AE, Golub RM.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^0c120c62]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Both groups (suture and mesh repair) had comparable patients' demographics and hernia characteristics which can minimize the inherent risk of selection bias associated with retrospective studies. Although according to WSES guidelines, incarcerated hernias are recommended to be managed with synthetic mesh repair invariably, only 60% of these patients were treated with mesh repair in our study. The reason for this can be the overall general condition and associated comorbidities of the patients that called for a rapid maneuver such as simple suture repair. On the other hand, only half of the patients with strangulation and around 10% of the patients with concomitant bowel resection underwent mesh repair which is in line with the WSES recommendations to use synthetic mesh cautiously in these potentially contaminated conditions.

Although mesh hernioplasty had higher incidence of SSO overall, there was no significant difference in the incidence of SSI between mesh repair and suture repair. The overall 30-day SSI after mesh repair in our series was 7.5% ranging between 3% for incarcerated hernias and 11.5% for strangulated hernias. The rates of SSI after prosthetic repair of strangulated hernias are generally higher than those of incarcerated hernia which can be attributed to the ischemia of the bowel wall that predisposes to bacterial translocation, as well as the risk of bowel resection that can further increase the contamination of the surgical field. That is why the operative field in the cases of strangulated hernias was classified as clean-contaminated or contaminated.

Abdominal wall hernia management in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) includes discussing nonsurgical management for asymptomatic hernias due to increased risk for complications and recurrence after repair, educating people managed expectantly to recognize symptoms of incarceration or strangulation such as acute pain, nausea, and vomiting that should prompt surgical evaluation, and discussing surgical repair in those who elect peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a mode of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) because increased abdominal pressure is a known risk factor for enlargement and complications of hernias.

### Laparoscopic repair of strangulated hernias [^2ee863df]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Although laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal polypropylene (TAPP) hernia repair is now a recognized procedure for groin hernia repair in patients undergoing elective surgery, there is a scarcity of data on TAPP repair in emergency situations such as those involving strangulated hernias.

Methods

Unless contraindicated, the authors' department considers laparoscopic TAPP repair the procedure of choice for all strangulated hernias. A prospective database of 1,532 consecutive hernia repairs performed between May 1998 and April 2004 was reviewed.

Results

A total of 28 irreducible strangulated hernias were observed and repaired through laparoscopic TAPP. There were three conversions (10.7%): one because of extensive adhesions and two because of bowel distention. Resection became necessary in 9 (36%) of the 25 cases involving effective TAPP repair of strangulated hernias. The mean operation time, with and without resection, was 103 and 55 min, respectively. The rate of postoperative morbidity was 4% because of one inguinal hematoma case. During a mean follow-up period of 340 days, there were no recurrences after TAPP repair.

Conclusions

For selected patients, the TAPP approach appears to be a good therapeutic option for strangulated hernias.

### Laparoscopic versus open approach for emergency repair of groin hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^72644340]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The findings of this systematic review and meta‐analysis have shown that laparoscopic acute groin hernia repair results in significantly shorter hospital stays and lower risk of wound infection compared to open repair. There was no significant difference between the two approaches in terms of operative time. Based on available evidence, laparoscopic groin hernia repair appears to be a safe and feasible approach in select cases in the emergency setting.

Several included studies attributed the favorable outcome of laparoscopic repair to the utilization of diagnostic laparoscopy. Using the TAPP approach, surgeons can observe and evaluate the viability of the herniated organs. Furthermore, the time taken for hernia reduction and mesh placement allows the herniated structures to recover if possible. This allows for more thorough exploration of bowel viability and reduces the risk of unnecessary bowel resection and conversion to laparotomy, which are known to worsen patient outcomes. Furthermore, diagnostic laparoscopy facilitates the detection of pseudo‐incarcerations and unexpected bilateral hernias. One study also noted that, in patients where bowel resections are required, laparoscopic removal of adhesions before conversion minimizes the size of the incision and enhances patient outcome. This supports the WSES recommendation to consider diagnostic laparoscopy to assess bowel viability if expertise is available.

Although laparoscopic repair demonstrates favorable outcomes in certain cases of acute groin hernias, results from this review do not support its widespread adoption for all presentations. Contraindications to laparoscopic repair include hemodynamic instability, significant peritoneal contamination, severe intestinal dilatation, intestinal perforation, and severe impairment of cardiopulmonary function. In patients where these conditions apply, there is no evidence to suggest that laparoscopic repair should be recommended over open repair. Furthermore, many studies recognize the steeper learning curve associated with laparoscopic repair, particularly in the emergency setting. This highlights the need for individualized assessment and management of patients presenting with acute groin hernias. The current WSES guideline recommends that strangulated groin hernias should be repaired via open approach. The HerniaSurge guideline recommends a tailored approach to acute groin hernia repair, with no specification regarding indications and contraindications to laparoscopic repair. Result from this review suggests that laparoscopic repair may be considered for patients without any aforementioned contraindications, where expertise is available.

Laparoscopic approach in complicated Groin and Ventral Hernia

According to the 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias, the repair of incarcerated hernias — both ventral and groin — may be performed with a laparoscopic approach in the absence of strangulation and suspicion of the need for bowel resection, where an open approach is preferable. However, due to improvements in MIS techniques and equipment, the laparoscopic approach is increasingly chosen for acute incarcerated hernias.

### Laparoscopic versus open approach for emergency repair of groin hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fce72ff9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This review is subject to several limitations. Foremost among these is the absence of randomized controlled trials in the current literature. All included studies are observational, resulting in low‐quality evidence due to nonrandomized study designs, biased patient allocation, and significant confounding. Notably, patients undergoing laparoscopic repair are often younger, less comorbid, and exhibit better preoperative conditions. Laparoscopic surgeries are also frequently performed by more experienced surgeons. Additionally, there is a large discrepancy between the size of the laparoscopic and open groups. Furthermore, the use and definition of clinical presentation terminologies were inconsistent. Historically, 'incarceration' refers to the inability to reduce the hernia mass into the abdomen, whereas 'strangulation' has been defined by compromised bloods supply to the herniated tissue. However, these terms have been defined inconsistently across the literature. In light of this, the 2023 HerniaSurge guidelines propose updated terminology, recommending 'acutely irreducible hernia' for hernias that become nonreducible with acute symptoms, 'chronically irreducible hernia' for longstanding nonreducible hernias without new symptoms, and 'strangulated hernia' only when vascular compromise is confirmed by imaging or intraoperative findings. The lack of standardized definitions in the existing literature limits the ability to perform meaningful subgroup analysis based on clinical presentation. This highlights the need for future studies to adopt consistent definitions for acute hernia presentations. Other limitations include the inability to compare outcomes between TAPP and TEP repairs as only two studies reported mixed use of TAPP and TEP, whereas none reported exclusive TEP use. Similarly, subgroup analysis based on different types of groin hernia is not possible due to insufficient data in the included studies. Lastly, only one study used a standardized system to grade postoperative complications.

In conclusion, although laparoscopic repair presents a safe and potentially superior alternative for noncomplicated presentations of acute groin hernias compared to open repair, definitive evidence is lacking. This systematic review and meta‐analysis emphasizes the need for higher‐quality evidence and hopes to guide future research endeavors and clinical practice. Ultimately, the decision between laparoscopic and open repair should be made judiciously, taking into account patient characteristics, surgical expertise, and evolving evidence‐based guidelines.

### Laparoscopic groin hernia repair… [^57184f76]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hewitt DB, Chojnacki K. Laparoscopic Groin Hernia Repair. JAMA. 2017; 318:

1294. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.11620 Laparoscopic hernia repair is performed with general anesthesia and requires use of a breathing tube. Three half-inch or smaller incisions are made in the lower part of the abdomen. In laparoscopic hernia repair, a camera called a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen to visualize the hernia defect on a monitor. The image on the monitor is used to guide the surgeon's movements. The hernia sac is removed from the defect in the abdominal wall, and a prosthetic mesh is then placed to cover the hernia defect. While doing this, surgeons are careful to avoid injuring the nerves that are near the hernia, blood vessels that can bleed, or the vas deferens. The small incisions are closed with stitches that dissolve on their own over time.

You should discuss all hernia repair options with your surgeon to determine which approach is best for you. The majority of patients undergoing elective or nonemergent groin hernia repair go home the same day as the surgery once their pain is under control, they have urinated, and they are able to tolerate food or liquids without nausea or vomiting. Most patients can expect soreness over the first 1 to 2 days after surgery. Take pain medication as prescribed by your surgeon. Some patients may experience bruising in and around the groin area. This is normal. However, if there is significant swelling in the groin, you should contact your surgeon. You should walk every day but limit strenuous activity such as running and lifting anything over 5 to 10 lb until evaluated by your surgeon at your postoperative visit 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. In general, if an activity hurts, it shouldn't be done.

Constipation and straining during bowel movements increases the pressure on the repair and should be avoided; eat a high-fiber diet and use stool softeners if needed.

### Laparoscopic versus open approach for emergency repair of groin hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0df358d0]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Over 20 million patients undergo groin hernia repair globally each year, making it one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Groin hernias can present acutely, often as strangulated or acutely irreducible hernias. Acute groin hernia repair, compared to elective surgery, typically yields poorer postoperative outcomes. The proportion of emergency groin hernia repairs varies significantly based on the income status of the country, with rates ranging from 3.7% to 9.6% in developed countries and reaching as high as 76.9% in developing countries. Historically, open repair has been the preferred approach in emergency settings. However, in recent years, there has been a significant evolution in the landscape of acute groin hernia repair with the introduction of laparoscopic techniques.

Despite the increasing use of the laparoscopic technique in acute groin hernia repair, evidence regarding its efficacy compared to open repair remains limited. Consequently, the 2017 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines recommends cautious consideration of laparoscopic repair, only in the absence of strangulation and the need for bowel resection. The 2018 HerniaSurge guidelines advocate for a tailored approach to acute groin hernia repair based on patient condition and the expertise of the surgical team. As such, there remains no definitive conclusion regarding the optimal approach to acute groin hernia repair.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to investigate the differences in safety and efficacy between laparoscopic and open repair for acute groin hernias based on available evidence. Furthermore, it aims to elucidate the utility of laparoscopic surgery in acute groin hernia repair, including its potential indications and contraindications.

### Laparoscopic mesh repair of a labial hernia [^3094d591]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To present a narrated video designed to demonstrate the steps involved in a laparoscopic mesh repair of a labial hernia.

Methods

This was in a 76-year-old woman who presented with a small bowel hernia in to her left labium majus. In 2014 she had a robotically assisted radical cystectomy for bladder cancer with anterior exenteration. She developed the hernia in February 2015 and initially a vaginal approach was attempted to repair the hernia (with layered non-absorbable sutures to close the fascia over the defect) at her local hospital, although this was unsuccessful. A laparoscopic repair with mesh on the 10 May 2016 was undertaken at our unit.

Results

This was a complex case requiring a multi disciplinary approach and individualised care. The need for a mesh was obvious: however, the use of both synthetic and biological meshes to achieve an optimum result was unique and highly successful.

Conclusion

In this instance a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach where initial adhesiolysis was performed and then a synthetic mesh sandwiched in between two biological porcine meshes provided a unique management solution. The patient was seen 8 weeks post operatively and at 14 months after the procedure. She had complete resolution of her symptoms with no residual hernia.

### Hernia emergencies [^a6f0726a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Hernia emergencies are commonly encountered by the acute care surgeon. Although the location and contents may vary, the basic principles are constant: address the life-threatening problem first, then perform the safest and most durable hernia repair possible. Mesh reinforcement provides the most durable long-term results. Underlay positioning is associated with the best outcomes. Components separation is a useful technique to achieve tension-free primary fascial reapproximation. The choice of mesh is dictated by the degree of contamination. Internal herniation is rare, and preoperative diagnosis remains difficult. In all hernia emergencies, morbidity is high, and postoperative wound complications should be anticipated.

### The history of the pediatric inguinal hernia repair [^eb61b168]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The history of inguinal hernia repair is a rich one. For centuries, hernia healers, doctors, anatomists, surgeons and quacks have been devoted to this pathology that has afflicted mankind throughout its evolution. The development of surgical correction mainly focused on adult pathology, with treatments that often involved the loss of the testis. Hernia management in children, however, also dates from antiquity. Described as a swelling on the surface of the belly in ancient papyri, it was treated with tight bandages by the early physicians of Alexandria. For centuries, conservative treatment had been used for the child using primordial trussess, many prayers, and often pagan rituals as the arboreal passage of children described by Marcello of Bordeaux, doctor of the Emperor Theodosius I (347–395 AD), reserving medical intervention only for cases of strangulation in which only reduction was attempted. The middle ages were characterized by an increase in cultural and scientific exchange, during which the first comprehensive surgical textbooks and atlases were written. Different approaches to the inguinal hernia were not taught and passed down through generations of surgeons. The modern era brought a better understanding of the inguinal anatomy, which led to surgical techniques associated with less post-operative complications. Today, the pediatric inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common pediatric operations performed. It is considered a safe procedure with very low complication rate.

### A case of De garengeot hernia and literature review [^d17081e9]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

The main complications of De Garengeot hernia repair, which are more common in elderly patients, are wound infection with the prevalence of 14%–29% and rarely necrotising fasciitis or death. It is found that delay in diagnosis, poor nutritional status, older age and multiple tissue planes involved in the repair of the hernia are contributing factors to increase the incidence of postoperative infections. In our case, patient had an uneventful recovery period and did not develop wound infection.

Learning points

De Garengeot hernia is a rare type of hernia which is the presence of appendix inside a femoral hernia sac.
Patients usually present with signs and symptoms consistent with an incarcerated/strangulated femoral hernia and surgeons should be aware of it as one of the differential diagnosis of right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Preoperative diagnosis of De Garengeot hernia can be achieved with modern imaging such as ultrasound or CT scan.
Surgery (appendectomy and herniorrhaphy) is the mainstay of treatment and should be done once diagnosed to prevent the complications.

### Meshing around: high-risk hernias and infected mesh [^f1b6d2ab]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of mesh is common for general surgeons around the world. When the operation goes well, and the patient has no issues, both the surgeon and the patient are satisfied with the results. It is estimated that after major trauma and abdominal surgery, the incidence of hernia formation is between 10% and 15%. Choice of mesh for hernia repair is important. The requirements for mesh prosthesis were first described in the 1950s. These requirements include induction of minimal host response and adhesions, vascularization, good host tissue incorporation and resistance to infection. Mesh complications include migration, seroma, foreign body reactions, dehiscence, fistulas, pain, small bowel obstruction and infection. Mesh infection is a serious and potentially devasting complication of hernia repair. Although uncommon in the groin, with an estimate of 2%–4% of cases overall, risk of mesh infection increases up to 10% in abdominal wall hernias. When the laparoscopic approach is employed for incisional hernias, the incidence is noted to be 3.6% overall. The complexity of repair and risk of infection worsen with hernias that have strangulated bowel and contaminated wounds since bacteria are present early in the course of the disease.

### Strangulated or incarcerated spontaneous lumbar hernia as exceptional cause of intestinal obstruction: case report and review of the literature [^1b536a3b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Modern hernia repair using synthetic graft is recommended in lumbar hernia. But in case of strangulation, an incision for exploration or diagnostic laparoscopy should be preferred. In this patient, we perfomed a laparotomy since the patient presented late. Actually there are enough evidence that in abdominal wall hernias mortality is most often associated with delay in presentation and diagnosis. This can probably apply to lumbar hernia even though there is no specific study addressing that specific issue.

Intestinal obstruction and bowel necrosis, require emergency laparotomy with a midline incision. This approach gives the best exposure, allows reduction of the hernial content and facilitates bowel resection and abdominal toilet, if necessary. Other herniation sites can also be evaluated with this incision. Other types of approaches, such as preperitoneal, lumbar, can be applied when early diagnosis is made or in not strangulated cases.

A laparoscopic approach was also envisaged. It is currently encouraged in emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias. However, this approach may prolong the time of operation and increase the risk of mortality in centers that have limited laparoscopic experience and in patients having a bad general condition.

Various repairs include primary suture of the orifice, muscle flaps, omentum, broad ligament, uterine fundus, prosthetic material and mesh plug. Without repair, compications rates of approximately 25% are reported.

The use of mesh for repair of the strangulated hernias in which resection was performed is controversial. Some authors do not recommend this type of repair due to the higher risk of rejection caused by infection. Others recommend it when an intestinal resection is carried out with sufficient care to minimize infective complications; therefore, the use of mesh will not be contraindicated. In our practice we don't use prosthetic material in strangulated hernias and particularly like in this case where a bowell resection was performed.

Mortality is reported to be between 10% and 50% in lumbar hernia. Unfavorable outcomes are commonly associated with delay in diagnosis and therapy, poor condition, elderly patients having coexistent diseases and strangulation with intestinal gangrene.

Although lumbar hernias are rare, they should be considered when an elderly, thin patient presents with a bowel obstruction. Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important factors in decreasing mortality and morbidity; therefore, rapid action for diagnosis and therapy is essential.

### Surgical management of ostomy complications: a MISSTO-WSES mapping review [^95894339]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment

Although PSH can be managed non-operatively in most cases, about 30% of these patients may ultimately require surgical repair, due to the onset of complications, such as strangulation, incarceration or obstruction, or to discomfort and problems with the fitting and function of the appliance. Of these, 10–20% may need urgent surgery. Indications for emergent surgical intervention include severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation associated with incarcerated or strangulated PSH.

Other indications for surgical repair are mainly patient-based, and they depend on the reported symptoms and impairment. These may include bulge around the stoma, poorly fitting appliance, discomfort at site, and recurrent symptoms of partial bowel obstruction.

When the stoma is temporary, ostomy closure may be an optimal alternative to PSH repair, although the risks associated with stoma reversal may be considered together with about 30% risk of developing incisional hernia in the site of closure with simple fascial suture of the defect.

Simple fascial repair is associated with an elevated risk of recurrence. A meta-analysis described a recurrence rate of 69.4% if it is performed locally or through midline laparotomy. In the EHS guidelines, the authors conclude that, although the high recurrence rate, this technique may be considered in specific patient groups, such as in contaminated cases or in the emergency repair of a strangulated hernia, for the less risks compared to the use of a mesh and because this is the simplest surgical repair technique.

Another option is stoma relocation, but it is associated with high recurrence rate at the new stoma site, as high as 76% in some studies, along with the risk of ventral hernia formation at the site of the previous ostomy.

PSH mesh repair can be performed with an open or minimally invasive approach (laparoscopic, endoscopic or robotic). No randomized controlled trials have been performed comparing different methods of PSH repair, and the literature consists primarily of single institution series with relatively small numbers describing outcomes using one type of repair and subsequent reviews of these series.

### Comparison of emergent laparoscopic and open repair of acutely incarcerated and strangulated hernias-short-and long-term results [^ad2628d1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Incarcerated and strangulated hernias are a common clinical presentation encompassing several challenges in acute care surgery. The role of laparoscopy is still controversial and the data is scarce. Laparoscopy enables better evaluation of the incarcerated organ and its viability. The use of mesh repair in these emergent operations is also a major concern. In this series we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic emergent repairs of acutely incarcerated and strangulated hernias, and their long-term results, in comparison to the conventional open repairs.

Methods

Retrospective review of prospectively collected data of all adult patients, between the ages of 18 and 89, who underwent emergent operation due to an incarcerated and strangulated hernia between November 2017 and December 2020.

Results

During the study period, 89 patients underwent emergent operation due to incarcerated hernias-63 laparoscopic repair and 26 underwent an open repair. In the laparoscopic group (LG) 38 patients had a groin hernia and 25 had a ventral hernia, while in the open group (OG) the distribution was 12 and 14, respectively. When operated laparoscopically, all groin hernias but one were repaired in the TAPP approach and most ventral hernias were repaired using the IPOM+approach. During the peri-operative period there were 3 mortalities (1 in the LG). There were no significant differences between the groups in minor or major complications. Mean follow-up time in the LG was 27.9 months and 29.4 months in the OG. There was no significant difference in recurrence rates. Long-term results showed better outcome in the LG regarding pain at rest, difficulty doing exercise and local discomfort.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic emergent repair of incarcerated hernias is a safe and feasible approach, with better short and long-term results compared to the open approach.

Emergency hernia repair in "clean surgical field"

The choice of technique repair is based on the contamination of the surgical field, the size of the hernia and the experience of the surgeon.

Prosthetic repair with synthetic mesh is recommended for patients with intestinal incarceration and no signs of intestinal strangulation or concurrent bowel resection (clean surgical field) (grade 1A recommendation).

The increased likelihood of surgical site infection may suggest additive risk for permanent synthetic mesh repair (grade 1C recommendation).

Primary suture repair as an elective hernia-related procedure can increase the risk of recurrence, thereby leading to subsequent follow-up surgery. This is the case in both ventral and inguinal abdominal wall hernias. Numerous studies have demonstrated the advantages of mesh use in clean, sterile cases; such advantages include ease of placement, low long-term complication rates, and reduction of recurrence for incisional hernias. For patients with intestinal incarceration and no signs of intestinal strangulation or concurrent bowel resection, the surgical field is presumed clean and the infectious risk for synthetic mesh is low. The absence of intestinal wall ischemia renders patients less predisposed to bacterial translocation, and there is a low risk of need for concurrent bowel resection, which leads to contamination of the surgical field. However, this has not been proven for cases of acute irreducible hernias.

### Emergency hernia repair outcomes for patients with and without established hernia care with a surgeon [^2b779744]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Increased emphasis has been placed on appropriate patient selection and preoperative comorbidity optimization to ensure high-quality hernia repair outcomes in the elective setting. While optimization efforts are associated with improved complication rates, postponed or deferred hernia repair may lead to incarceration or strangulation, necessitating emergent operation. It is unknown to what extent patients evaluated for elective hernia repair, who did not undergo surgery, contribute to the patient population undergoing emergent repair. Patients with increased comorbidities and hernia complexity may be disproportionately deferred for elective repair and at increased risk for unfavorable outcomes after emergency surgery.

This study evaluated the association of prior established hernia care with a surgeon with postoperative outcomes after emergent hernia repair. We hypothesized that patients with previously established hernia care would have more complications.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^89d90257]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

Prospectively collected data of consecutive patients with incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernia who were treated with or without synthetic mesh were reviewed. The study took place at the general surgery departments of Mansoura University principal hospital and Emergency hospital. Data collection involved patients treated between January 2014 and June 2016.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board of Mansoura Faculty of medicine. The study was registered onunder the unique identifying number (UIN): researchregistry1891.

Eligibility criteria

Adult patients of both genders who presented with incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernia were included. Ventral hernias comprised all hernias arising from a defect in the anterior abdominal wall including umbilical, epigastric, incisional, and Spigelian hernias. Patients who underwent resection of gangrenous bowel and anastomosis were also included.

We excluded patients with other types of hernia other than ventral hernias, patients who underwent elective hernia repair after manual reduction of irreducible hernia, patients who underwent bowel resection with stoma formation, patients with incarcerated or strangulated omentum only without bowel involvement, and patients with associated necrotizing fasciitis of the anterior abdominal wall. Patients with incomplete records were also excluded.

Definition of procedures and outcomes

Incarcerated ventral hernia was defined as irreducible hernia associated with symptoms of bowel obstruction, yet with no compromise of the blood supply of the bowel. Strangulated hernia presented with partial or complete interruption of the blood supply of the intestine. After application of hot fomentation to the doubtful bowel loop, it was considered either viable and returned to the peritoneal cavity or non-viable and resection with anastomosis of the bowel ends was conducted.

Incisional hernias were defined as hernias occurring at the site of abdominal incision performed for procedures other than hernia repair. Recurrent hernias are the hernias occurring at the site of incision made for previous hernia repair. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surgical wound classification, incarcerated hernias were considered as class I (clean), strangulated hernias without bowel resection as class II (clean contaminated), and strangulated hernias with simultaneous bowel resection as class III (contaminated).

### Open femoral hernia repair: one skin incision for all [^b2eb664f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Femoral hernias are relatively uncommon, making up 2–8% of all adult groin hernias. Incarcerated femoral hernias, however, are the most common incarcerated abdominal hernia, with strangulation of a viscus carrying up to 14% mortality. Femoral hernias are a common cause of small bowel obstruction and remain the most frequent cause of strangulation in this setting, necessitating immediate operative intervention.

Classically three approaches are described to open femoral hernia repair: Lockwood's infra-inguinal approach, Lotheissen's trans-inguinal approach and McEvedy's high approach.

The infra-inguinal approach is the preferred method for elective repair, approaching the femoral canal from below through an oblique incision 1 cm below and parallel to the inguinal ligament. This approach however offers little scope for resecting any compromised bowel.

The trans-inguinal approach involves a skin incision 2 cm above the inguinal ligament, dissecting through the inguinal canal and thus weakening this important structure. The danger with this, particularly in the presence of wound infection, is that a hernia may form later which would be difficult to repair. In addition, if necrotic bowel is encountered the risk of infection may preclude the use of synthetic mesh to repair the inguinal canal and predispose to inguinal hernia occurrence.

The high approach involves an oblique skin incision 3 cm above the pubic tubercle running laterally to cross the lateral border of the rectus muscle, that is divided allowing preperitoneal dissection of the sac. This approach is preferred in the emergency setting when strangulation is suspected allowing better access to and visualisation of bowel for possible resection.

Because of the tendency of femoral hernias to move upward to a position above the inguinal ligament, it may sometimes be mistaken for an inguinal hernia and the correct diagnosis often made only at operation. Frequently the origin of an incarcerated mass may be indistinguishable on physical examination. The presence or absence of compromised sac content is another clinical feature that is often very difficult to predict. In practice therefore these uncertainties make the decision as to which approach to adopt a very difficult one, and in our opinion an unnecessary one.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^2055e38b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled trial found prosthetic repair of incarcerated umbilical hernias a safe option with lower recurrence rates than suture repair. Similarly, other retrospective studies concluded that synthetic mesh repair was not associated with higher risk of SSI in the treatment of complicated ventral and groin hernias. Unlike the present study, the study by Bessa and Abdel-Razek lacked the presence of a control group (suture repair) to compare the outcomes with.

The incidence of SSI in the present series was comparable to that disclosed by Nieuwenhuizen et al. slightly higher than the incidence (6%) reported by Abd Ellatif and colleagues, yet much lower than the rate of SSI (14%) Carbonell and colleagues reported after the application of synthetic mesh in contaminated ventral hernia repair. Nonetheless, since causes of contamination in Carbonell's series were quite variable including infected previous mesh, violation of the gastrointestinal tract, and ostomy creation or reversal along other causes whereas contamination in our series was caused by bowel strangulation only; the higher rate of SSI in their study can be explained. We excluded patients with stoma from the present report since the management of stoma in conjunction with ventral hernia is likely to be coupled with serious morbidities as Carbonell et al. have acknowledged.

The relatively low incidence of SSI after synthetic mesh repair in the current study can be attributed to the combined application of clinical guidelines along with the use of good clinical judgment. As a general rule, following guidelines and applying evidence-based medicine can serve to achieve better outcomes in the surgical practice. The incidence of SSI after prosthetic mesh repair of complicated ventral hernias can be further reduced by employing different techniques of mesh placement (i.e. retrorectus mesh) and negative pressure wound therapy.

Despite the low rates of SSI in our report, chronic infection after the use of synthetic mesh under contaminated conditions remains one of the most concerning consequences. Chronic infection can compromise the wound healing resulting in chronic draining sinuses. Additionally, involvement of the underlying abdominal viscera can sometimes result in enterocutaneous fistulas. Furthermore, re-admission and reoperation for the management of mesh-related infection, including mesh extraction, are linked with added morbidities to the patient and higher treatment-related costs.

Groin hernias

Some studies have asserted that prosthetic repair of abdominal hernias can be safely performed alongside simultaneous colonic operations. Such joint procedures, they argue, exhibit acceptable rates of infectious complications and recurrence, and consequently, they stated that there is insufficient evidence to advocate the avoidance of prosthetic mesh in clean-contaminated fields, assuming that the appropriate technique is used.

Also, the results of the retrospective study by Ueda et al. including 27 patients operated for strangulated groin hernia with small bowel resection (ten patients with mesh and 17 without mesh) did not show any statistically significant differences in terms of morbidity between the two groups and led to the conclusion that strangulated inguinal hernia cannot be considered a contraindication to the mesh repair even in case of intestinal resection.

A recent prospective study by Bessa et al. enrolled 234 patients with acutely or strangulated groin hernias of which 34 underwent resection and anastomosis of non-viable intestine. The results did not show any significant difference (P = 0.7) in the rate of wound or mesh infection between hernias with viable versus non-viable contents. The authors concluded that the presence of non-viable intestine could not be regarded as a contraindication for prosthetic repair.

In the retrospective study by Venara et al. including a subgroup of 25 patients who underwent acute hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection (four with mesh repair and 21 with primary repair), bowel resection appeared to be a risk factor for overall postoperative complications (P > 0.0001) and major complications (P = 0.003), but not for postoperative SSI (P = 0.42). The authors concluded that mesh repair appeared to be safe in the treatment of incarcerated hernia, since after multivariate analysis, mesh placement was not a significant predictor of postoperative complication (P = 0.458).

Indication related to size

The systematic search provided only one article on defect size and outcome [96]. Moreno-Egea et al. performed a prospective study without a control group that excluded hernias smaller than 5 cm in diameter and those with "Swiss cheese" defects. The data analysis showed that size correlates with recurrence, and these authors recommended restriction of the laparoscopic approach to a hernia size of 10 cm or smaller (level 4). A retrospective single-center study of 302 patients who underwent open repair of primary incisional hernia analyzed several risk factors for recurrence and demonstrated that the size of the hernia is a significant risk factor for recurrence [97].

Asymptomatic hernias

The search found no publications on the natural history of the condition. One long-term prospective study and one review showed 60% of patients with incisional hernias to be symptom free [80, 81]. An international questionnaire among hernia specialists showed a rate of 23% for asymptomatic cases, and more than 20% of the patients did not undergo operative repair. The strangulation/incarceration rate was 5% [82]. The group concluded that there are no hard data describing the natural course of an incisional hernia. Their current view is that patients with asymptomatic incisional hernias should be undergo surgery to avoid complications.

Precise data on the strangulation rate or the risk for acute incarceration of incisional hernias are unavailable. One small prospective case study reported an emergency operation rate of 3.2% [103]. The data from the Danish Ventral Hernia Database published by Helgstrand et al. [84] showed an acute hernia rate of 10%, with umbilical hernias showing the highest rate (57%). No controlled studies have investigated the increase in size of incisional hernias over time, the risk factors for strangulation, or the development of discomfort and pain.

A prospective case study involving consecutive patients investigated whether patients obtain pain relief from surgery [103]. This study found no benefit regarding pain for patients with minimal symptoms. Two prospective trials have been launched to address this question relating to the indication for surgery among asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic incisional patients. The multicenter AWARE trial of Lauscher et al. [104] is the multicenter study in the recruiting phase and the second trial that has completed intake and data collection but has not been published to date [105]. Hence, no conclusive data exist currently, but the issue is likely to be resolved with publication of the results from the two trials.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^f8a7af1d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A retrospective study evaluated the risk factors associated with bowel resection and treatment outcome in patients with incarcerated groin hernias. The study analysed 182 adult patients with incarcerated groin hernias who underwent emergency hernia repair in the 10-year period from January 1999 to June 2009. Of these patients, bowel resection was required in 15.4% of cases (28/182). A logistic regression model identified three independent risk factors for bowel resection: lack of health insurance (odds ratio (OR) = 5, P = 0.005), obvious peritonitis (OR = 11.52, P = 0.019), and femoral hernia (OR = 8.31, P < 0.001).

Many authors reported that early detection of progression from an incarcerated hernia to a strangulated hernia is difficult to achieve by either clinical or laboratory means, which presents a large challenge in early diagnosis. Signs of SIRS including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, as well as abdominal wall rigidity, are considered common indicators of strangulated obstruction. However, an investigation by Sarr et al. demonstrated that the combination of four classic signs of strangulation — continuous abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis — could not distinguish strangulated from simple obstructions. Furthermore, Shatlla et al. reported a low incidence of these classical findings and stated that their presence indicated an advanced stage of strangulation, which would be of limited value for early diagnosis. In 2004, Tsumura et al. published a retrospective study investigating SIRS as a predictor of strangulated small bowel obstruction. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of SIRS alongside abdominal muscle guarding was independently predictive of strangulated small bowel obstruction.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

Initial treatment is usually conservative with stoma appliances. Dilatation performed under the care of a stoma care nurse can provide temporary improvement but may need to be performed repeatedly and the tissue trauma involved can lead to further fibrosis and stricturing.

There has been a case report of the use of a SEMS used in the palliative management of a malignant stricture causing large bowel obstruction.

Depending upon the cause of the stenosis, it is usually possible to perform a local correction by excising the scar tissue surrounding the mucocutaneous junction and mobilizing sufficient bowel to form a new stoma at the surface. Recurrent stenosis is common and in these patients re‐siting should be considered. An alternative is the use of a dermoplasty or skin flap technique although this has not been commonly described in the literature. If the stenosed stoma is a temporary covering loop, then stoma reversal may be an option.

Parastomal hernia

Question 7.14

Is imaging useful in the assessment of an obstructed/strangulated parastomal hernia?

Recommendation: CT scan is recommended as part of the assessment of a patient with a suspected obstructed or strangulated parastomal hernia.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia related to an abdominal wall stoma and is recognized to be a common problem in patients who undergo stoma formation. The reported incidence varies widely in the literature depending upon whether the definition is dependent upon symptoms, physical examination or radiological assessment, but may be up to 59% at long‐term follow‐up. It is likely that parastomal hernias are commoner in end colostomies than in other types of stomas.

### Laparoscopic treatment of small bowel strangulation caused by an intramesosigmoid hernia and review of literature [^8f7c28a4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

An internal hernia is defined as a protrusion of an abdominal viscera through the defects of the gastrointestinal mesentery or peritoneum-lined fossa. Sigmoid mesocolic hernias are an uncommon type of internal hernias, accounting for only 6% of all internal hernias. Furthermore, intramesosigmoid hernia is one of the three subtypes of the sigmoid mesocolic hernias. Internal hernias are potentially fatal conditions with diagnostic challenges. Patients presenting with acute obstruction, no surgical history and no external hernia should receive an urgent CT scan to facilitate early surgery and to minimise the risk of strangulation and bowel resection. Here, we report a case of strangulated small bowel obstruction secondary to an intramesosigmoid hernia with a successful laparoscopic repair. We also present a literature review of all reported cases so far and give an up-to-date perspective on intramesosigmoid hernia.

Laparoscopic approach

Repair of incarcerated hernias – both ventral and groin – may be performed with a laparoscopic approach (grade 1C recommendation).

Recent prospective studies and recent guidelines have focused on the laparoscopic approach to hernia repair in an elective setting.

By contrast, few studies have focused on the laparoscopic approach to hernia repair in an emergency setting. In 2004, Landau et al. published a retrospective study investigating the use of laparoscopy in the repair of incarcerated incisional and ventral hernias. The authors argued that laparoscopic repair was feasible and could be safely used to treat patients presenting with incarcerated incisional and ventral hernias.

Another retrospective study published in 2008 investigated the role of laparoscopy in the management of incarcerated (non-reducible) ventral hernias. The authors concluded that laparoscopic repair of ventral abdominal wall hernias could be safely performed with low subsequent complication rates, even in the event of an incarcerated hernia. Careful bowel reduction with adhesiolysis and mesh repair in an uncontaminated abdomen (without inadvertent enterotomy) using a 5-cm mesh overlap was an important factor predictive of successful clinical outcome.

In 2009, another retrospective study was published investigating laparoscopic techniques used to treat incisional hernias in an emergency setting. The results of this series also demonstrated the feasibility of laparoscopic surgery to treat incarcerated incisional hernias in an emergency setting.

Additionally, a systematic literature review performed in 2009 identified articles reporting on laparoscopic treatment, reduction, and repair of incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias from 1989 to 2008. It included seven articles on this topic, reporting on 328 cases treated with total extraperitoneal (TEP) or transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. Laparoscopy can also be used to resect bowel, if necessary, or to repair an occult contralateral hernia, present in 11.2–50% of cases. The Authors concluded that the laparoscopic repair is a feasible procedure with acceptable results; however, its efficacy needs to be studied further, ideally with larger, multicenter randomized controlled trials

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^0a92c9e8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to bowel resection, D.M and previous hernia surgery were recognized as significant predictors for SSI. D.M has been known to be associated with higher rates of infection after mesh repair of hernia since it reduces the T cell response and neutrophil function and causes disorders of humoral immunity. Previous surgeries for ventral hernias, especially when involving the use of prosthetic mesh, may render the repeat procedure technically demanding with difficult dissection, longer operation time, and increased risk of inadvertent bowel injury during dissection of the adhesions. Moreover, if the recurrence of hernia was associated with surgical site infection, further procedures for the treatment of recurrent hernia can have higher likelihood of SSI.

Although on-lay mesh hernioplasty was reported to have higher rates of recurrence and SSI than the sub-lay technique, we found the on-lay repair confers satisfactory results with no recorded cases of hernia recurrence and a rate of SSI comparable to those recorded after the sub-lay technique which ranged from 0–14.4%. We opt for employing the on-lay technique of repair as it appeared technically easier and faster to perform in the setting of emergency treatment of complicated ventral hernia, unlike the sub-lay technique that can be more technically demanding, time consuming, and requires better experience. Moreover, we thought that if SSI occurred, the removal of on-lay mesh would be technically easier and safer than the removal of a deeply-placed retromuscular mesh. Nevertheless, we think if the mesh was placed in retro-rectus position, better results could have been obtained with lower rates of SSO and SSI.

Similar results were achieved in the study published in 2014 by Koizumi et al. retrospectively analysing the clinical course and outcomes in 93 patients with strangulated inguinal end femoral hernias. The results demonstrated how the elapsed time from onset to surgery was the most important prognostic factor (P < 0.005).

In 2007, Derici et al. published a retrospective study using univariate and multivariate analyses to investigate factors affecting morbidity and mortality rates in cases of incarcerated abdominal wall hernias. Using the univariate analysis, results showed that symptomatic periods lasting longer than 8 h, the presence of comorbid disease, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, the use of general anaesthesia, the presence of strangulation, and the presence of necrosis significantly affect morbidity rates. In contrast, advanced age, the presence of comorbid diseases, high ASA scores, the presence of strangulation, the presence of necrosis, and hernia repair with graft were found to significantly affect mortality rates by univariate analysis; the presence of necrosis, however, was the only factor that appeared to significantly affect mortality rates based on multivariate analysis.
