## Question

DDx for a pericardial rub in a young woman?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a differential diagnosis and workup for a pericardial friction rub in a young woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a pericardial rub signifies pathophysiologically and diagnostically. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies in a young woman and how age and sex influence pretest probabilities. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential, followed by a guideline-based diagnostic algorithm. After that, I need to check red flags that mandate urgent intervention, and finally, I will outline initial management and follow-up, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting statements from the sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of a pericardial rub. A pericardial friction rub is a high-specificity, low-sensitivity finding generated by inflamed visceral and parietal pericardium rubbing during the cardiac cycle; it is best heard at the left lower sternal border with the patient sitting forward at end-expiration, and it may be triphasic, biphasic, or monophasic and transient, so I need to auscultate repeatedly if I suspect it but do not hear it initially [^116yQq8B] [^114weJcn] [^112TB9eB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how a rub fits into modern diagnostic criteria. Contemporary ACC/ESC guidance requires pleuritic chest pain or an equivalent suggestive presentation plus at least one additional finding among rub, ECG changes, elevated inflammatory markers, or imaging evidence of new/worsening effusion or pericardial inflammation, so a rub alone supports the diagnosis but is not sufficient by itself, and I need to ensure I do not overcall pericarditis without corroborating features [^112TB9eB] [^112aSEw3] [^113KrqZg].

> Next, I should review epidemiology to anchor pretest probabilities. In high-income settings, most acute pericarditis is idiopathic or presumed viral, accounting for roughly 80–90% of cases, with a higher proportion of idiopathic cases in younger adults; women have higher recurrence rates than men, which matters for counseling and recurrence prevention planning [^113db1AL] [^114kFUzm] [^115XngvR].

> I will now examine the most likely etiologies in a young woman. Idiopathic or presumed viral pericarditis remains the leading diagnosis, often following a recent upper respiratory infection; autoimmune etiologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus are disproportionately represented in women and should be actively considered, especially with serositis or systemic features; and although tuberculosis is less common in developed settings, I should keep it on the list if epidemiologic risk factors or large effusions are present, as TB remains a major cause globally and can be subtle in early disease [^113db1AL] [^114nkHVW] [^11293YDK].

> Let me consider infectious causes beyond TB. Viral etiologies like coxsackie, influenza, and COVID-19 can present with pericarditis; COVID-19 in particular has been reported as an initial manifestation with pericarditis, and although uncommon, it carries higher morbidity when pericarditis is clinically evident, so I should screen for recent exposures and tailor testing accordingly while avoiding low-yield routine viral serologies except in select scenarios [^112P5CTs] [^116eWNEW] [^116M7xFQ].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or severe. I need to check for bacterial pericarditis, which is rare but life-threatening and may be purulent, particularly in the setting of pneumonia or immunocompromise; in such cases, urgent pericardiocentesis for diagnosis and drainage is indicated, and I should not delay source control while awaiting cultures [^111ArLbZ] [^113Jg8Lq].

> I should also review noninfectious and iatrogenic causes. Post–cardiac injury syndromes, including Dressler physiology after myocardial infarction or postoperative states, can present with rub and pleuritic pain; malignancy with pericardial metastasis may produce hemorrhagic effusions; and drugs such as hydralazine, procainamide, and dopamine agonists like pergolide have been associated with pericarditis or pericardial effusions, so a careful medication and procedural history is essential [^115fJjAA] [^116iQeyS] [^1147c7Po] [^113HNagn].

> Let me think about the diagnostic algorithm next. I should confirm the diagnosis using the ACC/ESC framework: document pleuritic chest pain or equivalent, then seek at least one additional criterion among rub, ECG changes, elevated CRP/ESR, or imaging evidence of effusion or pericardial inflammation; concurrently, I should obtain ECG, inflammatory markers, and transthoracic echocardiography in all patients to assess for effusion, tamponade, and myocardial involvement, reserving CMR for equivocal cases or suspected myopericarditis and CCT for alternative chest pain etiologies or preoperative planning rather than routine pericarditis diagnosis [^112TB9eB] [^116uZDZ5] [^111mbK7d].

> Wait, I should double-check the role of viral serology. Routine viral serology is not recommended except for hepatitis C, HIV, and Lyme disease when clinically suspected; in endemic settings or with compatible exposure histories, TB testing should be pursued, but otherwise broad viral panels add little and can mislead, so I need to avoid unnecessary testing that will not change management [^116M7xFQ].

> Next, I should review red flags that mandate urgent action. Large or rapidly accumulating effusions with echocardiographic signs of tamponade, hemodynamic instability, purulent or suspected bacterial pericarditis, and failure to respond to NSAIDs within about a week are high-risk features that generally require hospitalization, urgent pericardiocentesis when tamponade is present, and escalation of therapy; I need to ensure I do not miss these features during initial triage [^113db1AL] [^113u8Nt9] [^114HtqYn].

> I will now outline initial management for low-risk, presumed idiopathic or viral pericarditis. NSAIDs are first-line, with ibuprofen or high-dose aspirin preferred, and colchicine should be added to reduce symptom burden and recurrence; corticosteroids are generally avoided as first-line due to higher recurrence risk unless there are contraindications to NSAIDs or specific indications such as autoimmune disease or pregnancy beyond 20 weeks; exercise restriction is recommended during active disease and for about 30 days after remission to mitigate recurrence risk [^114kFUzm] [^114weJcn] [^114PL9fn].

> Hold on, I should verify recurrence prevention. Colchicine reduces recurrence substantially, and for a first episode, a 3-month course is reasonable; after a first recurrence, extending colchicine to 6 months or longer is advised, and in corticosteroid-dependent or multiply recurrent cases, IL-1 blockade with agents like rilonacept can be considered as steroid-sparing therapy, reflecting the autoinflammatory component in many recurrent cases [^114kFUzm] [^115bhvie] [^111JCSDB].

> Let me reconsider the differential one more time to ensure internal consistency. In a young woman, the prioritized differential is: idiopathic or presumed viral pericarditis; autoimmune etiologies such as SLE; infectious causes including TB in the right epidemiologic context and COVID-19; post–cardiac injury syndromes if there is recent MI or surgery; bacterial pericarditis if severe or purulent; and medication or malignancy-related disease if history or effusion characteristics suggest them, with the workup tailored to pretest probability and severity while adhering to guideline-based diagnostic criteria [^113db1AL] [^112TB9eB] [^114kFUzm].

---

A pericardial rub in a young woman most often reflects **idiopathic or viral pericarditis** [^113db1AL] (including COVID-19) [^112P5CTs], but the differential is broad and includes autoimmune disease (notably SLE) [^1114aETC], bacterial infection (tuberculosis, streptococcal, pneumococcal) [^11293YDK] [^113Jg8Lq], malignancy (breast, lymphoma) [^1112cGzP], and iatrogenic or post-cardiac injury syndromes [^114kFUzm]. A focused history, exam, ECG, inflammatory markers, and echocardiography [^115ZHtXH] are essential; **CMR or CT** [^113KrqZg] is reserved for unclear or complicated cases. Management is etiology-specific, with NSAIDs and colchicine for idiopathic/viral cases [^114kFUzm], immunosuppression for autoimmune disease, and urgent drainage for purulent or large effusions with tamponade [^113u8Nt9] [^111ArLbZ].

## Infectious etiologies

### Viral pericarditis

- **Idiopathic/viral**: Most common in young women; often post-viral or truly idiopathic [^113db1AL].
- **COVID-19**: Increasingly recognized; can present with isolated pericarditis [^112P5CTs].
- **EBV/CMV**: Consider in mononucleosis-like syndromes.

---

### Bacterial pericarditis

- **Tuberculosis**: Important globally; often large effusions, constrictive course [^114kFUzm].
- **Streptococcal/pneumococcal**: Rare but serious; may be purulent [^113Jg8Lq].
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Consider in immunocompromised or post-surgical patients.

---

## Autoimmune and inflammatory etiologies

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Common in young women; serositis is frequent [^notfound].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Less common but possible.
- **Other connective tissue diseases**: Sjögren's, dermatomyositis, polymyositis.
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Rare pericardial involvement.

---

## Malignancy-related pericarditis

Breast cancer is a key consideration because it can metastasize to the pericardium [^1112cGzP]; lymphoma and leukemia also commonly involve the pericardium, and primary pericardial tumors (e.g. synovial sarcoma) are rare but reported [^1112cGzP] [^111uxxyH].

---

## Iatrogenic and post-cardiac injury syndromes

Post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS) presents as pericarditis after cardiac surgery, PCI, or pacemaker implantation [^1153232S]; **radiation-induced pericarditis** can occur after mediastinal irradiation.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential: **history and examination** should document chest pain, fever, recent infections, autoimmune symptoms, malignancy, and cardiac procedures, and the exam should assess for a rub, effusion, and tamponade physiology [^115ZHtXH]. Laboratory tests include inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), troponin, and autoimmune serologies (ANA, anti-dsDNA, RF) [^116uZDZ5]. Imaging starts with echocardiography to assess effusion and tamponade; CMR or CT is used when the diagnosis is unclear or complications are suspected [^113KrqZg].

---

## Management strategies

- **Idiopathic/viral pericarditis**: NSAIDs ± colchicine; corticosteroids if refractory [^114kFUzm].
- **Autoimmune pericarditis**: Immunosuppression (corticosteroids, DMARDs, biologics).
- **Bacterial pericarditis**: Antibiotics; urgent drainage if purulent [^111ArLbZ].
- **Malignancy-related pericarditis**: Oncologic therapy; pericardiocentesis for symptomatic effusions [^notfound].
- **Tamponade**: Immediate pericardiocentesis [^114HtqYn].

---

A pericardial rub in a young woman most often reflects idiopathic or viral pericarditis, but the differential is broad; a **focused history, exam, labs, and imaging** guide etiology-specific therapy and improve outcomes [^117U2CVw].

### Acute pericarditis: diagnosis and management [^116xUWRS]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, is found in approximately 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction. It occurs most often in men 20 to 50 years of age. Acute pericarditis has a number of potential etiologies including infection, acute myocardial infarction, medication use, trauma to the thoracic cavity, and systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, most etiologic evaluations are inconclusive. Patients with acute pericarditis commonly present with acute, sharp, retrosternal chest pain that is relieved by sitting or leaning forward. A pericardial friction rub is found in up to 85% of patients. Classic electrocardiographic changes include widespread concave upward ST-segment elevation without reciprocal T-wave inversions or Q waves. First-line treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. Glucocorticoids are traditionally reserved for severe or refractory cases, or in cases when the cause of pericarditis is likely connective tissue disease, autoreactivity, or uremia. Cardiology consultation is recommended for patients with severe disease, those with pericarditis refractory to empiric treatment, and those with unclear etiologies.

Assumptions and definitions — pericardial entities are defined to guide diagnosis and management: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium leading to characteristic pleuritic chest pain which can be accompanied by pericardial rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers; pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial space visible on imaging such as echocardiography; cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart by abnormal fluid accumulation causing impaired cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise; constrictive pericarditis is loss of elasticity with often abnormal pericardial thickening that impairs diastolic filling and leads to heart failure symptoms and can be transient/subacute (predominantly inflammatory and reversible) or advanced/chronic (often calcified and irreversible); effusive constrictive pericarditis is persistent constrictive physiology even after drainage of pericardial effusion.

### Acute pericarditis [^112PntzD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis is an acute inflammatory disease of the pericardium, which may occur in many different disease states (both infectious and non-infectious). Usually the diagnosis is based on symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath), electrocardiographic changes (ST elevation), physical examination (pericardial friction rub) and elevation of cardiac biomarkers. It may occur in isolation or be associated with an underlying inflammatory disorder. In routine clinical practice, acute pericarditis can be associated with myocarditis due to their overlapping etiologies.

Novel diagnostic criteria and classification by duration for pericarditis — diagnosis requires "Pleuritic chest pain or equivalent suggestive clinical presentation (must be present)" plus "at least 1 more finding (0 = unlikely, 1 = possible, 2+ = definite diagnosis)" from the following: "Pericardial friction rub"; "ECG changes: diffuse ST-elevation and/or PR-segment depression"; "Inflammatory biomarkers elevation (C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate)"; "Cardiac imaging evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion (especially echocardiography, other imaging modalities as alternative)"; or "Cardiac imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation (cardiac magnetic resonance pericardial late gadolinium enhancement and/or edema, computed tomography with contrast as alternative)". Duration classification is listed as: "Acute: Event lasting < 4–6 weeks", "Incessant: Event lasting > 4 to 6 weeks without remission", "Recurrent: New episode with signs and symptoms of pericardial inflammation after a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks", and "Chronic: Event lasting > 3 months".

Recurrent pericarditis — definition and clinical features: Recurrent pericarditis is a pericardial syndrome that is defined as a recurrence of episodes of pericarditis after a latent or asymptomatic period of ≥ 6 weeks. It is a common complication of acute pericarditis, with up to one third of patients with acute pericarditis developing repeat episodes. Symptoms associated with recurrent episodes are similar to those of the initial episode, although often not as severe, and pericardial rubs, ECG changes, and PEff occur less commonly with recurrent pericarditis.

Pericarditis and myocarditis — clinical features — are outlined with pericarditis classically presenting with sharp, pleuritic chest pain improved by sitting up or leaning forward, a possible pericardial friction rub, and widespread ST-elevation with PR depression as the electrocardiographic hallmark, while myocarditis often presents with sharp chest pain with troponin usually elevated and a predominance of heart failure distinguishing myocarditis from pericarditis.

### Acute pericarditis [^114nuuxm]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Although acute pericarditis is most often associated with viral infection, it may also be caused by many diseases, drugs, invasive cardiothoracic procedures, and chest trauma. Diagnosing acute pericarditis is often a process of exclusion. A history of abrupt-onset chest pain, the presence of a pericardial friction rub, and changes on electrocardiography suggest acute pericarditis, as do PR-segment depression and upwardly concave ST-segment elevation. Although highly specific for pericarditis, the pericardial friction rub is often absent or transient. Auscultation during end expiration with the patient sitting up and leaning forward increases the likelihood of observing this physical finding. Echocardiography is recommended for most patients to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude tamponade. Outpatient management of select patients with acute pericarditis is an option. Complications may include pericardial effusion with tamponade, recurrence, and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Use of colchicine as an adjunct to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy for acute viral pericarditis may hasten symptom resolution and reduce recurrences.

Pericarditis — diagnostic criteria and imaging roles state that "A novel diagnostic criteria for pericarditis has been devised, consisting of pericarditic chest pain with 5 additional criteria (0 = unlikely pericarditis, 1 = possible pericarditis, 2+ = definite diagnosis)", where "These criteria include clinical findings of pericardial rub, ECG changes, new or worsening pericardial effusions, serologic findings of elevated inflammatory markers, and imaging findings of pericardial inflammation on CCT or CMR". The page adds that "Multimodality cardiac imaging — including echocardiography, CCT, and CMR — play a critical and complimentary role in the diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment guidance, and surveillance of pericarditis", and that "CMR and echocardiography made the diagnosis of CP more reliable without need for diagnostic cardiac catheterization in most cases". It also notes advances where "Recent advances in targeted biologic therapies have led to a paradigm shift, positioning these agents as second-line".

### Acute pericarditis: rapid evidence review [^114weJcn]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral. Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

### Regional pericarditis: a review of the pericardial manifestations of acute myocardial infarction [^115JBrqS]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Regional pericarditis has been described in several settings, but occurs most frequently after transmural myocardial infarction. While the diagnosis remains elusive, it must be considered in all patients with recurrent chest pain following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis classically presents with positional chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, diffuse ST-segment elevation, and PR depression, but regional ECG changes associated with infarction-associated pericarditis sometimes exist. Given the magnitude and frequency of AMI, it is imperative to be aware of the myriad of pericardial manifestations of myocardial injury. An illustrative case and a comprehensive review of the literature will be provided.

Concurrent pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study had addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

### An interesting case of viral pericarditis [^112CCLWq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of upper respiratory symptoms and 2 syncopal episodes. She was initially febrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic; the initial electrocardiogram showed diffuse T-wave inversions and right atrial enlargement. There was no pericardial effusion on bedside and formal echocardiography; the latter, however, revealed a hyperechogenic pericardium. A viral swab was positive for influenza B. Treatment with intravenous rehydration and ibuprofen was started with good response. The patient went home 24 hours later with the diagnosis of mild pericarditis and syncope likely secondary to dehydration impaired diastolic filling. The incidence of acute pericarditis in previously healthy children is unknown. There are no known case reports of influenza B-associated pericarditis in the pediatric population. There is little high quality evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of pericarditis in children. However, limited data suggest that the typically described presentation of chest pain, pericardial rub, pericardial effusion, and electrocardiogram changes occurs in children. The pediatric population seems to respond well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis — introduction and diagnostic criteria: Acute pericarditis is a pericardial syndrome characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the pericardium; there are a multitude of causes and, in general, most cases are self-limited, with most cases idiopathic or viral, and it usually lasts < 3 months before being termed chronic pericarditis. Acute pericarditis typically presents with chest pain that is substernal and sharp, often acute in onset, and often radiating to the trapezius ridge; pericarditic pain is pleuritic, worse when lying down, and better when sitting forward, and the positional nature distinguishes it from myocardial ischemia. Physical signs include a pericardial friction rub and characteristic ECG changes; the diagnosis is based on the presence of (1) typical chest pain, (2) a pericardial rub, (3) typical ECG changes, and (4) new or worsening PEff, and in most cases, two or more of these findings are present. If not, ancillary supportive data should be sought, including elevations in inflammatory markers (Westergren sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) or ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, white blood count or troponin levels or a fever, and in selective equivocal or refractory cases, imaging by CMR with T2-weighted (T2W) images and LGE may be used to identify pericardial edema and inflammation.

Acute pericarditis — diagnostic criteria and confirmatory findings are outlined as follows: the presence of two criteria is considered diagnostic, with criteria including typical chest pain, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with pericarditis, and new or worsening PEF; confirmatory findings include elevated C‑reactive protein or ultrasensitive C‑reactive protein/Westergren sedimentation rate, and LGE on CMR may be a new confirmatory finding; ECG manifestations shown include diffuse concave ST‑segment elevations with lead aVR showing reciprocal ST‑segment depression and reciprocal PR‑segment elevation.

### Recurrent pericarditis and paradigm shift in cardiovascular imaging and targeted therapeutics [^113kr9iR]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis and multimodality imaging

The diagnostic criteria for recurrent pericarditis are similar those of acute pericarditis. It requires the initial pericardial attack and 2 out of the following 4 features: pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration and when supine, electrocardiogram changes including ST-segment elevation or PR segment depression, a pericardial friction rub on auscultation or a new or worsening pericardial effusion. Recurrent pericarditis is further defined as having a relapse of symptoms following a symptom-free period of 4 to 6 weeks or longer after the initial episode of pericarditis. Patients with a known history of recurrent pericarditis on multiple anti-inflammatories may have some of these features masked. Hence, supportive findings such as elevated inflammatory markers (eg, high-sensitivity CRP) or imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation on CMR aid in the diagnosis. Incessant pericarditis is defined as persistent symptoms without a symptom-free period and is considered more aggressive than recurrent pericarditis.

Conclusion

Imaging findings of pericardial disorders could be non-specific for the majority of the cases; therefore, the patient's clinical history is the most valuable clue for the differential diagnosis. The radiologists should be familiar with the various imaging appearances of pericardial disorders.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114nkHVW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Myocarditis with associated pericarditis — clinical and imaging considerations include that in some patients pericarditis is associated with myocarditis and may contribute to symptoms of chest pain and signs of pericardial rub on examination; imaging may show pericardial effusion that is usually small or moderate unless systemic inflammatory disorders such as lupus are present, in which case large pericardial effusions can occur, and pericardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) may also be detected on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). There are inadequate data on the prognostic value of the coexistence of pericarditis with myocarditis compared with myocarditis alone; viral myocarditis with associated pericarditis is usually self-limited and resolves without major complications or adverse outcomes, but in systemic inflammatory disorders it can be recurrent, and in cardio-oncology radiation therapy can result in pericardial inflammation in addition to myocardial injury.

### Hemorrhagic pericardial cyst diagnosis accelerated by emergency physician echocardiography: a case report [^111qKFwS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for chest pain in the emergency department is broad and includes both benign and life-threatening conditions-with pericardial cyst as a rare example. Emergency physician-performed point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) is increasingly recognized as a useful modality in the evaluation of patients with chest pain.

Case Report

We report a case of hemorrhagic pericardial cyst in a young woman presenting with chest pain in which findings on FOCUS contradicted findings on chest x-ray study and thus, accelerated diagnosis and definitive treatment. We also comment on epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of this uncommon, potentially fatal cause of chest pain. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report aims to bring an uncommon case to the attention of emergency providers and emphasize the importance of facility with FOCUS. Although definitive diagnosis and management were not accomplished at the bedside in this case, an abnormal finding on FOCUS prompted further investigation and timely treatment.

### Evaluation and treatment of pericarditis: a systematic review [^113db1AL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common cause of chest pain.

Objective

To summarize published evidence on the causes, diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and prognosis of pericarditis.

Evidence Review

A literature search of BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for human studies without language restriction from January 1, 1990, to August 31, 2015. After literature review and selection of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and large observational studies, 30 studies (5 meta-analyses, 10 randomized clinical trials, and 16 cohort studies) with 7569 adult patients were selected for inclusion.

Findings

The etiology of pericarditis may be infectious (eg, viral and bacterial) or noninfectious (eg, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post-cardiac injury syndromes). Tuberculosis is a major cause of pericarditis in developing countries but accounts for less than 5% of cases in developed countries, where idiopathic, presumed viral causes are responsible for 80% to 90% of cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria including chest pain, a pericardial rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. Certain features at presentation (temperature > 38°C [> 100.4°F], subacute course, large effusion or tamponade, and failure of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] treatment) indicate a poorer prognosis and identify patients requiring hospital admission. The most common treatment for idiopathic and viral pericarditis in North America and Europe is NSAID therapy. Adjunctive colchicine can ameliorate the initial episode and is associated with approximately 50% lower recurrence rates. Corticosteroids are a second-line therapy for those who do not respond, are intolerant, or have contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine. Recurrences may occur in 30% of patients without preventive therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease worldwide and may recur in as many as one-third of patients who present with idiopathic or viral pericarditis. Appropriate triage and treatment with NSAIDs may reduce readmission rates for pericarditis. Treatment with colchicine can reduce recurrence rates.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of pericarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113KrqZg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pericarditis — clinical diagnostic evaluation and multimodality imaging define diagnostic likelihood and imaging roles. "Pleuritic chest pain or equivalent suggestive presentation" plus "Plus ≥ 1 additional finding (0 = unlikely, 1 = possible, and 2+ = definite diagnosis)" establishes diagnostic categorization; additional findings include "Pericardial friction rub", "ECG changes (diffuse ST-elevation, PR-depression)", "Inflammatory biomarkers elevation (CRP, ESR)", "Cardiac imaging evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion (echo preferred, CMR, CCT)", and "Cardiac imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation (CMR preferred, CCT)". Imaging roles are specified as "Echo: assess pericardial effusion and constrictive physiology", "CMR (if indicated): assess and grade pericardial thickness, inflammation, effusion and constrictive physiology", and "CCT (if indicated): assess pericardial thickness, calcification, constrictive physiology, pre-operative planning", with abbreviations defined (e.g., electrocardiogram [ECG], C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR], cardiac computed tomography [CCT], echocardiography [echo]).

### Pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade in a 10-year-old male [^1154rH2H]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 10-year-old male with a past medical history of premature pubarche, mild persistent asthma, and eczema presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and scattered atelectasis. Echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU for pericardiocentesis and drain placement. As he later became hypertensive and febrile, we will discuss how our patient's hospital course guided our differential diagnosis and how we arrived at a definitive diagnosis using a multidisciplinary approach.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis: a review [^114kFUzm]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (< 0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (< 3%) can be life-threatening.

Observations

Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with presence of 2 or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine (≈90%); new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression (≈25%-50%); a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small (≈60%); or a pericardial friction rub (< 30%). In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis. Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%). With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least 6 months. Corticosteroids are often used if pericarditis does not improve with NSAIDs and colchicine. In certain patients with multiple recurrences, which can occur for several years, interleukin 1 (IL-1) blockers have demonstrated efficacy and may be preferred to corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Acute pericarditis is a common cause of nonischemic chest pain. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of pericarditis in endemic areas and is treated with antitubercular therapy. In North America and Western Europe, pericarditis is typically idiopathic, develops after a viral infection, or develops following cardiac procedures or surgery. Treatment with NSAIDs and colchicine leads to a favorable prognosis in most patients, although 15% to 30% of patients develop recurrence. Patients with multiple recurrent pericarditis can have a disease duration of several years or more, are often treated with corticosteroids, and IL-1 blockers may be used for selected patients as steroid-sparing therapy.

### Modeling acute pericarditis: an inflammatory step toward tailored therapeutic strategies [^111JCSDB]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers and can be categorized as acute, incessant, recurrent, or chronic. Among the different types of pericarditis, acute pericarditis is diagnosed in ∼0.2% of all cardiovascular in-hospital admissions and accounts for 5% of intensive care unit admittances for chest pain in Western Europe and North America. Acute pericarditis is characterized by an intense immune-inflammatory reaction involving the pericardium, mostly ensuing in healthy persons as a unique symptom or as a sign of a systemic disease. Its clinical diagnosis is based on 4 major criteria, including chest pain, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiogram changes, and new or worsening pericardial effusion. Activation of inflammatory entities and imaging-based evidence of pericardial inflammation also guide the diagnosis and the monitoring of the disease evolution. Despite various efforts for identifying an exact origin, most clinical events are referred to as "idiopathic", likely revealing, however, an incapacity to ascertain a specific etiology. The mainstay of treatment of pericarditis is represented by a regimen of anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-inflammatory treatments vary, however, in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. It is likely that the nature of the anti-inflammatory therapies should be tailored to the nature of the pericarditis. Of note, among patients with recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept, a fusion protein that prevents soluble interleukin-1α and -1β from binding to their receptor, directs resolution of pericarditis episodes and reduces the risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable animal models of pericarditis, and notably in its acute form, likely explains our limited understanding of this syndrome and the absence of specific anti-inflammatory therapies, which are urgently needed to reduce the disease morbidity in its different forms.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

When to consider added imaging in suspected pericardial absence — this condition is an exceedingly rare, incidental finding, typically in an asymptomatic often young person, and while diagnosis can be confirmed with clinical imaging modalities, pitfalls and overdiagnoses need to be avoided; the need for dedicated cardiac imaging should be carefully considered in asymptomatic persons because the diagnosis typically has no clinical consequences. Confirmatory testing should be reserved for symptomatic patients or those at risk for complications and only when patients are considered candidates for surgical options, and surgical management is based on small, uncontrolled observations, limiting any definitive recommendations.

### A descriptive analysis of patients with an emergency department diagnosis of acute pericarditis [^1163eBB6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe clinical characteristics, assessment and treatment of patients diagnosed in an emergency department (ED) with acute pericarditis.

Methods

A medical record review of patients with an ED diagnosis of pericarditis conducted in an adult tertiary hospital over a 5-year period. Variables collected included pain characteristics, associated symptoms, physical examination findings, investigation results, ED treatment and disposition.

Results

179 presentations were included, with 73.9% men and a mean age of 38.8 years. The majority of patients described pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration with half characterising the pain as sharp or stabbing, with others describing tightness, dullness or cramping. Radiation to the left shoulder occurred in 2.8% and change of pain with posture occurred in 46.4%. A pericardial rub was documented in 19 presentations. All patients had an ECG recorded with ST segment elevation present in 69.3% and PR segment depression in 49.2%. Nearly 90% of patients had troponin testing but only 6.4% of these were positive. Only 8.1% of cases were treated with colchicine. No patients required pericardiocentesis. Patients with high-risk factors were more likely to have previous pericarditis, dyspnoea, nausea, abnormal investigation results, treatment with colchicine and admission to hospital. However, 16.9% of patients without risk factors were admitted, and 46.9% of patients with at least one risk factor were discharged.

Conclusions

Pericarditis may not follow the classical clinical description. Admission and discharge decisions appear to relate to individual clinical characteristics rather than known risk factors. Use of colchicine for treatment in ED is infrequent.

Pericarditis epidemiology and distribution — burden, demographics, and setting-specific causes are as follows: Pericarditis accounts for 0.1% of hospital admissions and 5% of emergency department evaluations for chest pain, and approximately 0.2% of all cardiovascular admissions are attributable to acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis occurs more commonly in men aged 16 to 65 years and declines by an estimated 51% per 10-year increase in age, whereas recurrent pericarditis is more common in women. Pericarditis is classified based on etiology, clinical course, morphology, and associated impact of fluid characteristics, size, and hemodynamics. Idiopathic and viral etiologies are the most common cause of pericarditis in high-income countries, whereas tuberculosis, often HIV-associated, is the most common cause in low-income countries.

### Haemorrhagiccomplex pericarditis presenting with cardiac tamponade in an immunocompetent woman [^112GiioN]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

A young woman in her mid-40s with a medical history of hypertension presented with 10 days of a non-productive cough, worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness and pleuritic chest pain relieved by sitting up. She reported fevers of up to 103°F. She denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea but did admit to decreased appetite.

On examination, she was ill appearing but in no acute cardiopulmonary distress. Her pulse was regular but tachycardic. She had normal heart sounds with no rubs, murmurs or gallops. She had no jugular venous distension. The pulmonary examination was unremarkable. She had no lymphadenopathy. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable. She was also normotensive, tachycardic up to 138 beats/min, afebrile and not hypoxic when evaluated in the emergency department.

### Localized pericardial inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1139ELi7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Regional or localized pericarditis has been infrequently reported. We report a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who presented with retrosternal pleuritic-type chest pain without audible friction rub, electrocardiographic changes or detectable pericardial effusion on echocardiography. Computed tomography, however, revealed a circumscribed area of pericardial inflammation, suggesting a diagnosis of localized lupus-associated pericarditis. This case demonstrates that localized pericarditis may occur in SLE and that chest CT may be required as part of the work-up in the diagnosis of lupus pericarditis.

### Point-of-care ultrasound in management for dyspneic uremic patients: a case report [^113AQgBN]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are two kinds of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)-related pericardial diseases: uremic pericarditis and dialysis-associated pericarditis. Uremic pericarditis occurs in the non-dialysis patients with untreated uremia. Dialysis pericarditis occurs in chronic-dialysis patients with inadequate dialysis or fluid overload. Early diagnosis for uremic pericarditis is challenging for clinicians currently because of the low incidence caused by the widespread availability of dialysis. Besides, the typical presentations of pericarditis such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, friction rub could not occur in all patients. Moreover, the characteristic finding of diffuse ST elevation in ECG is rare in uremic pericarditis because the myocardium is not involved. Therefore, PoCUS can play an important role to rule in or rule out pericardial effusion in clinical practice.

Some limitations would exist in diagnostic ultrasound in patients with multi-diagnoses and multi-comorbidities. For example, patients with congestive heart failure and pneumonia would have pleural effusion, prominent B lines and lung consolidation. However, with gathering useful clinical information, ultrasonographers could overcome this problem based on the clinical situation of the patients. In uremic patients presenting with dyspnea, the integration of PoCUS into traditional physical examinations help emergency physicians narrow down the differential diagnoses.

"The diagnostic criteria likely perform best in patients with acute pericarditis, though can be applicable to patients with recurrences/flares".

### US database study of clinical burden and unmet need in recurrent pericarditis [^117Qk8L7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis is often associated with severe symptoms, including sharp, pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. While pericarditis epidemiology data are limited in the United States, about 5% of patients presenting in emergency departments with chest pain ultimately are identified as having an acute pericarditis episode. Acute pericarditis is diagnosed based on having at least 2 of the following: chest pain, pericardial friction/rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. The etiology of pericarditis varies, and causes can include infection, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post‐cardiac injury syndromes. In developing countries, tuberculosis is often a cause, but up to 90% of cases are considered "idiopathic" in developed countries, and presumed to be viral or post‐viral. While the term "idiopathic" is commonly used in these presumed post‐viral cases without a clear underlying cause, there is a growing body of evidence that innate immune system‐mediated autoinflammation, specifically interleukin‐1 signaling, plays an important role in various inflammatory disorders, including recurrent pericarditis (RP) cases that are classified as "idiopathic".

For most patients, pericarditis manifests as a single episode that lasts a few days to several weeks, and symptoms are resolved through conventional treatments such as NSAIDs with or without colchicine. There are, however, some patients who do not experience long‐term symptom resolution after an acute pericarditis episode. Up to 30% of patients experience recurrent pericarditis within 18 months when a subsequent episode occurs following a symptom‐free period of at least 4 weeks. Beyond the first recurrence, the clinical picture of RP varies broadly, with some patients responding well to conventional therapy and having no further recurrence. By contrast, 25% to 50% of patients who have experienced a first recurrence will experience additional recurrence, and among patients who have experienced ≥ 2 recurrences, 20% to 40% are expected to have subsequent episodes. Reasons for recurrence include incomplete or inadequate response to therapy and persistent underlying factors that drive pericardial inflammation, which appears to be primarily driven by autoinflammatory processes in patients with RP either without an underlying autoimmune etiology or in conjunction with other known causes, such as post‐cardiac injury syndromes.

### Acute pericarditis and cancer risk: a matched cohort study using linked UK primary and secondary care data [^116XYDnP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The diagnosis of acute pericarditis is based on 2 of the following criteria: (1) chest pain, (2) pericardial friction‐rub, (3) characteristic ECG changes, and (4) pericardial effusion on 2‐dimensional echocardiography. Elevated inflammatory markers and evidence of inflammation by imaging modalities may support diagnosis. The diagnosis can be challenging given that the only reliable criterion may be symptomatic chest pain, whereas criteria 2 to 4 can be difficult to confirm with the standard diagnostic workup in the general practitioner setting. In the hospital setting, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has a high sensitivity for detecting even smaller pericardial effusions. Our cohort was based on data from the CPRD and HES, which are considered to have a good generalizability both to the UK population and to comparable countries. Pericarditis diagnoses, as recorded in the CPRD and HES, have not been specifically validated, so there may have been some misclassification in our exposure measure, but our combined use of primary care and hospital data should have improved sensitivity and allowed us to include patients who may have had pericarditis without hospital admission.

### Incidence and factors associated with recurrent pericarditis in lupus [^116i49Td]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

The retrospective analysis of this cohort study led to several limitations. First, recurrent pericarditis was defined as that occurring at least 6 weeks from the last recorded episode of pericarditis, in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology. However, given the retrospective nature of this study, there is a chance that some episodes of incessant pericarditis may have been incorrectly defined as recurrent. Given that patients with persistent symptoms are typically reevaluated in short course in our clinical practice, the likelihood that incessant pericarditis was inappropriately defined is very low.

Second, SELENA-SLEDAI criteria were used to diagnose pericarditis. The SELENA-SLEDAI definition of pericarditis is less stringent than that used by cardiology associations, such as the European Society of Cardiology, as well as other forms of the SLEDAI criteria, including SLEDAI-2K. According to the SELENA-SLEDAI definition, only 1 of the following criterion must be present for diagnosis: pericardial pain, auscultation of pericardial rub, presence of pericardial effusion on imaging, or ECG confirmation. Within our study cohort, patient-reported pericardial chest pain was used most often to diagnose pericarditis. Importantly, we found that 21 patients who were further evaluated via specific testing, including transthoracic echocardiogram, computed tomography chest imaging, or ECG, demonstrated findings indicative of pericarditis. They thereby fulfilled both SLEDAI and European Society of Cardiology criteria for the diagnosis of pericarditis. This suggests that clinical criteria alone may be a useful tool for diagnosing pericarditis among patients with SLE.

### Age-stratified patterns in clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes in acute pericarditis: a retrospective cohort study [^1143mKVL]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data on acute pericarditis according to different age groups. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of age-related features in clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of acute pericarditis, with a focus on the geriatric population.

Methods

Patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis were consecutively enrolled between January 2014 and June 2022, and divided into four groups according to age (G1: 18–35 years; G2: 35–55 years; G3: 55–75 years; G4: > 75years). Clinical characteristics and medical therapy were recorded at baseline, and during follow-up.

Results

A total of 471 patients (median age 56.3 (IQR 33–73) years, 32.3% women) were included. Younger age (G1-G2-G3) was associated with a higher frequency of chest pain, pericardial rubs (p < 0001), ECG changes (p = 0.002) and were more commonly treated with colchicine (p < 0.001), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p = 0.006). Older patients (G4) depicted more commonly dyspnoea, pericardial/pleural effusion (p = 0.007) and were more often treated with corticosteroids (p = 0.037). A secondary cause of pericarditis was detected in 128/471 (27.2%) patients. Older patients were more commonly hospitalised and had a complicated course with new-onset atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001) and cardiac tamponade (p = 0.005), compared with younger patients, who presented more recurrences (respectively G1: 43.0%, G2: 34.7%, G3: 28.2% and G4: 16.2%; p < 0.001). After multivariable analysis, younger age remained the strongest independent predictor for recurrences (HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.81 to 5.58, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Older age is associated with less recurrences of pericarditis, but more severe complications with need for hospitalisation.

### Pericarditis mimicking Brugada syndrome [^111RdNwS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a genetic heart disorder due to alteration of the ion channels function that causes an impaired in the cardiac conduction system. It is characterized by an abnormal electrocardiogram pattern and may be complicated by malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium and 90% of isolated cases of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral. Acute pericarditis may appears with chest pain, fever, pericardial friction rub, and cardiac tamponade. Moreover, widespread ST segment changes occur due to involvement of the underlying epicardium.

Case Report

A 27-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department of the… Hospital due to fatigue and chest discomfort. Laboratory findings showed that WBC count and C-reactive protein were increased. Echocardiographic finding was normal. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of pericarditis. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a "saddle back"-type ST elevation in leads V2, recognised as type 2 Brugada pattern. The ECG normalized within a few days after the beginning of anti-inflammatory therapy and the follow-up was uneventful. Based on findings in our patient and data from literature, we hypothesize that the patient developed a Brugada ECG pattern due the pericarditis.

Conclusions

Our case report shows that the pericarditis may mimic BrS. Moreover, it is important to underline that a Brugada ECG pattern should only be considered as a sign of electrical heart disease but detailed diagnostic tests are anyway needed.

Symptoms

Classic symptoms and signs of acute pericarditis such as stabbing pain and pericardial rubbing are not common in tuberculosis pericarditis (between 3% and 8%). 15, 31 Conversely, the presentation tends to be insidious and systemic signs and symptoms as described in Tables 2 and 3 are more frequent. 32, 33 Clinical manifestations depend on the rate of fluid accumulation, the hemodynamic effect on cardiac contraction, and the degree of inflammation triggered by the infection. 34 If fluid accumulation is progressive, general systemic symptoms or heart failure will be the prevailing symptom. 8, 35 If fluid accumulation is rapid and there are no compensatory mechanisms, the patient will clinically manifest with tachycardia and hypotension. If no treatment is received or the treatment is inadequate, up to half of patients may progress to cardiac tamponade and mortality may be as high as 85% at 6 months. 16, 36

Table 2
Clinical Features of Acute Tuberculous Pericarditis

Table 3
Clinical Signs Observed in 67 Patients With Tuberculous Constrictive Pericarditis

Acute clinical manifestations of tuberculous myocarditis may become apparent as disturbances of the conduction system, causing prolonged QT syndrome, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiac arrest. On the other hand, chronic myocardial involvement may manifest with gradual heart failure symptoms or even as an asymptomatic patient who is diagnosed postmortem. 18 Subacute endocarditis presents as constitutional symptoms similar to pericarditis. Dyspnea and heart failure symptoms appear when vegetations generate hemodynamic compromise leading to severe valve insufficiencies. 28

In the aorta, clinical manifestations are produced by the formation of pseudoaneurysms or mycotic aneurysms, which manifest mainly as a pulsatile or palpable mass or chest or abdominal pain caused by mass effect, and will depend on the location and the rate of growth of the lesions. 20, 30 Commonly, most aneurysms do not produce symptoms and are only diagnosed after an autopsy is performed. 37, 38 Cases of complications caused by aneurysm perforation leading to exsanguination, acute aortic insufficiency, or cardiac tamponade have been described, and usually have a fatal outcome. 39, 40, 41

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^113D3gqW]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective review employing an informatics engine-based search (TriNetX). TriNetX is a global federated network of health research, providing access to data from electronic medical records of patients in large health-care organizations in the United States. For the initial subject identification, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-10 code related to acute pericarditis diagnosis (I30) was used. TriNetX automatically includes the corresponding ICD-9 codes. We identified 494 adult patients between January 1, 2009 and November 14, 2018, and two experienced physicians performed a chart review through electronic health records to complete a database including 240 patients meeting the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria for acute pericarditis (e-Fig 1). According to guidelines, the diagnosis of acute pericarditis requires at least two of the four following criteria: (1) pericardial chest pain; (2) pericardial rubs; (3) new ST-elevation or PR depression on ECG; (4) new or worsening pericardial effusion. Inpatients and outpatients were both included. The database contained relevant demographic data, clinical characteristics, treatments received, and adverse outcomes. All data, including ECG and echocardiographic data, were reviewed by at least two cardiologists before entry into the final database. Disagreements on findings or readings were resolved through discussion. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The chart review was approved by the local Institutional Review Board.

### Ischemic heart disease: noninvasive imaging techniques and findings [^115gjQsK]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Dressler syndrome is another MI-related complication seen in up to 5% of patients. The syndrome manifests with low-grade fever, pericardial rub, and pleuritic chest pain after an MI, and it is believed to be secondary to an autoimmune reaction to the myocardial necrosis that occurs 2–10 weeks after the infarction. Both cardiac MR and CT images show thickening of the pericardium and pericardial effusion acutely (Fig 26). LGE images from cardiac MRI show enhancement of the pericardium in chronic cases.

### High mortality with COVID-19 acute pericarditis [^116eWNEW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Li and Shi, and their coauthors used the National Inpatient Sample 2020 database and analyzed 211 619 patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID‐19. They found that the incidence of acute pericarditis was 0.46% overall, with a lower incidence during the second half of the year, attributed to the initiation of dexamethasone for patients with COVID‐19 with respiratory compromise. They compared the 980 patients with COVID‐19 and acute pericarditis to the patients with COVID‐19 without acute pericarditis, and found a striking difference in mortality (21.4% versus 11%, P < 0.001). After matching that balanced age, younger patients might be more likely to have a vigorous, exuberant immune response; anemia that may be a marker for chronic disease; chronic kidney disease and cancer that reflect immune issues and diminished reserve; lower income, higher Medicaid, urban teaching hospital care site, and factors that can reflect access impediments to care; the patients with COVID‐19 and acute pericarditis still had a much greater mortality rate (21.3% versus 11.1%, P < 0.001).

The patients with COVID‐19 and acute pericarditis compared with the patients with COVID‐19 without acute pericarditis had a greater incidence of clinical cardiac involvement, with a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest. Not surprisingly, they also had a higher average length of stay. What is notable is that patients with acute pericarditis had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury but not a higher incidence of acute respiratory failure.

The patients with acute pericarditis presumably had at least 2 of the 4 hallmark signs of pericarditis, pleuritic chest discomfort, pericardial rub, characteristic electrocardiographic changes, and new or worsening pericardial effusion. However, a breakdown of the characteristics of the acute pericarditis population was not available. Troponin or NT‐ProBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) values that could help establish the extent of cardiac involvement or supply demand imbalance were not available, nor were some of the standard measures of inflammatory response, including white blood cell count, lymphocyte depletion, and C‐reactive protein.

### Pericardial effusion impending tamponade: a look beyond beck's triad [^116yuahf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of chronic or slowly progressing pericardial effusion with impending tamponade remains a challenge, particularly when classical physical signs are subtle or absent. A high index of suspicion should be entertained in such cases in the appropriate setting even when the clinical signs and symptoms are missing. We present two cases where the pericardial effusion was missed in the emergency department due to subtle clinical features or mistaken for a more familiar "look-a-like" presentation. A review of the literature and an analysis of various clinical parameters of published cases were performed. It is pivotal that physicians should not only be aware of the limitations of the traditional clinical signs, but also be familiar with the use of other subtle findings and the importance of other modalities that may potentially enhance the sensitivity in diagnosing chronic pericardial effusion impending tamponade.

Pericardial effusion — definition, causes, imaging goals, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) size grading: Pericardial effusion is defined by the accumulation of > 50 mL of fluid in the pericardial space. Approximately one-half of pericardial effusions are idiopathic; in North America and Western Europe, postviral infection is the most common identifiable cause, whereas tuberculosis is the most common cause in places where it is endemic. The objectives of imaging pericardial effusions are to support diagnosis, evaluate the size and location of the effusion, assess its hemodynamic impact, and inform decisions regarding drainage, if indicated, and TTE is the first-line imaging investigation. Echocardiographic size categories are: trivial (< 1.0 cm and not visualized throughout cardiac cycle), small (< 1.0 cm), moderate (1.0–1.9 cm), large (2.0–2.5 cm), and very large (> 2.5 cm). Common mimickers on echocardiography include a left pleural effusion and an epicardial fat pad that has a heterogenous echodensity, moves with the myocardium, and is often located anterior to the right ventricle.

### Heart muscle disease management in aircrew [^111pNGut]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Pericarditis

Acute pericarditis may present with severe pain, which may be have an acute onset. Any associated pericardial effusion may result in haemodynamic compromise. In high-income countries, a viral aetiology is the most common cause, although in countries where tuberculosis is endemic it is most commonly the cause of pericarditis. Although pericarditis involves primarily the pericardium, the inflammatory process may also involve the myocardium (myopericarditis). The resulting myocarditis is usually mild.

Diagnosis of acute pericarditis is based on pericarditic chest pain, pericardial rubs, new widespread ST-elevation or PR depression on ECG, and a new or worsening pericardial effusion. Elevated inflammatory markers, or imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation may also provide support to the diagnosis. The presence of a pericardial effusion may result in haemodynamic compromise, which may have a more profound effect with exposure to Gz in particular. Therefore, aircrew with suspected or known pericarditis must undergo TTE to look for pericardial effusion. The use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is recommended for the treatment of pericarditis until symptoms fully resolve, along with colchicine which is continued for 6–12 weeks. Corticosteroids are associated with an increased risk of recurrence and use as a first-line treatment is not recommended. Aircrew are likely to be off medication by the time a return to flying is being considered, although if they remain on treatment, consideration should be given to a further period of grounding to ensure that symptoms have settled.

A period of reduced physical activity is recommended following an episode of pericarditisand aircrew should not fly during this period. Recurrence occurs in approximately 15%–30% of cases of acute pericarditis, although this may be halved if colchicine is used. In order to look for evidence of recurrence, and to avoid increased activity in the short-term following an attack of pericarditis, aircrew should be grounded for a minimum period of 3 months.

Methods

Patients

The Hopkins Lupus Cohort is a single-center, longitudinal, prospective cohort of 2931 patients whose diagnosis of SLE is confirmed before study enrollment. Patients were enrolled at a single tertiary medical center from 1988 to 2023. The Hopkins Lupus Cohort is approved yearly by the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. All patients provided consent to enter the cohort. Patient history, laboratory testing, and clinical information relevant to the classification of SLE and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index are recorded at the time of cohort entry. Race was self-reported. Patients were asked to choose from among African American, Asian, White, and other race; this information was collected as part of the demographic data collected in our registry. We combined Asian and other categories owing to low population size. Patients in the cohort are followed up quarterly at a minimum, and clinical information and laboratory testing are updated at subsequent clinical visits. We identified patients who had a history of pericarditis at the time of cohort entry or a diagnosis of pericarditis during cohort participation using the criteria described subsequently. This study is reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Diagnostic Criteria for Pericarditis

Pericarditis was diagnosed using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment–SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), a validated tool in the assessment of SLE clinical activity. For the diagnosis of pericarditis, 1 of the following criteria needed to be present: pericardial pain, auscultation of pericardial rub, presence of pericardial effusion on imaging, or electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmation. Clinical information was examined for all follow-up encounters after the first episode of pericarditis. Recurrent pericarditis was defined as pericarditis that occurred at least 6 weeks after the first recorded episode. Multiple recurrent episodes were identified if pericarditis occurred at least 6 weeks apart. Patients with SLE flares that included pericarditis were reevaluated more often than the minimum required quarterly evaluations (eg, within 6 weeks) to escalate baseline immunosuppressant therapy as needed and discuss symptomatic response to treatment of the SLE flare.

### Congenital unilateral pericardial agenesis presenting as an isolated chest pain in an adolescent: a case report and comprehensive review [^111NjJmc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital pericardial agenesis is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from the incomplete development of the pleuropericardial membranes during embryogenesis, leading to the partial or complete absence of the pericardial sac. Although this condition usually remains asymptomatic, it can present with various misleading symptoms such as chest pain (add some other, maybe 2, more prevalent presenting symptoms), making diagnosis challenging. Advanced imaging techniques are crucial for accurate diagnosis and management, especially when usual diagnostic modalities do not achieve a definite diagnosis.

Case Presentation

The history and diagnostic process of a 16-year-old female who presented with isolated, non-exertional chest pain are detailed. A comprehensive diagnostic work-up was initiated, including chest X-ray (CXR), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), CT angiography (CTA), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). These advanced imaging modalities unveiled the rare and elusive diagnosis of left-sided pericardial agenesis, decisively ruling out other potential causes and shedding light on an extraordinary case that challenges conventional diagnostic pathways.

Conclusion

Unilateral pericardial agenesis, though typically benign and often shrouded in clinical obscurity, can manifest with enigmatic symptoms such as isolated chest pain, necessitating a meticulous and comprehensive diagnostic approach. Multimodal imaging is essential for accurate diagnosis and for ruling out complications such as cardiac herniation or coronary artery compression. Considering the absence of significant complications, conservative management was chosen in this case, with the patient being discharged with instructions to monitor for any warning signs.

Clinical Key Message

Clinicians should consider congenital pericardial agenesis as one of the potential causes of unexplained chest pain, particularly when the initial investigations are inconclusive. Advanced imaging techniques (such as CXR and MRI) are vital for confirming the diagnosis and subsequently appropriate and timely management and preventing potential complications.

Case presentation

We present a case of 46-year-old male with no pertinent past medical history who presented to the emergency department with ongoing chest pain for 9 days associated with intermittent fevers and shortness of breath. On examination, the patient had a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and blood pressure of 143/72 mmHg. There were no audible murmurs or rubs on auscultation. He endorsed ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath.

The patient underwent contrast computed tomography (CT) angiography pulmonary embolism with pulmonary arterial phase timing that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but demonstrated a moderate sized pericardial effusion with high density concerning for hemopericardium, along with an outpouching on the right atrial wall with a narrow neck concerning for a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 1). Further workup, including lab work and an electrocardiogram, were unremarkable. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) redemonstrated the pericardial effusion and right atrial pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 2).

### Good prognosis for pericarditis with and without myocardial involvement: results from a multicenter, prospective cohort study [^117Dmq7r]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The natural history of myopericarditis/perimyocarditis is poorly known, and recently published studies have presented contrasting data on their outcomes. The aim of the present article is to assess the prognosis of myopericarditis/perimyocarditis in a multicenter, prospective cohort study.

Methods and Results

A total of 486 patients (median age, 39 years; range, 18–83 years; 300 men) with acute pericarditis or a myopericardial inflammatory syndrome (myopericarditis/perimyocarditis; 85% idiopathic, 11% connective tissue disease or inflammatory bowel disease, 5% infective) were prospectively evaluated from January 2007 to December 2011. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis was based on the presence of 2 of 4 clinical criteria (chest pain, pericardial rubs, widespread ST-segment elevation or PR depression, and new or worsening pericardial effusion). Myopericardial inflammatory involvement was suspected with atypical ECG changes for pericarditis, arrhythmias, and cardiac troponin elevation or new or worsening ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance. After a median follow-up of 36 months, normalization of left ventricular function was achieved in > 90% of patients with myopericarditis/perimyocarditis. No deaths were recorded, as well as evolution to heart failure or symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Recurrences (mainly as recurrent pericarditis) were the most common complication during follow-up and were recorded more frequently in patients with acute pericarditis (32%) than in those with myopericarditis (11%) or perimyocarditis (12%; P < 0.001). Troponin elevation was not associated with an increase in complications.

Conclusions

The outcome of myopericardial inflammatory syndromes is good. Unlike acute coronary syndromes, troponin elevation is not a negative prognostic marker in this setting.

Pericarditis computed tomography (CCT) — CCT for evaluation of other chest pain causes other than acute pericarditis is Reasonable, whereas CCT for routine assessment of pericarditis is Not recommended; in pericarditis, CCT findings may include pericardial effusion, thickening, and inflammation on delayed contrast sequence (although less accurate than CMR), and while CCT is not primarily used for diagnosing pericarditis it can be valuable for preoperative planning in cardiac surgeries such as pericardiectomy and is more useful in assessing other differential diagnoses of chest pain, such as acute aortic syndromes, pulmonary embolism, and coronary artery disease.

### Autoimmunity and autoinflammation as the yin and Yang of idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis [^117HqEnZ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity and autoinflammation are generally considered as mutually exclusive mechanisms of diseases but may concur to specific syndromes. Idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) is defined as the recurrence of pericardial symptoms at any point following the prior cessation of acute pericarditis, and the latency is generally 6 weeks. Manifestations of pericarditis such as pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion are less frequent in the subsequent episodes compared to the index attack, and in some cases the only clinical sign is represented by a suggestive chest pain. Several autoimmune diseases may manifest with pericarditis which is often related to viral infections, while postviral pericarditis may in turn display a nonspecific autoimmune background. Similarly, autoinflammatory syndromes such as familial Mediterranean fever and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome are characterized by self-limiting pericardial symptoms. Corticosteroids are generally effective, thus supporting the autoimmune nature of IRAP, but dramatic results are obtained with interleukin-1 blocking agents in corticosteroid-dependent cases, pointing to a pathogenic role for the inflammasome. Based on these observations, we submit that IRAP represents a paradigmatic example of the putative coexistence of autoimmunity and autoinflammation: the main aim of this review is to critically discuss the hypothesis as well as the current understanding of this enigmatic clinical condition.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^112cSXw1]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) for acute respiratory distress in the setting of 5 months of recurrent and worsening rash with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. At the onset of his rash, he and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the patient's rash recurred, prompting his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened, so amoxicillin was stopped; a prednisone course was prescribed which alleviated the rash. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely with associated symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Because of these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC, where his vitals were notable for tachypnea and tachycardia. His initial EC imaging workup was remarkable for an echocardiogram with a mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, chest x-ray (CXR) with a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography significant for prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results were notable for elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. Differential diagnosis remained broad, including infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

### Acute pericarditis as a primary presentation of COVID-19 [^112P5CTs]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly contagious viral illness which conventionally manifests primarily with respiratory symptoms. We report a case whose first manifestation of COVID-19 was pericarditis, in the absence of respiratory symptoms, without any serious complications. Cardiac involvement in various forms is possible in COVID-19. We present a case where pericarditis, in the absence of the classic COVID-19 signs or symptoms, is the only evident manifestation of the disease. This case highlights an atypical presentation of COVID-19 and the need for a high index of suspicion to allow early diagnosis and limit spread by isolation.

### Monophasic pericardial synovial sarcoma in a Turkish female patient: a very rare case with cyto-histopathological findings [^115ejSc9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Primary pericardial sarcomas are a group of extremely rare malignancies that constitute approximately 10–15% of all primary cardiac sarcomas. These aggressive sarcomas are classified into histopathological subtypes, including fibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and, synovial sarcoma. Primary PSS has a poor prognosis compared to other types of sarcomas. Due to its rarity, the literature on the cytology of primary PSS is insufficient, making differential diagnoses difficult. It appears that this case of monophasic primary PSS which was an extremely rare malignancy diagnosed with the cytopathological findings. The cytology of a very limited number of cases with PSS has been studied in the literature, but none of them have been able to obtain sufficient numbers of cells by aspiration. Therefore, FNA cytology results could not be presented.

Examinations involving PSS include a chest X-ray that may reveal the presence of a pericardiac mass in a widened mediastinum. Echocardiographic findings include pericardial effusion or a thickened pericardium. A CT scan determines the location of a tumor with either a local invasion or distant metastasis. Chapra et al. (2021) presented the radiological findings of a large, heterogeneously enhancing pericardial mass with pericardial effusion in a patient diagnosed with primary PSS. Recently, Luo et al. (2022) presented a young patient with a mediastinal mass noted in initial CT images, but the pathological examination and related auxiliary examinations of pericardial effusion did not show any tumor cells or related markers in the pleural fluid. In our case, the clinical and radiological findings of the patient were supported by the histopathological and cytopathological findings. The patient was followed-up for three years, but the tumor had grown, aggravating the patient's condition. She has recently been placed in intensive care.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^112VeT6n]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pericardial effusions are primarily categorized into inflammatory and non-inflammatory cases. This classification and the severity of the conditions determine the therapeutic plan. An essential consideration in understanding the epidemiology of the disease is the geographical region and country of residence. Not all pericardial effusions require evaluation to determine the cause. In developed countries, they are mainly categorized as idiopathic, believed to be associated with temporary viral infections. The second and third most common reasons are diagnosed diseases and malignancies. Conversely, in developing countries, tuberculosis remains the primary cause of the disease. These epidemiological factors can assist health decision-makers in approaching disease prevention and treatment. On a smaller scale, they empower physicians to make informed decisions for patient treatment when there is insufficient time to investigate the cause of pericardial effusion or when such investigation is not rationalized based on cost–benefit considerations. History, physical examination, and echocardiography constitute the main pillars of diagnosis. Treatment can range from observation to percutaneous or surgical procedures depending on the etiology and severity of fluid accumulation.

### High mortality with COVID-19 acute pericarditis [^1128rNHC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The study by Li and Shi suggests that when there is clinically manifest acute pericarditis in a patient with COVID‐19, whether there is more myocardial involvement or not, there is a level of inflammation that is associated with a striking mortality difference. The study forces a further elucidation of the causes of pericarditis in COVID‐19, and makes us ask why clinical pericardial involvement, not even with tamponade, might be associated with such high mortality.

The visceral pericardium has a blood supply from the internal thoracic arteries, off the subclavian arteries, and from the bronchial arteries, off the thoracic aorta. The visceral pericardium has postganglionic sympathetic innervation and preganglionic parasympathetic innervation. The sensory neurons are carried within the phrenic nerve. There is also lymphatic drainage of the pericardium. System inflammation with endothelial changes in the pericardial vasculature can inflame the visceral pericardium that then becomes even more vascular, and thus even more inflamed. Alterations of the parasympathetic ganglia may be part of the sinus tachycardia and even atrial arrhythmia that are often seen in acute pericarditis. The parietal pericardium, largely fibrous and avascular, can serve to trap the inflammation in the pericardial sack. A rub and pleuritic discomfort and an effusion ensue. If visceral pericardial inflammation is severe enough, there can be a myopericarditis, because the changes in the visceral pericardium affect the epicardium, with resultant electrocardiographic changes, alongside the expected pain, rub, and effusion. Myopericarditis is somewhat distinct from perimyocarditis, in which visceral pericardial inflammation is secondary to epicardial inflammation. The high mortality rates associated with COVID‐19 acute pericarditis may reflect both processes, with greater myocardial involvement than is seen in the patients with COVID‐19 without acute pericarditis, and greater, direct pericardial involvement than is seen in non‐COVID‐19 acute pericarditis. The higher mortality in COVID‐19 acute pericarditis compared with non‐COVID‐19 acute pericarditis is partly respiratory mediated. Acute pericarditis may also sum myocardial involvement and direct pericardial vascular involvement. For there to be direct, pericardial vascular involvement, there may have to be inflammation in the blood supply to the pericardium, perhaps starting with inflammation in the aorta and its branches, perhaps derived from the bronchial arteries being affected by respiratory involvement. There may have to be specific inflammatory markers that derive from direct effects on the pericardial vasculature. The renal involvement may reflect a similar issue. Whereas as many as 19% of COVID‐19 autopsies show patchy pericardial involvement, the patients with clinically manifest acute pericarditis would be expected to have much greater pericardial inflammation and perhaps greater endothelial alterations in the blood supply to the visceral pericardium. The large vessel inflammation, with a different array of inflammatory mediators, may be part of the explanation for the much higher mortality and morbidity (length of stay) associated with the acute pericarditis in patients with COVID‐19.

Her laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 20,000/mm³ (neutrophils 18,700/mm³ [1,800–6,800]; lymphocytes, 1,470/mm³ [1,000–3,400]; monocytes, 1,850/mm³ [200–800]; eosinophils, 230/mm³ [0–400]; basophils, 20/mm³ [0–100]). Antinuclear and anti–double-stranded DNA antibody titers were below threshold values. Results of an extensive infection workup, including blood cultures; skin biopsy cultures for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria; herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus culture and direct fluorescent antibody; as well as enterovirus polymerase chain reaction of pustule scrapings, were negative. Two sequential skin biopsies from the right forearm showed similar features, including a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with leukocytoclasis, marked papillary dermal edema, and formation of neutrophilic intraepidermal pustules. No microorganisms were identified via staining (Fite, Grocott's Methenamine Silver, Periodic acid–Schiff–diastase, Brown-Brenn, immunoperoxidase studies for herpes simplex virus I/II and varicella zoster virus; Fig 2). The usual findings for coxsackievirus infection — ballooning and reticular degeneration — were not observed. Results of age-appropriate screening for malignancy and immunofixation electrophoresis were normal.

Three days after presentation, the patient had chest pain, a pericardial rub, and diffuse ST-elevations, and troponin level was elevated at 0.94 μg/L (normal, < 0.05). Echocardiogram found a small pericardial effusion. Several days later she had hypotension, and a repeat echocardiogram found increased pericardial fluid with right atrial collapse. She was taken for urgent pericardial window with removal of 350 mL of bloody fluid resulting in immediate hemodynamic improvement. She also underwent a cesarean section. Cultures from pericardial tissue were without growth. Given the lack of any laboratory support for a diagnosis of infection and no improvement with broad antimicrobial coverage, the decision was made to treat the patient for Sweet syndrome complicated by myopericarditis. She was prescribed prednisone, 1 mg/kg/d for 5 days, followed by a prolonged taper. The skin lesions and pericarditis resolved, and she was discharged 2 weeks after starting prednisone.

Results

Clinical Characteristics of the Patients

A total of 240 patients were found to meet acute pericarditis criteria, and the characteristics at the time of presentation are summarized in Table 1. The median age of the cohort was 51 (34–62) years, with 135 (56%) men, and 121 (50.4%) self-defined whites and 100 (41.7%) blacks. Two hundred twenty (92%) patients had pericardial chest pain, 43 (18%) pericardial rubs, 107 (47%) pericardial effusion, and 128 (53%) ECG alterations (71 [30%] PR depression and 104 [43%] ST elevation). Idiopathic pericarditis was found to be the most common diagnosis (126, [52.5%]). Postcardiac injury was the second most frequent cause of pericarditis (79 [32.9%]; Fig 1 A). Among patients with postcardiac injury pericarditis, four (5%) had a chest trauma, 11 (14%) an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 32 (41%) a catheter ablation, and one (1%) thoracoscopic ablation, six (8%) a pacemaker implantation, 11 (14%) surgery for valve repair or replacement, and four (5%) intervention for left appendage exclusion. Eleven (14%) patients had a cardiac bypass surgery, of which three happened after AMI. Ten (13%) patients underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention, eight of which occurred after AMI.

### Haemorrhagiccomplex pericarditis presenting with cardiac tamponade in an immunocompetent woman [^111vXm43]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

This patient's large haemorrhagic pericardial effusion could have been caused by malignancy, tuberculosis (TB) or possible viral pericarditis, with MAC representing contamination. However, we argue against this as none of these differentials would explain this patient's clinical course. The patient's flow cytometry was negative, cytology was negative, breast biopsy was also negative and the lack of a recurrent nature was not in keeping with a malignant effusion with contamination. TB was ruled out as all her sputum samples were negative for M. tuberculosis (MTB), in addition to the fact that PCR and gene sequencing for MTB were negative on all samples tested (see table 1). Given the haemorrhagic nature, viral pericarditis was less likely. In addition, testing for common viruses, including coxsackie virus on the pericardial and respiratory samples, was negative. Hence, the large haemorrhagic pericardial effusion, recurrent fevers, inflammation and necrotising granulomas seen on histopathology, growth of MAC in multiple pericardial samples and a positive QuantiFERON-Gold test in the setting of negative PCR for MTB made a localised MAC-induced pericardial effusion the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Pericarditis in oncologic patients — Pericardial involvement in the setting of known malignancy can occur with direct spread or hematologic or lymphatic dissemination. Most pericardial metastases are identified as part of a staging chest computed tomography or positron emission tomography–computed tomography study. Frequently, the presence of new pericardial effusion or nodularity in staging imaging studies is the first clue for pericardial malignant involvement. The presence of hemorrhagic or complex pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of pericardial metastasis in that setting.

Conclusion

This case of PSS is an extremely rare malignancy, and it appears that it would be the first case with cytopathological findings to be published in the international literature. Because the progression of PSS is very rapid and because the morbidity and mortality rates of young people with PSS are relatively high, an aggressive surgical resection should be performed as soon as a patient is diagnosed. It should also be noted that FNAB is a helpful diagnostic method if it can be supported by molecular pathology.

### Management of pericardial effusion [^115p9D9k]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a common finding in clinical practice either as incidental finding or manifestation of a systemic or cardiac disease. The spectrum of pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. The aetiology is varied (infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-related), being tuberculosis the leading cause of pericardial effusions in developing countries and all over the world, while concurrent HIV infection may have an important promoting role in this setting. Management is guided by the haemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), associated medical conditions, and the aetiology whenever possible. Pericardiocentesis is mandatory for cardiac tamponade and when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected. Pericardial biopsy is generally reserved for cases with recurrent cardiac tamponade or persistence without a defined aetiology, especially when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected and cannot be assessed by other conventional and less invasive means. A true isolated effusion may not require a specific treatment if the patient is asymptomatic, but large ones are at risk of progression to cardiac tamponade (up to one third). Pericardiocentesis alone may be curative for large effusions, but recurrences are also common and pericardiectomy or less invasive options (i.e. pericardial window) should be considered with recurrent cardiac tamponade or symptomatic pericardial effusion (either circumferential or loculated). The aim of this paper was to summarize and critically evaluate current knowledge on the management of pericardial effusion.

The role of inflammation in pericardial disease — pericarditis is characterized by a severe inflammatory response to injury of mesothelial cells triggered by viral infections, cardiac surgery or procedures, or immune derangements; etiologies including infectious, autoimmune, or mechanical injury promote transcription and translation of proinflammatory genes and inflammasome components, leading to caspase‑1 activation and maturation of interleukin‑1β and other cytokines; derangements in innate and adaptive immunity contribute to disparate clinical phenotypes, significant patient‑level variability, and dysregulated immunity is often implicated in recurrent and chronic cases where identifying these derangements can refine targeted immunosuppressive therapies.

Evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — evaluation starts with a thorough history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests with particular attention to sedimentation rate, CRP, and troponin if myocarditis is suspected; TTE remains the first-line imaging modality for assessing suspected pericarditis, TTE findings may include pericardial effusion (without or with tamponade), pericardial thickening, features of constrictive physiology, and/or myocardial involvement, TTE can be serially used to monitor for improvement or worsening of these abnormalities, and TTE's main limitation is the inability of tissue characterization to identify and grade pericardial inflammation.

### A case of purulent pneumococcal pericarditis [^113Jg8Lq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Purulent bacterial pericarditis is a rare and potentially fatal disease. The course may be fulminant, and the presentation may pose a diagnostic challenge.

Case Report

An otherwise healthy 75-year-old male was brought to the emergency department in a state of general deterioration, confusion, and shock. Bedside ultrasound showed a significant pericardial effusion. His condition quickly deteriorated and the resuscitation included emergent bedside pericardiocentesis. The drainage was purulent and later cultures grew out Streptococcus pneumoniae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Purulent pericarditis is extremely rare but should be considered in the patient with a fulminant infectious process (particularly pneumonia) and signs of pericardial effusion. Treatment should include appropriate antibiotics and early drainage.

### Monophasic pericardial synovial sarcoma in a Turkish female patient: a very rare case with cyto-histopathological findings [^116ejFWW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Malignant pericardial effusions represent an advanced stage of malignancy and are less common than pleural or peritoneal effusions. Therefore, the clinical and cytopathologic features of these cases have rarely been reported. Studies conducted on pericardial effusions are relatively rare and have been limited to case reports and small series. Occasionally, a cytology examination cannot help to differentiate reactive mesothelial cells from malignant mesothelial or metastatic cells. If a cytogenetic examination is not available, a cell block from aspiration material can be obtained, and an immunohistochemical analysis of the block can be performed for a differential diagnosis of PSS. In our case, no cell block was obtained, and an immunohistochemical analysis of the pericardiocentesis material could not be performed. However, resection material was obtained a week later from a cytological examination, and an immunohistochemical analysis of this material was performed. According to the findings of this analysis, the patient was definitively diagnosed with monophasic primary PSS, and multimodality therapy consisting of chemoradiotherapy was managed according to this diagnosis.

The biphasic type of PSS that is composed of an epithelial component and a spindle-cell component is more common than the monophasic type composed of only spindle-cells and poorly differentiated small round cells clustered in a fascicular pattern. Consistent with the literature, the histopathological findings of our patient with a monophasic variant of PSS showed similar cells in some areas with myxoid background and large areas of focal necrosis. The tumor was mitotically active.

The differential diagnosis of PSS includes various other mediastinal and pericardial tumors, including mesothelioma, fibrosarcoma, thymoma, metastatic carcinoma, and other soft tissue sarcoma. Tumor histology may show a similar appearance to PSS, so to differentiate PSS from other sarcomas, the immunohistochemistry for vimentin, BCL-2, CD99, and TLE1 are common positive markers. The samples of our patient tested uniformly positive for vimentin, BCL-2, CD99, and TLE1 and tested negative for EMA, muscle markers (smooth muscle actin, desmin, and myogenin), the NSE neural marker, S-100, pankeratin (AE1/AE3), cytokeratin (CK5/6), CD57, p63 and FLI. This facilitated the correct differential diagnosis of PSS by excluding other possible soft tissue tumors. In some cases, tumor cells may also test positive for NSE and FLI1. Therefore, a cytogenetic examination of a sample is necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

### Acute pericarditis and cancer risk: a matched cohort study using linked UK primary and secondary care data [^1112cGzP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pericarditis is the most common disease of the pericardium and involves inflammation of the pericardium with or without pericardial effusion (pericardial exudate). Clinical presentation is characterized by chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and often with specific ECG changes. Acute pericarditis mainly affects the younger population, and it is usually benign and self‐limiting. However, pericarditis with effusion is a known complication to lung and breast cancer and has been reported also in patients with hematological malignancies, primary cardiac tumors, gastrointestinal cancer, and urogenital cancer. 1, 2 The connection may stem from direct extension of cancer cells from nearby structures or hematogenous spread of abnormal cancer cells through the bloodstream. 3 The link between pericarditis and cancer raises the question of whether pericarditis may be a useful marker of occult cancers and of importance in cancer detection.

A recent Danish population‐based cohort study by members of our group showed a high rate of several cancers, including lung, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract cancers, in addition to lymphoma and leukemia during the first 3 months after the pericarditis diagnosis. 4 Of note, an increased risk was also observed for lung cancer, non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma, and bladder cancer diagnoses up to several years after the pericarditis diagnosis. Importantly, the increased risk of cancer was not confined to patients with pericardial effusion. These results suggest that a more‐thorough investigation may be warranted in some patients presenting with acute pericarditis to exclude these cancers, but confirmation of the observed associations is needed in independent data sets before such action might be recommended, and there is a need for data on which patients groups are most likely to benefit from additional investigations.

We therefore investigated the association between pericarditis and subsequent risk cancer in the United Kingdom. We also examined whether associations between pericarditis and cancer were modified by patient‐level factors, and evaluated absolute excess cancer risk among patients presenting with pericarditis, according to key patient‐level factors.

### Monophasic pericardial synovial sarcoma in a Turkish female patient: a very rare case with cyto-histopathological findings [^111uxxyH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Synovial sarcoma accounts for 5–10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. The lesion is often observed as a soft tissue tumor in the extremities of young adults. Localization of synovial sarcoma in the pericardium has rarely been reported in the literature. There have been less than 20 cases of primary PSS published in the last decade. Among the cases of synovial sarcoma, monophasic PSS is an extremely rare malignant tumor that is challenging to diagnose and unpredictable. Early diagnosis and subsequent aggressive multimodal treatment are crucial to successfully manage a patient with this condition. The purpose of this report is to present the diagnostic and cytopathological experiences of a young patient with monophasic PSS.

COVID-19 virus-associated pericardial effusion

COVID-19 caused one of the most catastrophic health crises of our era, and there was a wide range of symptoms and signs which could be seen in the presentation of the COVID-19 patients. The manifestation can be a mild fever and respiratory discomfort or much more severe, such as rapid progression toward acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Although many effective strategies have been introduced to combat the severity of the impact of COVID-19 on societies, during the last four years, several surges in the incidence of this disease have happened, and it has been a major health concern. Being well-prepared for new virus strains that might involve the population is crucial. The most vulnerable part of the population for rapid progress of the disease includes those older > 60 years, men, those with extensive lung involvement, patients with cardiac or vascular diseases, patients with a history of pericardial effusion, diabetes, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Conclusion and follow-up

After a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging and laboratory tests, the patient was diagnosed with complete left-sided pericardial agenesis, a rare congenital condition. As the patient was asymptomatic aside from the initial chest pain, and no complications such as pericardial effusion, herniation, or coronary artery compression were detected, a conservative management approach was chosen. The patient was reassured about the generally benign nature of her condition and was discharged with clear instructions to monitor for any warning signs, such as increasing chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or any new or worsening symptoms. She was advised to avoid strenuous physical activity until further evaluation.

For ongoing care, a follow-up visit was scheduled with her cardiologist in three months to monitor her condition, with an additional echocardiogram planned in six months to reassess her heart's position and function. The patient and her family were educated on recognizing symptoms that could indicate complications and were instructed on when to seek immediate medical attention.

### Pergolide (Permax) [^1147c7Po]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

All patients taking pergolide should undergo periodic echocardiograms to screen for the development of valvulopathy. Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of valvulopathy, including dyspnea, edema, congestive heart failure and new cardiac murmurs. If a patient develops these signs or symptoms, consideration should be given to suspending treatment with pergolide until a full diagnostic evaluation, including echocardiogram, has been performed. Pergolide should ordinarily be discontinued if a patient is diagnosed with cardiac valvular disease. In some cases, signs and/or symptoms of cardiac valvulopathy improved after discontinuation of pergolide.

Fibrotic Complications

Case reports have demonstrated that pergolide increases the risk of fibrotic complications including pulmonary, pleural, and/or retroperitoneal fibrosis, pericarditis, pleuritis, and pericardial and/or pleural effusions. Cases have been reported after exposures to pergolide ranging from about one to several years. Precise risk estimates of pergolide-induced fibrotic complications are not available.

Specific risk factors predisposing patients to developing fibrotic complications with pergolide have not been identified. Fibrotic complications have been reported with all therapeutic doses of pergolide.

Pergolide is not recommended for use in patients with a history of fibrotic conditions.

Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of fibrotic complications, including dyspnea, persistent edema, cough, congestive heart failure, new cardiac rub, and/or signs of urinary tract obstruction. If a patient develops these signs or symptoms, consideration should be given to suspending treatment with pergolide until a full diagnostic evaluation has been performed. Pergolide should ordinarily be discontinued if a patient is diagnosed with a specific fibrotic complication. In some cases, signs and/or symptoms of fibrotic complications improved after discontinuation of pergolide.

### Diagnosing pericarditis [^113HNagn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, is most often caused by viral infection. It can also develop as a result of bacterial or other infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, injury to the mediastinal area, and the effects of certain drugs (notably hydralazine and procainamide). The clinical features of pericarditis depend on its cause, as well as the volume and type of effusion. Patients with uncomplicated pericarditis have pleuritic-type chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and may be relieved by leaning forward. Chest radiographs, Doppler studies, and laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the degree of effusion. In most patients, pericarditis is mild and resolves spontaneously, although treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a short course of a corticosteroid may be helpful. When a large pericardial effusion is produced, cardiac function may be compromised, and cardiac tamponade can occur. In patients with longstanding inflammation, the pericardium becomes fibrous or calcified, resulting in constriction of the heart. Drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary in patients with complicated pericarditis.

A case of a 37 year old man with cardiac angiosarcoma causing recurrent pericardial effusion, who eventually died of cardiac rupture, is presented. The diagnosis was not established until the postmortem examination despite echocardiography, pericardiocentesis, and pericardial biopsy investigations. There is neither a specific manifestation that enables early recognition nor well proven effective treatment against this disease. Accordingly, the prognosis of cardiac angiosarcoma remains grave. A high index of suspicion is recommended in patients who present with unexplained pericardial effusion.

Pericarditis phenotypes and concomitant myocarditis — "About 15% of patients will have concomitant myocarditis… manifested by elevated markers of myocardial injury (troponin) and left ventricular global or regional systolic dysfunction". The condition includes "a noninflammatory phenotype… seen in 10% to 20% of cases, and an inflammatory phenotype seen in 80% to 90% of patients", where those with the inflammatory phenotype "can present with high fever, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and pericardial and/or pleural effusions". If appropriately treated, "most acute pericarditis cases will have a benign course and resolve without recurrence". Risk factors for worse outcomes include "high fevers, subacute course, presence of large pericardial effusion with echocardiography features of tamponade physiology, failure to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as concomitant myocarditis".

The diagnostic steps for serositis were based on both symptoms and routine procedures, including chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, cardiopulmonary ultrasound, or chest computerized tomography. Lupus pericarditis was suspected based on the presence of one or more of the following clinical manifestations: typical sharp precordial pains, pericardial rubs, cardiomegaly on chest radiography, or electrocardiographic abnormalities indicative of pericarditis. It was confirmed by demonstrating the presence of pericardial effusion (> 0.5 cm in depth) on an echocardiogram. Lupus pleuritis was suspected when dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, or pleural effusion on chest radiography presented. It was confirmed by the presence of pleural effusion (> 0.5 cm in depth) on transthoracic sonography.

Infection-related pleuritis or pericarditis was diagnosed based on the cultures or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results of pathogens (bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, or viral) in the pleural or pericardial effusion, or it was highly suspected based on the treatment response to broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Lupus pericarditis or pleuritis was diagnosed by the clinical and laboratory parameters of lupus activity and the judgment of pediatric rheumatologists. Trivial pericardial and pleural effusions (< 0.5 cm in depth), or effusions due to other conditions, such as infections, malignancy, or fluid overload, were excluded in the analysis.

Primary outcome measure

The primary outcome was diagnosis of postoperative pericarditis. We identified the patient cohort meeting this diagnosis by 3 criteria: 1) no prior documented history of pericarditis (acute or recurrent); 2) meeting at least 2 out of 4 diagnostic criteria for acute pericarditis (chest pain, pericardial friction rub, ECG changes [diffuse nonlocalizing ST-elevations or PR-depressions], and new or worsening pericardial effusion); and 3) clinical presentation warranting treatment with either colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (first line), corticosteroids, or interleukin 1 inhibition. These therapies are in line with prior treatment algorithms for PCIS.ECGs were manually reviewed given possibility of machine error in diagnosis. We additionally collected data points for pericardial effusion size, pleural effusion, development of fever within 48 hours postop, and treatment type.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed, and tables were created using R software. The Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram was created using app.biorender.com. Continuous variables are expressed as median with 25th-75th percentiles (Q1-Q3) and categorical variables as number (n) with percentage. Assumptions of linearity for continuous variables were determined by visual inspection of scatterplots. Percentages for dichotomous variables are calculated by total number of cases in a given group (typically out of total cases that developed postoperative pericarditis vs total cases that did not develop postoperative pericarditis). Percentages for categorical variables are calculated as percentages of a given subcategory. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and categorical variables were compared with the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test if expected cell count was < 5. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on ASD repairs (multivariable covariates included age, sex, Asian race, body mass index (BMI), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time using univariable covariates with P < 0.20). Variables with incidence rate < 5% were excluded from the univariable analysis. Results are presented as OR with 95% CI. A 2-sided P value < 0.05 was determined to be statistically significant. Kaplan-Meier analysis for postoperative time to pericarditis was conducted using the survminer package in R. Censoring time was up to day 30.

Pericardiocentesis — indications, sequencing, and approach — states that "Pericardiocentesis is therapeutically performed in cases of impending or established cardiac tamponade, especially in urgent or emergency settings with echocardiography guidance, and diagnostically when there is concern for specific causes, such as bacterial, tuberculous, or malignant etiologies", while "In patients with an inflammatory pericardial effusion and no concern for tamponade, anti-inflammatory therapy should be pursued prior to pericardiocentesis". Approaches are outlined as "Anatomical approaches to pericardiocentesis include subxiphoid, apical, and parasternal. In an emergency, a subxiphoid or apical approach is preferred", with image guidance where "Echocardiography, fluoroscopy, and/or computed tomography may be utilized to guide the pericardiocentesis procedure", and escalation that "Surgical creation of a pericardial window is considered in select patients with recurrent large pericardial effusions and/or cardiac tamponade despite prior pericardiocentesis" and "In certain rare cases, radical pericardiectomy surgery may be indicated for recurrent pericardial effusions, even following the creation of a pericardial window, especially when there is concomitant medically refractory constrictive pericarditis or pericarditis".

A 46-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with fever and pleuritic thoracic pain. Six weeks prior to admission, the patient had undergone cardiac surgery. The ECG showed diffuse ST segment elevation and PR segment depression. The blood tests revealed increased inflammatory markers and negative myocardial necrosis markers. Pericardial and left-sided pleural effusion were noted. Sterile blood cultures were negative. Hence, the hypothesis of Dressler's syndrome was established.

4, 14, 15 In patients with acute pericarditis, chest pain is abrupt in onset, pleuritic, and substernal or left precordial in location. It may radiate to the trapezius ridge, neck, arms, or jaw. The pain is relieved by leaning forward and is made worse by lying supine. The classic triphasic pericardial rub is best heard along the left sternal border with the patient sitting up and leaning forward.
7. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Although auscultation of a pericardial friction rub has high specificity for acute pericarditis, it has low sensitivity that varies with the frequency of auscultation. 15, 16 The pericardial rub is best auscultated with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left lower sternal border in end expiration with the patient leaning forward.

It has a rasping or creaking sound similar to leather rubbing against leather. The classic pericardial rub is triphasic but occurs in only one half of patients with a rub, whereas the remainder of patients have a biphasic or monophasic rub. The three phases of the pericardial rub correspond to the movement of the heart against the pericardial sac during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and rapid ventricular filling. The rub of pericarditis may be transient, making it important for physicians to auscultate the heart repeatedly. 4, 5, 15 The presence of a monophasic rub occurring with the respiratory cycle in the absence of diagnostic changes on ECG or elevated cardiac enzymes should alert physicians to the possibility of pleuritis. 3 Physical findings that suggest acute cardiac tamponade include tachypnea, tachycardia, neck vein distention, hypotension, and inspiratory fall in arterial blood pressure.

Echocardiographic evidence of diastolic chamber collapse of the right atrium, right ventricle, or both serves to confirm tamponade. Treatment The goal of treating acute viral pericarditis is to relieve pain and to prevent complications such as recurrence, tamponade, and chronic restrictive pericarditis. Because most episodes of acute pericarditis are uncomplicated, many patients may be managed in the outpatient setting.

Acute pericarditis is a common disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in adults. 4, 14, 15 In patients with acute pericarditis, chest pain is abrupt in onset, pleuritic, and substernal or left precordial in location. It may radiate to the trapezius ridge, neck, arms, or jaw. The pain is relieved by leaning forward and is made worse by lying supine. The classic triphasic pericardial rub is best heard along the left sternal border with the patient sitting up and leaning forward.

Although auscultation of a pericardial friction rub has high specificity for acute pericarditis, it has low sensitivity that varies with the frequency of auscultation.

15, 16 The pericardial rub is best auscultated with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left lower sternal border in end expiration with the patient leaning forward. It has a rasping or creaking sound similar to leather rubbing against leather. The classic pericardial rub is triphasic but occurs in only one half of patients with a rub, whereas the remainder of patients have a biphasic or monophasic rub. The three phases of the pericardial rub correspond to the movement of the heart against the pericardial sac during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and rapid ventricular filling. The rub of pericarditis may be transient, making it important for physicians to auscultate the heart repeatedly. The authors of two recent randomized controlled trials examined the value of colchicine in the treatment of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

28, 29 Participants in each study received either conventional treatment with aspirin or aspirin at the same dose combined with colchicine. Patients intolerant of aspirin were given a tapering dose of prednisone over one month. 29.
