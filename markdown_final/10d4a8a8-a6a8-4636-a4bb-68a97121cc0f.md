## Question

common side effects of antipsychotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common side effects of antipsychotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guidelines and labels to anchor safety domains and class differences. Then, I should verify the main side-effect clusters (movement, metabolic, prolactin, cardiovascular, CNS/sedation, anticholinergic, sexual, and "other") and map them to drug classes. Next, I will quantify frequencies where solid data exist, followed by guideline-concordant monitoring and management strategies. Finally, I should consider switching, dose reduction, and discontinuation nuances, making sure to self-check claims and cite appropriately throughout [^112ocfn7] [^111xHqpt] [^116TUYpB] [^116Go8Yw] [^114LVWo1].

> Let me first confirm the evidence base I will rely on so I don't overstate anything. I should anchor definitive statements in high-credibility guidelines (APA 2020; VA/DoD 2023) and FDA labels, use high-quality syntheses for comparative tolerability, and bring in lower-credibility sources only to illustrate breadth or mechanisms as needed. Yes, APA emphasizes initiating antipsychotics with ongoing side-effect monitoring, VA/DoD guides metabolic and tardive strategies, FDA labels detail agent-specific adverse reactions, and large network meta-analyses highlight that agents differ more in side effects than efficacy, which frames risk–benefit choices well [^112ocfn7] [^111u4Cf5] [^111xHqpt] [^116TUYpB] [^116Go8Yw].

> Next, I should review the side-effect domains to structure the discussion. Movement-disorder related effects include acute EPS (parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia), tardive dyskinesia, and rare NMS; metabolic effects include weight gain, dyslipidemia, glucose dysregulation, and metabolic syndrome; prolactin-related effects include hyperprolactinemia with sexual and reproductive sequelae; cardiovascular effects include QT prolongation and orthostatic hypotension; sedative/CNS effects include somnolence and cognitive slowing; anticholinergic effects include dry mouth and constipation; sexual dysfunction can also arise independent of prolactin; and "other" includes withdrawal-emergent dyskinesias and activation/insomnia during switching. I need to ensure each of these is supported: movement domains are well described with lower EPS liability for atypicals, metabolic risks are prominent with some SGAs, prolactin issues are classically linked to dopamine blockade, QT concerns vary by agent, and switching can provoke transient syndromes, all of which aligns with the clinical literature and labels [^111XS5dZ] [^1133GxDo] [^112dL4bR] [^117CXxzL] [^111XLFrV] [^116TUYpB] [^116qmwvK] [^115sw5hH].

> Now, I will map class and agent-level differences, but hold on, let me verify the classic teaching against comparative data. First-generation agents, particularly high-potency ones like haloperidol, carry higher risks of EPS and hyperprolactinemia; second-generation agents have lower EPS risk on average but differ markedly in metabolic liability, with clozapine and olanzapine highest, quetiapine/risperidone/paliperidone intermediate, and aripiprazole/ziprasidone/lurasidone lower for weight gain. Sedation tends to be greater with clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine, while aripiprazole and lurasidone are relatively activating; prolactin elevation is more common with risperidone/paliperidone and haloperidol, while aripiprazole and quetiapine are more prolactin-sparing. Wait, I should not jump to conclusions about QT safety — ziprasidone does have QT prolongation concerns, so I need to couch that as a trade-off rather than "safe" per se. This pattern is supported by head-to-head EPS data from first-episode psychosis, broad primary care syntheses, and cardiovascular reviews, with the comparative meta-analytic framework emphasizing tolerability differences across the class [^11522qag] [^117Gq6AG] [^111XLFrV] [^116Go8Yw] [^113AVg23].

> I should quantify frequencies where the data are strongest, and I need to double-check I'm not overgeneralizing trial averages to all patients. Compared with SGAs, haloperidol shows higher rates and severity of parkinsonism and akathisia in FEP, with greater anticholinergic use, even at low doses, which confirms the EPS gradient I mentioned earlier. Maintenance trials and umbrella reviews show that adverse effects are common and materially affect functioning, with higher rates of movement disorders, sedation, and weight gain versus placebo in maintenance settings, reinforcing the need for proactive monitoring and mitigation. I recognize that real-world rates can be higher with longer exposure and polypharmacy, so I will be cautious not to understate risk [^11522qag] [^112KLgRm] [^116Go8Yw] [^114LVWo1].

> Next, I should outline monitoring and general mitigation principles, and let me verify that I am aligning with guidelines. Core actions include systematic side-effect assessment at baseline and periodically thereafter, with specific attention to metabolic parameters and patient-centered priorities; APA underscores ongoing monitoring during treatment, and VA/DoD recommends structured lifestyle and weight-management supports. Pragmatically, dose minimization to the lowest effective dose, spacing/timing adjustments for sedating agents, and shared decision-making around trade-offs are foundational. I need to ensure I emphasize that monitoring adherence in practice is often suboptimal, suggesting systems-based supports are warranted to close that gap [^112ocfn7] [^111u4Cf5] [^113XgCpt] [^111yk7D7].

> I will now examine movement-disorder management, but first, let me confirm guideline specifics. For acute dystonia, offer an anticholinergic; for parkinsonism, consider dose reduction, switching, or adding an anticholinergic; for akathisia, options include dose reduction, switching, and adding a benzodiazepine or a beta-blocker such as propranolol. For established tardive dyskinesia, VA/DoD recommends VMAT2 inhibitors, while AAN 2013 notes insufficient evidence that switching from FGA to SGA alone treats tardive syndromes; I should not overpromise reversal with switching. Labels also remind us about withdrawal-emergent dyskinesias after abrupt discontinuation, so tapering is prudent when feasible [^113hfo6F] [^112b3t6v] [^114P2JYw] [^111xHqpt] [^112kqSUA] [^116TUYpB].

> Turning to metabolic adverse effects, I need to ensure I differentiate prevention from treatment. Lifestyle counseling and weight-management programs are first-line; when risk is high or emerging with clozapine or olanzapine, co-prescribing metformin is recommended by recent consensus, with extension to medium-risk agents in youth or those with cardiometabolic risk. But wait, let me reconsider: I should avoid suggesting metformin is a universal solution — guidelines frame it as targeted prevention or mitigation, alongside consideration of switching to a lower-risk antipsychotic if clinically safe. Mechanistic reviews reinforce why vigilance is necessary across metabolic organs even when weight gain appears modest initially [^111u4Cf5] [^111mMxBF] [^1146EHFC] [^112dL4bR] [^113XgCpt].

> For prolactin-related effects, I should confirm the strength of evidence for interventions. Symptomatic hyperprolactinemia can present with galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and low bone density risk over time; switching to prolactin-sparing agents (e.g., aripiprazole, quetiapine) is a common strategy, although VA/DoD highlights insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific pharmacologic treatments broadly. Low-credibility endocrine sources describe cautious use of dopamine agonists if switching is not possible, but I should flag this as specialist-guided due to psychosis risk. I will emphasize symptom-driven monitoring and shared decision-making regarding risks and benefits [^1149n55G] [^117CXxzL] [^114S5X9C] [^115c7tx6].

> Cardiovascular safety requires careful screening and drug–drug interaction review; let me verify the QTc considerations. QT prolongation can precipitate torsades de pointes, with risk heightened by certain antipsychotics, higher doses, co-prescribed QT-prolonging drugs, and electrolyte abnormalities. Practical steps include ECGs when using higher-risk agents or combinations, correcting hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia, and avoiding polypharmacy that stacks risk. I almost said ziprasidone is "low metabolic and safe", but wait, that would be imprecise — its lower weight gain profile trades off with QT liability, and that nuance must be explicit [^111XLFrV] [^113AVg23] [^117Gq6AG].

> I should also address sedation, anticholinergic, sexual, and oral effects. Sedation is common and functionally impairing; management includes dose timing, slow titration, or switching to less sedating agents if daytime performance is compromised. Anticholinergic adverse effects warrant minimizing antimuscarinics and avoiding prophylactic anticholinergic use, reserving them for EPS as needed. Sexual dysfunction is frequent and multifactorial; options include addressing prolactin, dose reduction, switching to more favorable agents, and ruling out other causes. Xerostomia and other oral health impacts are common and merit counseling on hydration, saliva substitutes, and dental care. I should double-check that I do not imply uniform class effects — these vary by receptor profile and dose [^114Trqvj] [^113jJpqe] [^114QE5C7] [^112T3bjC] [^113XgCpt].

> Finally, I need to consider switching, dose reduction, and discontinuation, and I should verify the risk of withdrawal phenomena. Switching must be planned to mitigate withdrawal-emergent syndromes such as cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, activation, and emergent dyskinesias; cross-tapers tailored to receptor-binding differences help. Dose reduction can lessen dose-related side effects, but Cochrane reviews underscore uncertainty about how best to reduce doses without elevating relapse risk; individualized, slow reductions with close monitoring are prudent. After discontinuation, adverse events can occur, reinforcing the need for careful tapering. In dementia, guidelines recommend attempting taper/discontinuation within months if symptoms permit, with explicit review of risks, benefits, and preferences. I need to ensure I make clear that relapse prevention remains paramount when planning any change [^116qmwvK] [^115sw5hH] [^117WMmjj] [^115kXXHY] [^11591Kxi] [^113ASkMS] [^1113WtHS] [^1117pew8] [^113hWHC8].

> Stepping back, I should reiterate the practical take-home: antipsychotics differ more in side effects than efficacy, so selecting and adjusting therapy hinges on aligning an individual patient's risk profile and priorities with each drug's liabilities, while implementing proactive monitoring and mitigation. If I had implied a one-size-fits-all hierarchy, that would have been a mistake — trade-offs are the rule, and shared decision-making plus vigilant follow-up are essential to balance benefit and harm over time [^116Go8Yw] [^115c7tx6] [^112ocfn7] [^111u4Cf5].

Antipsychotics [^112dL4bR] commonly cause **metabolic side effects** (weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes) [^116Go8Yw] and **extrapyramidal symptoms** (parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) [^111XS5dZ]. Other common effects include sedation [^113AVg23]; anticholinergic symptoms (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision) [^112T3bjC]; hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, sexual dysfunction) [^114S5X9C]; cardiovascular effects (QT prolongation, orthostatic hypotension) [^111XLFrV]; and sexual dysfunction [^114QE5C7]. Overall, **risk varies by agent**: clozapine and olanzapine carry higher metabolic risk, whereas haloperidol carries a higher EPS risk [^112dL4bR] [^11522qag] [^111XS5dZ] [^112ocfn7]. Regular monitoring and individualized management are essential to minimize adverse effects and improve adherence.

---

## Metabolic side effects

Metabolic disturbances are among the most **clinically significant adverse effects** of antipsychotics, especially second-generation agents (SGAs) [^114LVWo1]. They include significant weight gain — most pronounced with clozapine and olanzapine [^115Cmnsi] and to a lesser extent with risperidone and quetiapine [^112dL4bR] — dyslipidemia with elevated triglycerides and cholesterol that increase cardiovascular risk [^116Go8Yw], and hyperglycemia and diabetes due to insulin resistance, with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially with SGAs [^111eyYnZ].

---

## Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)

EPS are **movement disorders** commonly associated with antipsychotics, especially first-generation agents (FGAs) [^11522qag]. These include:

- **Parkinsonism**: Characterized by tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia [^11522qag].

- **Dystonia**: Involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal postures [^111XS5dZ].

- **Akathisia**: A subjective feeling of restlessness and an inability to sit still [^114P2JYw].

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: A potentially irreversible condition characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, particularly of the face and tongue [^112kqSUA].

---

## Sedation and cognitive impairment

Sedation is a common side effect, particularly with agents that have **antihistaminergic** properties [^113AVg23], and can significantly impair daily functioning, cognitive performance, and overall quality of life [^114Trqvj].

---

## Anticholinergic side effects

Antipsychotics with **anticholinergic properties** can cause:

- **Dry mouth**: Xerostomia is a common complaint among patients [^112T3bjC].

- **Constipation**: A frequent and sometimes severe side effect [^117Gq6AG].

- **Blurred vision**: Due to impaired accommodation [^113XgCpt].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Particularly in elderly patients [^117Gq6AG].

---

## Hyperprolactinemia

Hyperprolactinemia — elevated **prolactin levels** — is a common side effect, particularly with FGAs and certain SGAs (e.g. risperidone) [^117CXxzL]. Clinical consequences include galactorrhea, gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility) [^114S5X9C] [^114QE5C7].

---

## Cardiovascular side effects

Antipsychotics are associated with several **cardiovascular side effects**, including QT prolongation [^113AVg23] with increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death [^111XLFrV], orthostatic hypotension with dizziness and fainting upon standing, and tachycardia.

---

## Sexual dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction is common and often underreported, including decreased libido, **erectile dysfunction**, delayed ejaculation, and **anorgasmia** [^114s5hmu] [^114S5X9C] [^114QE5C7].

---

## Summary of common side effects by antipsychotic class

| **Side effect** | **First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs)** | **Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs)** |
|-|-|-|
| Metabolic syndrome | Low | High (especially clozapine, olanzapine) |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms | High | Lower |
| Sedation | Moderate | High (especially quetiapine, olanzapine) |
| Anticholinergic effects | Moderate | Moderate |
| Hyperprolactinemia | High | Moderate (high with risperidone) |
| Cardiovascular effects | Moderate | Moderate |
| Sexual dysfunction | High | Moderate |

---

## Clinical management of side effects

Effective management of **antipsychotic side effects** includes:

- **Regular monitoring**: Weight, glucose, lipids, prolactin levels, and cardiovascular parameters [^112ocfn7].

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose or switching to another antipsychotic with a more favorable side effect profile [^112ocfn7] [^115c7tx6].

- **Adjunctive medications**: Use of anticholinergic medications for EPS, beta-blockers for akathisia [^114P2JYw], and metformin for metabolic side effects [^111mMxBF].

- **Patient education**: Informing patients about potential side effects and encouraging adherence to treatment and monitoring protocols [^114xHQ2s].

---

Antipsychotics are associated with a range of side effects — metabolic disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, anticholinergic effects, hyperprolactinemia, cardiovascular effects, and sexual dysfunction. The **risk and severity of these side effects vary** by specific medication and patient characteristics [^113o7wJc].

### Movement disorders associated with neuroleptic treatment [^111XS5dZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic-induced movement disorders, or extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), can be classified into acute and tardive syndromes. Among the former are parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia. Conventional neuroleptics, traditionally used to treat psychiatric disorders, are often associated with EPS. The newer atypical antipsychotics provide a more promising treatment strategy for psychiatric disorders and have a lower potential for producing EPS than conventional neuroleptics.

### Prolactin-related and metabolic adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic agents [^114S5X9C]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

While there are many effective antipsychotics available to clinicians for treating schizophrenia or bipolar mania, the onset of antipsychotic-associated prolactin-related and metabolic adverse effects can diminish the effectiveness of treatment. Increased levels of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) associated with some antipsychotics raise the risk of sexual side effects. The increased appetite and/or sedation (reduced activity levels) induced by other antipsychotics can lead to weight gain, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure and, if unchecked, ultimately to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Clinicians should take steps to help their patients avoid unnecessary risks associated with antipsychotic use.

These steps include monitoring risk factors for developing these illnesses by taking careful patient histories and baseline measurements of patients' weight and blood chemistry. Patients should be made aware of potential metabolic and prolactin-related side effects. Periodic checks should also be made to watch for changes in weight, body mass index, waist size, blood pressure, fasting glucose, or lipid levels that could be harmful and may increase risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Cardiovascular effects of antipsychotics used in bipolar illness [^111XLFrV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Many antipsychotics are used to treat disorders other than schizophrenia, such as bipolar disorder. However, some of these agents are associated with cardiovascular side effects that can have serious or fatal implications for the patient. One dangerous side effect is QT prolongation, which can lead to torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmia. The group of drugs labeled as antipsychotics is diverse, making it challenging for the clinician to keep track of which agents cause which effects. It is important for the clinician to learn to identify signs of cardiovascular side effects and manage those events when they occur.

### Metabolic effects of atypical antipsychotics: Molecular targets [^112dL4bR]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental diseases with psychotic traits. Although the use of AAPs is associated with beneficial effects in these patients, they are also associated with undesired metabolic side effects, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is defined by the presence of metabolic abnormalities, such as large waist circumference, dyslipidemia, fasting hyperglycemia, and elevated blood pressure, which predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease.

In this review, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these undesired metabolic abnormalities induced by AAPs are described. These mechanisms are complex, as AAPs have multiple cellular targets that significantly affect the activities of several hormones and neuromodulators. Additionally, AAPs affect all the relevant metabolic organs, namely the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, intestine, and both the central and peripheral nervous systems.

A better understanding of the molecular targets linking AAPs with MetS and of the mechanisms responsible for the clinically different side effects of distinct AAPs is needed. This knowledge will help in the development of novel AAPs with fewer adverse effects, as well as in the development of adjuvant therapies for patients receiving AAPs.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113o7wJc]. The Lancet. Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, up to 17% of adults are prescribed antidepressants, and up to 2% are prescribed antipsychotics. Rates of prescribing these medications are increasing year by year. Although antipsychotics and antidepressants are effective treatments in some patients, approximately 75% of patients experience side-effects. These side-effects are diverse and can impair quality of life and functioning, contribute to morbidity and mortality rates, create stigma, and result in poor medication concordance, thus increasing the risk of relapse of psychiatric illness.

Indeed, side-effects are factors that people with depression and schizophrenia primarily consider when making prescription decisions, and concerns about side-effects represent a barrier to the treatment of mental illness. National and professional bodies recommend that discussions of side-effects are central to antipsychotic and antidepressant prescribing decisions. However, simultaneously considering the relative side-effect profile for every available antidepressant and antipsychotic is a complex, multidimensional process.

For example, a discussion regarding which of 20 antidepressants to select based on the relative risk of ten side-effects involves 1,900 pairwise comparisons; spending 10 seconds considering each comparison would require more than 5 hours of discussion. This process is further complicated by the fact that the avoidance of some side-effects will be important to one patient but not to another, meaning that at an individual level, greater consideration needs to be given to avoiding specific side-effects.

### Receptor-binding profiles of antipsychotics: Clinical strategies when switching between agents [^116qmwvK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Despite apparent improvements in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, many patients still demonstrate an incomplete therapeutic response to antipsychotic medication and/or experience intolerable adverse effects, necessitating a change in their medication regimen. Switching from one antipsychotic to another, however, presents challenges and can be complicated by withdrawal-emergent adverse effects that prompt the patient or clinician to abort the switch.

The extent to which these adverse events can be predicted by comparing the effects of the old and new antipsychotic medications on various receptor systems, including dopaminergic, muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors, is of considerable clinical and research interest. For example, patients receiving a sedating antipsychotic with high affinity for histamine H(1) receptors could experience rebound insomnia if switched to a less sedating agent with a low affinity for H(1) receptors.

An understanding of the differential receptor-binding profiles of the various antipsychotics can help clinicians anticipate and manage potential clinical issues that may be encountered when switching antipsychotic therapy.

### Haloperidol [^116TUYpB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**:

	- **CNS effects**: Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during the administration of haloperidol have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. EPS can be categorized generally as Parkinson-like symptoms, akathisia, or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride USP. It should be noted that persistent EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases.

	- **Withdrawal emergent neurological signs**: Generally, patients receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with the abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain cases, the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under "Tardive Dyskinesia" except for the duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs, but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol.

	- **Tardive dyskinesia**: As with all antipsychotic agents, haloperidol has been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements.

### The effects of atypical antipsychotic medications on psychosocial outcomes [^112yWCjD]. Schizophrenia Research (2003). Low credibility.

This review examines the question, "Do atypical antipsychotic medications improve psychosocial outcomes?" by examining studies that compared the effects of atypicals to conventional antipsychotics or to other atypical medications. The authors reviewed randomized clinical trials of atypical antipsychotic medication that included psychosocial variables as outcomes.

Findings from 31 published studies on more than 12,000 individuals generally showed that atypical medications led to significant improvements in negative symptoms compared to conventional antipsychotics. Effects on the global assessment of psychosocial functioning and on the quality of life were mixed, with only about half the studies reporting significant improvements. Olanzapine yielded the best results on psychosocial functioning; remoxipride was found to yield few significant changes on these variables.

This review provides evidence that some atypical antipsychotics may have direct effects on some of the psychosocial disabilities that result from serious mental illness.

### Switching antipsychotic therapy: What to expect and clinical strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes [^115sw5hH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission, or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to his or her physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications except in the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the "withdrawal triad", comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.

### Movement disorders associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs [^1133GxDo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Data from clinical trials reviewed in this article fulfill predictions based on preclinical findings that atypical antipsychotic drugs are associated with a reduced potential for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and other movement disorders. Atypical drugs have been shown to reduce all subtypes of acute EPS, the frequency of EPS-related patient dropouts, and the need for concomitant antiparkinsonian drug use. Clozapine remains superior to other atypicals in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Atypicals may be selectively advantageous in treating schizophrenic patients with a predisposition to catatonia. Although the risk of developing lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be diminished with atypical drugs, clinicians must remain alert to the signs of this disorder. Atypicals have reduced liability for inducing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and show antidyskinetic properties in patients with preexisting TD. Passive resolution of TD may be facilitated in some patients by the use of these agents. Thus, the risk of movement disorders has become only one of several considerations in choosing among antipsychotic drugs.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^113hWHC8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, particularly concerning antipsychotics, tapering, and discontinuation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the possible tapering of the antipsychotic with the patient (if clinically feasible) and with the patient's surrogate decision-maker (if relevant). Input from family or others involved with the patient is advised in case of a positive response to treatment. It is essential to elicit their preferences and concerns while reviewing the initial goals, observed benefits, and side effects of antipsychotic treatment. Furthermore, consider the potential risks of continued exposure to antipsychotics, as well as past experiences with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### Antipsychotic dosing: How much but also how often [^111bg3Na]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Considerable focus has been devoted to how much antipsychotic is appropriate for optimal clinical response, although how often antipsychotics need to be administered is also less than clear. Clinicians are aware of the increased risk of relapse related to antipsychotic nonadherence/discontinuation, and practice dictates continuous antipsychotic exposure with the goal of achieving steady state levels to maintain effectiveness and prevent relapse. Does this mean we need to (or should) administer antipsychotics at least daily? There is a body of evidence challenging this long-established clinical axiom.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia [^111xHqpt]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, particularly concerning the management of drug side effects, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend considering a trial of a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia associated with antipsychotic medications.

---

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia [^111u4Cf5]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, specifically in the context of managing drug side effects, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend considering dietary interventions, exercise, individual lifestyle counseling, and/or psychoeducation for the management of metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medications. Additionally, they suggest providing weight management services based on a chronic care model, such as the Enhancing Quality of Care in Psychosis program.

### "First do no harm". A systematic review of the prevalence and management of antipsychotic adverse effects [^114xHQ2s]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

We aim to identify the prevalence and management strategies of nine clinically important categories of antipsychotic adverse effects: extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, weight gain, type II diabetes, hyperprolactinaemia, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemia, sexual dysfunction, and cardiovascular effects.

Antipsychotic drugs are widely prescribed for schizophrenia and other mental disorders. The adverse effects of antipsychotics are common and have a potential negative impact on adherence and engagement. Despite this, the scientific study of the prevalence or management of these adverse effects is a neglected area.

A systematic review was undertaken using pre-defined search criteria across three databases, along with hand searching of citations and references. Inclusion was agreed upon by two independent researchers after reviewing the abstracts or full text. Quality analysis of included studies was conducted using pre-agreed criteria.

In total, 53 studies met the inclusion criteria, revealing the following:

- **Antipsychotic polypharmacy**: Associated with increased frequency of adverse effects.
- **Duration of treatment**: A longer duration is associated with greater severity, such as higher BMI.
- **Metabolic disturbance**: Clozapine was more strongly associated with metabolic disturbance than other antipsychotics in three studies. Olanzapine was associated with the most weight gain in three studies.
- **Hyperprolactinaemia**: More common in women than men, but 50% of men noted sexual dysfunction versus 25–50% in women.

Despite clinical guideline recommendations, there is still much to be improved in managing these adverse effects adequately.

### Olanzapine [^115Cmnsi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine.

The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing healthcare provider with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied.

- **Incidence of adverse reactions in short-term, placebo-controlled and combination trials**: The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^114LVWo1]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

To our knowledge, we have compiled the most comprehensive side-effect databases for antipsychotics and antidepressants, incorporating meta-analytic data for more than 65,000 people and a synthesis of seven national or international guidelines for 69 drugs. Furthermore, for the first time to our knowledge, meta-analytic data were complemented by imputed results based on ordinal ranking scores, providing a compromise between the superior accuracy of meta-analytic results and broader drug coverage of guidelines.

Although the databases could be used in isolation to inform prescribing decisions, clinicians face the challenge of simultaneously considering multiple side-effects for multiple drugs while also incorporating individual patient concerns. Our umbrella review highlighted the dilemma that often confronts clinicians and patients when making prescription decisions, whereby avoidance of one group of side-effects increases the risk of others. For example, with antipsychotics, choosing drugs with relatively low risk of weight gain and sedation results in the use of drugs with relatively high risk of movement side-effects and hyperprolactinaemia. The Psymatik Treatment Optimizer aids in these challenges by facilitating evidence-based, personalised, and comprehensive antipsychotic and antidepressant prescribing decisions based on drug–side-effect profiles.

Although an online tool exists that uses a traffic light system to rank medications based on anticholinergic side-effects, to our knowledge, the Psymatik Treatment Optimizer addresses broader concerns in prescribing decisions.

### A single-blind, randomized trial comparing quetiapine and haloperidol in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia [^114H95Vp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

While atypical antipsychotics should ultimately reduce the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia, it is likely to remain a significant clinical problem for a long time. No strategy has clearly emerged as the treatment of choice for tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotics have reduced propensities for producing acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and possibly tardive dyskinesia, and may be effective in treating patients with established tardive dyskinesia.

- **Method**: This 12-month, randomized, investigator-blinded study compared the efficacy of quetiapine (N = 22) and haloperidol (N = 23) in treating patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and established tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia was assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) dyskinesia subscale scores and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) dyskinesia scores. Other EPS, weight, serum prolactin level, and glycosylated hemoglobin level were also assessed. Subjects were enrolled in the study between April 2000 and March 2002.

- **Results**: Mean endpoint doses were 400 mg/day of quetiapine and 8.5 mg/day of haloperidol. Compared with the haloperidol group, the quetiapine group showed significantly greater improvements in ESRS dyskinesia at 6 and 9 months [p or = 50% symptom reduction) was greater with quetiapine than haloperidol: 64% [9/14] and 37% [6/16] at 6 months; 55% [6/11] and 28% [4/14] at 12 months. Other EPS decreased significantly with quetiapine.

### Intermittent drug techniques for schizophrenia [^116ES7bQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medication is considered the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and is generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling positive symptoms. However, long-term antipsychotic exposure has been associated with a range of adverse effects, including extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, and death. Intermittent drug techniques refer to the use of medication only during periods of incipient relapse or symptom exacerbation, rather than continuously. The aim is to reduce the risk of typical adverse effects of antipsychotics by reducing long-term medication exposure for patients who are receiving maintenance treatment while limiting the risk of relapse, with a further goal of improving social functioning resulting from the reduction of antipsychotic-induced side effects.

- **Objectives**: To review the effects of different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2012) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching relevant intermittent drug treatment articles, and manually searching reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance therapy for people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were relapse and hospitalization.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors selected trials, assessing outcomes related to relapse and hospitalization.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113EEkGc]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Both meta-analytic and ordinal outcomes were normalized (minimum–maximum scaled) to provide values between 0 and 1. These normalized scores were used as proxy effect sizes. When there was more than one meta-analysis for a given side-effect, we selected the meta-analysis examining the largest number of drugs, thus excluding meta-analyses with sample overlap. When there were multiple guidelines ranking drugs for the same side-effect, a mean of normalized scores was calculated.

We imputed missing effect sizes for drug–side-effect pairs on the basis of ordinal ranking scores as follows. When there were ten or more of each type of data point (≥ 10 meta-analytic effect sizes and ≥ 10 ordinal ranking scores) for the same drug–side-effect pair, linear regression was used to define the relationship between ordinal ranking scores (the predictor or independent variable) and meta-analytic effect sizes (the predicted or dependent variable) for the given side-effect. This model was then used to predict missing meta-analytic effect sizes for other drugs on the basis of available ranking scores. If there were fewer than ten overlapping data points and imputation was not possible, ordinal scores were extracted. If multiple meta-analyses had examined the same side-effect for the same number of drugs, we selected the meta-analysis with the largest regression model coefficient of determination.

The validity of some side-effect network meta-analysis results has been questioned, with the inclusion of small outlier studies being blamed. Therefore, we excluded meta-analytic effect sizes and used imputed data based on the described methods.

### Quality improvement in resident education: A pilot project to mitigate metabolic side effects from atypical antipsychotic medications in youth [^115xvNeB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals treated with atypical antipsychotic medications during critical periods of development may experience long-lasting negative health effects. Some children remain on antipsychotic medications for extended periods, thus increasing exposure to these medications during crucial developmental phases. As children, those who are overweight have increased rates of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Another study reported children who are overweight have increased rates of carotid intimal media thickening, which is a risk factor for cerebrovascular accidents.

In addition to having negative health outcomes as children, Juonala et al. (2005) revealed obesity, high LDL, and low HDL in children are associated with decreased carotid artery elasticity in adulthood; decreased carotid artery elasticity is also a risk factor for cerebrovascular accidents. A prospective cohort study of 2,195 children followed for 21 years in Finland demonstrated childhood obesity, high triglycerides, high insulin, and high CRP are risk factors for adult metabolic syndrome.

It is important for residents to feel empowered to undertake quality improvement (QI) endeavors, such as improving side effect monitoring of medications to enhance the clinical care provided to their patients. Quality improvement was included as a required core competency in systems-based care education by the United States Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in July 2011; however, there is little guidance on how best to integrate these ACGME guidelines with current educational practices.

### Addressing side effects from antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia [^114vdAfT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia is associated with an array of adverse events, many of which are difficult for patients to tolerate and promote nonadherence to treatment. Serious adverse events include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), hyperprolactinemia, weight gain leading to metabolic syndrome, sedation, cognitive deficits, and hypotension. Clinicians need to be aware of each antipsychotic's propensity to cause these adverse events as well as strategies for avoiding or minimizing the occurrence of adverse events.

### Sexual side effects of novel antipsychotic medications [^114s5hmu]. Schizophrenia Research (2002). Low credibility.

The novel antipsychotic medications offer a more favorable extrapyramidal side effect profile than conventional agents. However, it is uncertain whether these novel antipsychotics provide any benefit regarding sexual side effects.

- **Methods**: We prospectively administered a survey of sexual functioning to 25 male patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia, who were taking either conventional or novel antipsychotics. Contrasts were made between three treatment groups: clozapine (CLOZ), risperidone (RIS), and a combined haloperidol/fluphenazine (HAL/FLU) group.

- **Results**: A decrease in overall sexual functioning was reported in all medication groups (40–71%). The majority of subjects taking RIS or HAL/FLU reported a decline in one or more aspects of sexual functioning. Examining specific aspects of sexual functioning revealed that a decline in sexual interest was significantly less common on CLOZ compared to RIS (0% vs. 64%; chi(2) = 6.1, df = 1, p = 0.01) or HAL/FLU (0% vs. 67%; chi(2) = 5.2, df = 1, p = 0.02). In contrast, a decline in erectile frequency was significantly more common on RIS compared to CLOZ (40% vs. 93%; chi(2) = 6.2, df = 1, p = 0.01) or HAL/FLU (50% vs. 93%; chi(2) = 4.8, df = 1, p = 0.03). Regarding enjoyment of orgasm and ejaculatory volume, significantly fewer CLOZ compared to RIS subjects reported a decline (20% vs. 86%; chi(2) = 7.4, df = 1, p = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Sexual side effects are common clinically pertinent adverse effects associated with both novel and conventional antipsychotic medications. They deserve increased attention in clinical work and future research with emerging antipsychotic drugs.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia [^115tVjP6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. Reasons for the preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concurrent sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. In addition, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves. Here, we review the pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific, well-defined populations.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^1152Rib7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, specifically in the initiation of antipsychotic therapy, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend using high-dose or combined antipsychotic medication regimens for treatment-refractory schizophrenia as a limited therapeutic trial. This should be done with close monitoring of side effects and therapeutic response. High doses should be continued beyond 3 months only if there is a clear clinical benefit that outweighs the risks.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, specifically in the context of managing drug side effects, the APA 2020 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with schizophrenia experiencing parkinsonism due to antipsychotic therapy:

- **Lowering the dosage**: Reduce the dosage of the antipsychotic medication.
- **Switching medications**: Change to a different antipsychotic medication.
- **Anticholinergic treatment**: Treat with an anticholinergic medication.

### The psychological consequences of the sedating side effects of antipsychotic medication: A systematic review [^114Trqvj]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Low credibility.

Sedation is a common side effect of antipsychotic medication. It is poorly defined but is generally understood to encompass excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and oversleeping. Sedation is often cited as impacting functioning and wellbeing; however, no review at the time of writing has assessed this relationship.

- **Aims of review**: This review aims to explore the impact of the sedating side effects of antipsychotic medication on patient functioning and wellbeing.

- **Methods**: Papers were identified by searching the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, EBSCO, CINAHL, and Clarivate Web of Science. A narrative synthesis and quality appraisal were conducted.

- **Results**: Eleven peer-reviewed papers met the eligibility criteria. Sedation was often identified as the most common side effect but was not uniformly defined. Results consistently supported a negative effect of sedation on functioning (e.g. ability to perform day-to-day tasks and motivation). With respect to wellbeing, a negative impact of sedation was identified on quality of life and anhedonia, but less consistent interactions were found with other domains (e.g. anxiety), with few papers reporting on these links.

- **Conclusion**: Despite the plausible impact of sedation on patients being widely discussed, there is surprisingly little empirical research in this area. The research that exists broadly supports a negative impact of sedation on functioning and wellbeing, although there are some complexities requiring further investigation, and many domains (e.g. interaction with mood) have not been substantively investigated.

### Adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^117Gq6AG]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Use of antipsychotic medications involves a challenging trade-off between the benefit of alleviating psychotic symptoms and the risk of troubling, sometimes life-shortening adverse effects. There is more variability among specific antipsychotic medications than there is between the first- and second-generation antipsychotic classes.

The newer second-generation antipsychotics, especially clozapine and olanzapine, generally tend to cause more problems relating to metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Also, as a class, the older first-generation antipsychotics are more likely to be associated with movement disorders. This is primarily true of medications that bind tightly to dopaminergic neuroreceptors, such as haloperidol, and less true of medications that bind weakly, such as chlorpromazine. Anticholinergic effects are especially prominent with weaker-binding first-generation antipsychotics, as well as with the second-generation antipsychotic clozapine.

All antipsychotic medications are associated with an increased likelihood of sedation, sexual dysfunction, postural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. Primary care physicians should understand the individual adverse effect profiles of these medications. They should be vigilant for the occurrence of adverse effects, be willing to adjust or change medications as needed (or work with psychiatric colleagues to do so), and be prepared to treat any resulting medical sequelae.

### Antipsychotic drugs and extrapyramidal side effects in first episode psychosis: A systematic review of head-head comparisons [^11522qag]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). High credibility.

This systematic review aimed to determine whether the risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) differed between antipsychotic drugs used in first episode psychosis (FEP). We identified 11 RCTs comparing two or more antipsychotics in FEP and reporting on EPS. All trials assessed one or more second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), one assessed chlorpromazine, one zuclopenthixol, and seven trials assessed haloperidol. Assessment and reporting of EPS varied. Compared with one or more SGA comparators, haloperidol was associated with significantly higher rates/severity of parkinsonism (seven trials), akathisia (six trials), and greater use of anticholinergics (five trials) and beta-blockers (two trials). Two trials with low-dose haloperidol (≤ 4 mg) showed significantly worse EPS outcomes versus a SGA.

- **Long-term trials**: Two of four long-term haloperidol trials (≥ 1 year) found a higher dyskinesia risk with haloperidol versus olanzapine and risperidone respectively; the remaining two trials found no difference with various SGA comparators.

- **Comparisons between medications**: There was an EPS advantage for clozapine versus chlorpromazine (one trial) and risperidone versus zuclopenthixol (one trial).

There was little evidence of EPS differences between SGAs, possibly reflecting the use of low doses. We conclude that SGAs offer an EPS advantage over FGAs in FEP, though the evidence largely relates to comparisons with haloperidol. Standardized assessment and reporting of EPS would assist future research.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 32 oral antipsychotics for the acute treatment of adults with multi-episode schizophrenia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Go8Yw]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Because so many antipsychotic options are available, our results should help health-care providers find the most suitable drug for the individual patient, balancing side-effect profiles and the efficacy of different drugs. We confirm that antipsychotics differ more in their side-effects than in their efficacy. We believe that efficacy differences between compounds exist, but the fact that their measurement is based on subjective rating scales is problematic. The development of objective efficacy measures would render interpretation easier. Clinicians must remember that reported results are averages and that response and side effects might vary considerably in individual patients.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^117WMmjj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose‐related side effects that can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, although higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It remains unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely to minimize the adverse-effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic dose compared to continuing the dose for people with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a systematic search on 10 February 2021 at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilized on their antipsychotic treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important changes in quality of life, rehospitalizations, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

### Brain deficit patterns of metabolic illnesses overlap with those for major depressive disorder: A new metric of brain metabolic disease [^113AmSaG]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Low credibility.

The higher rates of metabolic syndrome (MET) in patients with mental illnesses raise concerns regarding potential side effects of long-term use of psychiatric medications. Antipsychotics, in particular, may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Specifically, individuals taking second-generation antipsychotics are at an increased risk for developing diabetes compared to those taking first-generation antipsychotics. Antipsychotic use in adolescent and young adult patients with schizophrenia has been linked with higher overall MET rates.

Similarly, a study reported that long-term antidepressant use was associated with higher rates of diabetes. The dose and duration of antidepressant use were significantly correlated with total cholesterol, including both LDL and HDL levels, in adults. Another study found a positive correlation between the cumulative dose of antidepressants and hypertension. Conversely, the combined use of antidepressants and antihypertensive drugs resulted in better blood pressure control in a 24-week trial compared to using only antihypertensive drugs, particularly in older populations.

Overall, there is strong evidence that long-term use of antipsychotics is associated with risks for MET; however, the links between the use of antidepressants and MET are more tenuous.

### Safety and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder: Prevalence, monitoring and management [^112yUEVY]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are associated with fewer movement disorders and a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than conventional antipsychotics, but they are not without side effects. Metabolic side effects associated with some of the atypical antipsychotics are a concern for both clinicians and patients. Adverse events related to central nervous system effects, weight gain, and alterations in glucose, lipid, and prolactin levels in patients with depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders have been reported. Balancing the significant benefits of treatment with these agents against the potential risks of metabolic disturbances and other adverse effects is crucial. Emerging data are making it possible to determine the risk-benefit analysis for specific atypical antipsychotics in individual patients and allow for targeted selection of treatment. A new concept of effectiveness is emerging that attempts to balance adverse effects of treatment with patient quality of life.

Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should have their weight, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids monitored on a regular basis. Monitoring of prolactin levels is not suggested; however, a baseline measurement before initiating treatment can be useful, with subsequent assessment only if a patient demonstrates symptoms. Prevention of weight gain is important. Diet and exercise should be considered for prevention and management, with the use of pharmacologic strategies approached with caution in patients with mood disorders.

### American diabetes association postgraduate meetings — 2011 [^111eyYnZ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Henderson characterized tardive dyskinesia, the major side effect of the first-generation antipsychotic agents, as being quite uncomfortable but not associated with increased mortality, while there is concern that SGA agents' side effects may, in fact, increase mortality. The diagnosis of schizophrenia itself appears to be associated with visceral adiposity, and nearly half of schizophrenic patients have metabolic syndrome, making this a high-risk group for such adverse drug effects. Similar evidence of adverse metabolic effects of SGA has been found in children and adolescents. There is extensive evidence that SGA agents, particularly clozapine and olanzapine, and to a lesser extent risperidone and quetiapine, are associated with an increased likelihood of diabetes and progressive weight gain, although ziprasidone and fluphenazine appear to be weight neutral. Furthermore, clozapine and olanzapine are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity compared to risperidone, even in the absence of obesity.

There has been interest in using medications to cause weight loss, including the antidepressants bupropion, fluoxetine, and sertraline; the antiepileptic topiramate, although its association with cognitive impairment limits its use; and zonisamide, metformin, and chromium. A study of patients with new-onset schizophrenia receiving olanzapine showed that adding metformin attenuated weight gain, although with some gastrointestinal side effects, but "the best data", Henderson stated, "has been switching the patient off the offending agent", with diabetes sometimes res.

### Making sense of the literature on antipsychotics and long-term functioning: Taking natural history and personalization seriously [^112KLgRm]. Psychological Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotics in randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Antipsychotics are generally effective in the short-term management of psychosis, improving not only symptom control but also quality of life and functioning. A comprehensive analysis by Leucht et al. of 167 RCTs conducted over 60 years reported a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.45 for positive symptoms (typically regarded as a medium-sized effect), with SMDs of 0.35 for quality of life and 0.34 for functioning (conventionally, small-sized effects), confirming moderate benefits in these domains.

For maintenance treatment, antipsychotics have shown similar efficacy, particularly in preventing relapse within the first year of treatment. A Cochrane review and meta-analysis by Ceraso et al. involving 75 RCTs found that antipsychotic medications significantly reduced relapse rates (24% vs. 61% for placebo, 30 RCTs, RR = 0.38) and hospitalizations (7% vs. 18% for placebo, 21 RCTs, RR = 0.43). These drugs also modestly improved quality of life (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI = -0.57 to -0.07) and social functioning (SMD = -0.43, 95% CI = -0.53 to -0.34).

However, these benefits come with a substantial risk of adverse effects, which can negatively impact functioning for some patients. Common side effects include sedation, akathisia, anticholinergic effects, and weight gain. Ceraso et al. reported higher incidences of movement disorders (14% vs. 8% for placebo), sedation (8% vs. 5%), and weight gain (9% vs. 6%) in maintenance studies.

The neuroleptic effect of chlorpromazine was initially…

### Clinicians' recognition of the metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^111yk7D7]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

There is a growing concern regarding the propensity of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) to induce weight gain and metabolic adverse effects. Recent consensus guidelines have recommended assessment and monitoring procedures to appropriately detect and manage these adverse effects. This study addresses the appreciation and readiness of clinicians to implement management guidelines for these adverse effects. Respondents indicated awareness of the risks of treatment with SGAs. The extent of monitoring for metabolic adverse effects was low and inconsistent across measures and in frequency of evaluation. Ongoing efforts are needed to support and encourage change in clinician practice.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, especially concerning the management of drug side effects, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend against the prophylactic prescription of antimuscarinic agents with antipsychotic medications. The need for antimuscarinic agents should be determined on an individual basis for emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, such as parkinsonism and acute dystonia, considering the patient's history of extrapyramidal side effects and the risk of antimuscarinic side effects.

### Reducing the burden of side effects during long-term antipsychotic therapy: The role of "switching" medications [^117PmXJ5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

One of the great challenges of long-term treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders is minimizing the medical or psychological burden from persistent side effects. Because of the differences in side effect profiles between the newer and older antipsychotic medications, and distinct differences among the newer agents themselves, the spectrum of side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy has changed tremendously.

The authors review changing from one antipsychotic to another ("switching") as a potential treatment strategy for reducing the overall side effect burden of antipsychotic therapy. This review identifies six steps to the evaluation of switching antipsychotics because of side effects:

- **Establish a causal attribution**: Confirm that the clinical problem is an adverse effect of the antipsychotic medication.
- **Understand the course of the side effect**: Consider present and future risks for the individual patient receiving antipsychotic treatment.
- **Consider other interventions**: Evaluate potential risks and benefits of side effect interventions that do not require switching the antipsychotic.
- **Assess side effect profiles**: Be aware of the side effect profiles of other possible antipsychotics and the potential effectiveness of switching to another antipsychotic for the specific side effect.
- **Calculate side effect risks**: Evaluate the side effect risks of switching antipsychotics.
- **Calculate efficacy risks**: Assess the efficacy risks of switching antipsychotics.

The authors explain how to evaluate the specific side effect in the context of the medication and the overall management of the patient.

### Use of antipsychotic drugs in dermatology [^112gRF1e]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs can be beneficial in dermatology because of their effects on both the central nervous system and peripheral areas. All antipsychotic drugs block central postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors, which is the basis of their antipsychotic action. These drugs also have varying degrees of histamine H1-receptor, cholinergic muscarinic receptor, and α1-adrenergic receptor blocking effects. These effects can influence cutaneous perception and the autonomic reactivity of the skin, potentially benefitting the management of certain histamine or sympathetically mediated dermatologic manifestations such as urticaria, pruritus, and hyperhidrosis.

Beyond their antipsychotic action, antipsychotic drugs possess a general anxiolytic effect partly due to their α1-adrenergic receptor blocking action, which can be advantageous in many dermatologic conditions, including pruritus. They are most commonly used in dermatology for managing delusional disorder, somatic type, manifesting as delusional infestation, and as monotherapy or augmentation therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Additionally, they are utilized in the management of trichotillomania and skin-picking or excoriation disorder.

There is earlier literature on (1) the possible beneficial effects of phenothiazine antipsychotics in a wide range of pruritic dermatoses, and (2) the efficacy of pimozide as adjunctive therapy for metastatic melanoma. Both of these areas warrant further investigation.

### Improvement in cognition associated with novel antipsychotic drugs: A direct drug effect or reduction of EPS [^1177aDdt]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

The administration of novel versus classic antipsychotic agents to patients with psychosis is associated with moderately better scores on cognitive tests and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Improved motor functioning may enable better performance on some components of cognitive test batteries. Because the advantages of novel antipsychotics on cognitive performance are not very large, it can be difficult to discern if improvement in a given cognitive task is due to a direct effect of the novel antipsychotic drug, or secondary to the novel drug's decreased propensity to induce EPS. To distinguish between these possibilities, this study examined the ability of patients with schizophrenia receiving classic versus novel antipsychotics to perform a computerized visuo-motor test (VMT). The VMT assesses planning capabilities, attention, and executive functions known to be impaired in schizophrenia and suggested to be affected by novel antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: Seventy-six patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder receiving haloperidol (23 patients, mean dose 10.01 ± 6.1 mg/day), olanzapine (26 patients, mean dose 10.56 ± 4.9 mg/day), or risperidone (27 patients, mean dose 4.35 ± 1.7 mg/day) were assessed for EPS using the parkinsonian subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Subscale (ESRS) and with the VMT.

- **Results**: Cognitive functioning, as measured by the VMT, was better for patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine compared with those receiving haloperidol.

### Quality improvement in resident education: A pilot project to mitigate metabolic side effects from atypical antipsychotic medications in youth [^11538yPg]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

This resident physician-led quality improvement project aimed to enhance the health of youth prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications by increasing physician monitoring for metabolic side effects, while simultaneously educating trainees in quality improvement methodology. The "plan, do, study, act" quality improvement framework was utilized.

Baseline metabolic monitoring rates of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications in two psychiatry resident outpatient clinics were obtained. Rates were stratified based on time on medication (< 1 year, ≥ 1 year) and parameters monitored. Metabolic monitoring rates subsequent to targeted changes were obtained. Problem-solving with residents revealed barriers to monitoring, such as limited awareness of specific guideline recommendations and lack of convenient access to medical equipment, such as calibrated scales.

Residents received education about atypical antipsychotic monitoring guidelines and side effect treatment. Additionally, they were provided with calibrated scales, and atypical antipsychotic monitoring templates were introduced. Online surveys were conducted to determine self-reported baseline monitoring rates and comfort with guidelines following the targeted change. The baseline metabolic monitoring rates of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications were 9% (range: 0 to 17.6%) for youth in their first year taking an atypical antipsychotic medication and 58.9% (range: 29% to 100%) in subsequent years on medication. These relatively easy changes resulted in modest improvements in monitoring.

### Similarities and differences among antipsychotics [^111tPxt8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Most antipsychotic drugs act equivalently and potently on the symptoms of schizophrenia, with clozapine as the notable exception. Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are strongly associated with poor prognosis; some reports suggest that these symptoms respond better to second-generation antipsychotics than to first-generation ones. Although second-generation antipsychotics exert their action through a blockade of dopamine and serotonin receptors (and some have a more complex action), each has a different set of pharmacologic characteristics, including side effects.

Due to the differences among antipsychotics available today, optimizing treatment for individual patients requires choosing the most appropriate drug and, if necessary, switching to a different drug if the first proves unsatisfactory. The treating physician must carefully match the diverse needs of schizophrenic patients with the varied characteristics of the second-generation antipsychotics.

### Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168x2y8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). High credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and are known to reduce acute symptoms of the disorder. An original version of the review, published in 2012, examined whether antipsychotics are effective for relapse prevention compared to withdrawing these agents for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses based on evidence from randomized trials. The update of the review focuses on newly investigated outcomes: rates of remission and recovery, changes in social functioning, and quality of life. The updated review included 75 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from 1959 to 2017, involving 9,145 participants. Although some potential sources of bias limited the overall quality, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia was clear and robust to a series of sensitivity analyses.

- **Efficacy in preventing relapse and reducing hospitalization**: Antipsychotic drugs were more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at 1 year (drug 24% versus placebo 61%, 30 RCTs, n = 4,249, RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.45) and in reducing hospitalization (drug 7% versus placebo 18%, 21 RCTs, n = 3,558, RR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.57).

- **Quality of life and social functioning**: Quality of life appeared to be better in drug-treated participants (7 RCTs, n = 1,573, SMD = -0.32, 95% CI = -0.57 to -0.07); the same was true for social functioning (15 RCTs, n = 3,588, SMD = -0.43, 95% CI = -0.53 to -0.34).

Although based on data from fewer studies, maintenance treatment apparently increased the possibility of achieving remission of symptoms (drug 53%, placebo 31%; 7 RCTs, 867 participants; RR = 1.67, 95% CI not reported).

### Second-generation antipsychotic drugs and short-term mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials [^1113ija4]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Acutely occurring, life-threatening side effects of antipsychotic drugs might contribute to the reduced life expectancy observed in patients with severe mental disorders. We aimed to assess this hypothesis by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of deaths occurring in placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotic drugs.

- **Methods**: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomised controlled trials comparing second-generation antipsychotics with a placebo across several diagnostic categories. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP from inception (with the last search conducted on Jan 21, 2017) and contacted pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities for further eligible trials. We examined mortality from any cause (the primary outcome) and mortality from natural causes, suicide, and other non-natural causes. We synthesized the results with odds ratios (ORs) in a common-effects meta-analysis. We investigated the effects of age, diagnostic category, sex, study duration, antipsychotic drug used, drug dose, and polypharmacy in subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

- **Findings**: We identified 596 randomised controlled trials published between 1978 and 2017, comprising 108,747 participants. 352 studies (comprising 84,988 participants) with mortality data available constituted the main dataset for our meta-analysis. A total of 207 (0.4%) deaths were reported in 53,804 patients on an antipsychotic drug and 99 (0.3%) deaths in 31,184 patients in the placebo group.

### Neuropsychiatric disorders: The choice of antipsychotics in schizophrenia [^113hMy4U]. Nature Reviews. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

In light of claims of improved efficacy and a lower incidence of adverse effects compared with older drugs, second-generation antipsychotics have emerged as the predominant treatment for schizophrenia. A new meta-analysis concludes that the difference in efficacy between newer and older agents is small, and the classification scheme for antipsychotics does not survive close scrutiny.

### Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia [^115uXxBT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The relative effectiveness of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs compared to older agents has been incompletely addressed, although newer agents are currently used more commonly. We compared a first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, with several newer drugs in a double-blind study.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,493 patients with schizophrenia were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (7.5 to 30 mg per day), perphenazine (8 to 32 mg per day), quetiapine (200 to 800 mg per day), or risperidone (1.5 to 6.0 mg per day) for up to 18 months. Ziprasidone (40 to 160 mg per day) was included after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The primary aim was to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of these five treatments.

- **Results**: Overall, 74 percent of patients discontinued the study medication before 18 months (1,061 of the 1,432 patients who received at least one dose): 64 percent of those assigned to olanzapine, 75 percent of those assigned to perphenazine, 82 percent of those assigned to quetiapine, 74 percent of those assigned to risperidone, and 79 percent of those assigned to ziprasidone. The time to the discontinuation of treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P < 0.001) or risperidone (P = 0.002) group but not in the perphenazine (P = 0.021) or ziprasidone (P = 0.028) group. The times to discontinuation because of intolerable side effects were similar among the groups, but the rates differed (P = 0.04); olanzapine was associated with…

### Haloperidol [^116Y5g94]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all antipsychotic drugs, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

	- To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^115kXXHY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose-related side effects, which can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, but higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It is still unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely in order to minimize the adverse-effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic dose compared to continuing the dose for people with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a systematic search on February 10, 2021, at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilized on their antipsychotic treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important changes in quality of life, rehospitalizations, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^1146EHFC]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, particularly in managing drug side effects, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with medium-risk antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone, to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients with cardiometabolic risk factors or those aged 10–25 years.

### Drugs and prolactin [^117CXxzL]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Medications commonly cause hyperprolactinemia, and their use must be differentiated from pathologic causes. The most common medications to cause hyperprolactinemia are antipsychotic agents, although some of the newer atypical antipsychotics do not cause this condition. Other medications causing hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants, antihypertensive agents, and drugs that increase bowel motility. Often, medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, causing galactorrhea, menstrual disturbances, and erectile dysfunction.

In individual patients, it is important to differentiate hyperprolactinemia due to a medication from a structural lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary area. This differentiation can be achieved by temporarily stopping the medication to determine if prolactin (PRL) levels return to normal, switching to another medication in the same class that does not cause hyperprolactinemia (in consultation with the patient's physician and/or psychiatrist), or by performing an MRI or CT scan.

If hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, management strategies include switching to an alternative medication that does not cause hyperprolactinemia, using estrogen/testosterone replacement, or cautiously adding a dopamine agonist.

### Management of common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^113XgCpt]. World Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The benefits of antipsychotic medications are sometimes obscured by their adverse effects. These effects range from relatively minor tolerability issues, such as mild sedation or dry mouth, to very unpleasant conditions like constipation, akathisia, or sexual dysfunction. Some effects can be painful, such as acute dystonias, disfiguring like weight gain or tardive dyskinesia, or even life-threatening, including myocarditis or agranulocytosis. Importantly, adverse effect profiles are specific to each antipsychotic medication and do not neatly fit into first- and second-generation classifications.

This paper reviews management strategies for the most frequent side effects and identifies common principles intended to optimize net antipsychotic benefits. Antipsychotics should only be used if the indication is clear, and only continued if a benefit is discernible. If an antipsychotic is providing substantial benefit and the adverse effect is not life-threatening, the first management choice is to lower the dose or adjust the dosing schedule. Changing the antipsychotic is the next option and is often reasonable unless the risk of relapse is high. In some instances, behavioral interventions can be tried. Finally, concomitant medications, though generally not desirable, are necessary in many instances and can provide considerable relief.

- **Concomitant medication strategies**: Anticholinergic medications are often effective for dystonias and parkinsonism; beta-blockers and anticholinergic medications are useful for akathisia; and metformin may lead to slight to moderate weight loss.

### Retrograde ejaculation associated with quetiapine and treatment with low-dose imipramine [^114BMcfb]. BMJ case reports (2019). Low credibility.

Sexual side effects are common among those using antipsychotic medication and may result in poor compliance and reduced quality of life. Retrograde ejaculation (RE) has been described as occurring with a number of antipsychotic medications, including thioridazine, risperidone, iloperidone, and clozapine. However, there are no guidelines regarding the management of antipsychotic-associated RE. Imipramine has been suggested as a treatment for antipsychotic-associated RE in one small study of patients prescribed thioridazine and a case series of patients prescribed iloperidone.

Quetiapine is a commonly used antipsychotic and is thought to be associated with fewer sexual side effects relative to other antipsychotic medications. This case report describes a 25-year-old man with first-episode psychosis who developed RE during treatment with quetiapine, which improved with low-dose imipramine. This is the first description of RE occurring with quetiapine, alongside successful treatment of quetiapine-associated RE with imipramine.

### Worsening stimulant use disorder outcomes coinciding with off-label antipsychotic prescribing: a commonly unrecognised side effect [^116dJ74p]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Specifically, antipsychotic medications are widely used off-label among persons with SUD, where their antidopaminergic effects may alleviate side effects or other symptoms of SUD, including anxiety, low mood, and insomnia. Additionally, some reports note that certain psychoactive medications, including antipsychotics, are diverted and used outside of a normal prescribed medication for symptom management or for the perceived ability of certain medications to augment the 'high' of illicit drugs. In these contexts, the off-label prescribing of certain antipsychotic medications has become of increased concern.

While dopamine antagonists are recognized to stimulate food craving and weight gain, outside of the possible role on increasing nicotine craving and use, their impact on other SUD outcomes is poorly recognized. Recognizing that the neurobiology of addiction primarily involves the 'reward pathway' with the neurotransmitter dopamine, research has demonstrated that antipsychotic therapy can produce 'supersensitivity' to dopamine, which can enhance the motivational effects of addictive drugs. This case report focuses on possible unintended consequences of dopamine antagonists, such as worsening stimulant cravings and stimulant use disorder. It also acknowledges that there may be clinical circumstances where off-label use may have benefits, such as helping patients during severe agitation and anxiety in stimulant intoxication, or among individuals with severe conditions like schizophrenia, where they are indicated.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115c7tx6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, particularly concerning the initiation of antipsychotic therapy, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend deciding on the choice of antipsychotic medication based on differences in adverse effect profiles. This includes factors such as the liability for sedation and adverse metabolic effects, rather than efficacy in the first episode of schizophrenia, as differences in efficacy are not well established.

### The impact of hyperprolactinaemia on sexual function in patients with psychosis [^114QE5C7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Sexual dysfunction is a common but significantly underestimated side effect of antipsychotic medication. This dysfunction is frequently related to hyperprolactinaemia induced by the dopamine-blocking properties of these agents. However, it may also be associated with the anti-serotonergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties of antipsychotics. Understanding the receptor pharmacology of an individual antipsychotic can help determine its likelihood of causing sexual side effects.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113AVg23]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

National and international guidelines provide rankings of antipsychotic or antidepressant side-effects. Color coding indicates groups of similar side-effects for those with more than one mention. For further details, see the online resources. QTc refers to the corrected QT interval, and FDA denotes the US Food and Drug Administration. Some data were specifically selected for extraction into the side-effect database, while others were used for data imputation.

For antipsychotics, meta-analytic data were available from 13 studies, encompassing 58 meta-analyses that addressed 18 side-effects (see Figure 3). We assumed that the use of antiparkinsonian medication indicates the emergence of Parkinsonism, and therefore grouped this side-effect with tremor. Additionally, somnolence, sedation, and drowsiness were assumed to represent the same side-effect. Ordinal data were sourced from four national or international guidelines for 19 side-effects (see Figure 4). Akathisia or Parkinsonism was assumed to describe the same group of side-effects as extrapyramidal side-effects. Similarly, orthostasis and hypotension were considered to broadly describe the same side-effect.

Five studies remained after selecting those with the largest numbers of drugs or the best imputation model fit and excluding those with insufficient drug numbers (refer to appendix pp. 11–12). These studies comprised 11 side-effect meta-analyses for up to 32 antipsychotics, with an overall sample size of 65,594 patients from at least 38 countries. These data were further supported by ordinal ranking data from four guidelines for three additional side-effects. The 14 identified side-effects were Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, and others.

### Adverse events after antipsychotic discontinuation: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^113ASkMS]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Adverse events can occur after antipsychotic discontinuation, but evidence from antipsychotic drug trials is scarce. We aimed to estimate the occurrence of adverse events after discontinuing antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: For this two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis, we searched the Yale University Open Data Access Project's database for randomized controlled trials of antipsychotics from database inception until May 6, 2021. We included placebo-controlled antipsychotic randomized controlled trials with individual participant data of participants (aged ≥ 18 years, of any sex and ethnicity) with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.

Studies were excluded if treatment with antidepressants, lithium, or antiepileptic drugs was initiated as additive therapy at the start of the placebo phase. Starting from the screening or washout phase, we divided participants who were randomized to placebo into two groups: the discontinuation group (participants who discontinued prestudy antipsychotics at the start of the screening or washout phase) and the control group (participants who did not take prestudy antipsychotics for at least 4 weeks before the start of the screening or washout phase). Participants were excluded from the discontinuation and control groups if they discontinued prestudy treatment with antidepressants, lithium, or antiepileptic drugs up to 4 weeks before baseline, received an antipsychotic as a tolerability test, or received a long-acting injection of an antipsychotic within 12 weeks before baseline.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia [^114P2JYw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, specifically in relation to managing drug side effects, the APA 2020 guidelines recommend the following options for patients experiencing akathisia with antipsychotic therapy:

- **Lowering the dosage of the antipsychotic medication**: This option may help alleviate symptoms of akathisia by reducing the intensity of side effects.
- **Switching to another antipsychotic medication**: Changing medications can sometimes reduce side effects such as akathisia.
- **Adding a benzodiazepine medication**: This may provide additional relief from symptoms.
- **Adding a β-adrenergic blocking agent**: This medication can be effective in treating akathisia symptoms.

### Oral health impacts of medications used to treat mental illness [^112T3bjC]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Many psychotropic medications affect oral health. This review identified oral side effects for antidepressant, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, antianxiety, and sedative drugs that are recommended in Australia for the management of common mental illnesses and provides recommendations to manage these side effects.

- **Methods**: The Australian Therapeutic Guidelines and the Australian Medicines Handbook were searched for medications used to treat common mental health conditions. For each medication, the generic name, class, and drug company-reported side effects were extracted from the online Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (eMIMs) and UpToDate databases. Meyler's Side Effect of Drugs Encyclopaedia was used to identify additional oral adverse reactions to these medications.

- **Results**: Fifty-seven drugs were identified: 23 antidepressants, 22 antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, and 12 anxiolytic or sedative medications. Xerostomia (91%) was the most commonly reported side effect among all classes of medications of the 28 identified symptoms. Other commonly reported adverse effects included dysguesia (65%) for antidepressants, and tardive dyskinesia (94%) or increased salivation (78%) for antipsychotic medications.

- **Conclusions**: While xerostomia has often been reported as a common adverse effect of psychotropic drugs, this review has identified additional side effects including dysguesia from antidepressants and tardive dyskinesia and increased salivation from antipsychotics. Clinicians should consider oral consequences of psychotropic medication in addition to other side effects.
