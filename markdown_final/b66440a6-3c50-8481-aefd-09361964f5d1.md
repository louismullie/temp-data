## Question

What is the role of EEG in diagnosing neonatal seizures?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of EEG in diagnosing neonatal seizures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic challenge and why EEG is necessary. Then, I should verify the gold standard modality and its performance. Next, I will compare continuous video-EEG with alternatives like aEEG and routine EEG. After that, I need to review guideline-based indications for when to use EEG. I will then examine prognostic and therapeutic implications, including timing and seizure burden. Finally, I should consider implementation barriers, special populations, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic challenge. Neonatal seizures are common, often subtle or subclinical, and clinical observation alone is unreliable, with studies showing that roughly one-third to one-half of clinically suspected seizures are not confirmed on EEG, while many true electrographic seizures have no clinical correlate, leading to both under- and overdiagnosis without EEG confirmation [^9dc7d3af] [^d4ec289c] [^37af8398].

> I need to verify the gold standard. Continuous conventional video-EEG (cEEG) with adequate montage and expert interpretation is the reference standard for diagnosing neonatal seizures; it detects electrographic-only seizures, quantifies seizure burden, and enables assessment of treatment response, which is why regulatory and guideline bodies require cEEG for definitive diagnosis in research and clinical trials [^51539c13] [^39ff751a] [^878d2bdf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is a simplified, bedside tool with moderate sensitivity and specificity for detecting "neonates with seizures", and it frequently misses brief, low-amplitude, or spatially distant seizures; pooled sensitivity around 0.71 and specificity around 0.84 masks substantial heterogeneity and lower performance in low-bias studies, so aEEG can complement but not replace cEEG for diagnosis [^878d2bdf] [^72d51daa]. Routine or spot EEG is even less sensitive because seizures are intermittent; before-after data show cEEG increases detection from about one-third to one-half of suspected cases and reveals EEG-only seizures that routine EEG often misses [^5a8f2a2e].

> Next, I should review guideline-based indications for EEG. The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society recommends cEEG to improve diagnostic accuracy when seizures are suspected, to confirm suspected aEEG events, to monitor high-risk neonates without evident seizures, to assess background patterns for prognostication in encephalopathy, and to evaluate seizure control after treatment; these are conditional recommendations given very low evidence quality but reflect broad consensus on clinical value [^b8e5d0f2] [^462676d5] [^ba976e69] [^4be4024f] [^18788fe4]. WHO guidance similarly advises EEG confirmation of clinical seizures where available, reinforcing EEG's central role when accessible [^2f8f58e7].

> I will now examine prognostic and therapeutic implications. Higher electrographic seizure burden independently associates with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and early treatment of electrographic seizures may reduce subsequent seizure burden, though randomized data have not yet proven improved long-term outcomes; nonetheless, expert consensus supports treating electrographic-only seizures to lower burden, and cEEG is essential to quantify burden and guide therapy [^3145245b] [^1affea4b] [^cda08830]. Let me double-check timing: treating within 1 hour of electrographic seizure onset is associated with lower subsequent seizure burden, supporting rapid EEG-informed treatment decisions when feasible [^1affea4b].

> But wait, what about implementation realities. cEEG requires 24/7 access to equipment, leads, and expert interpretation, which many centers lack; feasibility constraints drive conditional rather than strong recommendations, and underscore the need for standardized pathways, training, and, where needed, validated algorithmic support to augment human review [^a4bc5a62] [^89d9a10f]. Automated detection tools like ANSeR can improve recognition of seizure hours without fully replacing expert review, which is crucial in resource-limited settings or when staffing is constrained [^9c0ae345].

> Let me consider special populations and durations. In hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, seizures are common and often electrographic-only; guidelines suggest at least 24 hours of cEEG during hypothermia and rewarming, with some centers extending to 72 hours given prolonged risk, and cEEG is also recommended after congenital heart surgery and during ECMO where seizure risk evolves over 24–48 hours [^79e48624] [^aa8c02cc]. In preterm infants, cEEG background patterns inform prognosis for evolving brain injury and death or disability, supporting selective use even when seizures are not suspected, albeit with very low-quality evidence [^0837310f].

> I should confirm the role of EEG beyond seizure detection. EEG background assessment informs severity of encephalopathy, maturation, and prognosis; features such as discontinuity, asynchrony, asymmetry, and sleep–wake cycling carry prognostic weight, and in preterms, positive sharp waves correlate with white matter injury, reinforcing EEG's dual diagnostic and prognostic roles in neurocritical care [^0837310f] [^21506313].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For any neonate with suspected seizures, prioritize cEEG when available to confirm diagnosis and quantify burden; if cEEG is unavailable, use aEEG as a bridge but plan confirmatory cEEG and avoid treating based on aEEG alone when pretest probability is low or interpreter expertise is limited; for high-risk neonates without clinical seizures, consider screening cEEG for 24–72 hours depending on risk profile; after antiseizure treatment, extend cEEG to confirm control for at least 24 hours; and integrate EEG findings with imaging and etiologic workup to guide management and counseling [^b8e5d0f2] [^79e48624] [^18788fe4] [^5f89b025].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and communicate them. Evidence quality for many cEEG recommendations is very low, and while seizure burden correlates with worse outcomes, it remains unproven that aggressive EEG-targeted therapy improves long-term neurodevelopment; thus, shared decision-making is essential, especially when cEEG is used primarily for prognostication or when treatment decisions carry nontrivial risks [^e83ef3d6] [^3145245b]. I need to ensure we also emphasize that EEG does not determine etiology; it confirms seizures and guides burden-directed therapy, while etiologic diagnosis still requires clinical, laboratory, and imaging correlation [^aa18d04c].

> In summary, EEG — particularly continuous video-EEG — is indispensable for diagnosing neonatal seizures because it reveals electrographic-only events, quantifies seizure burden, enables treatment-response monitoring, and provides prognostic information; aEEG and routine EEG are adjuncts with meaningful limitations, and optimal care requires aligning modality choice with risk, availability, and expertise while applying guideline-based durations and standardized pathways [^51539c13] [^b8e5d0f2] [^878d2bdf].

EEG is the **gold standard** for diagnosing neonatal seizures because most seizures are subclinical and cannot be detected by observation alone [^51539c13] [^9dc7d3af]. Continuous video-EEG (cEEG) for at least 24 hours is recommended to detect and quantify seizure burden, guide treatment, and assess response, especially in high-risk neonates such as those with HIE, stroke, or infection [^b8e5d0f2] [^79e48624]. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is a useful bedside adjunct but has lower sensitivity and specificity than cEEG and should be confirmed with cEEG when possible [^878d2bdf] [^72d51daa]. Early, accurate EEG diagnosis enables timely treatment and may improve outcomes by reducing seizure burden and secondary brain injury [^1affea4b] [^cda08830].

---

## Clinical significance of EEG in neonatal seizures

EEG is essential in neonatal seizures because:

- **Subclinical seizures**: Most neonatal seizures are electrographic-only, with no visible clinical signs, making EEG the only reliable detection method [^9dc7d3af] [^51539c13].

- **Electroclinical dissociation**: After treatment, clinical signs may disappear while electrographic seizures persist, requiring EEG to guide ongoing management [^3ad45872] [^751847b2].

- **Seizure burden quantification**: EEG allows accurate measurement of seizure burden, which correlates with neurodevelopmental outcomes [^3145245b] [^5d3b5ab0].

---

## Types of EEG monitoring

Two main EEG modalities are used in neonates: **continuous video-EEG (cEEG)** — the gold standard with multichannel recording and video, providing high sensitivity and specificity for seizure detection and quantification [^51539c13] [^39ff751a] — and **amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG)** — a simplified, bedside tool with lower sensitivity/specificity, useful for screening but requiring cEEG confirmation when possible [^878d2bdf] [^72d51daa].

---

## Indications for EEG monitoring

Guidelines recommend EEG monitoring in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended eeg modality** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspected seizures | cEEG | ≥ 24 hours or until seizures controlled for 24 hours [^79e48624] |
| High-risk neonates (HIE, stroke, infection) | cEEG | ≥ 24 hours [^79e48624] |
| Confirm suspected aEEG seizures | cEEG | As needed [^462676d5] |
| Assess seizure control after treatment | cEEG | ≥ 24 hours after treatment [^8404d5ad] |
| Preterm infants for prognostication | cEEG | Individualized, often 24–72 hours [^notfound] |

---

## Accuracy and limitations of EEG

cEEG is highly accurate for detecting neonatal seizures, but **resource-intensive** and requires trained personnel and equipment [^51539c13] [^a4bc5a62]. aEEG is more accessible but has moderate sensitivity/specificity and can miss brief or focal seizures; results should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with cEEG when possible [^878d2bdf] [^72d51daa].

---

## Impact of EEG on clinical management

EEG directly influences management by:

- **Confirming diagnosis**: Prevents under- or over-treatment of seizures [^9dc7d3af] [^5a8f2a2e].

- **Guiding therapy**: Enables timely, appropriate antiseizure medication and assessment of response [^18788fe4] [^8404d5ad].

- **Informing prognosis**: Background patterns and seizure burden inform neurodevelopmental risk and counseling [^e83ef3d6] [^0837310f].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with EEG-guided management

Early, accurate EEG diagnosis and treatment may reduce seizure burden and secondary brain injury, though **high-quality evidence** for improved long-term outcomes is still evolving [^1affea4b] [^cda08830]. Observational data suggest that EEG-guided care is associated with better seizure control and may reduce mortality and disability, but randomized trials are needed [^1affea4b] [^3145245b].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **ACNS 2025**: Recommends cEEG to improve diagnostic accuracy, confirm suspected seizures, assess treatment response, and guide prognostication in high-risk neonates [^b8e5d0f2] [^462676d5] [^18788fe4] [^4be4024f].

- **WHO 2011**: Recommends EEG to confirm clinical seizures where available [^2f8f58e7].

- **ILAE 2023**: Emphasizes EEG-based diagnosis and treatment, including electrographic-only seizures, to reduce seizure burden [^cda08830] [^98e213c3].

---

## Practical considerations and challenges

- **Resource availability**: cEEG requires equipment, trained staff, and 24/7 interpretation, which may not be available in all settings [^a4bc5a62] [^82faeb0e].

- **aEEG limitations**: Moderate accuracy and risk of false positives/negatives necessitate cautious use and cEEG confirmation when possible [^878d2bdf] [^72d51daa].

- **Training needs**: Interpretation of neonatal EEG requires specialized training and experience [^51539c13] [^62a1af9d].

---

EEG is the **gold standard** for diagnosing neonatal seizures, enabling detection of subclinical events, quantification of seizure burden, and guidance of therapy. cEEG is preferred when available, with aEEG as a useful adjunct; early, accurate EEG-based diagnosis and treatment are critical to reducing seizure burden and improving outcomes.

Neonates are susceptible to seizures due to their unique physiology and combination of risks associated with gestation, delivery, and the immediate postnatal period. Advances in neonatal care have improved outcomes for some of our most fragile patients, but there are persistent challenges for epileptologists in identifying neonatal seizures, diagnosing etiologies, and providing the most appropriate care, with an ultimate goal to maximize patient outcomes. In just the last few years, there have been critical advances in the state of the science, as well as new evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, classification, and treatment of neonatal seizures. This review will provide updated knowledge about the pathophysiology of neonatal seizures, classification of the provoked seizures and neonatal epilepsies, state of the art guidance on EEG monitoring in the neonatal ICU, current treatment guidelines for neonatal seizures, and potential for future advancement in treatment.

American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guideline — continuous EEG (cEEG) in neonates evaluates what clinically relevant information can be gained from cEEG in suspected or definite seizures and its use for prognosis, and presents evidence-based clinical guidelines on indications for monitoring. A working group from the Society developed priority questions, performed PubMed and EMBASE searches, and used a modification of the GRADE process to evaluate evidence and draft recommendations. The group identified six priority questions on the accuracy of cEEG for neonatal seizure diagnosis and prognosis. An initial literature search yielded 18,167 results distilled to a set of 217 articles; overall, evidence quality for most questions was rated very low and low, and conditional recommendations were provided based on published literature and expert consensus. Benefits and harms were considered, with relative harms far less than potential benefits, and when cEEG results have a likelihood of altering clinical decision making, the resource investment was felt to be justifiable.

This article highlights important facets of the diagnosis and management of seizures in neonates. Most seizures that occur in neonates are acute provoked seizures. Continuous electroencephalography monitoring and neuroimaging are essential to the evaluation of neonates with seizures. Once seizures are recognized, pediatric clinicians must immediately focus on acute stabilization, treatment with antiseizure medications, and determination of the underlying etiology. We hope this article imparts the reader with the foundations needed to provide optimal care for neonates with seizures, thus promoting brain development in this vulnerable population.

### Approach to neonatal seizures [^277224ed]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures can be difficult to recognize given the variation in their presentation. Hence, diagnosis and appropriate treatment may be delayed. Morphology of seizures in this age group is discussed, followed by common etiological entities. Special emphasis is laid on treatable disease states such as vitamin responsive seizure disorders and benign conditions that may not warrant aggressive treatment. Conditions that may have devastating neurological consequences are discussed in some detail so that the treating pediatrician can provide realistic information to the parents of such newborns. Imaging and laboratory workup is outlined, followed by guidelines for ordering and interpreting an electroencephalogram in this age group. Finally, treatment options in the form of antiepileptics are discussed with mention of new avenues for diagnosis and treatment that may become commonly employed in the future.

### Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography compared with conventional video-electroencephalography for detection of neonatal seizures [^878d2bdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Conventional video-electroencephalography (cEEG) is the reference standard for diagnosing and managing neonatal seizures. However, continuous bedside cEEG services are not available in most neonatal units. Hence, an alternative and relatively simple method called amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which uses a limited number of scalp electrodes, has become popular. aEEG allows continuous bedside monitoring of the electrical activity of the brain in neonates.

Objectives

The primary objective of the review was to assess the accuracy of aEEG against the reference standard cEEG for the detection of 'neonates with seizures' and 'individual seizures'. Detection of 'neonates with seizures' refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify a 'neonate' as 'seizure positive' or 'seizure negative' based on the detection of at least one seizure episode in the entire aEEG recording. Detection of 'individual seizures' refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify 'individual' seizure episodes within the same neonate rather than just diagnosing the neonate as 'seizure positive' or 'seizure negative'.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, and grey literature (Open Grey, Trove, and American Doctoral Dissertations) to 26 July 2022. We did not apply any language or publication status restrictions or any other filters.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective and retrospective studies investigating the accuracy of aEEG (index test) against the reference standard cEEG for the detection of neonatal seizures. To be eligible for inclusion, the studies must have compared aEEG with simultaneously recorded cEEG. There was no restriction on the number of leads, use of raw EEG traces, or experience and training of an aEEG interpreter. cEEG should have been recorded using at least nine electrodes and interpreted by a qualified person experienced in the interpretation of neonatal cEEG.

Data Collection and Analysis

Working independently, two review authors collected data from the included studies in a prespecified form and assessed the quality of the included studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. For the outcome of 'neonates with seizures', we used a bivariate mixed-effects regression model to conduct a meta-analysis to derive pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR), and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We generated a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve to display the results of individual studies. We calculated post-test probabilities based on Bayes' theorem through Fagan nomograms. For the outcome of 'individual seizures', pooling of data was not possible because of the 'unit of analysis' issue. Instead, we performed a narrative synthesis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE guidelines.

Main Results

We included 16 studies (562 infants) in the systematic review, of which only two studies interpreted the aEEGs prospectively at the bedside. Out of 16 studies, three studies (97 infants) described the accuracy of aEEG only for detecting 'infants with seizures', three studies (72 infants) described only 'individual seizures', while 10 studies (393 infants) described the accuracy of aEEG for detecting both. Ten of 16 studies were conducted in term and late preterm infants. Half of the included studies did not use raw EEG traces. Fourteen studies reported outcomes based only on retrospective interpretation. Ten of 16 studies used four electrodes (making this the most common approach amongst the included studies), and 10 studies' aEEG recordings exceeded six hours. Only two included studies used a seizure detection algorithm. In 14 studies, a neonatal or neurology consultant performed aEEG interpretation, and most (in 10 of 14 studies) had prior experience in aEEG interpretation. Accuracy of aEEG to diagnose 'neonates with seizures'. The only two prospective studies (53 participants) which interpreted aEEGs 'live' at the bedside, reported sensitivities of zero and 0.57 and specificities of 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. Meta-analysis of 13 studies (490 neonates) found that aEEG had a pooled sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.83), specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.95), positive LR of 4.50 (95% CI 1.55 to 13.04), and negative LR of 0.34 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.53) for the detection of 'neonates with seizures'. However, when we analysed only studies with low risk of bias (3 studies), sensitivity (0.56, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.99) and specificity (0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90) were even lower. There was significant statistical heterogeneity, which could not be explained based on threshold effect and exploratory analyses of forest plots. We graded the certainty of the evidence as low, in view of the high or unclear risk of bias in many studies, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. Accuracy of aEEG to detect 'individual seizures' in neonates. The reported sensitivities of aEEG for the detection of 'individual seizures' ranged from 0 to 0.86 (13 studies, 465 neonates). We rated the certainty of the evidence as low. The common causes of missed seizures on aEEG (i.e. false negative) as reported by studies were short duration of seizures, localisation of seizures away from aEEG leads, low voltage, and inexperienced interpreter. The false-positive rates were high when interpreted live at the bedside and if the interpreters were inexperienced. Artefacts resulting from muscle movement, patting, hiccups, and insufficient electrode attachment were other common causes of false-positive results.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that aEEG has only moderate sensitivity and specificity for detecting 'neonates with seizures', and its ability to detect 'individual seizures' varies widely. These findings suggest that aEEG may not be sufficiently accurate for diagnosing neonatal seizures as it can under-diagnose or over-diagnose seizures. Studies with low risk of bias are needed to address the issue definitively.

### Seizure disorders… [^b6f17b4e]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Seizures are one of the most common neurological manifesting symptoms in the pediatric age-group. Neonates experience a higher incidence of seizure than older children with a specific origin identified in most cases. Electroencephalography should be the first-line diagnostic evaluation to identify the focus of origin and type of seizure. Imaging is recommended in certain situations: A computed tomographic head scan should be obtained without delay when trauma and intracranial hemorrhage are suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for focal/multiple seizures, status epilepticus, an underlying condition with seizure risk, atypical neurological examination findings, or focal abnormalities on EEG. Immediate management should focus on opening the airway, supporting breathing, and preventing injuries. Intravenous lorazepam 0. 05 to
0. 10 mg/kg can be given over 2 to 5 minutes for a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes.

### Electrographic monitoring for seizure detection in the neonatal unit: current status and future direction [^be3658dd]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal neurocritical care is dedicated to safeguarding the newborn brain and prioritises clinical practices that promote early identification, diagnosis and treatment of brain injuries and maximise normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Neonates are most susceptible to seizure development due to brain immaturity and a high risk of injury. The incidence of neonatal seizures in term-born infants is 1–5.5 per 1000 live births in high-income countries and as high as 39.5 per 1000 live births in low-income countries. Frequently, seizures are the first and sometimes the only clinical sign of neurological disease in neonatesoccurring as a result of a disruption to the regular equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain. EEG measures the differences in electrical voltage and plays a key role in seizure detection and in monitoring the efficacy of treatment. American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ASNS) identifies continuous conventional electroencephalography (cEEG) with video as the gold standard of care for the diagnosis and management of neonatal seizures and neurological conditions. In neonatology, EEG is an especially useful safe and unobtrusive cot-side neuromonitoring tool in the NICU (with minimal burden to the infant) providing continuous real-time monitoring of the electrical activity of the brain with video-supporting behaviour observation of the critically ill infant.EEG also supports the observation of ongoing cerebral responses to asphyxia and determines the severity of neonatal encephalopathy and the efficacy of treatment.

This manuscript provides a broad overview of cEEG and amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) based neuromonitoring and its role in seizure detection in the neonatal unit. We will discuss seizure aetiology and the impact of seizure burden on developmental outcomes. Electrographic monitoring and seizure presentation on cEEG and aEEG will be described and incorporate the strengths and limitations of each mode of EEG monitoring (Table 1). Finally, we will describe seizure treatment before looking to the future of EEG monitoring and interpretation.

### Status epilepticus in the neonate [^6e313eca]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Status epilepticus in the neonate (NSE) is a medical emergency that often results in dire consequences. Minimising injury from NSE is essential. The diagnosis of NSE can be challenging as neonates frequently have electrographic only seizures and an EEG is essential for recognition of seizures and seizure burden. The lack of a universally accepted definition of NSE, possible adverse effects from commonly used antiseizure medications, debate regarding the best treatment packages for NSE, limited access to EEG and investigations for aetiology of NSE add to the clinical conundrum. In this review, we aim to present what is known, highlight the importance of EEG monitoring for diagnosis and treatment, discuss what is not known and suggest a practical paradigm for the management of NSE.

### Neonatal seizures: treatment practices among term and preterm infants [^80f8cd73]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures are common clinical conditions in both term and preterm neonates, yet no clinical management guidelines for direct care exist. We surveyed 193 international neurologists, neonatologists, and specialists in neonatal neurology or neonatal neurocritical care to assess management practices for seizures in preterm and term neonates. We found high reported rates of electroencephalogram and amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) monitoring to detect neonatal seizures, prevalent use of older anticonvulsant agents, and high rates of neuroimaging. Overall, responses were similar for term and preterm neonates. However, term neonates were likelier to be more heavily investigated, with higher use of magnetic resonance imaging and of electroencephalogram and aEEG monitoring of at-risk neonates. Continuous monitoring and cranial imaging of neonatal seizures now comprise the standard of care in many centers, although management practices vary widely. Early recognition and management of neonatal seizures and possible underlying injury may lead to increased opportunities for stopping seizures, protecting the brain, and improving developmental outcomes in at-risk neonates. The need for collaboration among neonatologists and neurologists is urgent, to address gaps in knowledge regarding management of neonatal seizures in term and preterm neonates.

### Controversies in neonatal seizure management [^4de5795d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Seizures in the newborn period are common and frequently indicate serious underlying brain injury. Although accumulating evidence suggests that they may impair brain development, there are currently no evidence-based guidelines for evaluation and management of neonatal seizures. In this review, we will address some of the current controversies facing child neurologists and neonatologists, including how to define, monitor, and treat neonatal seizures.

### Neonatal seizures [^5f89b025]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal seizures are common among patients with acute brain injury or critical illness and can be difficult to diagnose and treat. The most common etiology of neonatal seizures is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, with other common causes including ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage. Neonatal clinicians can use a standardized approach to patients with suspected or confirmed neonatal seizures that entails laboratory testing, neuromonitoring, and brain imaging. The primary goals of management of neonatal seizures are to identify the underlying cause, correct it if possible, and prevent further brain injury.

### Neonatal seizures [^afcd95dd]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures typically indicate significant underlying disease. They are poorly classified, under-recognized, and often difficult to treat. Recognition of etiology is often helpful in prognosis and treatment; the most common is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Patients generally have a poor prognosis, with most developing a severe encephalopathy and epilepsy. Studies suggest that neonatal seizures and their etiology have a significant impact on the developing brain; it is critical to recognize seizures early and initiate immediate antiepileptic therapy. Continuous computerized simultaneous video electroencephalograph monitoring is imperative; at-risk infants will frequently have electrographic seizures without clinical manifestations. Although there are antiepileptic therapies for neonatal seizures, they are ineffective in over 35% of cases. The goal of research should be the development of more effective therapies for neonatal seizures, regardless of etiology.

### Why monitor the neonatal brain-that is the important question [^9f4e5ca4]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Neonates with acute neurological disorders, such as encephalopathy due to hypoxia-ischemia, will commonly undergo continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring to assess brain recovery and detection of seizures. EEG monitoring is necessary for a reliable diagnosis and monitoring of neonatal seizures, because the majority of EEG-confirmed neonatal seizures have no clinical signs, while EEG monitoring may confirm that many clinical events are non-epileptic in origin. The International Neonatal Consortium, European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, Brighton Collaboration, the International League Against Epilepsy, and American Clinical Neurophysiology Society agree that all studies involving the treatment of neonatal seizures should evaluate seizures from the EEG recordings.

Before these international recommendations, it was common for clinicians to question the added value of (a)EEG monitoring in newborn care. The NEST trialattempted to address this question by assessing whether neurodevelopmental outcomes are improved by treating seizures with the aid of amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring (aEEG) compared to treating seizures identified by clinical recognition only. The underlying assumption was that seizure identification and management reduces secondary brain injury and improves neurodevelopment (Fig. 1), and that aEEG facilitates seizure diagnosis and treatment. The study found no evidence of improved neurodevelopmental outcomes, and secondary analyses showed reduced cognitive outcomes in the group with aEEG monitoring. The secondary outcome findings can be linked to many well-established confounders, only some of which were mentioned in the paper. However, the most surprising finding of this study is the lack of difference in overall seizure burden between groups treated with aEEG monitoring support versus those with clinical consideration only.

### Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography in neonates [^e2e2378d]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Conventional electroencephalography (EEG) has been used for decades in the neonatal intensive care unit for formulating neurologic prognoses, demonstrating brain functional state and degree of maturation, revealing cerebral lesions, and identifying the presence and number of electrographic seizures. However, both the immediate availability of conventional EEG and the expertise with which it is interpreted are variable. Amplitude-integrated EEG provides simplified monitoring of cerebral function, and is rapidly gaining popularity among neonatologists, with growing use in bedside decision making and inclusion criteria for randomized clinical studies. Nonetheless, child neurologists and neurophysiologists remain cautious about relying solely on this tool and prefer interpreting conventional EEG. The present review examines the technical aspects of generating, recording, and interpreting amplitude-integrated EEG and contrasts this approach with conventional EEG. Finally, several proposed amplitude-integrated EEG classification schemes are reviewed. A clear understanding of this emerging technology of measuring brain health in the premature or sick neonate is critical in modern care of the newborn infant.

### Electrographic monitoring for seizure detection in the neonatal unit: current status and future direction [^62a1af9d]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal neurocritical intensive care is dedicated to safeguarding the newborn brain by prioritising clinical practices that promote early identification, diagnosis and treatment of brain injuries. The most common newborn neurological emergency is neonatal seizures, which may also be the initial clinical indication of neurological disease. A high seizure burden in the newborn period independently contributes to increased mortality and morbidity. The majority of seizures in newborns are subclinical (without clinical presentation), and hence identification may be difficult. Neuromonitoring techniques most frequently used to monitor brain wave activity include conventional electroencephalography (cEEG) or amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG). cEEG with video is the gold standard for diagnosing and treating seizures. Many neonatal units do not have access to cEEG, and frequently those that do, have little access to real-time interpretation of monitoring. IMPACT: EEG monitoring is of no benefit to an infant without expert interpretation. Whilst EEG is a reliable cot-side tool and of diagnostic and prognostic use, both conventional EEG and amplitude-integrated EEG have strengths and limitations, including sensitivity to seizure activity and ease of interpretation. Automated seizure detection requires a sensitive and specific algorithm that can interpret EEG in real-time and identify seizures, including their intensity and duration.

### Neonatal seizure management: is the timing of treatment critical? [^1affea4b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of the time to treatment of the first electrographic seizure on subsequent seizure burden and describe overall seizure management in a large neonatal cohort.

Study Design

Newborns (36–44 weeks of gestation) requiring electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring recruited to 2 multicenter European studies were included. Infants who received antiseizure medication exclusively after electrographic seizure onset were grouped based on the time to treatment of the first seizure: antiseizure medication within 1 hour, between 1 and 2 hours, and after 2 hours. Outcomes measured were seizure burden, maximum seizure burden, status epilepticus, number of seizures, and antiseizure medication dose over the first 24 hours after seizure onset.

Results

Out of 472 newborns recruited, 154 (32.6%) had confirmed electrographic seizures. Sixty-nine infants received antiseizure medication exclusively after the onset of electrographic seizure, including 21 infants within 1 hour of seizure onset, 15 between 1 and 2 hours after seizure onset, and 33 at > 2 hours after seizure onset. Significantly lower seizure burden and fewer seizures were noted in the infants treated with antiseizure medication within 1 hour of seizure onset (P = 0.029 and .035, respectively). Overall, 258 of 472 infants (54.7%) received antiseizure medication during the study period, of whom 40 without electrographic seizures received treatment exclusively during EEG monitoring and 11 with electrographic seizures received no treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment of neonatal seizures may be time-critical, but more research is needed to confirm this. Improvements in neonatal seizure diagnosis and treatment are also needed.

### Neonatal seizures: providing care with evidence, not just experience [^37af8398]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Having a baby, even a healthy newborn, is an overwhelming experience. Now imagine being told your newborn is having seizures — and there are minimal guidelines for best treatment. This has been the reality for many of our patients' families.

The neonatal brain is particularly susceptible to seizures due to age-dependent physiology that leads to increased excitation and decreased inhibition. Seizures occur in 1–5 per 1000 live births and are the most common neurological emergency in the neonatal period. The majority of seizures in neonates occur in response to a brain insult — acute provoked seizures. Treatment of neonatal seizures has been riddled with controversy: whether continuous EEG recording is needed, whether to treat electrographic-only seizures, which antiseizure medications (ASM) to use, and what duration of medication treatment. Primarily through the help of the ILAE Task Force on Neonatal Seizures and the Neonatal Seizure Registry, we are now finding answers to these questions.

Question #1: Do We Need EEG?

The immature state of the motor pathways in neonates leads to difficulties in differentiating seizures from nonepileptic events. Health care professionals are able to accurately identify only 50% of seizures, with poor inter-observer agreement. Furthermore, electrographic-only seizures are common. In the recent position paper by the ILAE Task Force on Neonatal Seizures, only clonic seizures could be reliably diagnosed clinically. Diagnosis of other clinical seizure types, including automatisms, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, tonic, autonomic, behavioral arrest, and sequential, was unreliable without EEG.

Question #2: Do We Need to Treat Electrographic-Only Seizures?

Payne et alshowed seizure burden per hour, rather than duration of individual seizures, was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of neurological decline. This was most evident in those with acute seizures and systemic disease. In neonates with acute provoked seizures, the seizures may exacerbate the underlying injury. A seizure burden of > 30–60 seconds per hour is an indication for initiating treatment, regardless of presence or absence of clinical signs.

### Primer on neonatal electroencephalograms for the neonatologist… [^21506313]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: The electroencephalogram is a valuable noninvasive tool for assessing neonatal brain function. It has the unique property of providing functional information about the brain, rather than simply the anatomic information that is provided by neuroimaging studies. The major areas in which an EEG can provide unique information in the assessment of newborns are: 1) diagnosis and treatment of seizures, 2) evaluation of severity of cerebral dysfunction from primary neurologic disorders or systemic diseases, 3) identification of specific neurologic entities, and 4) determination of prognosis and long-term neurologic outcome. Serial EEGs provide information about the effectiveness of treatment and disturbances in brain maturation.

An EEG should be considered in the neonate when questions arise regarding the cause of the child's abnormal neurologic status. There are many situations. Comments.

### Risk of epilepsy in neonates with seizures [^3dbe09c1]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures occur more frequently during the neonatal period than in any other time of life. Neonates with seizures have an increased risk of mortality and neurodevelopmental sequalae such as epilepsy, cognitive and motor disability, sleep, and behavioural dysfunction. The clinical conundrum of accurate diagnosis of neonatal seizures and optimal interventional packages persists.

There are wide variations (6%–56%) in estimates of neurodevelopmental sequelae in survivors of neonatal seizures due to varying methods of identification of seizures, size of population, case series versus population‐based studies, socioeconomic status, geographical location, duration of follow‐up, and type of assessments undertaken. Accurate diagnosis of seizures in the neonate is the first essential step to assess efficacy of therapies and to prognosticate with confidence.

In this useful, large, well conducted register‐based cohort study of all children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018, Tinggaard et al. confirm the increased risk of epilepsy among survivors of neonatal seizures, with a cumulative risk of about 20%. The majority of those who had postneonatal epilepsy had onset in the first year of life, and those with structural abnormalities in the brain had a higher risk, confirming previous reports. The reported persistence of the increased risk of epilepsy into adolescence and young adulthood, will be useful for counselling. An interesting and surprising finding from the study is the increased risk of febrile seizures in survivors of neonatal seizures who did not have postneonatal epilepsy.

Neonates with seizures may have electrographic‐only seizures, electroclinical‐only seizures, or both. It is well known that underestimation and overdiagnosis of seizures may occur in neonates. Correct identification of neonates with seizures and estimation of seizure burden is an essential first step for meaningful interventional and follow‐up studies. The modification for neonates of the International League Against Epilepsy classification of seizures and the epilepsiesclearly recognize conventional video electroencephalogram (EEG) as the criterion standard for diagnosis and monitoring of seizures in the neonate. However, conventional EEG monitoring is not available in most parts of the world. The authors acknowledge that the identification of many neonates with seizures in their cohort may have been based on clinical features (most probably had amplitude‐integrated EEG or conventional EEG confirmation), and thus a limitation of the study.

### Neonatal seizures-part 2: aetiology of acute symptomatic seizures, treatments and the neonatal epilepsy syndromes [^52de1e1e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Most neonatal epileptic seizures are provoked by an underlying condition or problem-'acute symptomatic seizures'. However, a few neonatal epilepsy syndromes exist, and these are defined by the constellation of seizure types, EEG findings and family history seen. Making an accurate diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome can help direct investigations, treatment options and provide prognostic information. This article discusses the investigative approach and treatments for neonatal epileptic seizures, including the neonatal epilepsy syndromes.

### Summary proceedings from the neurology group on neonatal seizures [^7167d32e]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

One of the highest risk periods for seizures during the human life span is the first month of life. Most neonatal seizures are triggered by acute illness such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, or infection; rarely are they triggered by epilepsy per se. Seizures are the most common and important sign of acute neonatal encephalopathy, are a major risk for death or subsequent neurologic disability, and by themselves may contribute to an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Customary clinical practice includes visual monitoring of high-risk neonates for seizures, performance of a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) for suspicious clinical seizure activity, and empirical treatment with phenobarbital. Presently, however, there are no data that have unequivocally demonstrated the efficacy of barbiturates in the treatment of neonatal seizures. The neurology group recognizes an important need for randomized, placebo-controlled, ethically acceptable trials of phenobarbital efficacy and safety in the treatment of neonatal seizures. After exploring 3 possible frameworks for clinical trials of phenobarbital in the treatment of neonatal seizures, the neurology group ultimately focused on a multicenter, placebo-controlled, electroencephalographer-blinded study of phenobarbital versus placebo in a homogeneous group of newborns who are at high risk of developing early subclinical electroencephalographically detected neonatal seizures. Continuous video-EEG monitoring would establish the presence and number of seizures. Criteria for escape from the study to treatment are clearly defined. The proposed study could provide the first concrete evidence of treatment efficacy because (1) it examines a homogeneous patient population, (2) the recognition and quantification of seizures rests solely on the gold standard of seizure detection (EEG), and (3) the dosing of phenobarbital is matched specifically to the phenobarbital-binding characteristics of the individual treated. This study would affirm or refute the common practice of phenobarbital as the first-line treatment of neonatal seizures.

### Neonatal seizure management: is the timing of treatment critical? [^751847b2]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

See editorial, p 7

Owing to the unique physiologic properties of the immature brain, seizures are common in newborn infants, with an incidence of 1–3.5/1000 live births in term infants. Although a wide variety of causes have been reported, the leading cause remains hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), despite the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia. Seizure recognition is challenging in newborns because many seizures are subclinical or have subtle clinical manifestations; in addition, treatment of seizures can cause an "uncoupling" of clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) features.

There has been an increase in the use of EEG in neonatal units for diagnosing seizures. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is still preferred by some neonatologists, because it is easy to perform and not dependent on 24/7 neurophysiology support. International guidelines recommend the use of continuous conventional electroencephalography (cEEG) for a minimum of 24 hours as the gold standard for seizure diagnosis in the newborn.

There is increasing evidence that neonatal seizures are associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome, and that untreated seizures might add to the initial brain injury. Responsiveness to antiseizure medication may decrease with recurrent and prolonged seizures. The hypothesis that earlier treatment leads to better response is supported by animal work in mice and rats which has shown a progressive increase in intracellular chloride with recurrent seizures, increasing the likelihood of more seizures and decreasing the responsiveness to treatment. Current published guidelines for management of all neonatal seizures recommend initiation of antiseizure medication as soon as possible following seizure recognition, but there are no recommendations on specific target times for treatment. There remains significant variability in how seizures are diagnosed and managed, and a consensus is needed.

Our group previously showed that only 11% of "seizure episodes" were treated within the first hour after onset. Another study investigating the time from onset of aEEG seizure to treatment with antiseizure medication found that 32.1% of patients were treated within 1 hour of onset, 19.8% were treated within 1–2 hours of onset, and the majority (48.1%) were treated at > 2 hours after onset. The primary aim of our present analysis was to assess whether the time to treatment of first electrographic seizure has an impact on subsequent seizure burden. To achieve this goal, we used a large multicenter European neonatal cohort. Our secondary aim was to describe the initial seizure management for all infants included in this cohort.

### The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guideline on indications for continuous electroencephalography monitoring in neonates [^39ff751a]. Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology (2025). High credibility.

ACNS neonatal continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) guideline — scope and seizure definitions — focuses on hospitalized neonates, defined as those of postmenstrual age less than 48 weeks, and does not address outpatient neonatal EEG or "routine" EEG of duration less than 60 minutes. An EEG seizure was defined as a paroxysmal, rhythmic, evolving event on EEG lasting 10 seconds or longer; electrographic-only (EEG-only) seizures were defined as seizures evident only on EEG without clear accompanying clinical signs, and electroclinical seizures were defined as those with both ictal evolution on EEG and simultaneous clinical signs. The guideline states that it provides recommendations regarding which patients would most benefit from cEEG, but does not constitute a universal standard of care and is not exhaustive for all patients who might benefit from cEEG.

Neonatal cEEG — definite seizures after treatment (Recommendation 4): We suggest cEEG use in neonates with definite seizures to assess for seizure control after treatment, rated as a conditional recommendation with very low quality of evidence, and there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against cEEG after weaning or discontinuing antiseizure medications. The evidence base comprised 34 studies (3 RCTs, 13 prospective observational studies, and 18 retrospective studies). Supporting data include reports that cEEG was superior to clinical diagnosis alone to confirm seizure control after antiseizure medications and that 24 hours or more of cEEG after ASM treatment is superior to EEG of 1 hour or shorter duration to confirm resolution; implementation challenges such as difficulty providing respiratory support due to head positioning were noted, although benefits were found to outweigh potential harms.

### A machine-learning algorithm for neonatal seizure recognition: a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial [^9c0ae345]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of continuous conventional electroencephalography (cEEG), accurate diagnosis of neonatal seizures is challenging in clinical practice. Algorithms for decision support in the recognition of neonatal seizures could improve detection. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of an automated seizure detection algorithm called Algorithm for Neonatal Seizure Recognition (ANSeR).

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, two-arm, parallel, controlled trial was done in eight neonatal centres across Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. Neonates with a corrected gestational age between 36 and 44 weeks with, or at significant risk of, seizures requiring EEG monitoring, received cEEG plus ANSeR linked to the EEG monitor displaying a seizure probability trend in real time (algorithm group) or cEEG monitoring alone (non-algorithm group). The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and false detection rate) of health-care professionals to identify neonates with electrographic seizures and seizure hours with and without the support of the ANSeR algorithm. Neonates with data on the outcome of interest were included in the analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02431780.

Findings

Between Feb 13, 2015, and Feb 7, 2017, 132 neonates were randomly assigned to the algorithm group and 132 to the non-algorithm group. Six neonates were excluded (four from the algorithm group and two from the non-algorithm group). Electrographic seizures were present in 32 (25·0%) of 128 neonates in the algorithm group and 38 (29·2%) of 130 neonates in the non-algorithm group. For recognition of neonates with electrographic seizures, sensitivity was 81·3% (95% CI 66·7–93·3) in the algorithm group and 89·5% (78·4–97·5) in the non-algorithm group; specificity was 84·4% (95% CI 76·9–91·0) in the algorithm group and 89·1% (82·5–94·7) in the non-algorithm group; and the false detection rate was 36·6% (95% CI 22·7–52·1) in the algorithm group and 22·7% (11·6–35·9) in the non-algorithm group. We identified 659 h in which seizures occurred (seizure hours): 268 h in the algorithm versus 391 h in the non-algorithm group. The percentage of seizure hours correctly identified was higher in the algorithm group than in the non-algorithm group (177 [66·0%; 95% CI 53·8–77·3] of 268 h vs 177 [45·3%; 34·5–58·3] of 391 h; difference 20·8% [3·6–37·1]). No significant differences were seen in the percentage of neonates with seizures given at least one inappropriate antiseizure medication (37·5% [95% CI 25·0 to 56·3] vs 31·6% [21·1 to 47·4]; difference 5·9% [-14·0 to 26·3]).

Interpretation

ANSeR, a machine-learning algorithm, is safe and able to accurately detect neonatal seizures. Although the algorithm did not enhance identification of individual neonates with seizures beyond conventional EEG, recognition of seizure hours was improved with use of ANSeR. The benefit might be greater in less experienced centres, but further study is required.

### Ictal electroencephalograms in neonatal seizures: characteristics and associations [^9e6e51dc]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The characteristics of ictal electroencephalograms in 160 neonatal seizures of 43 babies were correlated with mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Neonatal seizures are focal at onset, most frequently temporal, and often occur during sleep. Twenty-one percent of babies with seizures died, and 76% of survivors manifested neurodevelopmental impairment during 2-6-year follow-up. A low-amplitude ictal electroencephalogram discharge was associated with increased mortality, and a frequency of < 2 Hz with increased morbidity. Status epilepticus, ictal fractions, multiple foci, and bihemispheric involvement did not influence outcomes. Of 160 seizures, 99 exhibited no associated clinical features (electrographic seizures). Neonatal seizures with clinical correlates (electroclinical seizures) exhibited a higher amplitude and frequency of ictal electroencephalogram discharge than electrographic seizures. During electroclinical seizures, the ictal electroencephalogram was more likely to involve larger areas of the brain and to cross the midline. Mortality and morbidity were similar in babies with electroclinical and electrographic seizures, emphasizing the need to diagnose and treat both types. Ictal electroencephalogram topography has implications for electrode application during limited-channel, amplitude-integrated electroencephalograms. We recommend temporal and paracentral electrodes. Video electroencephalograms are important in diagnosing neonatal seizures and providing useful information regarding ictal electroencephalogram characteristics.

### Electrographic monitoring for seizure detection in the neonatal unit: current status and future direction [^82faeb0e]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Seizures are a neonatal emergency and detection/treatment plays a major part in neurocritical care. The aetiology of seizures and seizure burden are associated with long-term outcomes. The methods used to monitor infants at high risk of seizures such as encephalopathic infants, combine subjective and objective measures using gold standard cEEG with video, and aEEG. Despite an increased focus on neonatal neurocritical care, neuromonitoring remains challenged by the availability of technology and the resources to ensure timely access and interpretation of EEG by expert neurophysiologists.

With regards to seizure monitoring and seizure detection in the neonate, three key issues must be considered:
EEG monitoring is a reliable cot-side neuromonitoring tool and of diagnostic and prognostic use, but is of no benefit to the infant if timely interpretation is not available.
cEEG and aEEG are used variably in units across the world. Both have strengths and limitations including sensitivity to seizure activity and ease of interpretation.
Automated seizure detection algorithms are beneficial to units with and without access to expert interpretation.

Neonatal seizure outome measures

Introduction

Continuous video electroencephalography (cvEEG) is the gold standard for seizure detection in neonates, as it is well established that the clinical evaluation of seizures without cvEEG confirmation can lead to both over- and under-diagnosis. Continuous video-EEG monitoring is essential since subclinical seizures occur in most neonates and as many as 16% have only subclinical seizures, particularly those with severe encephalopathy and/or receiving sedative medications. Both the FDA and EMA recognize the incontrovertible data showing the superiority of multichannel cvEEG monitoring for accurate detection of neonatal seizures compared with reduced montage devices such as aEEG, or EEG without video. Seizures are accurately detected with high inter-rater reliability when read by pediatric neurophysiologists, who should be the readers for any ASD trial evaluating drug response or efficacy. Thus, multichannel (minimum 8–20 channels) cvEEG monitoring is needed for accurate detection of seizures to determine drug response in neonatal seizure trials in order to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA and EMA. The measure of choice to assess drug efficacy is neonatal seizure burden measured in minutes of seizure activity per hour by cvEEG.,

To establish a robust primary outcome measure for a clinical trial of neonatal seizure treatment, we reviewed the available literature regarding treatment of neonatal seizures and performed an international survey of neonatologists, pediatric neurologists, and other expert clinicians who treat neonatal seizures. The literature review showed that a pre-treatment baseline period and response to treatment were rarely defined clearly, although an 80% reduction in seizure burden was the most commonly cited desired drug response. Although the international survey yielded variable opinions regarding the pre-treatment seizure burden that should prompt treatment, an 80% reduction in seizure burden was designated an optimal drug response. See "Supplemental Appendix 1 (online) " for Literature Review and Results of International Survey. As there is no current consensus on how treatment efficacy for neonatal seizures should be measured or data that define what specific reduction in seizure burden improves neurologic outcome, we propose the following:

### Why monitor the neonatal brain-that is the important question [^82c3343f]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A key goal of neonatal neurocritical care is improved outcomes, and brain monitoring plays an essential role.

ACNS guideline recommendation — We Suggest continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) use in neonates to improve accuracy of seizure diagnosis in clinically suspected seizures, as compared with clinical observation alone, amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) alone, or routine/spot EEG (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Quality of Evidence). Consistently across 57 studies including both term and preterm neonates with clinically suspected seizures due to heterogeneous etiologies, cEEG substantially improved the accuracy of seizure diagnosis, and this was true when cEEG was compared with clinical diagnosis, aEEG alone, or to routine/spot EEG. However, few studies directly compared EEG modalities simultaneously in the same neonates, and the overall quality of evidence was very low.

### The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guideline on indications for continuous electroencephalography monitoring in neonates [^aa8c02cc]. Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal continuous EEG (cEEG) for seizure screening without clinically evident seizures — timing and initiation are variably supported across conditions. Evidence in hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy indicates that 24 or more hours of cEEG is superior to less than 60 minutes. After congenital heart disease repair, seizures can appear as soon as 6 hours and the median time to seizure is just more than 24 hours, so cEEG would be of highest yield within 6 hours and up to 48 hours postoperatively. During extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cEEG should be initiated as soon as possible after cannulation with duration based on ongoing risk and neurologic evolution, and in hyperammonemia continuous EEG should be initiated at diagnosis with duration based on plasma levels and ongoing risk. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to make a formal recommendation on timing across conditions, and given feasibility and evidence limitations, this recommendation to monitor for seizures in high-risk neonates is conditional.

With routine/spot EEG, seizures were first detected by clinical manifestations in 85% of neonates, whereas after cEEG was available seizures were first detected on EEG in 33%; EEG-only seizures were diagnosed almost exclusively after cEEG became available (27 vs. 2%). In 98 neonates with cEEG-monitored seizures, only 50 of 98 (51%) had their first seizure in the first hour, with the remainder diagnosed with prolonged monitoring. Despite very low overall quality, the body of evidence strongly favors benefits of cEEG over clinician observation alone, amplitude‑integrated EEG (aEEG) alone, or routine/spot EEG alone to improve diagnostic accuracy; given resource intensity and feasibility limits, this recommendation is conditional.

### Outcomes following electrographic seizures and electrographic status epilepticus in the pediatric and neonatal ICUs [^3145245b]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Increasing recognition of electrographic seizures and electrographic status epilepticus in critically ill neonates and children has highlighted the importance of identifying their potential contributions to neurological outcomes to guide optimal management.

Recent Findings

Recent studies in children and neonates have found an independent association between increasing seizure burden and worse short-term and long-term outcomes, even after adjusting for other important contributors to outcome such as seizure cause and illness severity. The risk of worse neurological outcome has been shown to increase above a seizure burden threshold of 12-13min/h, which is considerably lower than the conventional definition of status epilepticus of 30min/h. Randomized controlled trials in neonates have demonstrated that electroencephalography-targeted therapy can successfully reduce seizure burden, but due to their small size these trials have not been able to demonstrate that more aggressive electroencephalography-targeted treatment of both subclinical and clinical seizures results in improved outcome.

Summary

Despite mounting evidence for an independent association between increasing seizure burden and worse outcome, further study is needed to determine whether early seizure identification and aggressive antiseizure treatment can improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Leveraging electronic medical record-embedded standardised electroencephalogram reporting to develop neonatal seizure prediction models: a retrospective cohort study [^42ba98fe]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal seizures are common and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy have a high incidence of seizures (about 30%), – which are identified mostly by electroencephalogram (EEG) only and would not be identified by clinical observation alone. Additionally, among neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, seizures have been associated with an increased risk of subsequent neurobehavioural problems and epilepsy.– Because of the high risk of seizures in this population, guidelines recommend that neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy undergo continuous EEG (CEEG) monitoring during the periods of therapeutic hypothermia and return to normothermia, which often last 4–5 days. However, this practice is resource intensive and not feasible for all neonates who might benefitbecause many neonates receive care in neonatal intensive care units without CEEG capability and approaches to remote CEEG are not widely available. Furthermore, CEEG is not entirely benign, as long-term electrode placement can cause skin breakdownand the necessary wires and head-wrap can interfere with parent–infant physical interaction and feeding. Therefore, it would be helpful to predict each individual's risk of seizure to optimise resource allocation and minimise unnecessary medical procedures by targeting CEEG to neonates at the highest risk of seizures.

Previous studies have shown that the prediction of neonatal seizures is complex, and clinical and EEG data generally do not predict seizures well. Clinical features alone are not predictive of seizures in neonates. EEG studies have found that although normal backgrounds correctly predict the absence of seizures, an abnormal background does not accurately predict the presence of seizures.– Seizure prediction models based on EEG features determined by manual review of EEG segments, – review of EEG reports, or direct computational analysis of EEG tracingshave been limited by small sample sizes or the short windows of review, and only a few have been tested in neonates.– Due to the need for manual chart or EEG review, the existing models cannot easily be incorporated into routine clinical care.

We implemented a standardised reporting template for all clinical EEG reports derived from terminology published by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS), and have previously shown that this reporting system is acceptable to electroencephalographers. In this study, we aimed to determine whether this standardised template leads to complete reporting of the recommended EEG features, and we aimed to develop neonatal seizure prediction models based on data extracted from these reports to optimise CEEG use among neonates, including the subset with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.

### Independent role of neonatal seizures in subsequent neurological outcomes: a population-based study [^9b4f07f7]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

This population-based study aimed to estimate the impact of neonatal seizures on subsequent neurological outcomes, regardless of underlying etiology.

Method

We performed a retrospective cohort study (1st January 2009-31st December 2014), using a USA nationwide claims database. Newborn infants enrolled in 2009 were followed for up to 6 years. Neonatal seizures were identified by combining the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code of 779.0 (convulsions in newborn), procedure codes of electroencephalogram and brain imaging, and antiepileptic drugs claims. Cox regression models were built to estimate the independent impact of neonatal seizures on developing epilepsy, intellectual disability, psychiatric/behavioral disorders, and headache.

Results

Out of 490 071 newborn infants (251 850 males [51.4%], 238 221 females [48.6%]), 800 neonatal seizure cases were identified. After controlling for sex, birthweight, preterm birth status, and underlying etiology, neonates with seizures were more likely to have epilepsy (hazard ratio = 32.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.7–38.7; p < 0.001), intellectual disability (hazard ratio = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.8–2.3; p < 0.001), and headache (hazard ratio = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1–2.2; p = 0.013) than those without seizures.

Interpretation

Observed covariates being equal, seizures in neonates appeared to play a significant role in developing epilepsy, intellectual disability, and headache. The findings showed a detrimental impact of the event in the very early life on neurological outcomes in later life.

What This Paper Adds

Seizures had their own impact on the development of adverse neurological outcomes. The magnitude of impact was quite large in epilepsy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® seizures-child [^feacb8fc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In children, seizures represent an extremely heterogeneous group of medical conditions ranging from benign cases, such as a simple febrile seizure, to life-threatening situations, such as status epilepticus. Underlying causes of seizures also represent a wide range of pathologies from idiopathic cases, usually genetic, to a variety of acute and chronic intracranial or systemic abnormalities. This document discusses appropriate utilization of neuroimaging tests in a child with seizures. The clinical scenarios in this document take into consideration different circumstances at the time of a child's presentation including the patient's age, precipitating event (if any), and clinical and electroencephalogram findings and include neonatal seizures, simple and complex febrile seizures, post-traumatic seizures, focal seizures, primary generalized seizures in a neurologically normal child, and generalized seizures in neurologically abnormal child. This practical approach aims to guide clinicians in clinical decision-making and to help identify efficient and appropriate imaging workup. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Characterisation of neonatal seizures and their treatment using continuous EEG monitoring: a multicentre experience [^57c118f3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Substantial technological advances have facilitated prolonged continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) recording, but the diagnosis and management of neonatal seizures remains challenging. Interpretation of the neonatal EEG is a highly specialised skill. Very few neonatal units have rapid access to expert neurophysiology opinion, although the majority have equipment suitable for amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) or cEEG monitoring. In future, automated seizure detection should inform clinical decision making and reduce the time required for experts to review long recordings. Prolonged cEEG recordings have confirmed the extent of the mismatch between clinical seizures and the electrographic seizure burden, and have revealed the true extent of the seizure burden present in many neurologically sick neonates. cEEG is currently recommended by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for neonates. A recent multicentre cEEG study in the USA found that 59% of neonates with clinically suspected seizures who were monitored for at least 24 hours had more than seven seizures, and 16% developed status epilepticus (SE).

The subtle nature of clinical seizures in neonates leads to both overdiagnosis and under-recognition. The problem of 'clinically silent' or 'electrographic only' seizures (electroclinical dissociation) is particularly prevalent in this age group. The mismatch increases after the administration of antiepileptic drugs, when it has been termed 'uncoupling'. Current estimates suggest that the mortality among neonates with seizures is around 10%, and 50% of those who survive have a significant disability. The debate regarding whether or not to treat to electrographic seizure quiescence, and whether achieving this would improve the prognosis, continues. Treatment on the basis of clinical diagnosis alone is the current standard of care in many neonatal units, but this policy carries risks. Undertreatment may lead to 'kindling' of additional seizures, adding to any pre-existing brain injury, and permanently altering seizure thresholds in the brain. On the other hand, overtreatment of neonates with antiepileptic drugs carries the risk of using neurotoxic medications, prolonging intensive care (with associated costs and parental separation) and exposing the newborn to potential complications from intensive care procedures or sedation.

The aim of this multicentre study was to describe detailed characteristics of electrographic seizures in a large cohort of term neonates in Europe monitored with cEEG. A secondary aim was to establish how and when seizures were treated during cEEG monitoring. We also aimed to establish a European network with shared definitions and a common platform for EEG and data collection, in order to facilitate future collaborative multicentre research in this important area.

### A machine-learning algorithm for neonatal seizure recognition: a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial [^16a4f74c]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Newborn infants can exhibit a range of unusual repetitive movements, not all of which are seizures. Recognition of seizures is vital because they are often a sign of an underlying neurological condition such as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, stroke, or meningitis, and because treatment for non-seizure events exposes infants to unnecessary harmful drugs. The diagnosis of neonatal seizures is challenging for clinicians because most neonatal seizures are electrographic only, clinical signs can become uncoupled after medication, and, even when present, clinical signs can be subtle and hard to distinguish from the normal repertoire of neonatal movements. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is often used by neonatologists for seizure detection, but limitations have been reported. Continuous conventional EEG (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for the diagnosis of all seizures. Evidence suggests that regardless of the underlying cause, seizures themselves have a negative effect on neurodevelopment, adding to the importance of early recognition and treatment. Despite the availability of cEEG in some neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and the growth of neonatal neurocritical care, early and accurate diagnosis of seizures and prompt treatment remain a challenge. Accurate EEG interpretation requires expert input, which is not readily available in most NICUs worldwide, even in high-income countries; it is also expensive and time intensive.

### Status epilepticus in the neonate [^db4c7ee0]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Treatment

The treatment of NS and NSE is part of a continuum. What to treat, when to treat and with what to treat are still debated in the NS and NSE arena. Lack of a universally accepted definition of an EEG seizure and status epilepticus in the neonate, varied classification of neonatal seizures (combinations of clinical only, ESZ only and ECSZs), and uncertainty regarding impact of pretreatment delay have resulted in a wide spectrum of protocols in clinical care and trials. Treatment is also guided by clinical features (seizure frequency, seizure duration), EEG features (background, ictal and interictal discharges) and seizure burden before and after initiation of ASM. There is general agreement that treating all electrographic seizures (ESZs and ECSZs) may be associated with improved outcomes.EEG confirmation of seizures is essential; however, in resource-limited settings, treatment is often based on aEEG or clinical diagnosis only.

Protocol design

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

ASD trials should include neonates with EEG-proven and/or high suspicion of clinical seizures or neonates at high risk of seizures, such as neonates with neonatal encephalopathy caused by HIE, stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Neonates with clinical seizures or high risk of seizures should be included to optimize enrollment and randomization of neonates as early as possible in the course of seizures, but ideally should be randomized only if EEG-proven seizures occur. Trial designs should specify the minimum seizure burden required for enrollment and randomization (see Primary Outcome section), and receipt of pre-approved first-line ASD, if add-on design is used. The following criteria should be considered:

### Effect of treatment of clinical seizures vs electrographic seizures in full-term and near-term neonates: a randomized clinical trial [^dfd4b78b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Seizures are the most common manifestation of neonatal encephalopathy, and with an estimated incidence of 1 to 5 per 1000 live births in term newborns, they are more common in the neonatal period than during any other time of life. The neurodevelopmental associations of neonatal seizures have been extensively described. They include motor and cognitive deficits, behavioral problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, and postneonatal epilepsy. While increased seizure burden is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment, there is evidence that even a single neonatal seizure can alter synaptic plasticity and have detrimental effects on cognitive functions, such as memory. The increasing awareness of the dangers of neonatal seizures has engendered a liberal approach to the use of anticonvulsants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Most neonatal seizures are subclinical; thus, bedside neuromonitoring with amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) has been widely adopted in NICUs, to achieve recognition of most electrographic seizuresand improve diagnostic precision. While the standard investigation for seizures in the NICU is still conventional EEG (cEEG), aEEG monitoring systems are suited to continuous use and bedside interpretation. In studies comparing cEEG with aEEG, aEEG has been shown to have sensitivity and specificity between 70% to 80% for detecting electrographic seizures.

Anticonvulsant pharmacotherapy for neonatal seizures has changed little during the last 50 years. Almost all neonatologists still use phenobarbital as the first-line agent. Until 2020, the only published randomized controlled trial comparing anticonvulsants in neonates showed that phenobarbital was relatively ineffective as a first-line anticonvulsant, though similar to phenytoin, the other most popular drug used in the late 1990s. Rodent studies have shown that both phenobarbital and numerous other anticonvulsants can cause both apoptotic neurodegenerationand disrupted striatal synaptic developmentwhen administered during critical periods of brain development.

Clinicians are generally aware that most neonatal seizures are subclinical and that antiepileptic drugs are relatively ineffective and potentially harm the developing brain. Furthermore, the drugs and other disease-modifying treatments, such as therapeutic hypothermia, suppress clinical seizures more than electrical seizures. Electrical seizure detection using aEEG has, if anything, accentuated the dilemma — should all electrographic seizures, even without a clinical correlate, be treated to reduce the risk of subsequent impairment, or do the treatments themselves contribute to neurological disruption and injury?

### Amplitude-integrated electro-encephalography: the child neurologist's perspective [^14371e56]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurologists increasingly recognize that critically ill patients are at high risk for seizures, particularly nonconvulsive seizures, and that neuromonitoring is a useful tool for diagnosing seizures and assessing brain function in these patients. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (EEG) is a simplified bedside neurophysiology tool that has become widely used in neonates over the past decade. Despite widespread interest by both neurologists and neonatologists in continuous brain monitoring, amplitude-integrated EEG has been largely ignored by neurologists, forcing neonatologists to "go it alone" when interpreting data from this bedside tool. Although amplitude-integrated EEG cannot replace conventional EEG for background monitoring and detection of seizures, it remains a useful instrument that complements conventional EEG, is being widely adopted by neonatologists, and should be supported by neonatal neurologists.

In childhood, the risk for seizures is greatest in the neonatal period. Currently used therapies have limited efficacy.

This review includes an overview of current approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal seizures, identifies some of the critical factors that have limited progress, and highlights recent insights about the pathophysiology of neonatal seizures that may provide the foundation for better treatment.

Most neonatal seizures are provoked or symptomatic in nature. However, a small number are of genetic origin and an early aetiological diagnosis may guide personalized therapy and influence aetiological classifications and outcomes.

It is important for the global health community to harness resources to facilitate good clinical care with early accurate diagnosis of seizures in the neonate, identification of aetiology, development of tailored treatment packages, evaluation of therapies, assessment of epilepsy, and other neurodevelopmental and health outcomes over an extended period of follow‐up, as well as precise prognostication. This study by Tinggaard et al. is a good addition to the literature in this area.

### Monitoring of seizures in the newborn [^dbece5c3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures are a distinct and not uncommon sign of neurological disease in the newborn, most often occurring in association with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy at term. The diagnosis and monitoring of seizures in the newborn is a considerable challenge, with many suspected clinical seizures having no electrographic correlates, while many electrographic seizures have no clinical correlate. Continuous video-EEG is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but few centres have the resources or expertise required. Amplitude-integrated EEG can be a helpful monitoring tool in experienced hands, but has potential for error when used by inexperienced staff. Automated seizure detection algorithms show much promise and some cotside systems are already available. The efficiency and accuracy of these systems is likely to improve.

### Neonatal electroencephalography: review of a practical approach [^72661759]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have routinely been performed for more than half a century. "Old" technical difficulties are no longer of concern with the advent of modern digital technology. Still, many "old" issues are at debate: characterization of neonatal EEG features, identification of EEG waveforms with potential clinical correlates, the role of neonatal EEG in prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome, and use of new devices. In the past decades, neonatal EEG and emerging issues' literature has greatly expanded. In this review, the authors have summarized some of these issues to increase the availability of the information for both clinical and research purposes. They propose an up-to-date concentrated practical approach to this rapidly expanding "subfield" of neonatal neurology.

### Impact of amplitude-integrated electroencephalograms on clinical care for neonates with seizures [^cc977a50]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) was recently introduced into neonatal intensive care in the United States. We evaluated whether aEEG has changed clinical care for neonates with seizures. This study included all 202 neonates treated for seizures at our hospital from 2002–2007. Neonates monitored with aEEG (n = 67) were compared with contemporary control neonates who were not monitored, despite the availability of aEEG (n = 57), and a historic control group of neonates treated for seizures before our neonatal intensive care unit initiated aEEG (n = 78). Eighty-two percent of those receiving phenobarbital (137/167) continued treatment after discharge, with no difference among groups. Adjusted for gestational age and length of stay, no difference among groups was evident in number of neuroimaging studies or number of antiepileptic drugs per patient. Fewer patients undergoing aEEG, compared with contemporary (16/67 vs 29/57, respectively, P = 0.001) or historic (n = 38/78, P = 0.002) controls, were diagnosed clinically with seizures without electrographic confirmation. We conclude that aEEG did not increase neuroimaging tests, and did not alter antiepileptic drug use. However, diagnostic precision regarding neonatal seizures improved with aEEG because fewer neonates were treated for seizures based solely on clinical findings, without electrographic confirmation.

### Sensitivity of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography for neonatal seizure detection [^3ab75b0c]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional electroencephalography remains the gold standard for the diagnosis and quantification of neonatal seizures. However, amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is being introduced to neonatal intensive care as an adjunct for neonatal seizure detection.

Objectives

This study's purpose was to determine the sensitivity of neonatal seizure detection in a single electroencephalogram channel (C3→ C4), used to simulate the raw signal from which aEEG is derived. We also aimed to determine the sensitivity of seizure detection by neonatologists by using aEEG and to establish those neonatal seizure characteristics that are associated with their correct detection by aEEG.

Methods

Conventional electroencephalograms with neonatal seizures were reviewed for electroencephalogram background and neonatal seizure characteristics (site of onset, duration, and peak-to-peak amplitude). The presence, duration, and peak-to-peak amplitude of each seizure were simultaneously noted in a single electroencephalogram channel (C3→ C4). aEEGs generated from this channel were reviewed for background and seizures by 6 neonatologists with varying aEEG interpretation expertise.

Results

A total of 851 neonatal seizures from 125 conventional electroencephalograms were analyzed. The patients' conceptional ages were 34 to 50 weeks. Because 94% of the conventional electroencephalograms had ≥ 1 neonatal seizure visible in C3→ C4, and 78% of all neonatal seizures appeared in the C3→ C4 channel, the theoretical sensitivity of seizure detection in a single electroencephalogram channel was high. However, seizures were briefer and lower in amplitude in C3→ C4 compared with conventional electroencephalography. Neonatologists identified seizures in 22% to 57% of the 125 records of neonatal seizure. They detected 12% to 38% of the 851 individual seizures. Multivariate analysis revealed that the appearance of seizures in C3→ C4, neonatal seizure duration, seizure amplitude, seizure count per hour, and neonatologists' experience with aEEG interpretation all correlated with neonatal seizure detection.

Conclusions

Even among physicians who have extensive experience, many neonatal seizures are difficult to detect on an aEEG, especially when they are infrequent, brief, or of low amplitude.

### The newborn drug development initiative workshop: summary proceedings from the neurology group on neonatal seizures [^bf1bcffa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The neonatal period eclipses all other epochs of the human life span for the highest incidence of seizures. Neonatal seizures are most commonly incited by serious acute illnesses such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, birth trauma, or infection.

Objective

The goal of this article was to summarize some of the Neurology Group's discussion on neonatal seizures and their treatment with phenobarbital (PB).

Methods

Information for this article was gathered from a workshop held March 29 and 30, 2004, in Baltimore, Maryland, as part of the Newborn Drug Development Initiative. A group of national experts was invited to form the Neurology Group to review certain aspects of neonatal seizures. Literature reviews were conducted using MEDLINE searches for original research studies, commentaries, and review articles between 1980 and 2004 using the key words neonatal seizures, treatment, and phenobarbital.

Results

It has been empirically established that infants who experience seizures face substantially higher mortality and morbidity rates than those who do not. Basic research indicates that neonatal seizures themselves are not innocuous and actively contribute to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current worldwide clinical practice most often includes empiric treatment with PB for definite or suspected seizures in the newborn. Unfortunately, this common practice has never been proven by even a single, rigorous, randomized controlled trial. The Neurology Group identified the treatment of neonatal seizures with PB as an important topic in the practice of neonatal neurology for further investigation. Three possible frameworks for ethically acceptable, clinical treatment trials were explored. From these, a suitable scenario was selected-an electroencephalographer-blinded study of PB versus placebo in a homogeneous group of newborns who are at high risk of developing early subclinical electroencephalographic neonatal seizures (ENSs). Prospective video-electroencephalogram monitoring performed immediately after an insult (such as major cardiac surgery for a serious congenital heart defect) would establish the presence and number of subclinical ENSs. For a brief period of time, neonates with subclinical ENSs would be randomized to PB (dosed to match the PB-binding characteristics of the individual) or placebo. Clear criteria for escape from the study to active treatment are defined.

Conclusion

The investigation proposed here could refute or confirm the contemporary practice of PB administration as the first-line treatment of neonatal seizures.

### Incidence of neonatal seizures in China based on electroencephalogram monitoring in neonatal neurocritical care units [^97b0a693]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The etiology of seizures is closely linked with the burden and mortality rate of critically ill newborns. Although genetic syndromes, CNS malformations, and inborn errors of metabolism accounted for merely 12.5% of all seizure cases, these infants experienced severe seizure burdens and a high rate of early death. Critically ill infants with these 3 major etiologies often face severe metabolic disorders, uncontrolled seizures, progressively worsening brain damage, or death during treatment, with a poor long-term prognosis. Therefore, we emphasize the need for heightened clinical vigilance for these types of patients. Prompt activation of genetic or other auxiliary tests should be initiated as soon as suspicion arises, aiming to secure time for intervention and treatment to improve prognosis.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, we lacked long-term outcome data and control data for high-risk infants not monitored with cEEG due to early funding constraints. We aim to create a large cEEG monitoring cohort for comparison. Second, we may have missed seizure cases without clinical symptoms by stopping monitoring after 4 hours. Despite ACNS recommendations of at least 24 hours of monitoring, implementing such continuous, large-scale monitoring was challenging. Future research might investigate the optimal cEEG monitoring duration. Furthermore, variability in cEEG analysis and reporting levels was expected despite our training measures, emphasizing the importance of experienced neurophysiologists and adherence to ACNS guidelines. Future studies could potentially involve a larger neonatal population and long-term follow-up.

### Electrographic seizures and status epilepticus in critically ill children and neonates with encephalopathy [^5d3b5ab0]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Electrographic seizures are seizures that are evident on EEG monitoring. They are common in critically ill children and neonates with acute encephalopathy. Most electrographic seizures have no associated clinical changes, and continuous EEG monitoring is necessary for identification. The effect of electrographic seizures on outcome is the focus of active investigation. Studies have shown that a high burden of electrographic seizures is associated with worsened clinical outcome after adjustment for cause and severity of brain injury, suggesting that a high burden of such seizures might independently contribute to secondary brain injury. Further research is needed to determine whether identification and management of electrographic seizures reduces secondary brain injury and improves outcome in critically ill children and neonates.

### Seizure control in neonates undergoing screening vs confirmatory EEG monitoring [^55aecd76]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Seizures in neonates are difficult to diagnose and often refractory to treatment. Up to two-thirds of neonates with acute symptomatic seizures have incomplete response to the initial loading dose of antiseizure medication (ASM). Strategies to improve treatment of neonates with seizures include the use of continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) to accurately diagnose seizures and assess response to treatment. It is unknown whether preemptive use of cEEG to screen for seizures in high-risk neonates improves odds of treatment success, as compared to initiating cEEG to confirm the diagnosis of seizures only after clinically suspected seizures occur.

We hypothesized that utilization of a screening cEEG rather than a confirmatory cEEG approach would improve the likelihood of prompt and successful response to initial ASM treatment for neonates with acute symptomatic seizures.

Preterm neonates — continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) for prognostication and risk stratification: "We Suggest cEEG Use in Preterm Neonates for Assessment of Interictal Background Patterns as Part of Risk Stratification for Evolving Brain Injury and Prediction of Death or Neurodevelopmental Disability. (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Quality of Evidence)". The guideline review states "We reviewed 34 articles to evaluate the use of cEEG in preterm neonates for purposes other than seizure detection", and that "cEEG can provide prognostic information and identify risk for evolving brain injury for preterm infants" using interictal features "including presence or absence of sleep–wake cycling, degree of discontinuity, asynchrony, asymmetry, presence or absence of normal graphoelements, and excessive positive sharp waves". Notably, "positive sharp waves in the central and vertex regions were shown to have high specificity for underlying white matter injury (specificity 100%, sensitivity 32% for white matter lesions; specificity 83%, sensitivity 27% for intraventricular hemorrhage in an autopsy study of 39 preterm infants)". Prognostic value increases with evolution over time, with "the result of EEG at 36 weeks PMA or greater" predictive of outcomes "at 12 to 36 months", and "cEEG-confirmed seizures, especially status epilepticus, are associated with a high risk for unfavorable outcomes". Overall, "The balance of benefits versus harms favors cEEG for assessment of interictal background patterns as part of risk stratification for evolving brain injury and prediction of death or neurodevelopmental disability. However, the quality of evidence is very low".

Discussion

Seizures are common among neonates with certain high-risk conditions, and they often lack distinct clinical signs. Accurate diagnosis of neonatal seizures relies on EEG confirmation. Screening cEEG allows detection of electrographic-only seizures and definitive diagnosis of clinically suspected seizures. Furthermore, in neonates, ASM administration can result in suppression of outward clinical signs while electrographic seizures persist (known as electroclinical "uncoupling"); cEEG is necessary to accurately assess response to ASM treatment. For this reason, some centers have developed pathways to employ cEEG for seizure detection among all neonates in high-risk groups, such as those with HIE or other conditions. Similarly, the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society has published guidelines for clinical conditions in which cEEG is indicated due to a high risk of seizures. The American Academy of Pediatrics has suggested that centers providing therapeutic hypothermia to neonates with HIE should also have the ability to provide cEEG or amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring for seizure detection. A recent survey of NICU practices in California found the majority of centers performed some degree of EEG monitoring among all neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for HIE. The goal of using cEEG as a tool to screen for seizures among high-risk neonates is to facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and thereby more effective treatment, while avoiding ASM administration for seizure mimics.

At the same time, cEEG is resource-intensive, and may not be available for all high-risk neonates at all hospitals. Among neonates with HIE treated with hypothermia, fewer than half have seizures on EEG. Among groups of newborns with other risk factors, the incidence is even lower. For this reason, some centers have employed a strategy of initiating cEEG only when there is a clinical suspicion for seizure, such as an abnormal paroxysmal movement suspected to be seizure. This confirmatory cEEG strategy allows lower use of resources than screening all neonates at risk. It is unknown to what degree this approach misses high-risk neonates with seizures that do not have clinical manifestations or delays seizure diagnosis and treatment.

There is a paucity of evidence regarding the effect of cEEG strategy on short- and long-term outcomes. A randomized trial of screening vs confirmatory cEEG in neonates at risk for seizures is unlikely to occur, due both to a lack of equipoise at individual centers and the high expense of such a trial. In the absence of a randomized trial, other types of evidence must be sought to understand the effect of cEEG approaches on outcomes.

### The risk of epilepsy after neonatal seizures [^5d800164]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other neurodevelopmental disorders (genetic syndromes, CP, intellectual disability, neuropsychiatric disorders) often coexist with epilepsy, which may be explained by an inherent genetic risk. However, a causal relationship between later epilepsy and comorbidities was not possible to disentangle statistically from the current study. Few studies report on the relationship between neonatal seizures and later febrile seizures without subsequent epilepsy. Whether the increased risk of febrile seizures after neonatal seizures can be explained by a lower seizure threshold due to perinatal factors, genetic factors, or neonatal seizures per se is not clear. A genetic predisposition to febrile seizures is well known, and some genetic variants may predispose to both neonatal and febrile seizures.

We present data from a large population‐based study, the largest to date, with nearly 2000 cases of neonatal seizures, which is a major strength of our study along with the longest follow‐up to date. Another strength are the Danish registries linked to the unique Danish personal identification number, which enable these large studies. We interpret our results as valid and generalizable to populations with similar demographics. However, our study also has limitations. In the clinical handling of seizures in neonates, the clinician uses the ILAE neonatal seizure definition. For the later diagnosis of epilepsy, the ILAE classification of epilepsy is applied. In the classification of epilepsy, diagnosis must follow either two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart, one unprovoked seizure and a risk above 60% for recurrence, or classification of an epilepsy syndrome. In neonates, the clinical diagnosis of neonatal seizures can be difficult because there can be many epileptic and non‐epileptic clinical manifestations in often clinically ill neonates. The neonatal classification emphasizes the role of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures. Many neonatal seizures are electrographic‐only, with no evident clinical features. Clinical events without an EEG correlate are not included. Our set‐up depends on routine diagnosis and reporting from hospital admissions; a potential bias is an underestimation of the true number of neonatal seizures if electrographic‐only seizures or milder manifestations are not registered. Such bias would contribute to a higher risk of epilepsy in our group of interest because only severe cases are noted with neonatal seizures. In contrast, an overestimation of neonatal seizures is also possible; however, since the prevalence of neonatal seizures in our cohort was low compared with previous population‐based studies, we find this less likely. Diagnosis of neonatal seizures with the availability of amplitude‐integrated EEG, EEG, and neurophysiologist assistance has evolved; although EEG monitoring with video is the criterion standard to diagnose neonatal seizures, this may never be implemented systematically in clinical care in all neonatal care units. Our study was based on population‐based data that rely on reporting from vital statistics and hospital discharge diagnoses. All neonates were included, both from low‐acuity and high‐acuity centres. EEG and amplitude‐integrated EEG has been available in many centres in the period, nevertheless it is likely that the diagnoses may, in many cases, reflect a clinical diagnosis of seizures.

Resource and implementation considerations for continuous electroencephalography (cEEG): "cEEG is known to be resource intensive". "When cEEG results have a likelihood of altering clinical decision making, the authors considered the resource investment was justifiable", with examples that include "neuroimaging in cases of asymmetry or evolving deterioration of the interictal background, initiation of antiseizure medication, counseling around goals of care, or referral to early intervention therapies". Nonetheless, "cEEG is not feasible in all settings", and "Given this, and the very low quality of evidence, this recommendation is conditional".

### Neonatal seizure management: is the timing of treatment critical? [^56c0e396]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of infants who received antiseizure medication exclusively during EEG monitoring had demonstrated electrographic seizures; however, 40 infants received antiseizure medication exclusively during EEG monitoring and had no evidence of electrographic seizures. Most of the infants who did not receive antiseizure medication had no electrographic seizures throughout the duration of EEG monitoring (203 infants); however, 11 infants with electrographic seizures had no treatment. Among these 11 infants with electrographic seizures, 6 had a total seizure burden of > 20 minutes and 2 had status epilepticus. These results demonstrate that recognition of seizures remains a major challenge for neonatologists and inappropriate antiseizure medication treatment (undertreatment and overtreatment) remains an ongoing concern. Animal and human studies have documented that exposure to antiseizure medication can lead to neuronal apoptosis, poor brain development, and later cognitive impairments; therefore, it is important to administer antiseizure medication appropriately to infants who may already have some degree of brain injury. These results illustrate the diagnostic difficulties that clinicians face, even when the gold standard diagnostic tool (cEEG) is used. Current guidelines recommend the use of cEEG monitoring for at least 24 hours to detect seizures in neonates, but there are no clear protocols for EEG review, and neurophysiologic support is limited even in tertiary neonatal centers. Implementation of EEG monitoring and seizure management protocols and specific EEG review and interpretation training have been shown to be beneficial.

### EEG background activity, seizure burden and early childhood outcomes in neonatal encephalopathy in Uganda: a prospective feasibility cohort study [^0e3c2fb8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Whilst EEG is considered the gold standard for monitoring of brain activity and detection of seizures in neonates, it is rarely available in LICs as part of routine clinical practice. EEG monitoring is feasible to use as a research tool in the sub-Saharan African setting and can provide unique insights into background brain activity, seizure prevalence and burden. Clinical assessment of newborns using an established scored neurological assessment can identify those with moderate to severe brain dysfunction. The seizure prevalence and burden, including status epilepticus, was high in this uncooled cohort with important potential implications for longer term outcomes amongst surviving children. Novel innovations to monitor brain dysfunction in diverse settings, could substantially improve our understanding of NE and support clinical management of seizures. More data is needed from LMIC settings to better understand the role of brain dysfunction and seizures, including the longer-term impacts for affected children and families, to support the identification of future potential neuroprotective strategies.

Neonatal clinical observation alone — In studies of neonates with a clinical diagnosis of seizure, 33 to 85% of neonates clinically thought to have seizures did not have seizures confirmed on cEEG, with most reports describing more than half of neonates found not to have cEEG seizures; this was as high as 96% in a series on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 90% in a small series with hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, and 100% in a mixed group. Among neonates with clinical seizures that were confirmed by EEG, cEEG often identified a far greater seizure burden or number of seizures than were recognized clinically, and in some studies as many as 80 to 90% of seizures were subclinical; there was an association between higher seizure burden and the likelihood of seizures being subclinical/nonconvulsive. One small series reported that clinical observation had a sensitivity for individual seizures of 13% and specificity of 38%.

### Investigating and managing neonatal seizures in the UK: an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach [^d4ec289c]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Seizures are common in the neonatal period because of the relative excitability of the neonatal brain and high risk of pathologies leading to acute symptomatic seizures. The true incidence of neonatal seizures is unknown, but proposed rates are 3/1000 term live births and between 132/1000 preterm neonates One reason why incidence figures may be inaccurate is because neonatal seizures are difficult to diagnose: multiple studies using EEG have shown that most neonatal seizures have no clinical features at all (electrographic seizures), and the accurate differentiation of epileptic seizures from non-epileptic events based on clinical skills alone is poor. For example, one study of term neonates showed only 34% of neonatal seizures having had clinical features and 73% of suspected seizures having had no epileptiform discharges associated with them on electroencephalography (EEG). As a result, neurophysiological techniques are used to support diagnosis, but the gold standard, continuous video EEG, is not available in all UK neonatal units, and the logistics of siting leads, checking recording quality, starting the monitor, and interpreting the EEG, 24 h a day, 7 days a week are enormous. Instead, amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) is used routinely on neonatal units, particularly in term babies with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), and can detect 1/3 of single seizures and 2/3 of repetitive seizures, missing those that are brief or distant from the EEG leads. Having two channels and the single lead EEG trace available for review on the aEEG monitor improves seizure detection rates.

The current ILAE classification of seizures in the neonateemphasises the role of the EEG for diagnosis of NS. It does not require the 10 s duration rule for diagnosis of an EEG seizure. This allows inclusion of brief ECSZs such as myoclonic seizures and epileptic spasms. It has been proposed that brief EEG rhythmic discharges (BERDS, BRDs) of < 10 s duration are mini seizures, with prognostic implication. The ILAE papersuggests that BRDs in neonates may be part of the ictal-interictal continuum. The question of whether BERDS/BRDS should be included in the seizure burden remains open and worthy of further study.

The EEG signature of seizures in neonates may be unique and difficult to recognise, requiring expertise in interpretation (figure 1). Combining clinical, VEEG, neuroimaging and genetic information may allow distinction between acute provoked seizures and the neonatal-onset epilepsies and identify aetiology-specific electroclinical syndromes (figure 1B), thus enabling more targeted interventions.

### ILAE classification and definition of epilepsy syndromes with onset in neonates and infants: position statement by the ILAE task force on nosology and definitions [^99708cdf]. Epilepsia (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on neonatal seizures:

- **Definition**: Neonatal seizures are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain of a newborn, typically occurring within the first 28 days of life, often with an acute brain injury or insult.
- **Pathophysiology**: Neonatal seizures arise when normal asynchronous cortical activity becomes synchronous, detected on electroencephalography as spike-and-slow-wave patterns. This aberrant firing often reflects a combination of enhanced neuronal connectivity, heightened excitatory transmission, and failed inhibitory mechanisms, all of which are influenced by developmental factors such as transient overexpression of glutamate receptors and the immature expression of GABA receptors. Most common causes of neonatal seizures are hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, infections, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Other causes may include hypoglycemia, CNS infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain malformations, metabolic disorders, genetic causes (such as mutations in KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A, PNKP, ARX genes), and drug withdrawal syndrome.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of neonatal seizures is estimated at 1–5 per 1,000 live births in full-term neonates and 14 per 1,000 in preterm neonates.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for neonatal seizures include smoking during pregnancy, nulliparity, advanced maternal age, increased maternal BMI, diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, maternal fever, chorioamnionitis, shoulder dystocia, placental abruption, assisted vaginal delivery, induced labor, and occiput posterior position at birth.
- **Disease course**: Seizures may present clinically or be detectable only on electroencephalography (subclinical). Seizure activity often begins focally but may generalize and involve the entire body. The clinical presentation varies widely depending on gestational age, underlying etiology, and concurrent medical conditions. Clinical seizures can include automatisms, clonic, myoclonic, or tonic seizures, epileptic spasms, autonomic seizures, behavioral arrest, sequential seizures, and other unclassified seizure types.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Neonatal seizures are associated with a 20% mortality rate and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including worsened motor and cognitive function compared with neonates without seizures, as well as an increased risk of remote seizures and epilepsy.

### Investigating and managing neonatal seizures in the UK: an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach [^a8233638]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Where neurophysiological techniques are used in neonates, consultants disagree on which method is the most suitable. Nearly all tertiary neonatology services routinely use aEEG, compared to 39.5% from secondary level neonatal and paediatric units. Although we did not plan our interview schedule to discuss the use of aEEG in secondary level units, one paediatrician in a district general hospital was actively seeking to purchase a monitor, whilst another thought it was inappropriate for their unit to have one because their staff lacked training and expertise in its use. Neonatal and neurology networks need to decide whether they support the introduction of aEEG into secondary level units and general paediatric wards. From a practical perspective, it is feasible with appropriate training and support, but others argue the National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommend young children with seizures should be reviewed by a paediatric neurologist, and aEEG may delay access to specialist opinion. Away from secondary level centres, neurologists prefer EEG and are wary of aEEG, thinking neonatologists place undue reliance on its ability to detect neonatal seizures. Some of this negativity may reflect neurologists' own lack of training and confidence in using aEEG. We should also be aware that, whilst EEG is seen as the gold standard investigation for the diagnosis of neonatal seizures, it is only as good as the neurophysiologist interpreting it, and differences in opinions on what EEG findings are neonatal seizures will exist in practice. In contrast, neonatologists recognise the value of EEG but do not have the same ease of access as neurologists, taking a pragmatic view that aEEG is a flawed tool, but one that allows for monitoring over longer periods of time than EEG, is more likely to capture recurrent seizures, is accessible, relatively easy to interpret, and better than clinical diagnosis on its own.

### Continuous EEG monitoring in neonates: one size does not fit all [^4d44de95]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2011 American Clinical Neurophysiology Society Guidelines on Continuous Electroencephalography Monitoring recommended tailoring the duration of monitoring based on the clinical scenario. The following points in the Guidelines are noteworthy:
Assessment of the EEG background requires a minimum of 1 hour in order to assess the effects of the sleep–wake cycle.
Neonates with high risk for seizures should be monitored for a minimum of 24 hours to screen for seizures. Infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for HIE and those undergoing congenital heart surgery have an elevated risk for seizures. Furthermore, seizures may occur even in the presence of a normal or mildly abnormal EEG background. In certain low-risk infants, EEG monitoring could be discontinued sooner after consulting with the child neurologist.
If seizures are detected, EEG monitoring should continue until the patient has been seizure-free for at least 24 hours (unless decided otherwise by the child neurologist).
EEG monitoring to evaluate suspicious clinical events (SCEs) should be long enough to capture multiple typical events.

Worden et al examined seizure occurrence in high-risk neonates and reported seizures in 28%. The probability of seizures was < 1% after 17 hours of EEG recording in those with SCEs but 42 hours in infants with other high-risk conditions (central nervous system [CNS] infection, CNS trauma, perinatal stroke, inborn errors of metabolism, genetic/syndromic conditions, cardiopulmonary risk factors, sinovenous thrombosis, prematurity with additional risk factors such as intraventricular hemorrhage or weaning antiseizure medication in a high-risk infant). By contrast, those with acute neonatal encephalopathy (ANE) had a longer period of seizure risk (< 1% after 73 hours); the median duration of monitoring for this group of infants was 84 hours. Epileptiform discharges increased the likelihood of seizures in each of the groups; when detected on early EEG recordings, they were predictive of seizures occurring within 24 hours in those with SCE. The finding of burst suppression on early EEGs increased seizure risk only in patients with ANE.

### Neonatal seizure management: is the timing of treatment critical? [^b3f1af2d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Seizure Analysis

This analysis included all the EEG monitoring performed for each infant, regardless of the time of study enrollment. Electrographic seizures were annotated by 1 of 4 neonatal neurophysiologists blinded to the infant's medical history and outcome. A standard EEG review protocol for seizure annotation was used. Electrographic seizures were defined as a minimum 10 seconds of sudden, repetitive, and evolving stereotyped waveforms involving at least 1 EEG channel. An infant was considered to have seizures if at least 1 electrographic seizure was annotated. The following summary measures of seizures were calculated: seizure period (time [in hours] from the beginning of the first electrographic seizure to the end of the last electrographic seizure), total seizure burden (duration [in minutes] of all seizures occurring during the entire monitoring period), maximum hourly seizure burden (maximum seizure burden within 1 hour [in minutes/hour]), status epilepticus (seizure burden in a minimum of 30 minutes within 1 hour), and number of seizures during the entire monitoring period. Seizure characteristics were described for all infants who experienced seizures during the EEG monitoring period.

Antiseizure Medication Treatment

EEG recordings were reviewed by local teams from each site in real time, and all seizures detected were managed according to local protocols. For each infant, antiseizure medication treatment was recorded in the study database (ie, type of drug, dose, and time of administration). The antiseizure medication was chosen according to local protocols and at the clinician's discretion.

### Recommendations for the design of therapeutic trials for neonatal seizures [^da6dd866]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The International Neonatal Consortium (INC) was formed by the Critical Path Institute (C-Path), an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace and reducing the costs of medical product development. The seizure working group of INC consists of key stakeholders from research institutions, the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, nursing groups, patient advocacy, and other organizations to develop guidelines/consensus recommendations for clinical trial design for treatment of neonatal seizures (Fig. 1). The inclusion of broad expertise and perspectives in this international group of experts resulted in a uniquely comprehensive set of recommendations for neonatal seizure trial design.

Fig. 1
Seizure workgroup collaborators

A modified Delphi processwas applied to develop the recommendations. Key areas for recommendations were agreed. Further topics were added from relevant guidance documents by regulatory authorities. Statements for the recommendations were formulated around the agreed key areas, followed by an iterative process of amendment and agreement until agreement was reached among the working groups before stakeholders provided further feedback and a final consensus was reached (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Delphi process to develop neonatal seizure trial recommendations

This paper describes a synthesis of views expressed by colleagues in EU and North America, which does not necessarily apply to colleagues in other jurisdictions, e.g. some clinicians in Japan thought video-EEG is not feasible for evaluating seizures. Nevertheless, the goal of the stakeholders in writing these recommendations is to ensure more successful and efficient trials of ASDs for this vulnerable population and, consequently, better antiseizure treatments. These recommendations are the crticial first step towards drafting a Master Protocol template to evaluate multiple ASDs or treatments in neonates, which is a priority for many regulatory agencies.

### Epilepsies in infancy [^88023992]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate and manage epileptic seizures and other paroxysmal events in infants, it is necessary to ask five key questions: (1) Is this a type of epilepsy?; (2) What seizure type(s) are occurring?; (3) Do these seizure types, combined with factors such as age at onset and EEG features, constitute an 'epilepsy syndrome'?; (4) What investigations do we need to do in searching for an underlying aetiology? and finally, (5) What is the prognosis for neurological and developmental state in later life? This review considers epilepsies that have an onset in infancy but after the perinatal period, outlines the commoner epilepsy syndromes occurring in this age group and describes paroxysmal events that can mimic epilepsy. Epilepsies in infancy may be the manifestation of a genetic predisposition associated with a benign course and good prognosis for neurodevelopment. In contrast, they may pose the challenging situation of 'epileptic encephalopathy', rare but potentially treatable metabolic conditions, or structural abnormalities with poor developmental outlook and intractable seizures. Seizures in infancy are relatively rare and there is a wide range of underlying causes, some of which require specific treatments to avoid preventable neurodevelopmental damage. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence suggests early referral of cases of infantile epilepsy to a tertiary centre.

### How helpful is aEEG? Context and user experience matter [^dbec922a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The scenario of the extremely preterm neonate illustrates a case that is very common, and also reflects the need for caution before acting on aEEG results in a neonate at low risk for seizures. Extremely preterm neonates have been reported to have an overall seizure prevalence of 5% when the gold standard of full array continuous EEG monitoring is applied prospectively. Because this is a relatively low pretest probability of seizures, even with the most expert level of aEEG interpretation, a positive test is not necessarily diagnostic. In our model, even with expert interpretation, the post-test probability of true seizures after positive aEEG was only 0.31. Again, while this may be high enough to justify more intensive diagnostics or monitoring, it may not be appropriate to initiate treatment based on this post-test probability alone.

This study has important limitations. These theoretical models, while based on evidence reported in the literature, cannot capture the nuances of every potential clinical scenario. We do not mean to claim that the post-test probabilities calculated here are accurate for actual individual patients. Rather, we chose these cases to illustrate examples of where aEEG could be most useful and when it might have lower utility. The pretest probabilities used are based on estimates of seizure prevalence for the selected conditions reported in the literature from population-based studies of large cohorts of neonates. The clinical scenarios outlined were selected to offer conditions commonly encountered in the neonatal intensive care unit with differing seizure prevalence to highlight the impact this has on test utility. Our estimates of the test characteristics sensitivity and specificity are based on those published across multiple studies of aEEG accuracy. Some of these studies used older equipment or methods of review, such as single-channel aEEG, that are less relevant to current practice at many centers. The estimates here for "expert", "intermediate", and "inexperienced" accuracy are only estimates; individual users may fall in between these categories or vary in accuracy in different situations. At the same time, these examples clearly illustrate the impact of varying skill in interpretation — with lower accuracy, aEEG gives much less useful information. This suggests that those using aEEG for seizure detection would benefit from having insight into their own skill level, thus recognizing their approximate sensitivity and specificity in interpretation. It also creates an opportunity to improve aEEG utility as increased experience and training to improve interpretation skill will improve test characteristics for a given user. Finally, we do not offer primary evidence from actual patient populations regarding how aEEG may improve care or change outcomes. This work uses only statistical approaches to illustrate examples of how patient selection and skill in interpretation impact aEEG utility, and should not be considered as definitive recommendations for which patients should or should not be monitored with aEEG.

### Characterisation of neonatal seizures and their treatment using continuous EEG monitoring: a multicentre experience [^b8a7d584]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

This study has a number of limitations. First, even though seizures were annotated by a group of board-certified electroencephalographers with specific experience in neonatal EEG, each EEG was not annotated by all four. Therefore, we do not have data on inter-rater agreement. However, we and others have previously shown that agreement for neonatal EEG seizure identification between expert reviewers is very high. Second, review of cEEG at each site was ad hoc and dependent on the individual neonate. There are no protocols in place for review of cEEG at any site as neurophysiology services are not available 24/7. Clinicians request review when concerns are raised on EEG or clinically for signs of seizures.

Third, while protocols do exist for the type of first-line, second-line and third-line AEDs to be used for the treatment of neonatal seizures, the recommended timing of administration of the AED is never stipulated. This is largely due to the fact that this detailed information has never been available before, that is, detailed EEG seizure information. In the absence of any clear guidelines for the optimal timing of AED administration, we arbitrarily expected that seizures should be treated within 1 hour of onset in order to be considered as having been appropriately treated.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: The current terminology used to define a seizure is confusing. Using strict terminology, a "seizure" is a sudden clinical event that has an outward change in neurologic function. Pathophysiologically, a "seizure" may or may not have an epileptic basis, with electroencephalography used primarily to differentiate these. An epileptic event is caused by a hypersynchronous neuronal discharge that is seen on EEG as an electrographic seizure. In newborns, however, many clinicians use the term neonatal seizure synonymously with epileptic seizure, thus assuming an epileptic mechanism. The International League Against Epilepsy glossary for seizure classification now uses the descriptor "epileptic" with seizure, which specifically assigns an epileptic mechanism to the clinical event.

In older children and adults, determining whether a seizure has an epileptic basis is more straightforward because of a greater association between epilepsy and. Comments.
