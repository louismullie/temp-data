## Question

Assеssmеnt of Livеr Function Tеsts in Patiеnts with Chronic Livеr Disеasеs: Corrеlation with Disеasе Sеvеrity and Prognosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how liver function tests correlate with disease severity and prognosis in chronic liver disease, and which tests and scores are most informative in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which laboratory parameters truly reflect liver function versus liver injury. Then, I should verify how well these tests track fibrosis stage and clinical decompensation. Next, I will review validated prognostic scores and their components. After that, I need to check the role of noninvasive fibrosis assessment and dynamic liver function tests. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize practical recommendations with caveats and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the distinction between liver injury markers and liver function tests, because conflating them leads to misinterpretation. ALT and AST are markers of hepatocellular injury and can be normal despite significant fibrosis, whereas bilirubin, albumin, INR, and platelet count better reflect synthetic function, cholestasis, and portal hypertension, respectively, and thus correlate more closely with disease severity and prognosis in chronic liver disease [^9f8e2324] [^fdeaf458] [^2a585b8d].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic value of individual components. Bilirubin and INR are consistently among the strongest predictors of short- and intermediate-term mortality in cirrhosis, and albumin tracks both synthetic capacity and systemic inflammation. Thrombocytopenia signals advanced fibrosis and portal hypertension, which is why platelet count is embedded in several fibrosis scores and why low platelets accompany worse outcomes in decompensated disease [^e827f462] [^c2e87ae8] [^15cc3e34].

> I should confirm how well routine liver tests correlate with fibrosis stage. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: aminotransferases correlate poorly with fibrosis, and many patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis have normal ALT/AST, whereas the AST/ALT ratio tends to rise as fibrosis advances, particularly in viral and alcoholic liver disease, and platelet count inversely correlates with fibrosis stage, which is why APRI and similar indices incorporate both AST and platelets to infer fibrosis noninvasively [^fdeaf458] [^15cc3e34] [^554c738c].

> Next, I should review validated prognostic scores and their components. The Child-Pugh score combines bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy and remains useful for surgical risk stratification and HCC treatment selection, though it includes subjective elements. MELD uses bilirubin, INR, and creatinine and is the cornerstone for transplant prioritization and short-term mortality prediction, with MELD-Na improving calibration. ALBI uses only albumin and bilirubin and performs at least as well as Child-Pugh in HCC cohorts, revealing heterogeneity even within Child-Pugh A patients [^84984ddd] [^f7165cd5] [^c2e87ae8].

> I need to check the role of noninvasive fibrosis assessment. Transient elastography predicts clinical decompensation and mortality better than biopsy stage in some cohorts, with thresholds around 10.5–12.5 kPa identifying patients at highest risk of events. Blood-based panels like FIB-4 and APRI are endorsed for initial fibrosis staging, though they have lower specificity and are less accurate for intermediate fibrosis than for cirrhosis, and emerging data suggest longitudinal changes in liver stiffness can track disease course when interpreted in clinical context [^0506807b] [^554c738c] [^65a861d9].

> Let me consider dynamic liver function tests. The galactose elimination capacity and indocyanine green retention tests quantify hepatic metabolic and excretory reserve, respectively, and correlate with survival in cirrhosis. However, they are not widely available and are mainly used in specialized centers or for surgical planning, so they complement rather than replace standard scores in routine care [^b6e9bf5a] [^546da8fe].

> But wait, what if the patient is in acute decompensation or ACLF. I should double-check that conventional cirrhosis scores can underestimate mortality in ACLF because they do not capture extrahepatic organ failures. CLIF-C ACLF, which counts organ failures, better reflects 28-day mortality, and MELD may underperform in this setting, so organ failure–aware scores are preferred in critically ill cirrhotic patients [^a33db3f4] [^2c1b317f] [^81c1336d].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In chronic hepatitis B, treatment thresholds use lower ALT cutoffs in many guidelines because normal ALT does not exclude active disease, reinforcing that aminotransferases are insensitive to fibrosis. In COVID-19, baseline liver test abnormalities and preexisting fibrosis markers associate with worse outcomes, likely reflecting systemic inflammation and preexisting liver vulnerability. In compensated disease, muscle function and fatigue may not independently predict outcomes, whereas sarcopenia becomes prognostically important in decompensated cirrhosis [^fdeaf458] [^2632b5bc] [^0616646b] [^f807d029].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and pitfalls. The magnitude of enzyme elevation does not reliably indicate severity, and many patients with advanced disease have normal LFTs. Coagulation tests reflect both hepatic synthesis and in vivo hemostatic balance, so INR predicts prognosis but is a poor standalone marker of bleeding risk. Noninvasive fibrosis tests can misclassify intermediate fibrosis, and biopsy remains the reference when results are discordant or when inflammation grading changes management [^fdeaf458] [^54f734bc] [^e0aaf58c].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. For initial assessment, use bilirubin, albumin, INR, and platelet count to estimate severity and risk, calculate MELD or MELD-Na for short-term mortality and transplant listing, and apply Child-Pugh or ALBI when relevant to treatment selection. Add FIB-4 or APRI and consider transient elastography to stage fibrosis noninvasively, reserving biopsy for discordant cases or when inflammation grading is needed. In decompensation or ACLF, prioritize organ failure–based scores like CLIF-C ACLF and reassess serially to guide escalation and transplant referral [^554c738c] [^84984ddd] [^2c1b317f].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that while aminotransferases signal injury, bilirubin, albumin, INR, and platelet count — especially when integrated into validated scores — correlate most strongly with disease severity and prognosis in chronic liver disease. Noninvasive fibrosis assessment and, when available, dynamic function tests add prognostic value, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and, in acute deterioration, with organ failure–aware models to avoid underestimating risk [^e827f462] [^0506807b] [^a33db3f4].

Liver function tests (LFTs) correlate with disease severity and prognosis in chronic liver disease, but **no single test is sufficient** [^51744ca2]. Bilirubin, INR, albumin, and platelets are the most informative for staging and prognosis, while AST/ALT reflect activity rather than fibrosis [^554c738c]. MELD and Child-Pugh scores integrate these parameters and predict mortality and transplant need [^e827f462] [^84984ddd]; **MELD is superior** for short-term risk, and Child-Pugh for surgical risk and HCC staging [^f7165cd5]. Noninvasive fibrosis scores (APRI, FIB-4) and elastography improve fibrosis staging and prognostication, especially when combined with clinical scores [^0506807b] [^e2e4beb7]. LFTs alone cannot reliably detect early fibrosis, so normal results do not exclude significant disease [^fdeaf458] [^aef209aa].

## Key liver function tests and their correlation with disease severity

| **Liver function test** | **Correlation with disease severity** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Bilirubin | Strongly correlates with severity; rises as hepatic excretion and synthetic function decline | - Central to MELD and Child-Pugh <br/> - Predicts mortality and decompensation [^e827f462] [^84984ddd] |
| INR (prothrombin time) | Reflects impaired hepatic protein synthesis; worsens with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis | - Core component of MELD and Child-Pugh <br/> - Predicts bleeding risk and mortality [^e827f462] [^84984ddd] |
| Albumin | Decreases with declining synthetic function; lower levels indicate advanced disease | - Included in Child-Pugh and ALBI <br/> - Predicts survival and complications [^84984ddd] [^c2e87ae8] |
| Platelet count | Thrombocytopenia reflects portal hypertension and advanced fibrosis | - Integral to APRI and FIB-4 <br/> - Predicts fibrosis and decompensation [^15cc3e34] [^554c738c] |
| AST/ALT | Elevations indicate hepatocellular injury but correlate poorly with fibrosis stage | - Useful for activity, not fibrosis <br/> - AST/ALT ratio > 1 suggests advanced fibrosis in some etiologies [^7e80c79f] [^798c26c7] |

## Prognostic scoring systems incorporating liver function tests

Several scoring systems integrate LFTs to predict outcomes in chronic liver disease:

- **Child-Pugh score**: Incorporates bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy; widely used for cirrhosis staging, surgical risk assessment, and HCC management [^84984ddd].

- **MELD score**: Uses bilirubin, INR, and creatinine; accurately predicts short-term mortality and is the standard for transplant prioritization [^e827f462] [^f7165cd5].

- **ALBI grade**: Based on albumin and bilirubin; objectively stratifies liver function and predicts survival in HCC and cirrhosis [^c2e87ae8] [^904132d1].

---

## Limitations of liver function tests in assessing disease severity

- **Normal LFTs do not exclude significant disease**: Patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis may have normal or mildly elevated LFTs, particularly in early disease [^fdeaf458] [^aef209aa].

- **Lack of specificity**: LFT abnormalities are nonspecific and can be influenced by extrahepatic factors, necessitating clinical context for interpretation [^9f8e2324].

- **Inability to detect early fibrosis**: LFTs are insensitive for early fibrosis, limiting their utility in early disease detection [^e0aaf58c].

---

## Role of noninvasive fibrosis assessment

Noninvasive fibrosis assessment complements LFTs by improving fibrosis staging and prognostication:

- **APRI and FIB-4**: Simple, widely available scores incorporating AST, ALT, and platelets; useful for excluding advanced fibrosis and guiding further testing [^554c738c].

- **Transient elastography**: Accurately detects advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis; predicts clinical decompensation and mortality, especially when combined with clinical scores [^0506807b] [^e2e4beb7].

- **Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test**: Predicts liver-related outcomes and mortality, offering prognostic value beyond static LFTs [^887ba55c].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Integrated approach**: Combine LFTs with clinical scores (MELD, Child-Pugh) and noninvasive fibrosis assessment for accurate staging and prognosis [^554c738c] [^adff9fe8].

- **Regular monitoring**: Serial LFTs and scores help track disease progression and guide interventions [^45fe929b].

- **Individualized interpretation**: Consider etiology, comorbidities, and patient-specific factors when interpreting LFTs and scores [^9f8e2324].

---

Liver function tests correlate with disease severity and prognosis in chronic liver disease, but **no single test suffices**. Bilirubin, INR, albumin, and platelets are most informative, and integrating these into validated scores (MELD, Child-Pugh, ALBI) with noninvasive fibrosis assessment provides the most reliable approach to staging and prognostication.

### Noninvasive monitoring of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^45fe929b]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatic fibrosis is the main determinant of clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis C. Liver histology is frequently considered the gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is associated with sampling error, interobserver variability, and potential complications. Thus, there is a need for simple, inexpensive, and reliable noninvasive means to assess disease severity in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Clinical examination is unreliable in differentiating different stages of compensated liver disease. Among the routine laboratory tests, decreased platelet count, increase in the ratio of aspartate to alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), and prolonged prothrombin time are the earliest indicators of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Individual serum fibrosis markers have limited accuracy in predicting hepatic fibrosis. Indices composed of a panel of markers correlate better with histological fibrosis, but their reliability requires further validation. Currently, noninvasive monitoring of patients with chronic hepatitis C relies on clinical evaluation, routine laboratory tests, and ultrasound and endoscopic surveillance in patients with cirrhosis. Initial evaluation should focus on assessment of activity and stage of liver disease for prognostication and decisions regarding treatment, and to rule out coinfections and other causes of liver disease. Subsequent follow-up should focus on detection of liver disease progression and the need for treatment. The frequency of monitoring and the tests used will depend on the patient's age, stage of liver disease, and comorbid conditions. There is an urgent need to develop and validate noninvasive tests that can accurately reflect the full spectrum of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^fdeaf458]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^9f8e2324]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^ae68d287]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the management of chronic liver disease, survival and prognosis are used to guide treatment decisions and discussions with patients and their caregivers. For a clinician, it is important to have appropriate tools to provide an accurate and realistic assessment of the natural course of a patient's disease. Multiple scores have been developed to model survival outcomes in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD). The first widely utilised score, the Child–Pugh score (CPS), remains one of the preeminent models for cirrhosis despite having been developed through empirical selection of relevant variables. More recently, contemporary scores have been derived from statistical analysis for variables independently predictive of mortality: the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has historically represented the most used alternative to the CPS. However, the landscape of ACLD has evolved since the development of these scores and will continue to change. Aetiological causes of ACLD have transitioned from predominantly viral hepatitis to alcoholic-associated liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Whilst the optimal diagnostic criteria for steatotic liver disease remain unclear, extended definitions now include patients that may not have been considered to have liver disease when index scores were derived. ACLD may also manifest in a variety of phenotypes including acute decompensations (AD) of ACLD, acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF), stable ACLD in patients awaiting orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) and those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are varied outcomes for each of these conditions. Moreover, the collective understanding of ACLF is incomplete, with a unifying definition not yet established. The advancement of contemporary understanding of ACLD requires re-assessment of prognostic tools. The aim of this review is to summarise, appraise, and compare current scores assessing disease in ACLD and highlight when each may be most useful.

Bloomfield AL. LIVER-FUNCTION TESTS. AMA Arch Intern Med. 1954; 94: 687–689. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1954.00250050001001 NUMEROUS attempts have been made for over half a century to measure the function of the liver by one or another test; these procedures have been proposed for several purposes. First, in cases in which the diagnosis is entirely obscure, it has been hoped that the presence of liver disease might be ruled in or out. Second, in the presence of known liver disease function studies have been used to define, if possible, the degree of damage and the type of lesion. Finally, these procedures seem to have a valuable place in appraising the course of hepatic disturbances — whether downhill or toward recovery. The discovery of the glycogenic activity of the liver, in 1857, by Claude Bernard, stimulated extensive studies of carbohydrate metabolism, and by the late decades of the century alert clinicians were attempting to develop carbohydrate tests for liver function.

The general idea was that, if one fed Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Chronic liver disease in an ageing population [^942800cd]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic liver disease is increasing in the elderly population. With a mostly asymptomatic or non-specific presentation, these diseases may easily go undiagnosed. Abnormal liver function tests of unknown cause are a common reason for referral to secondary care. Investigating the older person with abnormal liver function is important; even with mild abnormalities, the same vigilance should be applied to an older person as in a young person. Liver biopsy is safe but often overlooked in this age group and may provide useful information to diagnose, direct therapy and prognosticate. Treatment options are similar for all age groups, with a few subtle differences, although further evidence is frequently required for the older population. Morbidity and age-adjusted mortality are often more severe in older people, and therefore early diagnosis and intervention is important. Presented here are the most common chronic liver diseases that geriatricians are likely to encounter in clinical practise. Their epidemiology, clinical features, investigation, treatment and mortality are described with a particular focus on the elderly population.

### Liver dysfunction in COVID-19: a useful prognostic marker of severe disease? [^1aa442cc]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Risk factors and prognostic markers of severe disease remain to be fully determined, although some studies have suggested a correlation between abnormal liver function and adverse outcomes. Further studies are needed to investigate this further.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who were admitted to Kingston Hospital in the UK. Data collected included age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity profile, biochemical markers of liver function and the acute phase response, and overall outcome.

Results

Between 16 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, a total of 343 patients were admitted to the acute medical team at Kingston Hospital. Excluding those with a history of liver disease, 299 patients had liver function tests performed with abnormalities demonstrated in 44.8% of individuals. Derangement of liver function was associated with greater need for ventilatory support (p < 0.001), admission to high dependency unit or intensive care (p < 0.001) and increased length of hospital stay (p < 0.001). Of note, liver dysfunction was more common in those of non-white ethnicity (p = 0.007) and correlated with higher levels of C reactive protein (p = 0.01) and ferritin (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Abnormal liver function is associated with a negative outcome among those hospitalised with COVID-19. The cause for this association is unclear, but correlation between abnormal liver function and higher serum levels of acute phase proteins suggest that dysregulation of the immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 may be contributory.

### Clinical research on liver reserve function by 13C-phenylalanine breath test in aged patients with chronic liver diseases [^009084da]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Nowadays, the Child-Pugh classification remains the most widely accepted tool as a measure of disease severity in liver disease. However, in addition to being safe, non-invasive, easy to perform, and well correlated with the Child-Pugh score, PheBT could provide additional information in that direct hepatocyte functional capacity is measured, avoiding any subjectivity in hepatic dysfunction staging and also avoiding other elements that could modify the real degree of hepatic damage. The function tests can provide different information from that obtained by a liver biopsy, but not such detailed information on hepatic disease as that provided by histological examination. Furthermore, function tests cannot indicate the extent of inflammation or the degree of fibrosis.

Several factors have prevented widespread adoption of the 13C-PheBT: it is more expensive and time and labor consuming than the conventional biochemical tests. But, it is clear that such tests are superior to the tranditional Child-Pugh score in predicting survival or life-threatening complication. PheBT is able to discriminate hepatic functional capacity not only between healthy individuals and patients with liver disease, but also between different stages of hepatic dysfunction in adult and elderly. Our results show that 13C-PheBT can distinguish between class A cirrhotics and those with more advanced disease, but does not appear to be able to distinguish sufficiently between class B and C cirrhotics. Well-controlled, prospective trials are needed to clearly define the role of these quantitative tests in the management of patients with liver disease.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure [^dae74b8f]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure combines an acute deterioration in liver function in an individual with pre-existing chronic liver disease and hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, and is associated with substantial short-term mortality. Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40% of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.

### Liver fibrosis determination [^27cb37fd]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

All chronic liver disease can lead to liver fibrosis. Assessment of the severity of liver fibrosis is central to making treatment and management decisions. Liver biopsy, the gold standard for liver fibrosis assessment, is invasive and carries risks of complications and sampling errors. The use of noninvasive elastography-based radiologic methods of liver fibrosis determination is limited to centers that have the capabilities. Laboratory liver fibrosis determinations, both general clinical scoring systems and combination biomarker panels, are accessible to a wider population of clinicians for identifying patients at low risk of advanced fibrosis who do not need liver biopsies.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part I. diagnosis and evaluation [^80c60752]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease; most patients remain asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding from portal hypertension. Physical examination of patients with cirrhosis may reveal a variety of findings that necessitate a hepatic- or gastrointestinal-based work-up to determine the etiology. Some patients already may have had laboratory or radiographic tests that incidentally uncovered signs of cirrhosis and its comorbidities. No serologic or radiographic test can accurately diagnose cirrhosis. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between persistently elevated liver function tests and biopsy-proven underlying hepatic disease; thus, a more targeted serologic work-up is indicated in patients whose liver function test results are persistently abnormal. Unnecessary medications and surgical procedures should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Referral for liver biopsy should be considered only after a thorough, non-invasive serologic and radiographic evaluation has failed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis; the benefit of biopsy outweighs the risk; and it is postulated that biopsy will have a favorable impact on the treatment of chronic liver disease.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^a33db3f4]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Prognosis in acute-on-chronic liver failure — once it develops, the probability of 28-day mortality ranges from 30% to 50%, and outcomes are often driven by the number and severity of organ failures; severity scores such as MELD and MELD-Na may underestimate mortality among patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure because they capture intrinsic liver disease but not the impact of extrahepatic organ failures.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^2a585b8d]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Liver disease severity assessment in chronic hepatitis B — Determination of liver disease severity is integral to monitoring because of its importance to making treatment and surveillance decisions, and non-invasive tests of fibrosis such as hepatic transient elastography or serum markers such as FIB-4 can be considered for fibrosis staging, with elastography generally showing better performance than FIB-4; liver biopsy is infrequently used but is the most accurate means of defining severity of inflammation.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^3def212a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron indices and liver disease prognosis

An association between iron indices and the prognosis of liver disease has also been documented. In a recent study, Bruns et al proved the important role of serum transferrin as a prognostic factor of early mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. They analyzed all the common iron parameters of 292 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, 78 of whom had acute liver failure (ACLF), and showed that, although increased ferritin levels were associated with more severe grades of ACLF, there was no significant predictive value in terms of 30-day mortality. In contrast, low serum transferrin and high Tsat were correlated significantly with poor short-term mortality (at 30 days). These results indicate the failure of iron homeostasis in patients with advanced liver disease and suggest possible therapeutic approaches in patients with ACLF.

The decreased levels of hepcidin in cirrhotic patients have been found to cause hepatic iron accumulation and may also contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. Hepatic iron accumulation is known to be associated with a worse prognosis and the development of HCC. A recent cohort study of 237 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis demonstrated that low hepcidin levels could be a negative prognostic factor for survival and risk of HCC development. It is not yet known whether this is the result of hepcidin-associated disease progression, or whether hepcidin represents only a negative prognostic indicator. Kato et al, in a study of 34 patients with HCV infection, showed that phlebotomy and a low-iron diet can reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species and hepatitis severity by improving liver function tests, as well as reducing the risk of developing HCC.

Noninvasive tests to assess liver disease severity (Table 3) — Options listed are liver-directed physical exam (normal in most patients), routine blood tests (e.g. ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, INR, and CBC with platelet count), serum fibrosis marker panels, transient elastography, liver imaging (e.g., ultrasound or computed tomography scan), AST-to-platelet ratio index, and FIB-4 score.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^f7165cd5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostication in chronic liver disease and the implementation of appropriate scoring systems is difficult given the variety of clinical manifestations. It is important to understand the limitations of each scoring system as well as the context and patient group from which it was developed to allow appropriate application. This review seeks to explore the optimal clinical uses of different predictive scores developed for compensated and decompensated chronic liver disease, acute on chronic liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We will also review future areas of research for each score and current gaps in the literature.

Main body

The Child–Pugh score is the pre-eminent prediction score for liver disease that was developed through empiric selection of relevant variables. It is useful for selection of patients for surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma but is inferior to other scores for other clinically relevant endpoints such as survival in acute decompensations. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and subsequent variants (MELD-Na, MELD 3.0) were developed to predict mortality following elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion. An alternative is the Frieberg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) score, which has been externally validated for TIPS populations. Organ allocation for liver transplantation is also currently prioritised using the MELD score, with the MELD 3.0 reducing waitlist gender discrepancies. The Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) acute decompensation (AD) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) scores are used for predicting mortality in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation of liver disease and acute-on-chronic liver failure, respectively. Both scores were developed from retrospective analyses of an observational European cohort with external validation. Understanding of ACLF presentation of advanced liver disease remains in the preliminary stages. Improving collective understanding is important to optimise prognostication. The albumin-bilirubin score is a non-invasive predictor of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Incorporating artificial intelligence to personalise predictive algorithms may provide the most effective prognostication for all clinical phenotypes.

Conclusion

We summarised key prognostic scores used in advanced liver disease and make recommendations for the optimal uses. Nuances in the development and implementation of each are discussed to help guide effective use.

### Association between lactate-to-albumin ratio and short-term prognosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure treated with artificial liver support system [^c0af19e2]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome characterized by acute decompensation of liver function superimposed on underlying chronic liver diseases, with complex pathogenesis and high short-term mortality. Without timely and effective treatment, many patients are at risk of death. Although artificial liver support system (ALSS) treatment could improve the short-term prognosis of patients with ACLF, a significant number of patients still fail to survive. Early identification of these patients could help optimize their therapeutic strategy in a timely manner, including referral for liver transplantation. The disease severity of ACLF can be measured using scoring systems such as the COSSH (Chinese Group on the Study of Severe Hepatitis B) ACLF score, CLIF-C (European Association for the Study of the Liver — Chronic Liver Failure-Consortium) ACLF score, APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) ACLF score, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and its derivative scoring system, which integrate clinical features, extrahepatic organ function, and laboratory parameters. Although these disease severity and prognosis assessment tools are helpful in identifying critically ill patients with ACLF and their prognosis, they are not always effective. Nevertheless, laboratory markers that can directly predict the disease severity and prognosis of patients with ACLF are still not universally recognized.

### Possible unrecognised liver injury is associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients [^0616646b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several studies have suggested that alterations in liver function tests may play a relevant role in the natural history of COVID-19. However, the contribution of pre-established liver disease to the prognosis of COVID-19 has not been fully assessed. Importantly, the vast majority of available information has evaluated the influence of altered liver function tests on different outcomes when COVID-19 is already established, and it is difficult to ascertain whether they represent real markers of pre-existing liver disease or are manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we describe that higher scores of liver fibrosis indices commonly used in clinical practice (the FIB-4 and Forns indices) obtained before COVID-19 initiation, and therefore indicative of a possible pre-existing chronic liver disease, are related to survival of patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in the ICU. Moreover, this association remains significant after adjustment for two main components of prognosis in ICU patients – chronic comorbidity (estimated in our study by the CCI) and severity of the clinical condition at the time of ICU admission (evaluated by the APACHE II) – as well as for the intensity of the inflammatory response (estimated by serum ferritin values). Thus, our findings suggest that a careful evaluation of pre-existing liver injury may be relevant in the clinical work-up of COVID-19 patients since, when indirect signs of fibrosis are already present before the disease onset, clinical evolution may be worse. Furthermore, and according to our results, the excess of risk conferred by the elevation of pre-admission liver fibrosis markers suggests that a prioritization strategy for early vaccination should be considered in these patients. Importantly, the CCI has been identified as a robust predictor of mortality in ICU patients with acute lung injury and severe ARDS, independently of its aetiology, and has been associated with poorer outcomes in chronic liver disease. Furthermore, the APACHE II score is a widely validated instrument for the assessment of prognosis in critically ill patients, including those with acute respiratory failure, and ARDS as a primary cause of admission. Our findings are in line with a recent report that indicates that the severity of COVID-19 was significantly less intense in patients with a low risk fibrosis category – based on the FIB-4 index – as compared with those with intermediate or high fibrosis categories.

### The influence of muscle performance and fatigue on prognosis in patients with compensated liver disease [^bbdd2b37]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we followed a cohort of subjects with compensated chronic liver disease for several years and assessed the potential prognostic implication of physical function and fatigue. The key findings were that muscle function tests at baseline were essentially not correlated with prognosis at follow up.

Physical function in our cohort was generally lower compared with a control population, which suggest that several subjects in our cohort suffer from or are at risk of developing sarcopenia. This is a finding that has been shown in studies in advanced CLD or cirrhosis. We did not use advanced body composition metrics such as Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, which would have added information to our assessment of sarcopenia. However we did use several well validated muscle function tests to detect poor muscle function, which is now considered more important than muscle mass per se as it displays a stronger link with outcome in other populations. Several previous studies have also shown that sarcopenia is an important predictor of survival in subjects with cirrhosis. This is in contrast with our results, where we could not demonstrate a clear correlation between most muscle function tests and survival. This is likely explained by the fact that all subjects in our cohort were compensated at inclusion. Thus, the effects of sarcopenia in a decompensated liver disease population is likely not generalizable to our cohort of compensated liver disease. However, muscle function and muscle mass does play an important role in liver disease, but the exact timing for when it starts to impact survival is still yet to be determined. The difference in survival between subjects with poor muscle function and normal muscle function in our cohort was not statistically significant except for walking speed. However, we cannot make any conclusions of cause and effect from our data, but other studies have shown that frail individuals without liver disease where timed up and go has been shown to predict premature mortality. Previous studies have also shown that a long timed up and go is a risk factor for falls in subjects with liver cirrhosis. The time to complete timed up and go has also been shown to decrease if the subject engages in an exercise program, which suggests that physical training, even in subjects with compensated CLD could potentially be beneficial.

### Role of predisposition, injury, response and organ failure in the prognosis of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure: a prospective cohort study [^7daba6d4]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

WHO projections estimate that liver cirrhosis will be the ninth most common cause of death in the western world by 2015. The cost of management of patients who require hospital admission with acute deterioration in the US approximates $13 billion. In a significant proportion of such patients, death is related to multiple organ failure, which, when manifest, carries a high mortality rate. Currently, these patients do not have priority for listing for liver transplantation and often such patients are considered to be too ill for transplantation. Conceptually, this multiorgan failure can occur either as a slow gradually progressive decompensation culminating in multiple organ failure or it can occur as a result of a precipitating illness, which is often of non-hepatic origin on the background of cirrhosis in a previously stable cirrhotic patient, who may or may not have a history of decompensation. While both entities can lead to various features of multiorgan failure the underlying mechanisms of decompensation are probably quite different and, therefore, hypothetically the clinical outcome is likely to be different. This latter condition has been referred to in the literature as having acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).

In order to clinically describe the group of patients referred to as ACLF, we adopted the definition that these patients would have 'acute deterioration in liver function over a short period (up to four weeks)' 'associated with a precipitating event' 'in patients with previously well-compensated liver disease' 'characterised by organ failure'. We also hypothesised that from the clinical standpoint the most important difference between the two entities is the potentially reversible nature of ACLF if precipitants could be controlled.

Several studies have addressed the outcome of patients with liver cirrhosis and organ failure. The requirement for ICU admission in patients with cirrhosis was associated with high mortality rates ranging from 40 to 90%. Wehler et al. assessed the impact of organ failure and showed that the presence of organ failure with the Sepsis Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9 or greater was associated with a short-term mortality of about 90%. However, this study did not specifically address the question if there is a difference between patients with acute deterioration compared to those with end-stage liver disease. Identification of patients at risk of progressing to multiorgan failure would help substantially in prioritising patients for early intensive therapy, transfer to specialist tertiary referral units, liver support and listing for transplantation.

### Validation of a new prognostic model to predict short and medium-term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis [^23a31dd4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

This study is of course not the first evaluating a new score to stratify patients with cirrhosis according to their prognosis. However, to our best knowledge this is the first confirmatory study that evaluates the performance of an enzymatic-based liver function model for disease severity.

Certainly, our study has limitations. Although the number of primary endpoints (number of transplantations / number of patient deaths) were comparable in both the initial and confirmatory studies, cohorts differed in some clinical characteristics. The small difference seen in etiology, baseline demography and disease severity reflects the variety in epidemiology of patients with chronic liver disease. Secondly, diagnostic accuracy of disease severity scores differed only marginally. Our analysis strongly focuses on Child-Pugh Class B patients. We must admit that by performing this subgroup analysis the MELD might underperform in estimating patient survival when compared with the CreLiMAx risk score. Since patients' values for serum bilirubin and INR are parameters of the MELD and CPS equation, mathematical bias may be present.

In any case, the CreLiMAx risk score showed a good ability to identify patients with low risk of death. Therefore, the CreLiMAx risk score seems to be a valid tool for providing additional information for a holistic clinical decision-finding in patients facing an allocation system based on a sickest-first policy.

### The relationship between liver disease stage and liver fibrosis: a tangled web [^c633105c]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

The structural consequences of chronic liver disease are described as a series of liver disease 'stages' with scarring and architectural change that eventually destroys and replaces the normal lobular structure of the liver. Fibrosis ('excess collagen') and stage have been confused in histological staging systems. Fibrosis is part of increasing liver disease stage, but fibrosis and stage are different. Staging liver disease is important in routine histopathological assessment. Measurement of liver fibrosis is another process. The collagenous proportion of a liver biopsy [collagen proportionate area (CPA)] correlates with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), which is of recognized prognostic value. CPA at 1 year post-transplantation in hepatitis C virus-infected patients predicts subsequent clinical decompensation. CPA in cirrhotic patients predicts decompensation more accurately than staging or HVPG. The 'cirrhosis' stage category has poor prognostic power, and CPA effectively substages cirrhosis. CPA improves the description of liver disease stage. Proper validation of antifibrotic treatments and 'non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis' requires measurement of liver fibrosis (and not liver biopsy stage scores). It is unacceptable for the words 'fibrosis' and 'score' to remain next to each other. There are benefits to properly understanding liver fibrosis and liver disease stage and properly assessing each of them.

### Liver function test abnormalities at hospital admission are associated with severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a prospective cohort study [^db9a3984]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 85 million people worldwide causing severe strains on healthcare systems. Therefore, a better understanding of risk factors for more severe courses has become particularly important. A wide array of data is available now showing that male gender, age and comorbidities such as arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II correlate with worse outcomes and more severe COVID-19 infections. In addition, it has become evident that liver injury is present in a relevant proportion of patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection and might also correlate with worse outcomes. Even cases of acute liver failure have been described. However, the mechanism behind liver injury in SARS-CoV-2 and its clinical relevance remain a subject of debate. Importantly, the association between liver damage in COVID-19 patients and poor outcomes has only been evaluated retrospectively in the majority of studies, prospective studies on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients are still scarce. Furthermore, the available reports mainly focus on liver injury occurring during hospitalisation, while reports on an elevation of liver parameters at admission and analyses of the effect of baseline liver parameters on outcome and severity are rare. The correlation of LFT at the time of admission with severity is therefore less clear but of great clinical importance. We here present novel data on the association of LFT at the time of admission and course of the disease in a prospectively collected and well-characterised cohort of 217 COVID-19 patients.

### Nomogram for predicting advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease [^5729f9c8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although all international guidelines recommend early treatment for patients with chronic liver disease, it is estimated that two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis are diagnosed in time when they have liver-related complications, compromising their short-term prognosis. In our study, the INR, PLT, and PIIINP were independent risk factors for progressive liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. This indicates that there is an urgent need for simple and accurate tools to identify the subgroup of chronic liver disease patients who require special treatment by professional physicians. We subsequently constructed noninvasive nomograms that incorporated the three indexes to predict advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver disease patients to assess the progression of liver fibrosis in a noninvasive procedure in chronic liver disease patients. The established nomograms are convenient, useful and user-friendly in clinical practice.

### Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predicts clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease [^ab558a8d]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease in Western populations has reached epidemic proportions, where a third of all adults have some degree of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The estimates for the prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more aggressive form of NAFLD, are as high as 12%. Furthermore, viral hepatitis affects over 450 million people worldwide, and is associated with cirrhosis in 20% of this population. After developing cirrhosis, patients may remain well ("compensated") for long periods of time, but approximately 5–7% will develop complications (become "decompensated") annually. Furthermore, annual mortality rates can be as high as 57% once cirrhosis is established. In the face of this epidemic, there is an urgent clinical need for technologies that can identify patients with chronic liver disease, and risk stratify those who will develop complications or die from liver disease. This will facilitate timely therapeutic interventions, liver transplantation, and stratification within clinical studies.

Traditionally, clinicians have used needle biopsy to assess liver fibrosis. However, as this procedure is painful, requires hospitalisation for several hours or more, and is associated with a risk of complications and death, non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis assessment have been developed in the last decade. Furthermore, liver biopsy is associated with both sampling and observer dependent variability; therefore the use of this as a gold standard comparator for the development of non-invasive technologies is sub-optimal. A more robust and clinically relevant approach would involve the assessment of whether non-invasive technologies can be used to predict clinically meaningful endpoints.

Broadly, non-invasive techniques can be divided into those based on direct and indirect serum markers of fibrosis and those based on imaging and or elastography. Serum biomarkers are attractive as they are easy to measure and can be repeated over time. However, they lack specificity as they may be affected by extrahepatic fibrosis. For example, the Extended Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel reported a sensitivity of 90%, but had a specificity of only 41%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 for the detection of severe fibrosis. A subsequent 7 year follow-up study suggested that ELF score could predict clinical outcomes. However, patients with any disorder associated with extrahepatic fibrosis were excluded from these studies making it difficult to assess how this test could be applied to a general, unselected population.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^84984ddd]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Main text

Child–Pugh score

In 1964, the CHILD score was developed as a stratification tool for surgical risk in patients with liver cirrhosis. Bilirubin, albumin, ascites size, encephalopathy grade, and nutritional status were empirically selected based on observed association. The qualitative variables, ascites, encephalopathy, and nutritional status were each stratified into three groups based on severity, whilst continuous variables, bilirubin, and albumin were stratified by empiric selection of cut-off values. This enabled the manufacturing of a score between 5 and 15 for each patient. However, literature regarding surgical risk during this period did not support malnutrition as an independent predictor of survival. The Child–Pugh score (CPS) was subsequently proposed in 1973, wherein nutritional status was replaced with prothrombin time. On the surface, the score now effectively represented synthetic (albumin, international normalised ratio (INR)) and metabolic (bilirubin, encephalopathy) functions of the liver, with cut-off points for prothrombin time guided by clinical experience. Patients were then able to be distributed across grades of disease (A: 5–6, B: 7–9, C: 10–15) based on their total score from each of the 5 components.

The CPS was the first widely studied score for ACLD. It was initially verified for patients being evaluated for surgery for portal hypertension, with evidence that its use in selecting surgical candidates could be expanded. Small meta-analyses of patients undergoing both elective oesophageal (12 included studies) and pancreatic (8 included studies) resections found that outcomes were better for Child–Pugh A patients. However, there are no large meta-analyses examining surgical outcomes for patients based on CPS, or indeed validating it as superior to other prognostic scores. Current expert consensus in the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines suggests cautious consideration of its use as part of a pre-surgical risk assessment.

Integration of the CPS, as a measure of compensation status of ACLD, helps refine the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) strategy for treatment selection in HCC. It has been shown to be useful for guiding patient selection for surgical resection and systemic therapy, as well as established as a predictive factor for mortality following transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). Recognising the importance of the CPS in making treatment decisions in HCC, a meta-analysis aimed at evaluating first-line treatments for patients with CPS 8 or higher is currently underway (PROSPERO, CRD42024528193).

### Are physician-derived disease severity indices associated with health-related quality of life in patients with end-stage liver disease? [^a9993a12]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is now often used as an overall indicator of health status for patients with end-stage liver disease. However, there are no data evaluating the associations between MELD scores and patient reports of health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Methods

Two hundred-three patients with end-stage liver disease completed a disease-targeted HRQOL instrument (the LDQOL 1.0). Patients also rated the severity of their liver disease and reported number of disability days attributed to their liver disease in the preceding month. MELD and Child Turcott Pugh (CTP) scores were calculated for all patients. Associations of MELD and CTP scores with patient-derived outcomes were estimated.

Results

The mean MELD and CTP scores were 12 and 7, respectively, indicating mild severity of liver disease. HRQOL of patients was generally poor, with the mean SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores of 35 and 40. Seventy percent of patients rated their liver disease symptoms as moderate to severe. Similarly, 70% reported being disabled from their liver disease. MELD was associated with physical functioning scale and the physical component summary (PCS) score in patients with end-stage liver disease. In contrast, CTP score was significantly associated with physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, PCS score, effects of liver disease, sexual functioning, and sexual problems. Both MELD and CTP scores correlated with self-rated severity of liver disease symptoms but not with self-reported disability days.

Conclusions

Despite objectively mild liver disease, the subjective HRQOL of this cohort was severely impaired. CTP score was more closely associated with patient-reported estimates of HRQOL than the MELD score. CTP or disease-specific HRQOL instruments may compliment MELD by providing insights into outcomes of importance to patients with low risk of mortality.

### Significance of theC-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis [^5cfb533b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Third, we found no correlation between Child-Pugh or MELD score and the CBT values. MELD score is a valid prognostic score for intermediate term mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Child-Pugh score is a simple descriptive marker of the severity of cirrhosis with an almost equivalent to the MELD score prognostic value. Our conclusion is in agreement with the results of Lewis et al who used the salivary caffeine clearance to evaluate the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhosis. The authors concluded that, while caffeine clearance correlated strongly with the Child-Pugh score in outpatients with mild cirrhosis, there was no correlation between the same parameters in hospitalized patients with more severe decompensated liver disease. Although the salivary caffeine clearance is a less reliable assay, the similarity with our results suggests that the hepatic functional compromise and the microsomal P450 1A2 derangement are not reflected by the Child-Pugh and presumably MELD scores. This observation remains to be validated in future larger studies.

Given its simplicity and non-invasive nature, there may be indications that CBT might be useful in clinical practice. One indication for CBT might be the long-term follow up of patients with early-stage cirrhosis, which may progress to a more advanced stage without substantial changes in clinical and/or laboratory findings. The CBT might be also used to improve the predictive value of current clinical scores. Such a combined score might improve the assessment of the severity of cirrhosis.

In conclusion, the present study shows that the CBT can reliably differentiate the patients with cirrhosis. Since CBT can be an easy to use, safe, non-invasive method for the evaluation of liver function impairment, larger prospective studies are required to assess its predictive role in the long-term outcome of patients with cirrhosis.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Reliable and accurate predictors of the severity and prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease are required in daily clinical practice
Several 13C-breath tests have been recently evaluated for the assessment of liver function in a variety of chronic liver diseases
In particular, the 13C-caffeine breath test (CBT) has provided promising results for the evaluation of such patients

What the new findings are:

CBT values were found to reliably differentiate the patients with cirrhosis
CBT values did not differ between non-cirrhotic patients with chronic liver disease and healthy controls
In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, CBT results did not seem to be affected by the smoking habits or to be associated with the Child-Pugh or Meld score

### Identification of liver disease: why and how [^7822b8ec]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Mortality from chronic liver disease (CLD) in the UK has increased by over 400% since 1970, driven by alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C virus, the natural histories of which can all be improved by early intervention. Patients often present with advanced disease, which would be preventable if diagnosed earlier and lifestyle change opportunities offered. Liver function tests (LFTs) are very commonly measured. Approximately 20% are abnormal, yet the majority are not investigated according to guidelines. However, investigating all abnormal LFTs to identify early liver disease would overwhelm services. Recently, several diagnostic pathways have been implemented across the country; some focus on abnormal LFTs and some on stratifying at-risk populations. This review will collate the evidence on the size of the problem and the challenges it poses. We will discuss the limitations and restrictions within systems that limit the responses available, review the current pathways being evaluated and piloted in the UK, and explore the arguments for and against LFT-based approaches and 'case-finding strategies' in the community diagnosis of liver disease. Furthermore, the role of fibrosis assessment methods (including scoring systems such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, the enhanced liver fibrosis test and elastography) within these pathways will also be discussed. In conclusion, this review aims to establish some principles which, if adopted, are likely to improve the diagnosis of advanced liver disease, and identify the areas of contention for further research, in order to establish the most effective community detection models of liver disease.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) — some experts suggest applying NAFLD grading/staging to ALD, but ALD-specific systems have not entered standard practice; although advanced fibrosis predicted short-term mortality in one context, the scoring system was not adopted, and biopsies may not be routinely obtained in suspected ALD, complicating outcome correlation.

### Characteristics of liver function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV coinfection [^d69e9a23]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major global health threat. We aimed to describe the characteristics of liver function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection.

Methods

We enrolled all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV coinfection admitted to Tongji Hospital from February 1 to February 29, 2020. Data of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. The characteristics of liver function and its association with the severity and prognosis of disease were described.

Results

Of the 105 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV coinfection, elevated levels of liver test were observed in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%). The levels of the indicators mentioned above increased substantially during hospitalization (all P < .05). Fourteen (13.33%) patients developed liver injury. Most of them (10, 71.43%) recovered after 8 (range 6–21) days. Notably the other, 4 (28.57%) patients rapidly progressed to acute-on-chronic liver failure. The proportion of severe COVID-19 was higher in patients with liver injury (P = 0.042). Complications including acute-on-chronic liver failure, acute cardiac injury and shock happened more frequently in patients with liver injury (all P < .05). The mortality was higher in individuals with liver injury (28.57% vs 3.30%, P = 0.004).

Conclusion

Liver injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV coinfection was associated with severity and poor prognosis of disease. During the treatment of COVID-19 in chronic HBV-infected patients, liver function should be taken seriously and evaluated frequently.

### Changes in liver function tests, congestion, and prognosis after acute Heart Failure: the STRONG-HF trial [^3b8d60de]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) represents a clinical syndrome that engenders a cascade of systemic effects due to impaired cardiac function and the ensuing elevated left ventricular filling pressure. Central to these systemic manifestations is the impact of right-sided congestion of visceral organs, notably affecting the liver, spleen, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. The liver, in the setting of AHF, often exhibits deranged function as a consequence of passive congestion and hypoperfusion, which, in turn, can be detected and monitored through liver function tests (LFTs). These tests, which include markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (tBil), among others, serve as indirect indicators of the hemodynamic burden on the liver as well as the AHF's severity and progression.

Cachexia and sarcopenia are systemic conditions characterized by the loss of muscle mass with or without loss of fat mass. This is a feared complication in chronic diseases such as cancer and end-stage liver disease but has also been increasingly recognized in patients with HF as it severely affects patient quality of life, functional independence, and overall prognosis. Recent observations suggest a potential link between low levels of ALT and the presence of cachexia/sarcopenia, adding a layer of complexity to their role in evaluating patients with AHF. We therefore aimed to assess the association between LFTs and the clinical presentation, including congestion status, and outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF in the STRONG-HF (Safety, Tolerability and efficacy of Rapid Optimization, helped by NT-proBNP testinG, of Heart Failure therapies) trial. We also aimed to assess trajectories of LFTs during rapid up-titration of HF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as compared to usual care (UC).

### Prognosis of symptomatic versus asymptomatic autoimmune hepatitis: a study of 68 patients [^549f9a4e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disorder of unknown etiology. Disease presentation ranges from asymptomatic to symptomatic onset, fulminant, acute, or chronic.

Goals

To evaluate the prognosis of patients with asymptomatic versus symptomatic AIH and to determine the role of early treatment and prognostic factors in this subgroup of patients.

Methods

Sixty-eight patients with AIH were retrospectively evaluated for clinical presentation, liver function tests, autoantibody profile, liver biopsy, treatment, and long-term prognosis.

Results

Twenty-three patients were classified as having asymptomatic AIH. They were compared with the 45 AIH patients with symptomatic onset. Patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic presentations were indistinguishable by age, but there was a relative male predominance in the asymptomatic group. Aminotransferase and immunoglobulin levels were lower in the asymptomatic group. In contrast, the histopathologic picture was indistinguishable between the two groups. Lobular hepatitis of a moderate to severe degree, portal fibrosis, and bridging fibrosis were detected in similar frequencies in both groups. Asymptomatic onset led to a delay in diagnosis and, consequently, in the initiation of treatment and was associated with use of relatively lower doses of corticosteroids. Response to treatment and long-term prognosis of asymptomatic patients was better than that observed in the symptomatic group.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic onset of AIH is relatively common. The clinical presentation appears in correlation with liver functions tests but not with liver histology. This subgroup of AIH carries a better response to treatment and a favorable prognosis.

### The use and interpretation of tests for liver function… [^51744ca2]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

For twenty years or more clinicians, physiologists and clinical pathologists have attempted to devise procedures or tests that would indicate the functional capacity of the liver, in order to determine the presence and degree of disease of the liver and to obtain information with regard to prognosis. The careful physiologic studies that have been made following total and partial hepatectomy have served as a guide to the solution of this problem and have stimulated interest in it. Meanwhile, physiologists repeatedly have warned that no one function could be depended on to indicate the general status of the whole organ and that the reserve function of the liver was so great that functional abnormalities could be expected to appear only when most of it had been destroyed. In presenting the following report, it is our intention to consider the utility and general significance of the tests in common use and to. SNELL AM, MAGATH TB.

### MELD scoring system is useful for predicting prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis and is correlated with residual liver function: a European study [^e827f462]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Indices for predicting survival are essential for assessing prognosis and assigning priority for liver transplantation in patients with liver cirrhosis. The model for end stage liver disease (MELD) has been proposed as a tool to predict mortality risk in cirrhotic patients. However, this model has not been validated beyond its original setting.

Aim

To evaluate the short and medium term survival prognosis of a European series of cirrhotic patients by means of MELD compared with the Child-Pugh score. We also assessed correlations between the MELD scoring system and the degree of impairment of liver function, as evaluated by the monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) test.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated survival of a cohort of 129 cirrhotic patients with a follow up period of at least one year. The Child-Pugh score was calculated and the MELD score was computed according to the original formula for each patient. All patients had undergone a MEGX test. Multivariate analysis was performed on all variables to identify the parameters independently associated with one year and six month survival. MELD values were correlated with both Child-Pugh scores and MEGX test results.

Results

Thirty one patients died within the first year of follow up. Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and MEGX serum levels were significantly different among patients who survived and those who died. Serum creatinine, international normalised ratio, and MEGX(60) were independently associated with six month mortality while the same variables and the presence of ascites were associated with one year mortality. MELD scores showed significant correlations with both MEGX values and Child-Pugh scores.

Conclusions

In a European series of cirrhotic patients the MELD score is an excellent predictor of both short and medium term survival, and performs at least as well as the Child-Pugh score. An increase in MELD score is associated with a decrease in residual liver function.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^d46087c6]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of fibrosis, hepatitis C, AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using the liver stiffness measurement obtained before initiating antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal noninvasive liver disease assessment parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating liver stiffness measurement with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved in patients with treated HCV infection.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^aeab0910]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The intrinsic strengths of the MELD scores come from their objective construction as a product of multivariate analysis, representing the best method to minimise confounders and increase statistical power. Being continuous scores, they also possess higher statistical power. The MELD scores are also independent of disease aetiology and decompensated sequelae (ascites, HE, acute variceal bleeding). The increasing burden of metabolic associated fatty liver disease and the decreasing incidence of ACLD due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection indicates that the dominant liver disease aetiologies have changed, and disease courses are likely to be different. As the MELD score is not affected by disease aetiology, it is more resistant to the changing etiological landscape of liver disease.

Whilst the components of the MELD scores are independent predictors of mortality, each may have varied significance due to the maladaptive neurohormonal and physiological responses in ACLD. Rosenstengle and colleagues conducted a large analysis of transplant-listed candidates, stratifying them by dominant biochemical parameter: bilirubin (MELD-Br, n = 13,658), INR (MELD-INR, n = 13,809), and creatinine (MELD-Cr, n = 12,412). Survival was lower for females across each group, emphasising the importance of prospectively validating the MELD 3.0 score, whilst the MELD-Cr had significantly lower 1-year intention-toto-treat rates (p < 0.001). Creatinine is a variable that may be affected by many patient-specific characteristics including sarcopenia and myosteatosis, which are themselves independent predictors of survival. Lattanzi and colleagues demonstrated in a prospective trial of 249 cirrhotics that radiologically identified sarcopenia and myosteatosis were independently associated with mortality, and that amalgamating them with the MELD score resulted in improved prediction of 3- and 6-month mortality. Meta-analyses have supported the prognostic importance of sarcopenia. The limitations of each variable in the MELD scores including hyponatremia are further discussed in the supplement.

### The 1-year and 3-month prognostic utility of the AST / ALT ratio and model for end-stage liver disease score in patients with viral liver cirrhosis [^effb6af1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The AST/ALT ratio has shown good diagnostic accuracy in patients with chronic viral liver disease. However, its prognostic utility has never been tested. Recently, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been proposed as a simple and effective tool to predict survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to assess the 3-month and 1-yr prognostic ability of the AST/ALT ratio in a series of patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis, and to evaluate the relationship between the AST/ALT ratio and the MELD score and to compare their prognostic ability.

Methods

The AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores of 99 patients with liver cirrhosis of viral etiology (73 patients with hepatitis C virus and 26 with hepatitis B virus) who had been followed-up for at least 1 yr were retrospectively calculated and correlated with the patients' 3-month and 1-yr prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the AST/ALT ratio and the MELD score cut-offs with the best sensitivity (SS) and specificity (SP) in discriminating between patients who survived and those who died. Univariate survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method using the cut-offs identified by means of receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores showed a significant correlation (r(s) = 0.503, p = 0.0001). In all, 8% and 30% of the patients had died after 3 months and 1 yr of follow-up, respectively. AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores were significantly higher among the patients who died during both 3-month and 1-yr follow-up. An AST/ALT ratio cut-off of 1.17 had 87% SS and 52% SP, whereas a MELD cut-off of 9 had 57% SS and 74% SP in discriminating between patients who survived and those who died after I yr. The combined assessment of the AST/ALT ratio and/or MELD score had 90% SS and 78% SP. Survival curves of the patients showed that both parameters clearly discriminated between patients who survived and those who died in the short term (AST/ALT ratio, p = 0.0094; MELD score, p = 0.0089) as well as in the long term (AST/ALT ratio, p < 0.0005; MELD score, p = 0.004).

Conclusions

In patients with virus-related cirrhosis, the AST/ALT ratio has prognostic capability that is not significantly different from that of an established prognostic score such as MELD. Combined assessment of the two parameters increases the medium-term prognostic accuracy.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^2b830c09]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing — high blood-ammonia levels alone do not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in HE with chronic liver disease (CLD); if a patient with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE is in question. For ammonia-lowering drugs, repeated ammonia measurements may be helpful to test efficacy, but logistical challenges, specimen type differences, and method variability should be considered when interpreting results.

### Role of predisposition, injury, response and organ failure in the prognosis of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure: a prospective cohort study [^8acfd01c]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Predisposition (P)

Age, gender and aetiology of liver disease as possible predisposing factors were not different between survivors and non-survivors. Although more men developed organ failure (37% versus 26%, P = 0.02), there was no difference in mortality between men and women in the organ failure (OF) group. For baseline biochemistry and comparisons between survivors and non-survivors see Table 2. Non-survivors had significantly higher levels of creatinine, bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), international normalised ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and lower albumin levels compared to survivors at baseline. Bilirubin and INR were also independent predictors of mortality in the multivariable analysis. Child and MELD score were predictive for mortality on univariate analysis (Table 3) but these scores were not included into the multivariable analysis.

### Accuracy of blood-based biomarkers for staging liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease: a systematic review supporting the AASLD practice guideline [^44fd320b]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Data extraction and analysis methods — Two independent reviewers completed the data extraction, baseline characteristics were collected, and risk of bias was assessed with the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Certainty was rated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach; the quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for risk of bias or imprecision based on the width of the upper and lower estimates of 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity, and low accuracy. Outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR−); data were synthesized using Stata version 17 to pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs after extracting true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates. Analyses were stratified by clinically meaningful covariates such as test type, cutoffs, disease etiology, and fibrosis stage; at least 4 studies were required for pooled estimates, and if < 4 studies were included, accuracy metrics were reported as ranges. A bivariate regression model accounted for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity, and when comparing 2 serum biomarkers the proportional odds ratio (POR) was used with DORs pooled using a random effects model; POR = DOR1/DOR2 was calculated and a CI excluding 1 can suggest a significant difference between tests. Likelihood ratios were interpreted clinically; for example, LR+ 2, 5, and 10 and LR− 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 indicate a 15%, 30%, and 45% change in present probability to help "rule-in" or "rule-out" a diagnosis, respectively.

### Coagulation in liver disease: a guide for the clinician [^54f734bc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The human hemostasis system is complex and poorly understood after decades of intense scientific study. Despite multiple defects in routine coagulation laboratory studies in patients with chronic liver disease, there is growing evidence that these patients are effectively "rebalanced" with regard to procoagulant and anticoagulant activity and that most of these patients remain in a tenuous but balanced state of hemostasis. A major difficulty in the assessment of these patients is that there are no established laboratory tests that accurately reflect the changes in both the procoagulant and anticoagulant systems; therefore, routine laboratory testing is misleading to the clinician and may prompt inappropriate or risky therapies with little real benefit to the patient. The international normalized ratio is an example of this type of misleading test. Although the international normalized ratio is inextricably linked to prognosis and severity of protein synthetic dysfunction in acute and chronic liver disease, it is a very poor marker for bleeding risk and should not be used in isolation for this purpose. Coagulation disorders are critical in the management of frequent clinical scenarios such as esophageal variceal bleeding, invasive and percutaneous procedures, portal vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, and acute liver failure. This article summarizes the pathophysiology of hemostasis in liver disease, describes the strengths and weaknesses of various laboratory tests in assessment of these patients, and outlines the optimal management of hemostasis for some common clinical scenarios. Further research is needed for proper understanding of hemostasis in liver disease to optimally and safely manage these complex patients.

### Enhanced liver fibrosis test can predict clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease [^887ba55c]. Gut (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians use fibrosis in a liver biopsy to predict clinical outcomes of chronic liver disease. The performance of non-invasive tests has been evaluated against histological assessment of fibrosis but use of clinical outcomes as the reference standard would be ideal. The enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test was derived and validated in a large cohort of patients and shown to have high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80 95% CI 0.76 to 0.85) in identification of significant fibrosis on biopsy.

Objective

To evaluate ELF performance in predicting clinical outcomes by following up the original ELF cohort.

Methods

Patients recruited to the ELF study at seven English centres were followed up for liver morbidity and mortality by examination of clinical data. Defaulting/discharged patients were followed up by family practitioner questionnaires. Primary outcome measure was liver-related morbidity/liver-related death.

Results

457 patients were followed up (median 7 years), with ascertainment of clinical status in 92%. There were 61 liver-related outcomes (39 deaths). Survival analysis showed that the ELF score predicts liver outcomes, with people having the highest ELF scores being significantly more likely to have clinical outcomes than those in lower-score groups. A Cox proportional hazards model showed fully adjusted HRs of 75 (ELF score 12.52–16.67), 20 (10.426–12.51) and 5 (8.34–10.425) compared with patients with ELF < 8.34. A unit change in ELF is associated with a doubling of risk of liver-related outcome.

Conclusions

An ELF test can predict clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease and may be a useful prognostic tool in clinical practice.

### Hematological ratios in patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure: prognostic factors [^76991271]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is the most severe form of acutely decompensated cirrhosis and is characterized by the presence of intense systemic inflammation. Leucocyte quantification can serve as an indirect indicator of systemic inflammation. In our study, we investigated the predictive value of hematological ratios (neutrophils to lymphocytes, monocyte to lymphocytes, platelets to lymphocytes, lymphocytes to C-reactive protein, and neutrophils to lymphocytes and platelets) in acute decompensation (AD) and ACLF patients and their relation to disease severity and early mortality.

Patients and Methods

We included 60 patients with ACLF and AD, and 30 cirrhotic controls. Clinical data were collected, and survival was followed for 1 and 6months. Blood samples were analyzed at admission for differential leucocytes and assessed for liver and renal function tests. The leukocyte ratios were calculated and compared, and their correlation with liver function indicators and prognosis was assessed.

Results

All ratios were significantly higher in AD and ACLF patients compared to control (except for lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio which was significantly lower), and were positively correlated with Child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)-Na, and ACLF severity scores. Multivariate regression revealed that neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, and MELD-Na were independent prognostic factors of 1-month and 6-month mortality. A unique prognostic nomogram incorporating MELD-Na, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio could be proposed for predicting prognosis in AD and ACLF patients.

Conclusions

Cheap, easy, and noninvasive hematological ratios are introduced as a tool for early identification and risk stratification of AD and ACLF patients.

### Noninvasive diagnosis and prognosis of liver cirrhosis: a comparison of biological scores, elastometry, and metabolic liver function tests [^e2e4beb7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis have been extensively developed. We assessed the accuracy of liver stiffness measurement, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score, 13C-aminopyrine breath test, and indocyanine green plasma clearance for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease and for the prediction of severe complications in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

A total of 296 consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases of various causes were studied. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were (95% confidence interval) 0.93 (0.90–0.96) for liver stiffness measurement, 0.82 (0.77–0.87) for 13C-aminopyrine breath test, and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for APRI score. Using cutoff values of 14.1 kPa for liver stiffness, 4.15% dose/h for 13C-aminopyrine breath test, and 1 for APRI score, the positive predictive value was approximately 90% for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Using cutoff values of 65.2 kPa for liver stiffness, 1.17% dose/h for 13C-aminopyrine breath test, 2.82 for APRI score, and 51.1% for indocyanine green plasma clearance, the positive predictive value was approximately 80% for the occurrence of severe complications among cirrhotic patients.

Conclusion

Liver stiffness measurement, 13C-aminopyrine breath test, indocyanine green plasma clearance, and APRI score are reliable noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases of various causes, and are also prognostic indicators for the occurrence of severe complications in cirrhotic patients.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^266e5361]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD-IDSA pediatric hepatitis C initial assessment and monitoring note that children with chronic HCV infection usually appear clinically well on physical examination; hepatomegaly occurs in ≤ 10% of patients, and assessment of hepatic laboratory parameters, including albumin, aminotransferase levels, total bilirubin, INR, and platelet count, is recommended every 6–12 months. Persistently or intermittently elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels occur in approximately 50% of children with chronic HCV infection, but serum aminotransferase levels, however, do not consistently correlate with HCV liver disease severity. Laboratory testing for concomitant infections with HBV and HIV, and immunity to HAV, are also recommended due to shared risk factors and the need to vaccinate nonimmune children against HAV and HBV, and ultrasound-based, liver elastography appears increasingly promising for monitoring children and adolescents with chronic HCV infection; children with comorbid conditions and those receiving hepatotoxic drugs require careful monitoring.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure: far to go-a review [^92ccf815]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been recognized as a severe clinical syndrome based on the acute deterioration of chronic liver disease and is characterized by organ failure and high short-term mortality. Heterogeneous definitions and diagnostic criteria for the clinical condition have been proposed in different geographic regions due to the differences in aetiologies and precipitating events. Several predictive and prognostic scores have been developed and validated to guide clinical management. The specific pathophysiology of ACLF remains uncertain and is mainly associated with an intense systemic inflammatory response and immune-metabolism disorder based on current evidence. For ACLF patients, standardization of the treatment paradigm is required for different disease stages that may provide targeted treatment strategies for individual needs.

### Significance of theC-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis [^d41d19a6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Any chronic liver disease can lead to cirrhosis, characterized histologically by extensive fibrosis and the conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules. The severity of cirrhosis may range from a completely asymptomatic compensated phase to symptomatic decompensated liver disease presenting with ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and/or non-obstructive jaundice. Since cirrhosis represents the end-stage of any chronic liver disease, it has been mandatory to elaborate reliable and accurate predictors of its severity and prognosis. To date, two widely accepted prognostic scores are mainly used in clinical practice worldwide: the Child and the subsequently modified Child-Pugh score, and the more recently developed MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score, which has replaced the Child-Pugh score in prioritizing patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation.

Several 13 C-breath tests have been recently evaluated for the assessment of liver function in a variety of chronic liver diseases. Among them, the caffeine breath test (CBT) appears to be promising, since caffeine has high oral bioavailability, almost exclusive hepatic metabolism principally via demethylation by cytochrome P450 1A2 to CO 2, low extraction ratio, low plasma binding capacity and may be considered innocuous when used at test doses. Thus, CBT values can reflect the functional hepatic reserve and represent a good marker of the severity of liver function impairment.

Park et al found that CBT values correlate inversely and reproducibly with the degree of hepatic dysfunction, as estimated by Child-Pugh score. CBT values were lower in subjects with cirrhosis of varying etiology than in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. They also showed that the 13 C-CBT results can assess the severity of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B patients and may show improvement in liver function in response to long-term lamivudine therapy. In two further studies, it was shown that the CBT results can reliably predict severe hepatic fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It should be emphasized that the existing studies assessing the performance of CBT have included only patients with chronic liver disease and well-compensated cirrhosis, but not cases with decompensated cirrhosis. The aim of the current study was to determine the utility of the CBT in assessing cirrhosis and examine its relationship with MELD score.

### Assessment of liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a new evidence-based approach-the ALBI grade… [^c2e87ae8]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Cox regression analysis was performed on the Japanese training set to derive a model. By splitting its linear predictor at the 25th and 90th percentiles, three groups, according to survival, were generated. Using this classification, patients with HCC were assigned as low, medium, or high risk, describing the lowest 25% of risk, medium risk between the 25th and 90th percentile, and the highest 10% of risk, respectively. Evidence of deviation from proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Stata's phtest and through visual assessment of log-log survival plots. Multivariable Cox regression on the Japanese training set showed that vascular invasion, albumin, tumor size, log. Applying the model to the other cohorts, visual inspection of the curves again indicated that the discrimination between the three ALBI groups was as good as that of the C-P grade. This is reflected in the Harrell's C and Somers' D scores.

KM curves showing the ALBI breakdown of C-P grade A patients in the Japanese, European, and US and Chinese cohorts are shown in Figures 2A to 2C and reveal two distinct prognostic groups. Assessment of liver function is particularly important in clinical trials because it is perceived that cirrhosis is a competing cause of death. To isolate the impact of a specific HCC treatment on survival, many HCC treatment studies are limited to patients with C-P grade A. However, our findings suggest that not all C-P grade A patients are the same and that this heterogeneity may have an impact on survival findings. The fact that both serum bilirubin and albumin are part of the battery of tests widely referred to as liver function tests suggests that our model is, indeed, measuring liver function, a contention that is supported by our demonstration that the model showed discrimination in patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis.

We have examined this group specifically for the aforementioned reason, not to suggest that it would have a role outside the area of HCC and chronic liver disease. Interestingly, in a systematic review of prognostic indicators in cirrhosis, serum albumin and bilirubin were the two most prominent individual prognostic variables in good studies.

### Assessment of liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a new evidence-based approach-the ALBI grade [^904132d1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have associated chronic liver disease, the severity of which is currently assessed by the Child-Pugh (C-P) grade. In this international collaboration, we identify objective measures of liver function/dysfunction that independently influence survival in patients with HCC and then combine these into a model that could be compared with the conventional C-P grade.

Patients and Methods

We developed a simple model to assess liver function, based on 1,313 patients with HCC of all stages from Japan, that involved only serum bilirubin and albumin levels. We then tested the model using similar cohorts from other geographical regions (n = 5,097) and other clinical situations (patients undergoing resection [n = 525] or sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC [n = 1,132]). The specificity of the model for liver (dys)function was tested in patients with chronic liver disease but without HCC (n = 501).

Results

The model, the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade, performed at least as well as the C-P grade in all geographic regions. The majority of patients with HCC had C-P grade A disease at presentation, and within this C-P grade, ALBI revealed two classes with clearly different prognoses. Its utility in patients with chronic liver disease alone supported the contention that the ALBI grade was indeed an index of liver (dys)function.

Conclusion

The ALBI grade offers a simple, evidence-based, objective, and discriminatory method of assessing liver function in HCC that has been extensively tested in an international setting. This new model eliminates the need for subjective variables such as ascites and encephalopathy, a requirement in the conventional C-P grade.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^5ac38a56]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure is emerging as a major cause of mortality. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^37f87728]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

COVID‐19 in Special Populations With Liver Disease

Cirrhosis

Patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver decompensation and acute‐on‐chronic liver failure (ACLF) following viral infection, such as influenza. Whether the same is true for patients with cirrhosis with SARS‐CoV‐2 remains to be determined. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with worsening Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, ACLF, and death. A study comparing hepatic liver‐related outcomes between 185 patients without cirrhosis but with CLD and 43 patients with cirrhosis of mostly metabolic and viral etiology observed a higher rate of severe liver injury and death with more advanced stage of liver disease following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, especially in patients with Child‐Pugh score of ≥ 9. Twenty percent of patients with cirrhosis developed either ACLF or acute decompensation. Moreover, mortality was significantly higher among patients with cirrhosis with COVID‐19 compared with a control group with cirrhosis who were admitted for bacterial infections. However, a U.S. multicenter study that compared inpatient mortality among patients with cirrhosis with or without COVID‐19 with a matched control group with COVID‐19 without cirrhosis also reported a higher mortality among patients with COVID‐19 with underlying cirrhosis compared with those without cirrhosis (30% vs 13%, respectively) but similar mortality between the two groups with cirrhosis (30% vs. 20%, respectively). Interestingly, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, a score of prognostic comorbidities, was the only independent mortality predictor in patients with cirrhosis, suggesting an important role of multiple comorbidities in determining the severity of COVID‐19. Thus, patients with cirrhosis who contract SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may be at greater risk for COVID‐19 and liver‐related mortality, but it remains to be determined if their mortality is higher compared with patients with cirrhosis who acquire other viral or bacterial infections. Initial data on patients with COVID‐19 and cirrhosis from the COVID‐Hep registry showed that lung disease and liver‐related death accounted respectively for 78.7% and 12.2% of causes. Mortality strongly correlated with baseline liver function and was up to 43.3% in patients with Child‐Pugh class B cirrhosis and 63% in patients with Child‐Pugh class C.

### The clinical value of tests of liver function… [^56960944]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This study is an effort to evaluate clinically certain so-called tests of liver function on the basis of the results obtained from their use in cases of known or anticipated diseases of the liver. The difficulties encountered in the application of functional tests to the liver have been commented on frequently in recent literature and have been concisely summarized by Carlson. 1 A critical survey of the many liver function tests which have been introduced led Mann and Bollman2 to the conclusion that the tests which offered the greatest clinical possibilities were those concerned with the measurement of serum bilirubin and the excretion of specific dyes. These observations have been supported in general by the workers who have applied the tests to clinical material, the van den Bergh reaction and the icterus index being used in the study of serum bilirubin and one of the halogenated phenolphthaleins as the specific dye.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^5cee9529]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis and macrocytic anemia are associated with the severity of liver disease. In a study conducted by Yang et al, macrocytic anemia was associated with the severity of liver disease in patients with decompensated cirrhosis related to hepatitis B. The MELD score was used to assess the severity of liver disease in this study. In another study conducted by Yoon et al, elevated MCV levels were associated with greater liver cancer mortality in men.

Of the 58 patients who had macrocytosis, only 29 had low serum B12 levels. Acute and chronic liver disease is associated with higher serum B12 levels, and this has been attributed to the release of vitamin B12 from the liver as a result of hepatocellular necrosis and increased binding of B12 with serum proteins. In addition, higher B12 levels are associated with severe liver disease and prognosis.

In conclusion, in our study we found a significant correlation between the MELD score and the degree of anemia. A higher MELD score was associated with more severe hematological complications. Whether the correction of anemia in such patients at an early stage will retard the progression of disease is debatable and requires further studies. However, lower Hb levels were definitely associated with more severe forms of liver cirrhosis, as was established by the correlations with MELD score and CTP class in this study. Larger studies will be needed to assess whether Hb should be used as a marker for the severity of liver disease. The reverse is also true: MELD score can be used effectively to predict hematological complications in such patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Anemia in liver cirrhosis is multifactorial and the most common complication encountered
Hemoglobin levels decrease with an increase in the severity of liver disease
Macrocytosis is also associated with greater severity of liver disease

What the new findings are:

In this study there was a significant negative correlation between model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and hemoglobin levels
Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) scores also showed that hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in CTP class C patients
Macrocytosis was significantly higher in patients with MELD scores > 12

### The correlation between triiodothyronine and the severity of liver fibrosis [^d8fe1a5b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

NAFLD and T2DM are common diseases that often coexist and can act synergistically to cause adverse outcomes. The coexistence of NAFLD and T2DM increases the likelihood of the onset of diabetic complications and increases the risk of progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis, HCC, and even death. Studies have shown that almost 70% of diabetic patients may also have NAFLD, and the prevalence of biopsy-proven NASH is 20% in T2DM patients with normal liver function. The prevalence of prediabetes and T2DM is 85% in patients with NAFLD, and is more than two times higher than that in the general population. Liver biopsy studies have clarified that the coexistence of NAFLD and T2DM has an absolute cumulative effect on cirrhosis, liver-related and all-cause mortality, and that the adverse consequences of the coexistence of NAFLD and T2DM are more severe than either condition alone. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that T2DM patients who have elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or steatosis of liver should be screened and evaluated for liver fibrosis and NASH, and that screening for NAFLD should focus on identifying patients with liver fibrosis, among whom early intervention may prevent progression to the decompensated cirrhotic stage. The severity of liver fibrosis is an important predictor of cirrhosis, liver transplantation and liver-related death in patients with NAFLD, where the risk of liver-related death increases exponentially with increasing fibrosis stage. Studies have shown that advanced liver fibrosis exists in 5–7% of T2DM patients and is even more common in obese T2DM patients, whose prognosis is usually poor and need early intervention to reduce fibrosis progression. However, the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis progression is not fully understood and requires urgent in-depth study.

### Fibrosis and disease progression in hepatitis C [^7e80c79f]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The progression of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C determines the ultimate prognosis and thus the need and urgency of therapy. Fibrogenesis is a complex dynamic process, which is mediated by necroinflammation and activation of stellate cells. The liver biopsy remains the gold standard to assess fibrosis. Scoring systems allow a semiquantitative assessment and are useful for cross-sectional and cohort studies and in treatment trials. The rate at which fibrosis progresses varies markedly between patients. The major factors known to be associated with fibrosis progression are older age at infection, male gender, and excessive alcohol consumption. Viral load and genotype do not seem to influence significantly the progression rate. Progression of fibrosis is more rapid in immunocompromised patients. Hepatic steatosis, obesity, and diabetes may also contribute to more rapid progression of fibrosis. There are no tests that reliably predict the rate of progression of fibrosis in an individual patient. High serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are associated with a higher risk of fibrosis progression, and worsening of fibrosis is uncommon in patients with persistently normal serum aminotransferase levels. Serum markers for fibrosis are not reliable and need to be improved and validated. Liver biopsy provides the most accurate information on the stage of fibrosis and grade of necroinflammation, both of which have prognostic significance. Repeating the liver biopsy, 3 to 5 years after an initial biopsy is the most accurate means of assessing the progression of fibrosis.

### The galactose elimination capacity and mortality in 781 Danish patients with newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis: a cohort study [^b6e9bf5a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease with high mortality. The condition implies a loss of liver function, and it is a fundamental assumption that the extent of this loss is important for survival. Still, little is known about the association between the prognosis of the patients and their liver function. Clinicians therefore often use scores based on standard blood chemistry tests and clinical signs of liver disease, such as the Child-Pugh score and the MELD-score, as prognostic indicators. However, these scores reflect symptoms and complications of the liver disease, not the liver function as such.

The carbohydrate galactose is metabolized nearly exclusively in the liver, and the elimination rate at blood concentrations high enough to yield near-saturated enzymatic conversion, the galactose elimination capacity (GEC), is used as a quantitative measure of the metabolic capacity of the liver. GEC is assumed to reflect the liver's total capacity to serve the vitally important metabolic homeostasis of the organism.

A number of studies support the concept that the metabolic capacity of the liver, as measured with the GEC, is associated with mortality of cirrhosis patients: A prognostic value of the test was documented in patients with acute liver failure, and studies of cirrhosis patients found that the GEC added prognostic information beyond that obtained by standard blood chemistry tests, although this was not a consistent finding. These studies, however, included only selected cirrhosis patients; comprised an insufficient number of patients (between 35 and 194); had relatively short observation time; and aimed to examine the utility of including the GEC in clinical prediction rules, not its association with mortality. Thus the concept of an association between GEC and mortality of cirrhosis patients remains unproven despite its biologic plausibility. The association is best examined in a large cohort of cirrhosis patients with wide variation in GEC, and neither the inclusion criteria nor the analysis should include possible correlates of GEC, such as standard blood chemistry tests or clinical signs of liver failure. Furthermore, an analysis of the association between GEC and mortality should adjust for age and gender because the GEC declines with age and is higher in men than in women, and it should also adjust for comorbidity that has a considerable impact on mortality. We have available a sufficiently large and well-defined patient material to conduct such an analysis: 781 Danish patients with newly-diagnosed cirrhosis followed for up to 13 years.

### Predictors of clinical outcomes in cirrhosis patients [^c723560d]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current review aims to explain the different systems available to clinicians for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

Recent Findings

Cirrhosis is the final stage of chronic liver disease and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most commonly utilized tools to predict outcomes in patients with cirrhosis include the following: assessing severity of portal hypertension using hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements, using scoring systems such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores, and recently, clinical staging systems based on cirrhosis-related clinical complications. Assessing portal pressure with HVPG measurements provides valuable prognostic information, yet is costly, time-consuming, and invasive. MELD and CPT scores can be calculated quickly and not only assess liver function, but also yield predictive information. However, they represent only one point in time, and do not take into account the full clinical picture. Clinical staging systems have traditionally been focused on compensated and decompensated stages, with newer models assessing the influence of cirrhosis-related complications. However, these are not commonly utilized.

Summary

Predicting clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis is challenging, and is likely best accomplished with a combination of objective data (such as MELD and HVPG provide) in addition to the clinical course of cirrhosis.

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^aef209aa]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages and also significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present in persistently normal ALT levels HBV, HCV carriers or similarly, in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the large number of persons in the general population which may harbor a clinically significant liver disease behind the screen of normal alanine aminotransferase, more attention should be devoted to future research for alternative noninvasive markers of liver damage.

### Severity of liver test abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 depends on comorbidities and predicts early in-hospital mortality [^2632b5bc]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality.

Methods

Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe.

Results

LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present.

Conclusion

Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.

### HDL-related biomarkers are robust predictors of survival in patients with chronic liver failure [^8187eb5e]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are reduced in patients with chronic liver disease and inversely correlate with disease severity. During acute conditions such as sepsis, HDL-C levels decrease rapidly and HDL particles undergo profound changes in their composition and function. We aimed to determine whether indices of HDL quantity and quality associate with progression and survival in patients with advanced liver disease.

Methods

HDL-related biomarkers were studied in 508 patients with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis (including acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF]) and 40 age- and gender-matched controls. Specifically, we studied levels of HDL-C, its subclasses HDL2-C and HDL3-C, and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA-I), as well as HDL cholesterol efflux capacity as a metric of HDL functionality.

Results

Baseline levels of HDL-C and apoA-I were significantly lower in patients with stable cirrhosis compared to controls and were further decreased in patients with acute decompensation (AD) and ACLF. In stable cirrhosis (n = 228), both HDL-C and apoA-I predicted the development of liver-related complications independently of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. In patients with AD, with or without ACLF (n = 280), both HDL-C and apoA-I were MELD-independent predictors of 90-day mortality. On ROC analysis, both HDL-C and apoA-I had high diagnostic accuracy for 90-day mortality in patients with AD (AUROCs of 0.79 and 0.80, respectively, similar to that of MELD 0.81). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, HDL-C < 17 mg/dl and apoA-I < 50 mg/dl indicated poor short-term survival. The prognostic accuracy of HDL-C was validated in a large external validation cohort of 985 patients with portal hypertension due to advanced chronic liver disease (AUROCs HDL-C: 0.81 vs. MELD: 0.77).

Conclusion

HDL-related biomarkers are robust predictors of disease progression and survival in chronic liver failure.

Lay Summary

People who suffer from cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) have low levels of cholesterol carried by high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C). These alterations are connected to inflammation, which is a problem in severe liver disease. Herein, we show that reduced levels of HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I, the main protein carried by HDL) are closely linked to the severity of liver failure, its complications and survival. Both HDL-C and apoA-I can be easily measured in clinical laboratories and are as good as currently used prognostic scores calculated from several laboratory values by complex formulas.

### The influence of muscle performance and fatigue on prognosis in patients with compensated liver disease [^f807d029]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor muscle function is associated with a negative prognosis in advanced liver disease but the impact in compensated chronic liver disease is unknown. Similar prognostic uncertainty applies to fatigue. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of muscle performance and fatigue in a cohort of patients with compensated chronic liver disease.

Methods

We followed 241 patients with compensated chronic liver disease included in a study between 2010 and 2014. Subjects were 52 ± 15 years (mean ± SD; 134 females). All subjects performed four muscle function tests: "Timed Up and Go" test, walking speed, handgrip strength, and standing heel-rises. Fatigue was evaluated by fatigue impact scale. Follow up data was acquired through hospital records and registries.

Results

During follow up of 6.75 ± 1.4 years, 13 patients died (5.5%) and 11 (4.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation. A timed up and go over 10 s was not significantly associated with a lower survival (Kaplan-Meier, log rank test p = 0.132), or with transplant free survival (p = 0.543), Fig. 3. It was also not specifically associated with liver related causes of death (p = 0.597). The other physical functioning tests and fatigue were not significantly associated with mortality or transplant-free survival (p > 0.05 for all) except for maximal walking speed (2.2 vs. 1.9 m/s, p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that muscle function and fatigue are not key prognostic factors in compensated chronic liver disease. However, further confirmation in future studies is needed.

### Hepatology may have problems with putative surrogate outcome measures [^0b2e0edd]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

A surrogate outcome measure is a laboratory measurement, a physical sign, or another intermediate substitute that is able to predict an intervention's effect on a clinically meaningful outcome. A clinical outcome detects how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate outcome measures occur faster or more often, are cheaper, and/or are less invasively achieved than the clinical outcome. In practice, validation is surprisingly often overlooked, especially if a biologic plausible rationale is proposed. Surrogate outcomes must be validated before use. The first step in validation is to demonstrate a correlation between the putative surrogate and the clinical outcome, e.g., the higher the surrogate the shorter time to death. However, a correlation is not sufficient to validate the surrogate. The second step is to establish if the intervention's effect on the surrogate outcome accurately predicts the intervention's effect on the clinical outcome. In hepatology a number of putative surrogate outcomes are used both in clinical research and in clinical practice without having been properly validated. Sustained virological response to interferons and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C, serum bilirubin concentration following ursodeoxycholic acid or immunosuppressants for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and nutritional outcomes following artificial nutrition for liver patients may not be valid surrogates for morbidity or mortality. The challenge is to develop reliable surrogates, both to facilitate the development of new interventions and to ensure our patients and us that these interventions are effective clinically.

### The influence of muscle performance and fatigue on prognosis in patients with compensated liver disease [^7c82751a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Poor muscle function is a frequent finding in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD). A common cause of muscle dysfunction in this population is sarcopenia, which has previously been shown to be a negative prognostic factor. The prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with advanced CLD has been estimated to be as much as 37.5%. However studies regarding the prevalence of sarcopenia and poor muscle function in non-advanced CLD are few, and muscle function tests such as the Timed up and go test have been linked to a worse prognosis in several other populations. The suggested definitions of sarcopenia have moved to focus on muscle function rather than solely on muscle mass, which has not been studied to the same extent in compensated CLD, but the etiology of sarcopenia and poor muscle performance is likely multifactorial in most patients with liver disease and possibly different in some aspects in advanced versus non-advanced CLD. Previous studies have also shown that sarcopenia in patients with decompensated liver disease is related to hepatic encephalopathy, mortality, worse outcome following liver transplantation, and other complications of decompensated chronic liver disease. However, the impact of muscle function on prognosis in compensated CLD is unknown.

Another common and well-known symptom in patients with CLD is fatigue which has also been linked to poor muscle function. Peripheral muscle dysfunction has been suggested as a contributing factor to fatigue, at least in Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). However, the impact of fatigue on prognosis in compensated CLD is unknown.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^91dbad79]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

There is ongoing evidence that vitamin D is related to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis. Although the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis is strongly documented, its pathogenic association with advanced liver fibrosis remains controversial. There is evidence of a significant relation of 25(OH)D levels with the degree of liver dysfunction, considering that an inverse correlation of 25(OH)D levels with both Child-Pugh score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease has been reported. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase the risk for overall mortality and infections in patients with cirrhosis. Vitamin D deficiency has been also associated with advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma and poor prognosis. Finally, there are studies suggesting that patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal vitamin D levels have higher virological response to treatment. However, there are not enough studies conducted in cirrhotic-only populations. The association between vitamin D and cirrhosis demonstrates a great potential for clinical application. The relation between vitamin D deficiency and the degree of liver function, degree of fibrosis and infectious complications could support its use as a prognostic index and a diagnostic tool.

### Resistin serum levels are associated with insulin resistance, disease severity, clinical complications, and prognosis in patients with chronic liver diseases [^71116fc4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are present in nearly all patients with liver cirrhosis. Resistin, a mainly adipose-derived peptide hormone, reduces insulin sensitivity in adipocytes, skeletal muscles, and hepatocytes. In experimental cirrhosis models, resistin expression is upregulated. We aimed to evaluate the potential clinical value of resistin in chronic liver diseases (CLD).

Methods

Serum resistin was measured in 82 non-diabetic CLD patients during evaluation for potential liver transplantation and 76 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were followed for 6 yr.

Results

Resistin serum levels were significantly elevated in patients with liver cirrhosis compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Resistin increased with stage of liver cirrhosis as defined by Child-Pugh or model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Serum resistin correlated with insulin secretion (C-peptide, p < 0.001) and inversely with insulin sensitivity (HOMA-index, p = 0.008) in CLD patients. Resistin also correlated inversely with markers of hepatic biosynthetic capacity and positively with markers of inflammation such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as with clinical complications, e.g., portal hypertension. Patients with elevated resistin had increased mortality in 6-yr-survival (p = 0.005, Cox regression model).

Conclusion

Resistin offers novel application potential as a clinical biomarker in the assessment of liver cirrhosis. Elevated resistin may contribute to insulin resistance in advanced liver dysfunction.

### The influence of muscle performance and fatigue on prognosis in patients with compensated liver disease [^21553025]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fatigue was not associated with a lower overall survival or transplant free survival in our cohort. A previous study has suggested that fatigue in primary biliary cholangitis was associated with a lower rate of survival at a 4 year follow up. The reason for this finding is unknown, but we could not confirm this in our study. The cohorts are not entirely comparable regarding liver disease severity and in our cohort a broader range of liver diseases were also included, which could explain that we could not demonstrate the same findings. However, the association between fatigue and severity of liver disease is low.

Our study has several strengths. We had a relatively long follow-up period. However, ideally this should have been even longer to record a larger number of outcome events, especially when studying a group with patients with compensated liver disease. Previous studies suggest that significant mortality and decompensation in chronic liver disease and compensated cirrhosis generally occurs at periods of longer follow-up than the period used in our cohort. This would support the hypothesis that a longer follow-up period would have been required in our study. Furthermore, we had a relatively large cohort in which muscle function was characterized in a structured manner. We also used validated registries, which have a high degree of reliability, and we also had access to the Swedish electronic national medical records, which were scrutinized. During the year 2020, only 0.9% of subjects who died in Sweden did not receive a certificate of cause of death. Another strength in our study is the variety of muscle function tests that all subjects underwent at inclusion done by a single investigator, ensuring a standardized procedure. By using validated tests for both upper and lower body strength, and functional test such as the timed up and go, we achieved a comprehensive assessment of the muscle function. We also used validated questionnaires for both fatigue and the level of physical activity. The FIS has also been used in liver populations in previous studies.

### Correlation of FIBROSpect II with histologic and morphometric evaluation of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C [^612a2868]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Accurate disease staging in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection helps guide treatment and may provide prognostic information. Liver biopsies are invasive, costly, and associated with morbidity. We hypothesized that a noninvasive test of liver fibrosis can accurately stage liver fibrosis. We prospectively evaluated the FIBROSpect II (FSII) biomarker panel versus pathology assessment and a quantitative measure of fibrosis.

Methods

Liver biopsy specimens and serum were obtained from 252 CHC patients, including 50 posttransplant, from 3 tertiary centers. Biopsy specimens were scored centrally and independently at each site, along with central quantification of fibrosis by digitized morphometry. Serum tests were performed blinded to clinical or histologic evaluation.

Results

The mean biopsy specimen length was 1.95 ± 0.87 cm; prevalence of stage F2 through F4 fibrosis was 77%. Agreement between central and site readings for individual stages was modest (k = 0.674), with concordant readings in 106 of 248 (43%) biopsy specimens. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for FSII and morphometry for stages F2 through F4 for concordant biopsy specimens were 0.823 and 0.728, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for FSII were 83.5% and 66.7%, respectively, with an accuracy of 80.2%. The aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index sensitivity and specificity for predicting F2 through F4 were 30.4% and 100%, respectively, the indeterminate rate was 40.4%, and the accuracy rate was 48.4%. The accuracy of FSII in concordant biopsy specimens in the posttransplant cohort was 73%.

Conclusions

Serum biomarkers can differentiate mild from moderate-to-severe fibrosis. This prospective study validates the performance characteristics of FSII in CHC patients and a posttransplant cohort. Assessing the diagnostic utility of biomarkers is limited by variability in methods to quantify fibrosis and poor interobserver agreement for histologic staging.

### Liver function estimation using multiphase hepatic CT: diagnostic performance of iodine-uptake and volumetric parameters [^546da8fe]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Accurate estimation of liver function is essential for assessing disease severity, monitoring progression, and predicting the prognosis of chronic liver disease. It also facilitates optimal surgical planning to minimize the risk of liver failure, a major cause of mortality and morbidity after hepatectomy. The liver functional assessment is crucial not only in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), most of whom have underlying cirrhosis, but also in patients with hepatic metastases due to the rising prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced liver damage. While biochemical parameters and clinical scoring systems such as the Child–Pugh score are commonly used as static liver functional makers, these methods may have limited predictive value in predicting the risk of hepatic decompensation and patient prognosis.

The indocyanine green (ICG) retention after 15-min (ICG-R15) is a well-established dynamic quantitative test for estimating liver function and determining the safe extent of hepatectomy. The utility of the ICG test has been validated and recognized in European countries, with the recently developed European guidelines recommending it prior to hepatectomy as a next-step test following static biochemical function assessments. It also has the potential to predict the severity of portal hypertension, the prognosis of cirrhosis, and clinical outcomes following therapeutic interventions other than hepatectomy. Specifically, an ICG-R15 ≥ 20% indicates severe liver dysfunction which is considered a contraindication for major hepatectomy. Although the ICG test is used as one of the reference standards for liver function, it is relatively time-consuming and lacks imaging guidance and morphological information. In contrast, technetium-99m diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid galactosyl human serum albumin (99m Tc-GSA) scintigraphy is an imaging-based liver function test. 99m Tc-GSA binds exclusively to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes without being taken up by other organs. Given that decreased receptor expression is indicative of liver damage, 99m Tc-GSA scintigraphy provides a direct evaluation of regional hepatocyte function. Consequently, its use is recommended for patients with a limited future liver remnant, underlying liver disease, or when volume modulation strategies are implemented before major hepatectomy. However, there are drawbacks such as limited availability, particularly in Western countries, high cost, technical complexity, and increased radiation exposure, which may limit its broad clinical applicability and frequent use in screening.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^798c26c7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the predicting role of AAR value on developing cirrhosis in a prospectively enrolled cohort of hospitalized CHB patients by collecting their clinical and follow-up data after at least 6 months. We arrived at the conclusion that patients with higher AAR value exhibited significantly increasing risk of cirrhosis development independent of other host characteristics (gender, age, drinking history, smoking history and ALBI grade). Moreover, the effect remained prominent with the increasing follow-up time.

Cirrhosis is a multi-stage process involving many pathological changes, manifested as extensive liver parenchyma damage, liver cell necrosis, fibrous tissue proliferation, normal liver structure disorder and hard texture. Consequently, it is accomplished with abnormal liver function at the most time. Hepatic function produces a marked effect on predicting the development and prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and other liver diseases. Serum ALT and AST are two common liver enzymes that are routinely detected in the clinical setting, which was originated from damaged hepatocytes. Their activities have been widely considered the commonest marker to reflect the severity of liver injury, so as to monitor CLD prognosis and treating response, as well as in aiding decisions for clinical strategy. For example, normalized levels of enzymes for a prolonged period are a prompting to discontinue treatment in patients with hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and overlap syndrome. AAR value is one main effective hallmark to reflect extent of liver damage and relevant complication, by comprehensively considering the characteristics of AST and ALT released into the blood. According to previous study, AAR was mainly used as a marker to identify fibrosis in patients with NAFLD(non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), and performed good discrimination accuracy in advanced alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Furthermore, AAR value was also revealed to be correlated with increased risks for development of CHC-related cirrhosis. Although numerous clinical data were conducted to identify the clinical value of AAR on liver diseases, non-ignorable disputation was manifested.

Chronic liver diseases (CLD) are a major worldwide health problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CLD were the 12th leading cause of death in the USA in 2015. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, and hepatitis C virus–induced liver disease are the major etiologies of CLD in the USA and Europe, while hepatitis B virus is the leading cause in high-prevalence regions, such as Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the prevalence of CLD from most etiologies has been stable, the prevalence of NAFLD has increased steadily, and this condition has now become the most common cause of CLD worldwide, affecting between 80 and 100 million individuals in the USA alone.

Early diagnosis of CLD and accurate assessment of liver disease severity are key determinants for optimized patient management, since early treatment and lifestyle modification can arrest disease progression and even lead to improved hepatic function and a reversal of histological abnormalities.

Assessment of liver function is an important issue for treatment individualization (etiological therapies and hepatocellular carcinoma) and follow-up, as well as for allocation of donors for living donor liver transplantation. In daily practice, the severity of liver disease and liver function is often based on clinical signs of disease and biochemical blood parameters, such as the levels of albumin and bilirubin, as well as prothrombin time. Grading systems, such as the albumin-bilirubin ratio (ALBI) score, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), or the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD), combine these parameters to determine liver function and are used for treatment decision-making. In addition to these tests, the indocyanine clearance, 13 C methacetin breath test, and galactose elimination capacity are established methods for the evaluation of liver function.

### Functional liver imaging score derived from hepatobiliary-specific contrast-enhanced MRI: a study on agreement and correlation [^303cf5a6]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assessment of liver function is critically important for personalized management of CLD and hepatic tumors, as well as for preoperative evaluation in liver transplantation. In clinical practice, the assessment of liver disease severity and functional impairment predominantly relies on clinical signs and blood biochemical markers, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), along with manifestations like ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, several standardized liver function scoring systems are widely employed, including the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score, CTP, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and the Indocyanine Green Retention Test at 15 min (ICG-R15).

Although the aforementioned laboratory parameters and liver function grading systems are instrumental in guiding clinical decisions, they have notable limitations. The ALBI inadequately reflects the true functional status of end-stage liver disease. Furthermore, its reliance on albumin and bilirubin levels may be confounded by nutritional status or biliary obstruction, leading to inaccuracies. The CTP contains five equally weighted parameters: TB, ALB, PT, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. However, these parameters are susceptible to extraneous influences, and the grading of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy involves subjective evaluation. The MELD incorporates TB, creatinine, and the International Normalized Ratio (INR), but fails to account for complications related to portal hypertension. Moreover, non-hepatic factors may alter TB, INR, or creatinine levels, compromising its validity. Despite being regarded as the "gold standard" for assessing functional hepatic reserve, the ICG-R15 test requires prolonged testing time, lacks real-time liver imaging information, and is prone to interference from hepatic blood flow or biliary excretion, limiting its accuracy.

### Transient elastography for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease [^0506807b]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

There is increasing interest in developing noninvasive means to evaluate liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease to determine disease severity, prognosis and optimal treatment. Transient elastography (TE) has previously been demonstrated to predict the presence or absence of advanced fibrosis. The current study was conducted to determine whether TE can identify patients with chronic liver disease at risk of clinical decompensation. A total of 667 patients underwent TE and were followed for a median of 861 days and 57 patients achieved the primary outcome, a composite of clinical endpoints including death, ascites, encephalopathy, increased Child Score ≥ 2, variceal bleed, hepatocellular carcinoma or listing for transplant. Overall, TE had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 for predicting clinical outcome. Using a cut-off of 10.5 kPa, TE has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%, 63.0%, 19.3% and 99.2%, respectively. A predictive model for clinical events was developed using generalized cross-validation for clinical endpoints considering TE, liver biopsy results and multiple other predictors. Individually, TE performed better than biopsy, or any other variable, for predicting clinical outcome [Harrell's C Statistic 0.86 for TE, 0.78 for stage]. Patients with a TE score of > 12.5 kPa were found to have a relative hazard for clinical event of 18.99 compared with patients with TE score < 10.5. A combined variable model including TE, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) yielded the highest predictive accuracy with Harrell's C value of 0.93. In the subset of patients with cirrhosis, TE was not found to be independently associated with clinical outcomes in univariate or multivariate analysis although it retained a high sensitivity and NPV of 97.5% and 92.3%, respectively, at a kPa cut-off of 10.5. TE can successfully identify patients with chronic liver disease who are at low risk of clinical decompensation over a time period of 2 years.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^5419c965]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Anemia is more severe in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis and can be a predictor of the severity of liver disease.

Methods

In this cross-sectional observational study, we included 181 cirrhotic patients with anemia owing to liver cirrhosis and its complications. The population was divided into 2 groups based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the severity of anemia was assessed in the 2 groups. Similarly, hemoglobin levels were assessed in 3 groups based on the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification.

Results

There was a statistically significant correlation between CTP class and hemoglobin (P < 0.001), with the lowest hemoglobin levels in CTP C patients. The correlation coefficient between hemoglobin and MELD score was -0.671 and was statistically significant, establishing that hemoglobin levels decrease with increasing severity of liver cirrhosis. Of 58 patients with macrocytosis, 45 (77.6%) had a MELD score of > 12, whereas only 13 patients (22.4%) had a MELD score of < 12. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

This study shows that hemoglobin levels decrease with increasing severity of liver disease; thus, this measure can be used in the initial assessment of patients to give a picture of the severity of the disease. A larger prospective trial is needed to establish the use of hemoglobin levels for assessing severity and predicting mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Regarding specific circumstances for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (diagnosis), EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to establish the diagnosis and grade acute-on-chronic liver failure based on the assessment of organ function as defined by the CLIF-C Organ Failure score.

### Non-invasive markers for hepatic fibrosis [^e0aaf58c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Successful individualized management of chronic liver disease depends on the correct staging of liver fibrosis. In order to provide the means of monitoring the course of liver disease and its response to therapy, staging should be performed in a non-invasive and reproducible manner. The fact that the process of fibrogenesis is a component of the normal healing response hampers the development of disease-specific biomarkers; this is why the quest for suitable non-invasive biomarker of liver fibrosis has become one of the biggest challenges in translational hepatology. A number of non-invasive techniques ranging from serum biomarker assays to advanced imaging techniques are being developed. Among non-invasive methods that have gained the strongest clinical foothold are FibroScan elastometry and serum-based APRI and FibroTest. There are many other tests that are not yet widely validated, but remain promising. Major validation efforts to enroll large cohorts of patients with chronic liver diseases controlled for important confounders such as ethnicity, body mass index and etiology of liver disease, must be undertaken.

Importantly, most non-invasive tests fail to differentiate between early stages of fibrosis. In fact, most of these tests can primarily distinguish cirrhosis from no or minimal fibrosis. For the diagnosis of significant liver fibrosis (F ≥ 2) non invasive tests cannot yet replace liver biopsy. Therefore, the current utility of non-invasive diagnostics remains limited to pre-screening allowing physician to narrow the population of patient before definitive testing of liver fibrosis by biopsy of the liver.

### Serum liver fibrosis markers predict hepatic decompensation in compensated cirrhosis [^4ea6b2d9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of fibrosis provides considerable information and is highly valuable not only for.

the diagnosis but also for the prognosis and for the therapeutic decision. In recent years, due to the increasing need to easily and accurately stage liver fibrosis before treatment and monitor the progress of the disease, non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis have been extensively investigated. Biomarkers of liver fibrosis can be divided into direct and indirect markers. Direct markers are fragments of the liver matrix components produced during the fibrotic process and the molecules represent the intensity of fibrogenesis or fibrinolysis such as HA, LN, CIV, and metalloproteinases. The majority of earlier studies evaluating non-invasive fibrosis tests, were mainly cross-sectional with the aim of correlating levels of different types of simple and complex biomarkers or imaging with the stage of liver fibrosis. Only a small number of studies for these markers and their combination were designed to assess disease progression. Nevertheless, these studies were performed in a low number of patients or focused on the value of HA.

AASLD practice guidance — prognosis and prediction of ACLF development: The PREDICT study, a large, prospective European cohort (n = 1071 patients with decompensated cirrhosis), identified a subgroup named pre-ACLF who were at higher risk of developing ACLF and of 3-month and 1-year mortality; these patients had a higher frequency of complications prior to enrollment and higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and white blood cells [WBCs]) that progressively increased during follow-up together with higher severity scores at admission (Chronic Liver Failure Consortium [CLIF-C] acute decompensation, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD], and MELD-Na) compared with those who did not develop ACLF. Although these characteristics may help identify patients needing closer monitoring, no individual or combination of clinical or analytical variables were identified as accurate biomarkers to predict the development of ACLF.

### Serum aminotransferase levels and platelet counts as predictors of degree of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C virus infection [^15cc3e34]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

In patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, liver fibrosis stage is a prognostic factor for therapy outcome. So far, a liver biopsy is necessary to determine disease stage accurately. We sought to develop a simple, noninvasive method of accurately predicting the degree of liver fibrosis in chronic HCV infection.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 211 consecutive patients with chronic HCV, who received a liver biopsy at the Liver Center of the University of California, San Diego. A total of 58 of these patients had a positive history of alcohol abuse, and we analyzed them separately in a sensitivity analysis. AST/ALT ratio and platelet counts were determined in all patients. Fibrosis was staged using the METAVIR score.

Results

Both AST/ALT ratio and platelet counts correlated significantly with the disease stage (r = 0.190, p = 0.006, and r = -0.543, p < 0.00, respectively). In a sensitivity analysis, there was no correlation between AST/ALT ratio and disease stage for patients with a history of alcohol abuse. For patients without history of alcohol abuse, the correlation between disease stage, AST/ALT ratio, and platelet counts was r = 0.297, p < 0.00, and r = 0.560, p < 0.00, respectively. In these patients, AST/ALT ratio ≥ 1 in combination with a platelet count of < 150,000/mm3 can identify patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (stages 3 and 4) with a positive predictive value of 93.1%. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value were 41.2%, 99.1%, and 85.0%, respectively. In patients with ALT/AST ratio of < 1 or platelet counts of > 150,000/mm3, these laboratory parameters cannot predict liver fibrosis stage.

Conclusion

AST/ALT ratio in combination with platelet counts may obviate a liver biopsy for fibrosis staging in some patients with chronic HCV infection.

### The significance of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio in patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^e08e8902]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis reflects the end stage of every chronic liver disease. Its natural history is characterized by an asymptomatic phase, termed "compensated" cirrhosis followed by a rapidly progressive phase marked by the development of complications of portal hypertension and/or liver dysfunction, termed "decompensated cirrhosis". Survival is much lower in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and signs of decompensation seem to be accurate predictors of death risk. Research in coming years could focus on the primary prevention and treatment of cirrhosis, including the use of noninvasive tests to screen for earlier stages of the disease.

Traditionally, classification using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) model is most widely used to determine prognosis in patients with chronic liver disease, and has been shown to be useful in the assessment of patients with cirrhosis. In addition, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) is a reliable measure of short-term mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease of diverse etiology and severity. In 2006, D'Amico et al, in a large systematic review, pointed out the need to make suggestions for future studies of prognostic indicators of cirrhosis, so that the information can be used in clinical practice.

A recent study reported the predictive value of high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with decompensated cirrhosis regarding short-term mortality, independently of relevant predictive factors such as MELD score. CRP may be considered a surrogate marker for the early identification of infection in hospitalized cirrhotic patients, or subclinical inflammation related to bacterial translocation, and has true prognostic significance in cirrhotic patients with advanced liver failure, enabling the identification of those patients with a poor short-term prognosis.

On the other hand, serum albumin, a laboratory component of CTP score and a marker of liver insufficiency, lies among the most frequent predictors, indicating that even subtle abnormalities are predictive of death in cirrhotic patients. Combining these data, a novel inflammation-based prognostic score was investigated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR) was first introduced in patients with acute medical admissions and sepsis. In 2015, Kinoshita et al tried to verify its utility in liver disease, suggesting that the ratio might constitute an independent prognostic marker in patients with HCC in particular. Even more recently, Huang et al introduced the marker in liver cirrhosis. They implied that CAR as a simple marker of inflammation could predict the long-term prognosis of patients with decompensated cirrhosis related to hepatitis B virus (HBV).

Results

The study cohort

In total 497 inpatients admitted for acute deterioration of cirrhosis were recruited into the study (Table 1). Twenty patients were excluded from the final analysis because of lack of data or not fulfilling study criteria. The study group, therefore, consisted of 477 patients. Three hundred and eighteen patients did not develop organ failure (non-organ failure group from here). (Figure 1) Thirty-day mortality in the non-organ failure group was 8% (Figure 2a) and the one-year mortality was 42%. A total of 159 patients developed organ failure (organ failure group; mean age 52 ± 0.7, 75% male, aetiology: alcohol 75%, other 11%, both 14%, Table 1). Thirty-day mortality of the 159 patients who developed organ failure was 58%. (Figure 2a, Table 1). Forty-two patients (26%) were not admitted to ICU.
