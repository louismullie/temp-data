## Question

how often if the size is 3.9cm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to surveil a 3.9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm and what the evidence-based interval should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how a 3.9 cm AAA is categorized by size and what that implies for growth and rupture risk. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ACC/AHA, SVS, ESVS, AIUM) recommend for surveillance intervals at this size. Next, I will check the natural history data on growth and rupture to ensure the interval is safe. Finally, I will consider any modifiers like sex, growth rate, or imaging quality that might justify shortening the interval, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with rationale.

> Let me first confirm the size category and baseline risk. A 3.9 cm abdominal aorta meets the definition of a small AAA (≥ 3.0 cm), and importantly it sits at the upper end of the 3.0–3.9 cm stratum, where growth tends to be faster than in smaller 3.0–3.4 cm aneurysms, though still slow overall, with median expansion around 0.11 cm/year in cohorts of 3.0–3.9 cm AAAs and rupture risk remaining very low at this size range [^114VkN5o] [^112q3vZr].

> I should confirm guideline concordance. The ACC/AHA 2022 guideline explicitly recommends surveillance ultrasound every 3 years for AAAs 3.0–3.9 cm, and this interval is echoed by the SVS 2018 guideline and the ESVS 2019 guideline, as well as the AIUM practice parameter, all of which converge on a 3-year interval for this size band, with escalation to annual imaging once 4.0 cm is reached [^113QRckf] [^111SiSQH] [^115RjLC2] [^111fpyL7] [^1177DBAR].

> Wait, let me verify the safety of a 3-year interval at 3.9 cm. The meta-analysis of individual patient data shows that for a 3.0 cm AAA, an approximately 7.4-year interval keeps the risk of exceeding 5.5 cm below 10%, and for a 3.9 cm AAA the required interval to stay below that risk threshold is correspondingly shorter but still comfortably longer than 1 year, supporting that a 3-year interval is safe at 3.9 cm. Additionally, observational cohorts of 3.0–3.9 cm AAAs report very low rupture rates and slow expansion, reinforcing the appropriateness of triennial surveillance here [^111ho55c] [^114VkN5o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are there modifiers that would push me to shorten the interval now. Rapid growth, defined as ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1.0 cm in 1 year, warrants earlier reassessment and may prompt consideration of repair; sex-specific thresholds differ, with women having lower operative thresholds and higher rupture risk at a given diameter, but at 3.9 cm this still falls within the small-aneurysm category where triennial ultrasound remains standard unless other high-risk features are present; if imaging quality is suboptimal or the aorta is not fully visualized, CT or MRI can be considered to clarify size and morphology before committing to a modified schedule [^111ftsZY] [^11127htc] [^116WM42F] [^112YhEdF].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. For a 3.9 cm AAA, I recommend surveillance abdominal ultrasound every 3 years, consistent with ACC/AHA, SVS, ESVS, and AIUM guidance. If the aneurysm reaches 4.0 cm, transition to annual surveillance, and if rapid growth or concerning features emerge, shorten the interval and reassess operative thresholds accordingly. Ensure risk factor modification and confirm that ultrasound visualization is adequate, using CT/MRI if needed for definitive sizing [^113QRckf] [^115RjLC2] [^111fpyL7] [^1177DBAR] [^112YhEdF].

---

For a 3.9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), **surveillance ultrasound every 3 years** is recommended by major guidelines (ACC/AHA, SVS, ESVS, AIUM) [^113QRckf] [^115RjLC2] [^111fpyL7] [^1177DBAR]. This interval is supported by low rupture risk (< 1% per year) [^112q3vZr] and slow median growth (~0.11 cm/year) in this size range [^114VkN5o]. If the aneurysm reaches 4.0 cm or grows rapidly (≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months), shorten the interval to annual or semiannual surveillance and refer to vascular surgery [^115RjLC2] [^111ftsZY].

---

## Recommended surveillance interval

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS), and the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) **consistently recommend** ultrasound surveillance every 3 years for AAAs measuring 3.0–3.9 cm [^113QRckf] [^115RjLC2] [^111fpyL7] [^1177DBAR].

---

## Rationale for 3-year surveillance interval

The 3-year interval is based on the **low rupture risk and slow growth** typical of 3.0–3.9 cm AAAs:

- **Rupture risk**: < 1% per year for AAAs 3.0–3.9 cm [^112q3vZr].
- **Growth rate**: Median expansion ~0.11 cm/year, with many remaining stable over years [^114VkN5o].
- **Evidence**: Individual patient meta-analysis shows that 3-year intervals safely control growth and rupture risk in small AAAs [^1173EqWa].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting 3-year surveillance

Multiple studies and meta-analyses support the safety and effectiveness of 3-year surveillance for 3.0–3.9 cm AAAs, demonstrating **low rupture risk and slow growth**, which align with the 3-year interval [^114VkN5o] [^111ho55c]. The USPSTF also notes that small AAAs have low rupture risk, further supporting less frequent surveillance in this size range [^112q3vZr].

---

## Factors influencing surveillance frequency

While 3-year intervals are standard, some factors may warrant **closer monitoring**:

- **Rapid growth**: ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1 cm in 1 year [^114pr16o] [^111ftsZY].
- **Symptoms**: New abdominal/back pain or tenderness [^114AZ6Gu].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Female sex, family history, connective tissue disorders, or high cardiovascular risk [^113QRckf].

---

## Recommended actions if rapid growth or symptoms occur

If rapid growth or symptoms develop, **shorten surveillance** and consider referral:

- **Growth ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months**: Shorten to annual or semiannual surveillance and refer to vascular surgery [^111ftsZY].
- **Symptoms**: Immediate imaging (ultrasound or CT) and urgent vascular evaluation [^114AZ6Gu].
- **Size ≥ 4.0 cm**: Transition to annual surveillance [^113QRckf] [^115RjLC2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Aneurysm size** | **Recommended surveillance interval** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| 3.0–3.9 cm | Every 3 years | Standard interval per guidelines [^113QRckf] [^115RjLC2] [^111fpyL7] [^1177DBAR] |
| ≥ 4.0 cm | Annually | Shorter interval due to increased growth and rupture risk [^113QRckf] [^115RjLC2] |
| Rapid growth (≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months) | Annual or semiannually | Urgent vascular referral [^114pr16o] [^111ftsZY] |

---

For a 3.9 cm AAA, **ultrasound surveillance every 3 years** is appropriate given the low rupture risk and slow growth; shorten the interval or refer if growth accelerates or symptoms develop.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta to greater than 3 cm diameter. To promote early detection and management of AAA (which reduces the likelihood of fatal aortic ruptures), authorities in the UK, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway, offer screening to all men aged 65. By contrast, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a one-off screening with ultrasound scan (USS) in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked and recommends selective screening based on clinical judgement in men who have never smoked. However, despite the introduction of such screening programmes, ruptured AAA continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality, exemplified by AAA's contribution to around 0.8% of deaths in men aged 65 and older and 0.4% in women aged 65 and older in England and Wales.

Rupture of AAAs occurs primarily in people not captured by current screening programmes. They include, for example women, men under 65, men invited to screening at 65 but who did not attend, and men with a normal aortic ultrasound scan at age 65 but who develop an AAA later in life. A small number of ruptures also occur in screen-detected AAAseither prior to reaching the threshold for elective intervention, whilst waiting for this intervention, or after being declared unfit for intervention. However, the prevalence of AAA is falling over time. For example, less than 1% of men screened as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS) abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programme (NAAASP) in 2021 were observed to have an AAA. By contrast, the prevalence of AAA was 4.9% in the UK Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS), carried out in 1997–9. This temporal decline in the population burden of AAA suggests that the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening may also be changing, encouraging consideration and evaluation of more targeted screening approaches. The USPSTF has, for example, highlighted that research is needed to define the benefits of screening in particular subgroups, suggesting that a stratified approach may have net benefit over current strategies. One potential subgroup is current cigarette smokers, for whom a strong association with AAAhas been reported (7-fold increase in risk in men, and 15-fold in women).

### Expansion rates and outcomes for the 3.0-CM to the 3.9-CM infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114VkN5o]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was performed for the determination of the expansion rates and outcomes and for recommendations for the surveillance of the 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Design

The study was observational with data from patients screened with ultrasound scanning for AAA at five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers for enrollment in the Aneurysm Detection and Management Trial. The eligibility requirements included: AAA from 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm in diameter and at least one repeat ultrasound scan more than 90 days after the initial screening. Patients also completed a questionnaire for demographic data and the determination of the presence of risk factors associated with AAA. The study endpoints included: 1, both mean and median expansion rates; 2, moderate expansion (> 4 mm/year); 3, no expansion; 4, all causes of death; 5, AAA rupture; 6, expansion to 4 cm or more; 7, expansion to 5.0 cm or more; and 8, operative repair.

Results

Ultrasound scan screening results identified 1445 patients with 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs. Seven hundred ninety men met the ultrasound scan criterion of having at least two ultrasound scan studies during the study period, and these 790 men were used for this study. Mean AAA size was 3.3 cm, with an average follow-up period of 3.89 ± 1.93 years. The median expansion rate was 0.11 cm/year. Expansion rates were significantly different (P < .001) between 3.0-cm and 3.4-cm cm AAA and 3.5-cm and 3.9-cm AAA. There were no reported AAA ruptures during the study period, although cause of death data were available in only 43% of the patients. Few 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs expanded to 5.0 cm or more during the study period. The patients with 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs who underwent operative repair during the study period were younger, had larger initial AAA diameters, and had more rapid expansion rates.

Conclusion

AAAs of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm expanded slowly, did not rupture, and rarely had operative repair or expanded to more than 5.0 cm in our study of male patients. Expansion rates and the incidence rate of operative repair are more common in the 3.5-cm to 3.9-cm AAA when compared with the 3.0-cm to 3.4-cm AAA.

### Fifteen-year follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of ultrasonographic screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms [^111B4Ak2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term benefits of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are uncertain. These are the final results of a randomized controlled screening trial for AAA in men, updating those reported previously. Benefit and compliance over a median 15-year interval were examined.

Methods

One group of men were invited for ultrasonographic AAA screening, and another group, who received standard care, acted as controls. A total of 6040 men aged 65–80 years were randomized to one of the two groups. Outcome was monitored in terms of AAA-related events (surgery or death).

Results

In the group invited for screening, AAA-related mortality was reduced by 11 per cent (from 1.8 to 1.6 per cent, hazard ratio 0.89) over the follow-up interval. Screening detected an AAA in 170 patients; 17 of these died from an AAA-related cause, seven of which might have been preventable. The incidence of AAA rupture after an initially normal scan increased after 10 years of follow-up, but was still low overall (0.56 per 1000 person-years).

Conclusion

Screening with a single ultrasonography scan still conferred a benefit at 15 years, although the results were not significant for this population size. Fewer than half of the AAA-related deaths in those screened positive could be prevented.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113UVxp7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

A total of 59 ruptured AAAs occurred after a normal first scan, of which 47 (80 per cent) were fatal. These 59 men had a mean age of 68.7 years at screening, the same as that for all the other men who had a normal first scan. There was a marked increase in the rate of these ruptured aneurysms after 8 years of follow-up. By years 12–13 the rate had increased to 8.3 per 10 000 person-years, but remained substantially lower than the overall rate of AAA rupture in the control group (Fig. 2). Time since initial scan, rather than age, was the determinant of this increased risk of rupture. It was possible to retrieve 32 of the baseline scans for the 59 men with such a rupture (baseline scans were not available in one centre). Among the remeasured baseline aortic diameters, about half (18 of 32) were in the range 2.5–2.9 cm (Fig. 3).

### Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in high-risk women [^112VFFnb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Distribution of aortic diameters in women aged 65–75 years invited with risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm

Frequency of maximal aortic diameter in 5169 women who underwent scans. Range of diameters was from 0.8–6.0 cm with a mean(s.d.) aortic diameter of 1.57(0.27) cm. Fifteen women had an aortic diameter greater than 2.9 cm and were diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (prevalence 0.29 per cent). Three of these 15 women had an AAA greater than 5.5 cm at screening and were referred for consideration of surgery

In those women that were screened who consented to data collection, analysis of AAA prevalence by actual smoking status recorded at the time of screening was possible (Table 2). Similar to the analyses based on primary care record smoking status, there was a higher prevalence of AAA in current smokers (0.83 (95 per cent c.i. 0.34 to 1.89) per cent) compared with ex-smokers (0.24 (95 per cent c.i. 0.11 to 0.49) per cent, P = 0.002). Combining both groups to consider 'ever smokers', the prevalence of AAA was 0.35 (95 per cent c.i. 0.2 to 0.6) per cent. The prevalence of AAA in women with coronary artery disease, independent of smoking status, was 0.52 (95 per cent c.i. 0.14 to 1.64) per cent.

Table 2
Prevalence of sub-aneurysmal aortic dilatation/abdominal aortic aneurysm by invitation group and directly recorded risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm

Sub-aneurysmal aortas were also significantly more prevalent in current smokers (2.21 (95 per cent c.i. 1.31 to 3.64) per cent) than ex-smokers (0.58 (95 per cent c.i. 0.36 to 0.92) per cent) (P = 0.001). Three sub-aneurysmal aortas were recorded in the non-smoking group with coronary artery disease (0.6 (95 per cent c.i. 0.2 to 1.7) per cent).

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk thresholds influencing surveillance intensity: The risk of rupture increases at an AAA diameter of > 5.5 cm for men and > 5.0 cm for women; accordingly, surveillance imaging should be more frequent at larger AAA diameters that approach these thresholds.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113yAgLE]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term effects of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening were investigated in extended follow-up from the UK Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) randomized trial.

Methods

A population-based sample of men aged 65–74 years were randomized individually to invitation to ultrasound screening (invited group) or to a control group not offered screening. Patients with an AAA (3.0 cm or larger) detected at screening underwent surveillance and were offered surgery after predefined criteria had been met. Cause-specific mortality data were analysed using Cox regression.

Results

Some 67 770 men were enrolled in the study. Over 13 years, there were 224 AAA-related deaths in the invited group and 381 in the control group, a 42 (95 per cent confidence interval 31 to 51) per cent reduction. There was no evidence of effect on other causes of death, but there was an overall reduction in all-cause mortality of 3 (1 to 5) per cent. The degree of benefit seen in earlier years of follow-up was slightly diminished by the occurrence of AAA ruptures in those with an aorta originally screened normal. About half of these ruptures had a baseline aortic diameter in the range 2.5–2.9 cm. It was estimated that 216 men need to be invited to screening to save one death over the next 13 years.

Conclusion

Screening resulted in a reduction in all-cause mortality, and the benefit in AAA-related mortality continued to accumulate throughout follow-up.

Small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management — Four trials evaluated early surgical intervention compared with surveillance of smaller aneurysms (4.5–5.4 cm in diameter), and two good-quality open repair trials (n = 2226) and 2 fair-quality EVAR trials (n = 1088) showed no differences in all-cause and AAA-related mortality. However, there was a reduction in rupture rate with early open surgery compared with surveillance for small AAAs, and seven pharmacotherapy RCTs (n = 1953) showed no significant effect on AAA growth compared with placebo.

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^112Q17t9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 92 unique articles were identified, of which 24 (26 per cent) were considered potentially relevant and assessed in detail (Fig. 1). Six papers based on six studies met the inclusion criteria 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28 and a seventh study 22 reported on AAA defined as diameter of 3.5 cm or more, but data for women with aortic diameter of 3.0 cm or over were obtained from the corresponding author. All these studies used ultrasonography for screening. Correspondence with the authors provided further details of several studies 21, 25, 26 and one author 25 provided an eighth unpublished study using ultrasonography for screening. These eight studies were included in the meta‐analysis. One study 29 reported on a subgroup of a larger study, and was retained for assessment of prevalence by smoking status only. One further medium‐sized study 30 reported on physician‐initiated screening (with both ultrasonography and CT) in a population, but without defining either the specific criteria for screening or AAA by a minimum aortic diameter, and hence provides only a minimum estimate of prevalence. All of the studies excluded women with known AAA from screening.

### Surveillance intervals for small abdominal aortic aneurysms: a meta-analysis [^111ho55c]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs [3.0 cm-5.4 cm in diameter]) are monitored by ultrasound surveillance. The intervals between surveillance scans should be chosen to detect an expanding aneurysm prior to rupture.

Objective

To limit risk of aneurysm rupture or excessive growth by optimizing ultrasound surveillance intervals.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Individual patient data from studies of small AAA growth and rupture were assessed. Studies were identified for inclusion through a systematic literature search through December 2010. Study authors were contacted, which yielded 18 data sets providing repeated ultrasound measurements of AAA diameter over time in 15,471 patients.

Data Extraction

AAA diameters were analyzed using a random-effects model that allowed for between-patient variability in size and growth rate. Rupture rates were analyzed by proportional hazards regression using the modeled AAA diameter as a time-varying covariate. Predictions of the risks of exceeding 5.5-cm diameter and of rupture within given time intervals were estimated and pooled across studies by random effects meta-analysis.

Results

AAA growth and rupture rates varied considerably across studies. For each 0.5-cm increase in AAA diameter, growth rates increased on average by 0.59 mm per year (95% CI, 0.51–0.66) and rupture rates increased by a factor of 1.91 (95% CI, 1.61–2.25). For example, to control the AAA growth risk in men of exceeding 5.5 cm to below 10%, on average, a 7.4-year surveillance interval (95% CI, 6.7–8.1) is sufficient for a 3.0-cm AAA, while an 8-month interval (95% CI, 7–10) is necessary for a 5.0-cm AAA. To control the risk of rupture in men to below 1%, the corresponding estimated surveillance intervals are 8.5 years (95% CI, 7.0–10.5) and 17 months (95% CI, 14–22).

Conclusion and Relevance

In contrast to the commonly adopted surveillance intervals in current AAA screening programs, surveillance intervals of several years may be clinically acceptable for the majority of patients with small AAA.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening practices: impact of the 2014 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations [^115Suk3Z]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess changes in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ultrasound screening associated with the release of revised U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on June 24, 2014.

Methods

All AAA screening ultrasound examinations performed in the Massachusetts General Hospital radiology department in the 15 months before and after the new guidelines were retrospectively reviewed to assess changes in examination volume and appropriateness, demographics, aneurysm detection rate and size at diagnosis, frequency and type of incidental findings, and radiologist recommendations. Examinations were considered "definitely appropriate" if meeting USPSTF grade "B" evidence and "possibly appropriate" if meeting grade "C" or "I" evidence, based on available guidelines. Means were compared with the t test.

Results

A total of 831 examinations were reviewed, 417 (50.2%) performed before and 414 (49.8%) after the new guidelines, with overall mean (SD) subject age 67.9 (6.8) years, 89.2% male. Appropriate examinations increased from 289 of 417 (69.3%) to 313 of 414 (75.6%) after the new guidelines (P = 0.04), mostly due to definitely appropriate examinations (253/417 [60.7%] versus 286/414 [69.1%], P = 0.01). Aneurysm detection rates increased from 23 of 417 (5.5%) to 39 of 414 (9.4%), P = 0.03. Mean (SD) aneurysm size (cm) at diagnosis decreased from 3.8 (0.7) to 3.3 (0.6), P = 0.01. Examination volume, demographics, and rates of incidentals and recommendations remained similar. Incidentals arose in 15.4% of all examinations, often iliac artery aneurysms or renal masses. Recommendations were made in 5.1%, mostly for cross-sectional imaging.

Conclusions

The revised USPSTF guidelines have been associated with increased AAA screening appropriateness and aneurysm detection in our practice, with smaller aneurysm size at diagnosis.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115xDBVk]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening implementation and yield — It was apparent that < 3% of abdominal ultrasound claims were for SAAAVE-specific AAA screening, and currently 40% of operative repair in Medicare beneficiaries are performed late in the course of the disease. In an analysis of a cohort of > 3 million individuals, it was suggested that small changes in recommended eligibility requirements could improve screening yield for traditionally lower-risk groups. Electronic health record best practice alerts reduced the percentage of unscreened patients within a 3.6 million subscriber system from 52% to 20% within 15 months, and patients who had undergone any type of cross-sectional abdominal imaging in the preceding 10 years (> 54,000) were excluded from the alert system. In the first 3 years of the U.K. National Health Service program, AAA detection rate was only 1.6%, less than 50% of that expected on the basis of the prior MASS cohort. Cost-effectiveness calculations derived from MASS (£7600/life year gained) suggest that screening will remain cost-effective even with prevalence rates as low as 1%.

### An economic evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening program in Italy [^1119rq8t]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a localized dilatation of an aortic vessel. Though predominantly asymptomatic, it is a chronic degenerative condition associated with life-threatening risk of rupture. The early diagnosis of AAA, ie, before it ruptures, is therefore important; a simple, effective diagnostic method is ultrasound examination. To assess the benefit of screening in Italy, we developed a cost-effective Markov model comparing screening vs nonscreening scenarios.

Methods

A 13-health-states Markov model was developed to compare two cohorts of 65- to 75-year-old men: the first group undergoing screening for AAA by means of ultrasound (US), the second following the current practice of incidental detection. The following health states were distinguished: no AAA, unknown small AAA (3–3.9 cm), followed-up small AAA (1 year), unknown medium-sized AAA (4–4.9 cm), followed-up medium-sized AAA (6 months), unknown large AAA (> 5 cm), elective repair, emergency repair, postelective-repair AAA, postemergency-repair AAA, rejected large AAA, and death. Transitions between health states were simulated by using 6-month cycles. Transition probabilities were derived from a literature review of relevant randomized controlled trial and from a screening program that is currently ongoing at San Martino Hospital in Genoa, Italy. The Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective was adopted and incremental cost per life-year saved was calculated with a lifetime horizon; costs and health benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3% from year 2 onward. Uncertainty surrounding the model inputs was tested by means of univariate, multivariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Results

Considering an attendance rate of 62%, the individual cost per invited subject was €60 (US $83.2); 0.011 additional quality adjusted life years (QALY) were gained per patient in the screened cohort, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €5673/QALY (US $7870/QALY). The results were sensitive to some parameter variations but consistent with the base case scenario. They suggest that on the basis of a willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY, screening for AAA is cost-effective, with a probability approaching 100%.

Conclusions

As in economic evaluations developed in other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and The Netherlands, setting up a screening program for AAA can be considered cost-effective from the Italian NHS perspective.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113KN3GZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To reduce late ruptures in future, two policies are possible. The first would be to rescreen all men with a normal aortic diameter, for example after 10 years, but this would be costly. The second would be to include those with an aortic diameter in the range 2.5–2.9 cm in the surveillance programme. It would be sufficient to recall these men only after, for example, 5 years in the first instance, because the chance of developing an AAA larger than 5.5 cm or having an AAA rupture before that time is very small. Hence the additional cost to the surveillance programme would be modest.

Being based on a population-based sample of UK men, the results from MASS should in principle correspond with the expected benefit that will derive from the NHS AAA Screening Programme (NAAASP). However, the prevalence of AAA (diameter at least 3.0 cm) is about 1.7 per cent in NAAASP, compared with 4.9 per cent in MASS, and the number of ruptured AAAs is currently falling in the UK and elsewhere. The reasons for the lower prevalence are not fully understood, but may partly be because NAAASP is targeting a younger age (men aged 65 years, rather 65–74 years as in MASS), in some NAAASP centres the ethnic mix is different, and the uptake is lower than in MASS. In addition, there has been a reduction in smoking prevalence and a general reduction in cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases over the intervening 15 years, together with an increased use of some drugs (especially statins) and of elective surgery for those aged over 75 years. Therefore, although it would still be expected that about half of the AAA-related deaths in men aged 65 years and over in the UK should eventually be prevented, the absolute benefit will not be as large as in MASS.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116vjd1Z]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a pathologic condition with progressive abdominal aortic dilatation of 3.0 cm or more that predisposes the abdominal aorta to rupture. Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic until they rupture, although some are detected when an imaging study is performed for other reasons. The risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm include hypertension, coronary artery disease, tobacco use, male sex, a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, age older than 65 years, and peripheral artery disease. Abdominal ultrasonography is the preferred modality to screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm because of its cost-effectiveness and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm can be managed medically or surgically, depending on the patient's symptoms and the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. Medical management is appropriate for asymptomatic patients and smaller aneurysms and includes tobacco cessation and therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction. Surgical management, which includes open and endovascular aneurysm repair, is indicated when the aneurysm diameter is 5.5 cm or larger in men and 5.0 cm or larger in women. Surveillance of abdominal aortic aneurysm depends on the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. The most serious complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm is rupture, which requires emergent surgical intervention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men with a history of smoking who are 65 to 75 years of age should undergo one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm screening with ultrasonography.

### Recommendations for screening intervals for small aortic aneurysms [^112S3rvx]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim was to determine the optimum rescreening interval for small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).

Methods

Data from 12 years of population screening of 65-year-old men were analysed and 1121 small AAAs (less than 4.0 cm in initial diameter) were divided into groups: group 1 (2.6–2.9 cm; n = 625), group 2 (3.0–3.4 cm; n = 330) and group 3 (3.5–3.9 cm; n = 166). Expansion rate and the cumulative proportions to expand to over 5.5 cm, or require surgery, or rupture were calculated.

Results

Expansion rate was related to initial aortic diameter: 0.09 cm per year in group 1, 0.16 cm per year in group 2 and 0.32 cm per year in group 3 (P < 0.001). Aneurysms in 2.4 per cent of patients in group 1 exceeded a diameter of 5.5 cm or required surgery within 5 years; there were no ruptures. In group 2, no aorta exceeded 5.5 cm but at 3 years 2.1 per cent had reached 5.5 cm and 2.9 per cent had required surgery. The rupture rate at 3 years was zero. In group 3, the aneurysm diameter exceeded 5.5 cm in 1.2 per cent of patients, but no patient required surgery or experienced rupture within 1 year; at 2 years 10.5 per cent of aneurysms had exceeded 5.5 cm in diameter or required surgery and 1.4 per cent had ruptured.

Conclusion

The appropriate rescreening interval can be determined by initial aortic diameter in screened 65-year-old men. AAAs of initial diameter 2.6–2.9 cm should be rescanned at 5 years, those of 3.0–3.4 cm at 3 years and those of 3.5–3.9 cm at 1 year.

AIUM abdominal aorta ultrasound — screening interpretation categories should include at least 3 categories: Positive defined as infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) greater than or equal to 3 cm in diameter or greater than or equal to 1.5 times the diameter of the more proximal infrarenal aorta; Negative defined as no infrarenal AAA; and Indeterminate when aneurysmal status is not defined because of nonvisualization or partial visualization of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and/or iliac bifurcation. The report should also state whether the suprarenal aorta was seen and, if seen, whether it is normal in caliber, and as an incidental finding an aneurysm above the celiac artery may be reported if the diameter is greater than 3.9 cm for male patients or 3.1 cm for female patients.

### Screening and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysms: who needs it and when [^11783CRq]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms potentially can save many lives by preventing aneurysm rupture. Screening programs, however, have yet to be proven as an efficient means of accomplishing this goal and improving overall life expectancy. Until more information is available, selective high-risk screening may be the only viable option. Recently, 2 large prospective studies have better defined the utility of screening programs and have provided guidelines for the safe nonoperative management of small aneurysms. Using ultrasound surveillance, these can be followed up at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on their size, with operative intervention reserved for aneurysms that enlarge rapidly, become symptomatic, or reach 5.5 cm in diameter.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^117K2Wn4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for aneurysm screening — Randomized trials of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening showed benefit: four trials including 127,891 men and 9342 women aged 65 to 79 years found ultrasound screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality, with benefit beginning within 3 years and persisting up to 15 years, and screening was associated with reduced risk for AAA rupture and emergency surgery. In the MASS trial over 13 years there was a 42% reduction in AAA-related mortality, an estimated 216 men needed to be invited to screening to save one death during 13 years, and roughly half of ruptures had an initial diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2005 recommended a one-time abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, and in 2014 updated to one-time screening for men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked (grade B) with selective screening for those who have never smoked (grade C); screening was not recommended for women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufficient for women aged 65 to 75 years with a smoking history. In the absence of a smoking history, prevalence drops to 2%; among women of similar age with a past smoking history prevalence is 0.8%, in current smokers prevalence is 5%, and in women who have never smoked AAA prevalence is < 0.60%. Under the SAAAVE amendment, Medicare began offering one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes and for men and women with a family history of AAA disease as part of the Welcome to Medicare exam, and originally the order could be placed only by the primary care physician within 6 months of activation of Medicare benefits.

### Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in high-risk women [^111vyTJ4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening protocol

Screening consisted of a single ultrasound scan of the abdominal aorta with images captured in two planes at the largest diameter identified. An AAA was defined as a maximal aortic size 3.0 cm or greater from inner edge to inner edge, as per established international guidance. The full ultrasound protocol is detailed in the Supplementary material.

Following screening, there were five possible outcomes all of which were detailed in an outcome letter sent to the patient's primary care practitioner. All aortas measuring 2.5 cm or greater were classified as 'abnormal' and those with measuring less than 2.5 cm as 'normal' An AAA was defined as 3.0 cm or greater. Women who screened normal were reassured and discharged. Those whose aorta could not be visualized were offered a second (repeat) scan at their primary care practice. If the aorta could still not be visualized they were referred to the University Hospitals of Leicester Vascular Studies Unit. Those with aortas between 2.5 cm and 2.9 cm were booked for a 5-year follow-up aortic ultrasound scan at their regional hospital vascular unit. The long-term clinical benefit of surveillance in this 'sub-aneurysmal' group is unknown but some studies have demonstrated a significant proportion will become aneurysmal within 5 years. Women diagnosed with an AAA from 3.0–5.4 cm were offered cardiovascular risk factor modification advice, provided with an appointment with the local vascular unit for clinical assessment, and entered into follow-up with the local vascular surgery service. Surveillance scans were planned in accordance with NAAASP protocols for male AAA surveillance.

Women with an AAA measuring 5.5 cm or greater were referred to their local vascular surgery unit for consideration of surgical repair.

### Impact of implicit abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in the veterans affairs health care system over 10 years [^1125dWHr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease, typically considered an abdominal aortic diameter > 3 cm, has a pooled global prevalence of 4.8% and is commonly seen in men aged ≥ 65 years. Most small AAAs (< 4 cm) are asymptomatic and pose little danger, whereas larger AAAs have a significant risk of fatal rupture. At a diameter of 5.5 cm, asymptomatic aneurysms are considered for surgical or endovascular repair to prevent rupture. Given the significant risk associated with larger AAAs, screening programs have been implemented in the United States and other countries to detect aneurysms earlier and at smaller diameters, so that surveillance and intervention can reduce the incidence of rupture.

The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended in 2005 that men aged 65 to 75 years with any history of smoking undergo a 1‐time AAA screening via ultrasonography. This recommendation was based largely on the outcomes of 4 population‐based randomized controlled trials of sonographic AAA screening performed in the United Kingdom and Australia, which at that time collectively demonstrated a reduction in AAA‐specific mortality, which favored screening (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.74). An extrapolation of the trials' findings to a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 US men aged 65 to 74 years showed that 89% of AAA‐attributable death could be prevented by screening only those with smoking history.

### Advances in imaging and surveillance of AAA: when, how, how often? [^111ztJpU]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Despite rapid technological developments for imaging the aorta, ultrasonography remains the method of choice for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. Randomised trials, conducted in the 20th century, have provided convincing evidence in favour of screening men at age 65 years, or older. However, in the 21st century the prevalence of aneurysms in 65 year old men has fallen by more than half, probably because of lower smoking prevalence and better cardiovascular risk prevention: screening or rescreening at an older age may be helpful. A recent meta-analysis has provided good evidence for surveillance intervals, with the majority of patients with screen-detected aneurysms (up to 4.5 cm diameter) being safely managed with 3-year surveillance intervals. Even for larger aneurysms, annual surveillance intervals are likely to be acceptable. This would reduce the number of surveillance visits by approximately half.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114nsvCC]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^112Lj4gg]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background:

The long-term effects of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening were investigated in extended follow-up from the UK Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) randomized trial.

Methods:

A population-based sample of men aged 65–74 years were randomized individually to invitation to ultrasound screening (invited group) or to a control group not offered screening. Patients with an AAA (3.0 cm or larger) detected at screening underwent surveillance and were offered surgery after predefined criteria had been met. Cause-specific mortality data were analysed using Cox regression.

Results:

Some 67 770 men were enrolled in the study. Over 13 years, there were 224 AAA-related deaths in the invited group and 381 in the control group, a 42 (95 per cent confidence interval 31 to 51) per cent reduction. There was no evidence of effect on other causes of death, but there was an overall reduction in all-cause mortality of 3 (1 to 5) per cent. The degree of benefit seen in earlier years of follow-up was slightly diminished by the occurrence of AAA ruptures in those with an aorta originally screened normal. About half of these ruptures had a baseline aortic diameter in the range 2.5–2.9 cm. It was estimated that 216 men need to be invited to screening to save one death over the next 13 years.

Conclusion:

Screening resulted in a reduction in all-cause mortality, and the benefit in AAA-related mortality continued to accumulate throughout follow-up. Registration number: ISRCTN37381646.

### Risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm after ectatic aorta detection from initial screening [^115FVKkA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Current abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surveillance guidelines lack any follow-up recommendations after initial abdominal aortic screening diameter of less than 3.0 cm. Some reports have demonstrated patients with late AAA formation and late ruptures after initial ultrasound screening detection of patients with an aortic diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm (ectatic aorta). The purpose of this study was to determine ectatic aorta prevalence, AAA development, rupture risk, and risk factor profile in patients with detected ectatic aortas in a AAA screening program.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all patients screened for AAA from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, within a regional health care system was conducted. Screening criteria were men 65 to 75 years of age that smoked a minimum of 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. An ectatic aorta was defined as a maximum aortic diameter from 2.5 to 2.9 cm. An AAA was defined as an aortic diameter of 3 cm or greater. Patients screened with ectatic aortas who had subsequent follow-up imaging of the aorta with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were analyzed for associated clinical and cardiovascular risk factors. All data were collected through December 3,/2018. A logistic regression of statistically significant variables from univariate and χ 2 analyses were performed to identify risks associated with the development of AAA from an initially diagnosed ectatic aorta. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess survival data. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

From a screening pool of 19,649 patients, 3205 (16.3%) with a mean age of 72.1 ± 5.3 years were identified to have an ectatic aorta from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016. The average screening ectatic aortic diameter was 2.6 ± 0.1 cm. There were 672 patients (21.0%) with a mean age of 73.0 ± 5.7 years who received subsequent imaging for other clinical indications and 193 of these patients (28.7%) with ectatic aortas developed an AAA from the last follow-up scan (4.2 ± 2.5 years). The average observation length of all patients was 6.4 ± 2.9 years. No ruptures were reported, but 27.8% of deaths were of unknown cause. One patient had aortic growth to 5.5 cm or greater (0.15%). Larger initial screening diameter (P < .01), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < .01), and active smoking (P = 0.01) were associated with AAA development.

Conclusions

Patients with diagnosed ectatic aortas from screening who are active smokers or have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are likely to develop an AAA.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116wisRt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound — screening and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is presented as an effective and rapid modality and is the recommended diagnostic tool in screening for and surveillance of AAA; the ultrasonic criterion for AAA is a diameter > 3.0 cm using primarily the outer-edge to outer-edge measurement convention in the anterior-posterior or transverse view, and the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect the presence of an aneurysm approaches 100%, although interobserver variability exists and successful imaging can be limited by obesity and superimposed bowel gas. Using B-mode imaging, color Doppler, and spectral waveform analysis, comprehensive evaluation can detect additional aortic pathologies and may prompt further imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After endovascular repair of AAA (EVAR), abdominal ultrasound can detect aneurysm sac expansion which may indicate an endoleak, defined as abnormal flow outside of the aortic graft that typically warrants confirmation by CT, and contrast-enhanced color duplex ultrasound has shown promising results in enhanced sensitivity in detection of endoleaks although its use requires ongoing study.

Importance

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have mortality estimated at 81%.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence on benefits and harms of AAA screening and small aneurysm treatment to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher supplied only), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through September 2018. Surveillance continued through July 2019.

Study Selection

Trials of AAA screening benefits and harms; trials and cohort studies of small (3.0–5.4 cm) AAA treatment benefits and harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data. The Peto method was used to pool odds ratios (ORs) for AAA-related mortality, rupture, and operations; the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to pool calculated risk ratios for all-cause mortality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

AAA and all-cause mortality; AAA rupture; treatment complications.

Results

Fifty studies (N = 323 279) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) estimated that a screening invitation to men 65 years or older was associated with a reduction in AAA-related mortality over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57–0.74]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 926]), AAA-related ruptures over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.55–0.70]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]), and emergency surgical procedures over 4 to 15 years (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48–0.68]; 5 RCTS [n = 175 085]). In contrast, no significant association with all-cause mortality benefit was seen at 12- to 15-year follow-up (relative risk, 0.99 [95% CI 0.98–1.00]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]). One-time screening was associated with significantly more procedures over 4 to 15 years in the invited group compared with the control group (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.34–1.55]; 5 RCTs [n = 175 085]). Four trials (n = 3314) of small aneurysm surgical treatment demonstrated no significant difference in AAA-related mortality or all-cause mortality compared with surveillance over 1.7 to 12 years. These 4 early surgery trials showed a substantial increase in procedures in the early surgery group. For small aneurysm treatment, registry data (3 studies [n = 14 424]) showed that women had higher surgical complications and postoperative mortality compared with men.

Conclusions and Relevance

One-time AAA screening in men 65 years or older was associated with decreased AAA-related mortality and rupture rates but was not associated with all-cause mortality benefit. Higher rates of elective surgery but no long-term differences in quality of life resulted from screening.

### The case for expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113nbY3j]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are re-evaluating their screening paradigms for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Currently, most countries that screen for AAA do so only in male ever-smokers between the ages of 65 and 75 years and in patients with a family history of AAA. However, these recommendations are based primarily on screening trials predating the endovascular era. The wider applicability of endovascular aneurysm repair and its safety profile, especially in the elderly, have changed the risk-benefit of repair and, by extension, screening. This is despite the decreasing prevalence of AAA thanks to improved medical therapies and lower smoking rates. This evidence summary critically examines the evidence behind screening and the potential for expanded screening.

The ultrasonic criterion for AAA is a diameter ≥ 3.0 cm, using primarily the outer-edge to outer-edge measurement convention in the anterior-posterior or transverse views. The sensitivity of ultrasound to detect the presence of an aneurysm approaches 100%, although interobserver variability exists, and successful imaging can be limited by obesity and superimposed bowel gas. Using B-mode imaging, color Doppler, and spectral waveform analysis, a comprehensive evaluation can detect additional aortic pathologies and may prompt further imaging with CT or MRI. After endovascular repair of AAA (EVAR), ultrasound can detect aneurysm sac expansion that may indicate an endoleak, a finding that typically warrants confirmation by CT, and contrast-enhanced color duplex ultrasound has shown promising results in enhanced sensitivity in detection of endoleaks although its use requires ongoing study.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) morphology and growth — risk features and thresholds are detailed, noting saccular AAAs are rare with limited natural history data, and in a Dutch registry 7,659 patients with AAA included 6.1% saccular AAA; among saccular aneurysms with acute presentation, 25% had diameters < 5.5 cm and 8.4% had diameters < 4.5 cm, whereas in fusiform AAA these were 8.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Pooled surveillance data show growth rates range from 1.5 mm/y to 2 mm/y for AAA of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm and from 3.3 mm/y to 5.7 mm/y for AAA of 4.0 cm to 5.9 cm at baseline; major early-treatment trials excluded aneurysms that grew ≥ 7 mm in 6 months or > 10 mm in 12 months. Accordingly, aneurysms with size increases of ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1 cm in 1 year are considered rapidly growing and may warrant consideration of repair, and elective repair for patients presenting with saccular AAA is recommended by the Society for Vascular Surgery although specific size guidance is lacking.

Different national screening programmes use a variety of surveillance intervals for patients identified with small abdominal aortic aneurysm. An individual patient meta-analysis of > 15000 persons with small aneurysm has provided a strong scientific basis for safe surveillance frequency. In many screening programmes the number of surveillance visits for men could be reduced by up to half. The higher rate of aneurysm rupture in women leads to different recommendation for women.

### International variations in AAA screening [^117MSoun]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programmes reduce AAA-related mortality and are cost-effective. This study aims to assess the state and variability of AAA screening programmes worldwide.

Methods

Data were obtained from an international expert group convened at the 34th Charing Cross Symposium as well as government websites and published reports on screening programmes.

Results

Six countries are in the process of implementing national AAA screening programmes, with Italy still performing screening trials. There is wide variability in inclusion criteria between countries with the majority screening only men in their 65th year, however 3 programmes include women, 2 programmes only include patients with high cardiovascular risk, and 2 trials are also screening for hypertension and lower limb atherosclerosis. Surveillance intervals vary between screening programmes, with the most common regimen being to vary the surveillance interval depending upon aneurysm size, however the optimum surveillance interval in terms of decreasing mortality and cost effectiveness remains uncertain.

Discussion

International dissemination of current AAA screening programme outcomes is required to inform developing programmes about optimum screening intervals, benefits of surveillance of the subaneurysmal aorta, and screening for other cardiovascular disease.

Thoracic aortic dimensions and aneurysm management in asymptomatic screening populations — Normal aortic size increases with age, with at 70 years of age the normal ascending aorta 3.5 cm and the descending aorta 2.7 cm; the upper limit of normal is 4.2 and 3.2 cm, respectively. Aortic enlargement should not be called an aneurysm until the size is > 50% larger than normal, and there is no evidence of benefit or recommendation for screening individuals for thoracic aortic aneurysm unless there is a clear family history or known genetic defect associated with aortic disease. Measurement should be of the outside of the aorta in a plane strictly perpendicular to the blood flow. Management of BP and lipids is recommended for individuals with an aneurysm to decrease the rate of further expansion, but the data come primarily from patients with familial risk, and there is little evidence to suggest that reporting mild/moderate aortic dilation affects health outcomes. Monitoring recommendations include annually or biannually based on size, type, and location in the context of annual lung cancer screening, and consideration of surgical repair is recommended for patients with an ascending or descending aortic size of ≥ 5.5 cm (unless there is a familial syndrome).

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^1128AYfW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Aortic aneurysms are of concern because of their potential risk of death. The likelihood of a mortal event occurring has been linked historically to aneurysm size. Elegant natural history studies from the 70s and 80s demonstrated a significant increased incidence of mortality at size greater than 6 cm for the ascending aorta and 7 cm for the descending aorta. Consensus guidelines developed in 2009 suggest that ascending aortic aneurysms greater than or equal to 5.5 cm warrant surgical repair. Surgery is not recommended for aneurysms less than 5 cm diameter. However even with a smaller diameter there is still a risk of complication. Thus even for MTAA patients with an initial aneurysm size of 4–4.9 cm, there is 5–10% yearly risk of rupture, dissection or death. To-date, the sub-group of these MTAA patients at highest risk for a future adverse event has not been well established - driving the contemporaneous practice for risk factor modification and close surveillance. With increasing awareness of the danger of radiation exposure however, there remains a real need to identify an optimal surveillance interval differentially for follow-up of "at-risk" versus "not-at risk" MTAA patient sub-groups.

Given their inherent, asymptomatic nature, the true MTAA incidence cannot be known. However in an interesting study, Itani et al. reported the detection of asymptomatic aortic aneurysms in a mass lung cancer screening program using mobile helical computed tomography units. They found 11 of 6,971 (0.16%) of screened subjects to have aortic aneurysms. Similarly in our study, all of our MTAA patients presented with asymptomatic aneurysms and were diagnosed as an incidental finding.

Of the 110 records reviewed, only 14 (13%) met the endpoint criteria of substantive growth or requiring surgery. There were no aortic aneurysm related deaths. Throughout our study period, the assessment and follow-up practices at our institution were the same for all study patients and followed current convention which among many practitioners has been to repeat imaging every 6 months up to 1-year; then once aneurysm stability has been established to perform annual imaging thereafter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening — supportive evidence and definitions — Smoking history is defined as lifetime use of ≥ 100 cigarettes, with risk attributable to smoking varying by exposure and lower risk in those with lower versus higher pack-year history. Based on a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials inclusive of nearly 125 000 mostly male patients, screening of men ≥ 65 years of age reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs; OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years. In a population-based study in the United Kingdom, two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Having a first-degree relative with AAA is a well-known and well-established risk factor for development of AAA, and small cohort studies of ultrasound screening in relatives have identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30–30–30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines 16, and registered in May 2015 in the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42015020444). The review protocol was reviewed externally (F. Lederle, Veterans Administration Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). The aim was systematically to review published and unpublished data of the current (since 2000) prevalence of AAA in women, detected by either ultrasonography or CT (aortic diameter 3.0 cm or greater).

MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases were searched, using a combination of controlled vocabulary (medical subject heading (MeSH) or Emtree ®) terms and free‐text terms in ProQuest Dialog™, and limiting the search to data published since 2000. The search was restricted to major European languages, and used the following terms: abdominal aortic aneurysm, women/gender/sex/women's health/sex difference, genetic predisposition, prevalence/incidence/occurrence/frequency, screening, population/population‐based. The final search date was 13 January 2016. Current Controlled Trials (/) and the National Research Register (UK) were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished trials. This search was complemented by scanning reference lists of relevant articles, and manual searches of Endovascular Today and vascular surgery conference proceedings.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition that contributes to a crude mortality rate of ~150,000–200,000 deaths per year worldwide. More than two-thirds of patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm present without a prior diagnosis of AAA. An AAA is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger. Early studies suggested that aortic diameters < 3.0 cm did not necessitate regular follow-up. However, recent data reveal that 13.8% of patients with aortic diameters between 2.6 and 2.9 cm experienced growth to over 5.5 cm within 10 years. Early detection and treatment can considerably decrease AAA-related mortality, especially in the elderly. Recent guidelines recommend ultrasonography for general AAA screening in at-risk populations, specifically men over 65, with a smoking history, with other peripheral aneurysms, a first-degree relative with an AAA, as well as those who have undergone organ transplantation.

Ultrasonography, the most common imaging screening modality for AAA, has proven to be effective and less costly compared to standard computed tomography (CT) scans. Nonetheless, ultrasound is generally performed by highly trained sonographers, and the interpretation is carried out by board-certified physicians. This challenge is further exacerbated by the restricted accessibility of sophisticated ultrasound equipment. Both of these factors contribute to ultrasound examinations having the longest waiting times compared to other imaging modalities, thereby reducing the cost-effectiveness of general screening for AAA –.

In the past decade, Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has seen extensive use across various hospital settings, including outpatient clinics, emergency departments, wards, and operating rooms. It has played a crucial role in medically underserved areas, from rural regions in developed countries to low-income nations, and is even used in manned space flights. Portable ultrasound machines have facilitated the acquisition of high-quality images suitable for diagnostic purposes. This has the potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities, especially in remote areas where experienced sonographers may not be readily available.

### Screening men for abdominal aortic aneurysm: 10 year mortality and cost effectiveness results from the randomised multicentre aneurysm screening study [^113XhtMS]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The benefit of inviting men aged 65–74 to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm continues at about the same rate 7–10 years after screening, as observed in previous years. The reduction in number of deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm in MASS is estimated as 42% at four years,47% at seven years, and now 48% at 10 years. This is surprising as it might be expected that ruptures of the aneurysm in those originally screened as normal and incidental detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the control group would erode the benefit over time. Being based on a population based sample of UK men, these figures correspond to the expected benefit that will derive from the UK national screening programme. About 1900 deaths each year, half of the deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm that occur in men aged 65 or more in the UK, should be prevented in due course by the screening programme. Such a programme will never prevent all ruptures but to optimise performance our results show that emphasis should be placed on achieving a high initial attendance rate and good adherence to clinical follow-up, preventing delays in undertaking surgery, and maintaining a low operative mortality after elective surgery. More evidence may be needed to choose the best intervals between recall scans, for different sizes of aneurysm less than 5.5 cm; any strategy needs to balance the effectiveness in preventing ruptures while under surveillance against the costs.

A crucial problem is the extent to which those screened as normal will go on to develop an aneurysm that ruptures and whether rescreening of participants after a normal scan is justified at any stage. We observed a noticeable increase in ruptures after eight years of follow-up; although most were fatal, the absolute numbers remained small. For example, 15 fatal ruptures occurred during years 8–10; over the same period there was an overall reduction of 40 deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm in the group invited to screening compared with the control group. Hence the deaths due to rupture after a normal scan seem not to have impacted yet on the diverging curves from deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm shown in figure 1. Recommending rescreening those with an initial normal scan would only become justified in subsequent years if future analyses show that there is a further noticeable increase in ruptures in this group that is not sufficiently offset by the reduction in number of deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm for those with an aneurysm detected (or rendered unimportant by the overall toll of mortality from all causes).

AAA rupture risk and size thresholds — Historically, rupture risk was 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms < 5 cm, 3% to 15% for 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for ≥ 8 cm. Trials did not find a survival benefit for repair of aortic aneurysms measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm, and based on these data a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA. The mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture was 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men. Indexing aneurysm size to body surface area using aneurysm size index (ASI equals aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m²]) has in women been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

Methods

The design of MASS is described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, a population based sample of 67 770 men aged 65–74 was recruited during 1997–9 from four centres in the UK and randomised to receive an invitation to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (invited group) or not (control group). Among the 33 883 men invited to screening, principally in a primary care setting, 27 204 (80%) attended and 1334 aneurysms (diameter ≥ 3.0 cm) were detected. Within this group of detected aneurysms, surveillance involved rescanning: annually for those with diameters of 3.0–4.4 cm and every three months for those of 4.5–5.4 cm. Patients were referred to a hospital outpatient clinic for possible elective surgery when the aneurysm reached 5.5 cm, the aneurysm had expanded by 1.0 cm or more in one year, or symptoms attributable to the aneurysm were reported.

We collected additional data from local hospital records on follow-up ultrasound scanning done within medical imaging departments and surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The UK Office for National Statistics notified us of deaths up to 31 March 2008, after matching on the unique National Health Service (NHS) number for each participant. Follow-up ranged from 8.9 to 11.2 years (mean 10.1 years). The primary outcome of interest — deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm — is defined as all deaths within 30 days of any surgery (elective or emergency) for abdominal aortic aneurysm plus all deaths with codes 441.3–441.6 (international classification of diseases, ninth revision; see table 1).

We used unadjusted Cox regression to compare deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm (censoring other causes of death) and all cause mortality between the two randomised groups. Life years gained was derived as the area between the Kaplan-Meier curves of deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysm for the control and invited groups, adjusting for the effect of deaths from other causes. We also obtained an unbiased randomisation based estimate of the benefit of attending initial screening. This estimate was calculated by subtracting from the controls a group that is equivalent to the non-attending group among those invited, thus leaving a control group comparable to those attending in the invited group.

### Potential benefits and harms of offering ultrasound surveillance to men aged 65 years and older with a subaneurysmal (2.5–2.9 CM) infrarenal aorta [^113ePF9p]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this review was to perform a rapid evidence summary to determine the prevalence of subaneurysmal aortic aneurysms, growth rates, and risk factors that modulate growth in average-risk men aged 65 years and older. Secondary objectives were to evaluate benefits and harms of lifelong ultrasound (US) surveillance and treatment outcomes for any large aneurysms that develop in the screened population.

Methods

We searched multiple databases (eg, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, and the Cochrane Library) on February 16, 2016. Using a liberal accelerated method, two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and subsequently screened full-text studies. General study characteristics (eg, country, study design, number of participants) and data (eg, number of men with subaneurysmal aortas, quality of life [QoL], mortality) were extracted. One reviewer performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments, and a second reviewer verified 100% of studies. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Results

The search identified 37 relevant studies ranging in size from 3 to 52,690 participants. Prevalence of subaneurysmal aortas ranged from 1.14% to 8.53%, and 55% to 88% of these men progressed to a 3.0-cm aneurysm by 5 years of follow-up. Risk factors for growth included the infrarenal aortic diameter at age 65 years, having a subaneurysmal aorta at age 65 years, and current smoking. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey was the most commonly used tool to measure QoL, and QoL was typically lower in people with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Anxiety and depression levels did not differ significantly between comparison groups in any studies. Four studies reported on the number of men whose aorta was subaneurysmal on initial US who went on to surgery. Overall, 10% (57/547) of men initially measuring in the subaneurysmal range progressed to abdominal aortic aneurysm > 5.4 cm and received elective surgery; 1% (6/547) received emergency surgery because of a ruptured aorta. Among those who did, mortality rates were much lower for elective (9.5%) vs emergency surgery (50%). Risk of bias was usually low for studies measuring prevalence and moderate and high for studies measuring psychological harms of screening and harms and benefits of surgery. Overall, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework as guidance, the quality of the evidence was generally very low.

Conclusions

Because of the limited evidence and the low quality of the existing evidence, it is not possible to determine confidently whether men with abdominal aortas measuring 2.5 to 2.9 cm should be observed in a lifelong US surveillance program.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113bVFup]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger. The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries. The current prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture. Although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of 1-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0–5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA outweigh the benefits.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked rather than routinely screening all men in this group. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA.

### Decreasing tumor size explains some improvement in survival from localized breast cancer… [^1179jYpQ]. ASCO (2004). Low credibility.

Methods: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to obtain tumor size and 5-year relative survival for women with localized invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1975–99. By definition, these cancers were node-negative and confined to the breast. Tumor size was categorized as < 5mm, 5–9mm, 1–1. 9cm, 2–2. 9cm, 3–3. 9cm, 4–4. 9cm, and 5+cm. We calculated age-adjusted, tumor size-adjusted relative survival for cohorts diagnosed in 5-year time intervals. We also calculated relative survival standardized to the tumor size distribution of the 1975–79 cohort. For each of the later cohorts, we calculated change in observed and standardized relative survival compared with the 1975–79 cohort, and we estimated the percent of improvement in relative survival attributable to decreasing tumor size. Results: Among localized invasive breast cancers, the proportion of tumors 2cm or larger declined from 59% in 1975–79 to 30% in 1995–99.

More than half of the increase in relative survival from 1975–79 to 1995–99 was eliminated after standardization of the contemporary cohort to the tumor size distribution of the 1975–79 cohort. Conclusions: Gains in survival from localized breast cancer realized over the last three decades may be explained in part by a shift in the tumor size distribution. When making temporal comparisons, it is important to adjust for changes in tumor size in order to fully accommodate the effects of stage migration. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of diagnostic and screening ultrasound examinations of the abdominal aorta in adults [^1177DBAR]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

AIUM practice parameter — diagnostic evaluation and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) specifies indications and size-based follow-up: evaluate patients with a "Palpable or pulsatile abdominal mass or abdominal bruit" or "Unexplained lower back pain, flank pain, or abdominal pain", and perform "Follow-up of a previously demonstrated AAA" and "Follow-up of patients after AAA repair, particularly after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair". Rescanning intervals are size-dependent: "For AAA size of 3.0–3.9 cm, follow-up ultrasound every 3 years", "For AAA size of 4.0–4.9 cm, follow-up annually", and "For AAA size of 5.0–5.4 cm, follow-up every 6 months".

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm: populations at risk and how to screen [^113CbJUQ]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) account for significant morbidity and mortality in adults. Because they are most often asymptomatic until rupture occurs, screening that allows early detection and management has been advocated. In this review, the authors examine evidence to support screening at-risk populations for AAAs and evaluate various screening methods.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114uCfeJ]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results

Using the same screening protocol as for 65-year-old men in NAAASP, screening detected AAA in 0.31% of the population resulting in 23% more AAAs detected in total from age 65 to 95 years, leading to an additional 452 elective operations per 1 million women invited to screening, 21% more than predicted to occur under no screening (table 1). Most of these additional operations occurred between the ages of 67 and 77 years (figure 1A, appendix). By contrast, there were 97 (4%) of 2336 fewer emergency operations (appendix), and 396 (4%) of 9235 fewer AAA ruptures, predominantly occurring after age 70 years (figure 1A). Approximately half of the AAA ruptures in the group invited to screening occurred in women with aortic diameter of less than 3 cm at initial screening (appendix). There were 85 (7%) of 1269 fewer AAA-related deaths in the first 10 years after screening and 257 (3%) of 8388 fewer deaths overall from age 65 to 95 years. For every four women who avoided an AAA-death because of successful screening, one woman died due to additional elective repair (342 avoiding AAA-related deaths because of screening vs 85 deaths caused by elective surgery after screening; table 1). There was an early negative effect of screening on deaths due to AAA because of the high operative mortality for elective repair, particularly since less than half of the repairs in women aged younger than 75 years used EVAR (figure 1B). Overall, 3900 women would need to be invited to screening to prevent one AAA-related death.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk by size and evidence base — Historically, the risk of rupture was reported to be 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms ≤ 5 cm in maximum diameter, 3% to 15% for aneurysms 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for aneurysms ≥ 8 cm; multiple trials that are now > 2 decades old evaluating early repair for AAAs measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm found no survival benefit but an increased risk of subsequent reintervention; accordingly, a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA, women had higher rates of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related deaths than men with a mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture of 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men, and in women ASI (aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m2]) has been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^116Rok1g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracic aortic aneurysms account for almost 50,000 deaths annually in the United States. Death is due to rupture or dissection and is strongly linked to the size of the aneurysm. Recent Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Thoracic Aortic Disease represent the efforts of multiple professional societies (ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM) to develop evidence based recommendations for the management of all aspects of thoracic aortic disease in order to improve patient outcomes. The guidelines were prepared after rigorous and careful review of the evidence by multiple experts in the field representing cardiologists, radiologists, vascular surgeons and cardiothoracic/aortic surgeons.

Current guidelines recommend surgical intervention for ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms when they are 5 cm in size for patients with genetic predisposition to rupture/dissection such as the connective tissue disorder Marfan's syndrome, or 5.5 cm in size for non-Marfan patients. Similarly the recommendations are to surgically intervene when a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm is 5.5 cm for a Marfan or 6 cm for a non-Marfan patient. These guidelines are based on data showing increased mortality for these patients. Thus, the risk of rupture-related complication exceeds the risk of surgery-related complications for this high risk patient sub-group - rendering an operation as the safer strategy. For moderate-size (defined as ≤ 4.9 cm) thoracic aortic aneurysms (MTAA), however, the committee concluded that the evidence is severely lacking to establish recommendations. These MTAA patients are generally not referred for surgery- but the appropriate frequency and mode of surveillance are unclear.

The computed tomography (CT) scan is currently the most commonly used form of aortic imaging, but carries with it the risk of ionizing radiation. Only weak (level C) evidence suggests the use of magnetic resonance imaging for these patients instead of computed tomographic imaging in an effort to reduce such harmful exposure. Echocardiography is used sporadically, as clinicians have concerns about the reliability and accuracy of echo-based TAA aneurysm sizes.

In our Thoracic Surgical Clinic we see many patients with MTAA. Current management is guided by best clinical judgment. There is no data to guide surveillance of these patients. Given the scarcity of reported data on MTAA patients, the aim of our pilot study was to evaluate the natural history of a cohort of our MTAA patients, to review the surveillance strategy used, and to report on our patients' long-term outcomes.

### Incidence, follow-up, and outcomes of incidental abdominal aortic aneurysms [^113WjS4a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Incidental abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are identified during imaging for other reasons. Incidental AAAs are important findings because they require monitoring and surgical treatment, when indicated, to prevent rupture. The prevalence of incidental AAAs and their management has not been extensively studied.

Methods

We electronically screened a 25% simple random sample of abdominal computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies conducted between 1996 and 2008 at one academic medical center. Screen-positive reports were manually reviewed to determine if they showed an incidental AAA. We reviewed the medical records of all in-patients to determine whether the incidental AAA was documented, a treatment plan was identified, and whether it was communicated to the patient's family physician through the discharge summary. We used evidence-based recommended schedules to determine the adequacy of AAA monitoring for each person.

Results

In 79,121 abdominal images, we identified 812 incidental AAAs (1.0% of all studies) or 364 incidental AAAs annually (95% confidence interval [CI] 349–379). Patients were elderly (mean age, 74 years), and AAAs were a mean diameter of 4.0 cm. For 174 inpatients, AAAs were noted in only 51 patients (29%) and only 25 (15%) were communicated to the family physician. Of 329 patients who were observed beyond their first recommended follow-up scan, only 51 (16%) were monitored appropriately throughout their entire follow-up; the median proportion of follow-up time with recommended monitoring was 56% (interquartile range, 32%-82%). Elective AAA repair was done in 98 patients (13%), the probability of which was significantly increased when AAA monitoring frequency was compliant with that recommended in practice guidelines. Six patients (0.8%) were admitted with aortic rupture, the probability of which was independent of AAA monitoring.

Conclusion

Incidental AAAs are common and appear to be poorly monitored. Our data suggested that improved monitoring of incidental AAAs was independently associated with elective AAA repair. Population-based analyses are required to determine the influence that monitoring has on incidental AAA rupture and patient mortality.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^111xnvhD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The mortality benefit was somewhat less in years 10–13 after screening than before year 10. This was at least partly due to ruptured AAA in men originally screened normal, with a steady increase in these ruptures from year 8 onwards; the large majority of these were fatal. Although the rate was small in absolute terms (less than 1 per 1000 per year even at years 12–13), it was enough to diminish the benefit of AAA screening during this late follow-up. In addition, there was a cumulative effect of incidental AAA detection in the control group, as apparent through the elective operations taking place, and a greater operative mortality and contraindication/refusal rate for elective surgery as age increased. All these aspects may have contributed to the reduced mortality benefit later in follow-up.

The only apparent determinants of the increased risk of AAA rupture in those screened normal were the aortic diameter at baseline and the time since screening. About half of these ruptures were in men with an initial aortic diameter of 2.5–2.9 cm. Based on other population screening programmes in the UK, the proportion of men aged 65 years with an internal aortic diameter in the range 2.5–2.9 cm is less than 3 per cent: it reduced from about 3 per cent to 1 per cent over 1991–2009 in Gloucestershire, was 2.6 per cent in Chichester and Worthing in 2004–2007, and 1.6 per cent in the English national screening programme in 2009–2011. In programmes measuring external aortic diameters, the proportion would be expected to be somewhat higher. Although the men in MASS had a mean age of 69 years at screeningrather than 65 years, the increase in AAA prevalence with age is modest. Thus there appears to be a large difference in the proportions of men with 2.5–2.9-cm aortic diameters: among the men in MASS with an initially normal scan whose aneurysm later ruptured it was about half, whereas the background prevalence is less than 3 per cent.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm surveillance — Surveillance imaging should use ultrasound examinations unless other imaging modalities are specifically indicated. Some authors have suggested that there is no need to observe patients with an initial aortic diameter < 3 cm, given their low risk for rupture; however, in a 12-year analysis of 1121 men 65 years of age or older, 13.8% of aortas with an initial diameter of 2.6 to 2.9 cm exceeded 5.5 cm at 10 years. Among patients with an aortic diameter between 3.0 and 3.4 cm, 21% had reached 5.5 cm at 3 years; and of those with a diameter between 3.5 and 3.9 cm, 10.5% exceeded 5.5 cm or required surgery within 2 years, with rupture occurring in 1.4%. Two randomized controlled trials and a follow-up study demonstrated that a policy of surveillance until aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm is safe and associated with a rupture rate of 1% per year.

"Select patients < 65 years of age may be at increased risk of AAA rupture", but "in patients < 65 years, data are lacking on the mortality benefit of AAA screening". "Some patients may develop AAA after the age of 75 years even if they had an initial negative screen between the ages of 65 and 75 years", yet "data from cohort studies suggest long-term AAA-related mortality is low among patients with an initial negative screening ultrasound who had a subsequent AAA detected on repeat screening after the age of 75 years". For borderline enlargement with risk factors, selected low-surgical-risk patients "may be considered for repeat screening on an individualized basis".

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^112cZJNU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

The design of the MASS trial has been described in detail elsewhere. In brief, a population-based sample of men aged 65–74 years were recruited in 1997–1999 from four centres in the UK, and randomized to receive an invitation to screening (invited group) or not (control group). Randomization was conducted centrally using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers, stratified by centre and general practice. The anterior–posterior and transverse internal diameters of the abdominal aorta were measured ultrasonographically, and the higher value was recorded as the aortic diameter. Men with an aortic diameter of 3 cm or greater were diagnosed with an AAA. Aortas with a smaller diameter were classified as normal (recorded simply as less than 3.0 cm) and these men were not recalled for further imaging. Within the group of detected AAAs, surveillance involved repeat imaging annually for aneurysms with an aortic diameter of 3.0–4.4 cm and every 3 months for those with a diameter of 4.5–5.4 cm. Referral to a hospital vascular department for consideration for elective surgery was made when the aortic diameter reached 5.5 cm, aortic expansion was 1.0 cm or more in 1 year, or symptoms attributable to the aneurysm were reported.

Additional data were collected from local hospital records relating to ultrasound scans and AAA surgery. Deaths up to 31 March 2011 were notified by the UK Office for National Statistics following matching on the unique National Health Service (NHS) number for each individual. Follow-up ranged from 11.9 to 14.2 (mean 13.1) years. The primary outcome of interest, AAA-related mortality, was defined as all deaths within 30 days of any AAA operation (elective or emergency) plus all deaths with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 codes 441.3–441.6. Where possible, the baseline scans were retrieved for men screened normal who subsequently had an AAA rupture, and the aortic diameter was remeasured (to give an exact result in millimetres) by a single experienced radiologist.

Extended follow-up in MASS was approved by Southampton and South West Hampshire Ethics Committee (A), March 2007.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112q3vZr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

AAA treatment thresholds and rupture risk: Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality, and larger size is associated with increased rupture risk. The annual risk for rupture is "nearly 0%" for AAAs 3.0 to 3.9 cm, "1%" for 4.0 to 4.9 cm, and "11%" for 5.0 to 5.9 cm. Surgical repair is standard for "an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period)". Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the most common elective approach, and "in the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of ruptured AAA repairs are performed using EVAR". The majority of screen-detected AAAs (≥ 90%) are between 3.0 and 5.5 cm in diameter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) timing of intervention — symptomatic evaluation and rupture risk by size: For a known AAA with acute symptoms but without hemodynamic instability, "A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred". In selected stable symptomatic cases, "it may be appropriate to delay intervention for several hours" and "the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU". For asymptomatic large aneurysms, "A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA, > 5.4 cm in diameter". Size-based rupture risk estimates include "rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but > 33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in diameter", while more contemporary pooled data report "a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms > 7 cm in diameter".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115ShLQ7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant vascular disease found in 4% to 8% of the screening population. If ruptured, its mortality rate is between 75% and 90%, and it accounts for up to 5% of sudden deaths in the United States. Therefore, screening of AAA while asymptomatic has been a crucial portion of preventive health care worldwide. Ultrasound of the abdominal aorta is the primary imaging modality for screening of AAA recommended for asymptomatic adults regardless of their family history or smoking history. Alternatively, duplex ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate for screening. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.
