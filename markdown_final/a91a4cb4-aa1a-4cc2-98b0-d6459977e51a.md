## Question

Is it normal for small submental lymph nodes to be palpable?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether small submental lymph nodes can be normal when palpable. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "normal" versus "abnormal" lymph nodes on clinical exam. Then, I should verify whether submental nodes are among the nodal groups considered inherently abnormal when palpable. Next, I will review direct evidence about the normal presence and morphology of submental nodes on imaging in healthy individuals. After that, I need to consider size, consistency, and risk-factor features that make palpated nodes concerning. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable answer with caveats and indications for further work-up, including when to use ultrasound or fine-needle aspiration.

> Let me first confirm the general framework for evaluating lymphadenopathy, because I need to ensure I'm not overcalling normal findings as disease. Most lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited, and the first branch point is whether it is localized or generalized and whether there are red-flag features such as systemic symptoms or high-risk locations like supraclavicular nodes; importantly, supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are considered abnormal when palpable, and epitrochlear nodes > 5 mm are worrisome, while submental nodes are not listed among nodes that are inherently abnormal when palpable, which suggests that palpable submental nodes can be within normal limits depending on context [^113wGzNw] [^116EJVzK].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is direct evidence that submental nodes are part of normal anatomy that may be detected even in health. A pediatric MRI study of healthy children systematically identified head and neck nodal groups, documenting submental nodes and showing their typical oval morphology with a mean short-to-long axis ratio around 0.6; the authors concluded that rounder and larger nodes can be normal depending on location and age, which supports the idea that submental nodes are commonly present and can be visualized in otherwise healthy individuals, albeit this dataset is pediatric and location-specific [^117Azxzs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — palpability still needs to be interpreted with clinical features. I need to check size and character thresholds: nodes larger than 2 cm, hard, matted, or fixed raise concern for malignancy or granulomatous disease; persistence beyond about four weeks or the presence of B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), older age, and supraclavicular location heighten risk and prompt evaluation, whereas small, soft, mobile, non-tender nodes without systemic features in low-risk patients are usually benign; the submental basin drains the chin, lower lip, floor of mouth, and anterior tongue, so minor dental, gingival, or oropharyngeal irritation can yield transient reactive enlargement that may be palpable on careful exam [^116EJVzK] [^116EJVzK].

> Let me synthesize this carefully: yes, small submental lymph nodes can be normal when palpable, particularly if they are subcentimeter, soft, mobile, non-tender, and not accompanied by systemic symptoms or other red-flag features; they are anatomically expected structures and are not in the category of nodal groups that are "always abnormal" if palpable, and most localized cervical lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in primary care settings, especially when clinical risk is low [^113wGzNw].

> But wait, what if the node persists or has atypical features — what should I do then? I should confirm the duration and associated symptoms; if nodes persist beyond 4 weeks, are > 2 cm, hard, fixed, or associated with systemic features or high-risk history, then imaging and labs are appropriate, and for a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, fine-needle aspiration is preferred over open biopsy as the first-line sampling method according to AAO-HNSF guidelines; this aligns with primary care guidance to escalate evaluation based on persistence, size, and risk features rather than palpability alone [^116EJVzK] [^1155GpeK].

> Next, I should review a nuance about age and setting to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. In children, reactive cervical nodes are very common and point-of-care ultrasound can help differentiate reactive from suppurative or malignant features at the bedside; in adults, similar sonographic principles apply when clinical concern is higher, but absent red flags, short-interval observation is often reasonable for small, benign-appearing submental nodes before imaging or biopsy is pursued [^114LuJXs].

---

Yes, small palpable submental lymph nodes are **normal in healthy individuals** [^113wGzNw], especially in children and adolescents [^117Azxzs], and are usually **benign and self-limited** [^116EJVzK]. Nodes **≤ 1 cm**, soft, mobile, and non-tender are typically reactive to minor oral or dental inflammation [^114nSZjd]. Persistent nodes **> 2 cm** [^116EJVzK], hard, fixed, or associated with systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^113wGzNw] warrant further evaluation with ultrasound and possible biopsy [^1155GpeK].

---

## Normal size and characteristics

Normal submental lymph nodes are typically **≤ 1 cm in adults** [^113wGzNw]; in children, **up to 1.5 cm** can be normal due to a more active immune system [^117Azxzs]. They are soft to slightly firm, mobile, and non-tender, with a smooth surface and no matting or fixation to surrounding tissues [^116EJVzK]. They are oval or bean-shaped, and on ultrasound they demonstrate a **preserved fatty hilum** [^111HVVax].

---

## Common benign causes of palpable submental lymph nodes

Palpable submental nodes are **most often reactive to benign conditions**, such as:

- **Dental infections**: Caries, periodontal disease, or periapical abscesses [^114nSZjd].

- **Oral infections**: Gingivitis, stomatitis, or aphthous ulcers [^1125c4TM].

- **Upper respiratory infections**: Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or sinusitis [^113wGzNw].

- **Viral infections**: Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis), cytomegalovirus, or herpes simplex virus [^114nSZjd].

- **Minor trauma**: Oral mucosal injury or recent dental procedures.

---

## Clinical features suggesting malignancy or serious pathology

While most palpable submental nodes are benign, some features **raise concern for malignancy** or serious disease:

- **Size**: Nodes > 2 cm or rapidly enlarging [^116EJVzK].

- **Consistency**: Hard, firm, or rubbery nodes [^113wGzNw].

- **Fixation**: Nodes fixed to surrounding tissues or matted.

- **Duration**: Persistent nodes > 4 weeks without regression [^116EJVzK].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue [^113wGzNw].

- **Associated findings**: Oral lesions, persistent ulcers, or masses in the head and neck region.

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

When evaluating palpable submental lymph nodes, **a systematic approach is essential**:

- **History**: Recent infections, dental issues, trauma, systemic symptoms, travel, animal exposures, medications, and family history [^116EJVzK].

- **Physical examination**: Node size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, and associated oral or neck lesions [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, and specific serologies (e.g. EBV, CMV, HIV) if indicated [^116EJVzK].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality; CT or MRI if deeper structures are involved or malignancy is suspected [^111HVVax].

- **Biopsy**: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy if malignancy is suspected or nodes persist beyond 4 weeks without regression [^116EJVzK] [^1155GpeK].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**. Benign reactive nodes are managed with observation and reassurance, while underlying infections or inflammation are treated. Infectious lymphadenitis is treated with appropriate antibiotics or antiviral therapy [^113wGzNw]. Malignancy is managed with surgical excision, radiation, or chemotherapy based on tumor type and stage. Persistent unexplained nodes warrant biopsy and further evaluation [^1155GpeK].

---

## Prognosis and clinical significance

Benign reactive nodes have an **excellent prognosis**; most resolve spontaneously or with treatment of the underlying cause [^113wGzNw]. The prognosis of **malignant nodes** depends on tumor type, stage, and treatment response; early detection and treatment improve outcomes.

---

Small palpable submental lymph nodes are **normal in healthy individuals** [^113wGzNw], especially in children and adolescents [^117Azxzs], and are usually **benign and self-limited** [^116EJVzK]. Persistent nodes > 2 cm, hard, fixed, or associated with systemic symptoms require further evaluation [^1155GpeK].

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorders, medications, and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized.

- **Localized lymphadenopathy**: Patients should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns.

- **Generalized lymphadenopathy**: Defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease.

Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and the presence of systemic symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Lymphadenopathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. The history should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. The physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy.

Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by an underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (e.g. complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (e.g. bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancies.

### Normal head and neck lymph nodes in the paediatric population [^117Azxzs]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To determine the normal range of head and neck lymph nodes in a paediatric population, a retrospective review was undertaken of 200 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in patients aged between 5 months and 16 years. Exclusion criteria included possible causes for lymphadenopathy, and studies were previously reported as normal. Eight regions were assessed for the presence of nodes, with the short and long axis of the largest node measured and the ratio calculated.

The most commonly identifiable nodes were the deep cervical, submandibular, and posterior cervical, present in 100%, 99.5%, and 92.5% of studies, respectively. In the long axis, the three largest nodes were the submandibular, deep, and posterior cervical with mean values of 19.7, 18.1, and 15.4 mm, respectively. For the S/L ratio, the nodes with the most oval shape were the pre-auricular, occipital, and submental with ratios of 0.64, 0.63, and 0.6, respectively. A positive correlation between the occipital and deep cervical lymph node groups with age was found to be stronger than the rest of the localizations.

This study characterizes the normal distribution, size, and shape of head and neck lymph nodes in a healthy paediatric population, demonstrating that rounder and larger lymph nodes may be a normal finding, depending on their location and patient age.

### Imaging evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy: Approach, classification, and differential diagnosis [^112gpK21]. Seminars in Roentgenology (2025). High credibility.

Hilar lymphadenopathy can result from various causes, including head and neck cancer, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, lymph node metastasis, and coal worker pneumoconiosis. Conditions such as systemic sclerosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, bacterial pneumonia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, silicosis, berylliosis, sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Castleman disease are also possible causes. Furthermore, it can be associated with primary pulmonary hypertension, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, cytomegalovirus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, amyloidosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and bronchiectasis. Additionally, certain medications, such as phenytoin, can lead to hilar lymphadenopathy.

### Is routine inclusion of level IV necessary in neck dissection for clinically N0 supraglottic carcinoma [^111JBsBd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Elective level II to IV dissection has become a common practice for patients with N0 neck and supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. Several authors have questioned the necessity of dissecting level IV and the possible risk of associated morbidities such as chyle leak and phrenic nerve injury.

- **Study design and setting**: We reviewed 58 patients who underwent elective functional and lateral neck dissection for supraglottic carcinoma. Node levels were delineated just after the removal of the specimens. The patients were followed for at least 3 years postoperatively or until the time of death; recurrence rates and levels were evaluated.

- **Results**: Occult lymph node metastases were determined in 14 cases. Level II was the most involved zone, with 7 patients affected. Isolated level IV lymph node metastasis was not established.

- **Conclusion**: We think that routine level IV dissection is not necessary in the management of clinically and radiologically N0 necks in patients with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.

### Clinical practice guideline: Evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^1155GpeK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for neck mass, specifically with respect to fine-needle aspiration, the AAO-HNSF 2017 guidelines recommend performing fine-needle aspiration rather than an open biopsy as the first-line method to obtain a tissue sample in patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy.

### Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva metastasizing to the submandibular gland: a case report and review of the literature [^116jLfLw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Conjunctival malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor with the potential for metastasis and death. It is rare in the Black population because of the protective effect of melanin. Metastases are usually to regional lymph nodes, most commonly the preauricular nodes, deep cervical lymph nodes, and the salivary gland.

- **Case presentation**: We described the case of a 41-year-old Black African woman who presented to our ophthalmology clinic with a painless, right medial pigmented bulbar conjunctival swelling and right preauricular and submandibular swelling. Two years ago, she had similar swelling at the same location in the right eye. She subsequently underwent surgical excision under general anesthesia. Histology of both tissues showed proliferating malignant melanocytes with heavy pigmentation disposed of in solid nests, tongues, and sheets obscuring cellular details in these areas. Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells to stain for HMB45 and Melan A. This led us to conclude that the tumor was a malignant melanoma. The patient died a year after making the diagnosis.

- **Conclusion**: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare ocular malignancy that should be considered in cases of pigmented lesions of the eye, especially in people with dark pigmentation. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia or a nevus are known as preexisting melanocytic lesions from which conjunctival melanomas might develop. Metastases are often to preauricular and cervical lymph nodes as well as to the salivary gland. This demonstrates the significance of early presentation and thorough history-taking.

### Afferent and efferent lymph-collecting vessels of the submandibular nodes with special reference to the lymphatic route passing through the mylohyoid muscle [^111Ynbvr]. Head & Neck (2003). Low credibility.

Although metastasis of cancer in the oral region to the submandibular node is well described, there has been no anatomic representation of lymph vessels penetrating the oral floor and draining into the node.

- **Materials and methods**: Ninety specimens were obtained from formalin-fixed, donated cadavers. Histologic observations using serial sections followed the macroscopic observations.

- **Results**: In 19 of 90 specimens, we found afferent collecting lymph vessels exiting from the mylohyoid surface and draining into the preglandular submandibular node. In 3 of the 19 specimens, collecting vessels passing through the narrow muscle gap with or without arteries, veins, and nerves were identified histologically. The postglandular submandibular node was not evident in the drainage route.

- **Conclusions**: Although there is a low incidence, due to the direct lymphatic route or pathway between the oral region and preglandular submandibular node, the pathologically positive supraomohyoid node sometimes appears even in elective neck dissection. However, we speculate that sentinel node investigation would reveal the much more critical role of the jugulodigastric node not only as the actual sentinel node but also as the common terminal node along the various drainage routes from the oral region.

### Predictive factors of level IIb lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma [^111UjH4Q]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The extent of neck dissection (ND) appropriate for necks yielding clinical evidence of metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is controversial. The need for level IIb lymph node (LN) dissection is particularly uncertain in view of its association with postoperative shoulder dysfunction. In this study, we examined the frequency, pattern, and predictive factors of level IIb LN metastases in PTC patients with clinically positive lateral neck nodes.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the medical records of 76 PTC patients who underwent therapeutic lateral ND for the treatment of clinically positive lateral neck nodes between March 2005 and July 2008. ND specimens were separately obtained for analyzing LN involvement with respect to neck level.

- **Results**: Metastatic disease at levels II, III, IV, and V was observed in 40 (52.6%), 55 (72.4%), 52 (68.4%), and 12 (15.8%) of the patients, respectively. The metastasis rate in level IIb was 11.8% (9 of 76). By univariate analysis, the rate of level IIb LN metastasis was significantly higher in patients with positive level IIa LNs and positive LNs in all lateral neck levels (levels IIa + III + IV) (P < .05). Multivariate analysis showed that positive LN involvement in all lateral neck levels (IIa + III + IV) was an independent predictive factor of level IIb LN metastasis (P = 0.044, odds ratio = 9.692).

- **Conclusions**: Level IIb LN dissection may be omitted in the treatment of positive neck nodes in PTC patients if multilevel involvement, including level IIa involvement, is absent.

### Management of salivary gland malignancy: ASCO guideline [^1179xyWJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, specifically in the management of regional lymph nodes, the ASCO 2021 guidelines recommend performing ipsilateral selective neck dissection. The levels depend on the primary site, with levels 2–4 recommended for parotid malignancies, as part of surgical elective neck management in patients with salivary gland cancer.

### Oropharyngeal lesions and cervical lymphadenopathy: Syphilis is a differential diagnosis that is still relevant [^115egfnx]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Syphilis (lues), a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum, has been increasing in incidence during the last few years. Therefore, while clinically it is often not suspected, syphilis is increasingly becoming a differential diagnosis in routine pathology.

- **Aim**: To report our experience with five cases of cervical lymphadenopathy and/or oropharyngeal lesions, clinically thought to be lymphomas, lymph node metastases, or carcinoma, in which we made the mostly clinically unsuspected diagnosis of syphilis.

- **Methods**: Fine needle aspiration of enlarged cervical lymph nodes was evaluated by cytology and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis), and biopsies were examined by using histology. In addition, all materials were also subjected to immunostaining, silver staining, and molecular (PCR) testing.

- **Results**: Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed follicular hyperplasia in two cases and granulomatous lymphadenitis in one case. In three patients, concomitant biopsy of co-existing oropharyngeal lesions revealed histological findings compatible with syphilis. T. pallidum was detected in all cytological and histological samples by immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry and PCR. Subsequently, a diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed clinically and by serology.

- **Conclusions**: Syphilitic lymphadenitis is still a relevant differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy, and it is clinically often not suspected. Co-existing oropharyngeal lesions should alert the physician to this differential diagnosis; and lesions with compatible morphology.

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: a pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^114HNf1F]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Mandibular lymphoma involves malignant tumors that develop from the lymphatic system cells and can affect any organ containing lymphoid tissue. While Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) most often involve lymph nodes in the head and neck, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) can equally affect extra-nodal sites such as the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, muscles and soft tissues of the orbit, thyroid gland, maxilla, and mandible. Mandibular NHL is rare and frequently mistaken for dental infection, which can lead to a prolonged delay in diagnosis. All age groups may be affected; however, adults tend to be more commonly affected than children, and there is no gender predilection.

The clinical features of mandibular NHL are nonspecific and include pain, jaw swelling, ulceration, tooth mobility, and cervical lymphadenopathy. On panoramic views, mandibular NHLs appear as ill-defined radiolucent lesions. Despite their large size, these tumors can be easily missed on conventional X-rays. Radiological findings can be quite subtle, such as tooth displacement in the occlusal direction, loss of the lamina dura, and widening of the periodontal ligament space. Rarely, mandibular NHL can present with minor osteolysis or unilateral enlargement of the mandibular canal and mental foramen. Enlargement of the mandibular canal and mental foramen is rare and has been reported in neurogenic tumors affecting the inferior alveolar nerve, such as schwannoma and neurofibroma, in perineural spread of disease (mainly from SCC, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and lymphoma) and as an anatomic variant.

### Submandibular triangle masses [^115YDLfD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The study aims to analyze the demographic data from a large case series of patients operated on for submandibular triangle masses over a span of more than 10 years, and it presents a review of the literature. The charts of patients who underwent surgical intervention for submandibular triangle masses between January 2000 and November 2010 were reviewed. The review included medical history, age, sex, duration of symptoms, clinical presentation, preoperative investigations, and histopathologic diagnosis.

The study included 66 subjects: 12 patients (18.2%) with submandibular sialolithiasis, 18 patients (27.2%) with sialadenitis, 10 patients (15.1%) with lymphadenitis, and 26 patients (39.3%) with tumors. Of the tumors, 23% were malignant and 77% were benign. Benign tumors of the submandibular gland comprised 22.7%, and malignant tumors of the submandibular gland comprised 3% of all submandibular masses. The most common benign tumor was pleomorphic adenoma. The most frequent histopathologic diagnoses of submandibular masses originated from the submandibular gland, comprising 71.2% of all submandibular mass pathologies. The main symptom was a painless mass. Ultrasonography was the most common preoperative diagnostic procedure. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed in 26 patients, though a clear diagnosis could not be provided in 3 (12%) patients.

In conclusion, infectious conditions and benign tumors are more frequent than malignant tumors in the submandibular region. The histopathologic diagnoses mainly consisted of submandibular sialadenitis, sialolithiasis, and pleomorphic adenomas.

### Sonographic assessment of the submandibular space [^115YNvdb]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

There is a wide variety of pathological processes that may present with swelling in the submandibular space. Although the submandibular gland is the most important structure in this region, there are a number of extraglandular causes of swelling that frequently mimic submandibular gland enlargement. In this review, the use of high-resolution ultrasound in the assessment of the submandibular gland and adjacent structures is discussed and illustrated.

### Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, larynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx: EHNS-ESMO-ESTRO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^112eJpYo]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for oropharyngeal cancer, specifically in relation to indications for neck dissection and post-treatment surgery, the EHNS/ESMO/ESTRO 2020 guidelines recommend not performing neck dissection in patients with negative 18F-FDG-PET and normal-sized lymph nodes at 12 weeks post-chemoradiotherapy.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117MhJWg]. Head & Neck (2022). Low credibility.

Data extraction involved gathering characteristics related to the study design, population, diagnostic workup, reference standard, procedures, and diagnostic outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), as well as the anatomical distribution of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). All data were extracted in duplicate by two independent reviewers using standardized forms. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. To evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of SLNB, 2×2 contingency tables were created from the extracted absolute numbers of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Contingency tables were prepared separately for tumor sites: oropharynx and larynx/hypopharynx. In cases where appropriate data could not be obtained from published articles, authors were contacted. True positives were defined as the presence of metastases in SLN(s). True negatives were identified by the absence of metastases in SLN(s) and elective neck dissection (END) specimen, or the absence of regional recurrence during follow-up under a "wait and see policy". False negatives were delineated by the absence of metastases in SLN(s) but their presence in END specimens or regional recurrence during follow-up under a "wait and see policy". It is important to note that false positive results are not possible, as histopathological examination conclusively proves metastases; thus, the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) are always 1.

The risk of bias and applicability of these studies were evaluated using the Quality Assessment tool of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2). Signaling questions for bias and criteria for assessment of applicability were carefully tailored to the studies under evaluation.

### Salivary gland cancer: ESMO-European reference network on rare adult solid cancers (EURACAN) clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116JjkpS]. ESMO Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, more specifically with respect to the management of regional lymph nodes, the ESMO/EURACAN 2022 guidelines recommend including the gland in a selective neck dissection involving levels I-III in patients with submandibular gland cancer unless the tumor is intraglandular and a low-grade histology is proven, which only requires resection of the gland and level Ib lymph nodes.

### The evolving landscape of salivary gland tumors [^111RgUQW]. CA (2023). Low credibility.

The most common presenting symptom of salivary malignancy is a painless parotid or neck mass. Sublingual gland malignancies may present at a late disease stage as a mass in the floor of the mouth. The presence of pain, a rapidly growing mass, facial weakness, or lingual weakness/paresthesias (in the case of sublingual tumors) are ominous signs that usually indicate high-grade malignancy.

It is important to note that the differential diagnoses of a swelling/mass lesion is broad. For this review, we focused on features of key primary salivary gland neoplasms; however, salivary gland involvement by nonneoplastic tumor-like conditions (e.g. nodular oncocytic hyperplasia, necrotizing sialometaplasia, salivary duct cyst, among others), mesenchymal neoplasms, hematolymphoid processes, direct extension of cutaneous malignancies, and metastases can also be observed and should be considered in the differential, depending on the clinical history and presentation, radiologic findings, and laboratory data.

### Management of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^112ouHty]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for oropharyngeal cancer, particularly concerning indications for neck dissection and post-treatment surgery, the ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend against performing neck dissection in patients whose anatomic cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) conducted at ≥ 12 weeks post-radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy shows resolution of previously abnormal lymph nodes.

### When to address level I lymph nodes in neck dissections [^115vfLU7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of level I neck lymph node groups in head and neck carcinoma and compare the effect of primary tumor sites, such as oral cavity (OC), oropharynx (OP), hypopharynx (HP), and larynx (Lx), on level I lymph node metastasis.

The study was designed as a case series with chart review and was set in a comprehensive cancer center. A total of 243 patients with OC and laryngopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent neck dissections in the last three years were included in the study. The primary tumor site was OC, followed by OP, Lx, HP, and carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP).

Results showed that level I was involved in 29 of 243 (11.9%) patients. The other levels were also positive in all but five (17.2%) level I-involved patients. The primary tumor site with level I lymph node metastasis was OC (19.1%), followed by CUP (11.1%), OP (9.8%), Lx (4.4%), and HP (0%). The Lx primary site involved level I only if there were multiple other adverse prognostic features, such as N3 neck, extracapsular spread, pathologic involvement of all resected lymph nodes, involvement of all levels I-V, and invasion of the submandibular gland.

The conclusion was that although the submandibular content is resected as part of radical and modified radical neck dissections, level I-sparing selective neck dissections could be a safe and effective surgical neck management strategy in appropriately selected patients with OP, Lx, and HP carcinoma.

### Kybella [^1174M9Kz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage**: Kybella injection is administered into subcutaneous fat tissue in the submental area, using an area-adjusted dose of 2 mg/cm². A single treatment consists of up to a maximum of 50 injections, with each injection being 0.2 mL (up to a total of 10 mL), and spaced 1 cm apart. Up to 6 single treatments may be administered at intervals no less than 1 month apart. See General Considerations for Administration and Injection Technique before injection.

- **General considerations for administration**: Kybella should be administered by a healthcare professional. Screen patients for other potential causes of submental convexity or fullness, such as thyromegaly and cervical lymphadenopathy. Consider using Kybella cautiously in patients with excessive skin laxity, prominent platysmal bands, or other conditions where reducing submental fat may lead to an aesthetically undesirable outcome. Caution is also advised for patients with previous surgical or aesthetic treatments of the submental area, as changes in anatomy or scar tissue may affect the ability to administer Kybella safely or achieve the desired result.

Kybella is clear, colorless, and free of particulate matter. Visually inspect Kybella vials for particulate matter or discoloration, and discard the vial if the solution is discolored or contains particulate matter. Discard any remaining solution in the vial after use.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, specifically in the management of regional lymph nodes, the ESMO/EURACAN 2022 guidelines recommend the following options for patients with parotid gland cancer at high risk for cN0 pN+ (T3-T4, high grade, > 54 years of age):

- **Selective level II dissection**: Followed by watchful waiting if pN0, or extend neck dissection to levels I-V if pN+.

- **Elective neck dissection to levels II-IV**: Followed by watchful waiting if pN0, or irradiation to levels I-V if pN+.

- **Elective neck irradiation to levels I-V**.

### Optical molecular imaging can differentiate metastatic from benign lymph nodes in head and neck cancer [^113V4Kor]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Although a combination of direct visualization and palpation is considered the gold standard by pathologists for detecting and harvesting lymph nodes (LNs) from neck dissection specimens, this technique is time-consuming, can miss smaller LNs, and is subject to high interobserver variability, limiting standardization within institutions and across medical centers. To improve nodal yield and increase detection of small LNs, fat clearance can be performed. However, this technique requires a chemical agent to dissolve the fat tissue around the LNs and is therefore time-consuming, expensive, and potentially hazardous.

Local or intravenous/intra-arterial injections of methylene blue and indocyanine green have been used to improve LN identification at pathology. However, due to poor tumor specificity, this approach has never become routinely implemented; sensitivities and specificities achieved with this method vary between 52–94% and 76–78% respectively.

Most importantly, none of these techniques discriminates between metastatic LNs and benign LNs. Our proposed method, involving anti-EGFR-based fluorescence molecular imaging, allows for localization and segregation of LNs that are at the highest risk of harboring metastasis. This provides an opportunity to ease the process of LN assessment at pathology. In the same way that sentinel LN mapping selects LNs most likely to harbor metastatic disease, pathological molecular imaging selects high-risk LNs, thereby reducing the need for complete processing of all the LNs. However, in contrast to sentinel LN mapping, which requires a re-operation when metastatic LNs are found, mo

### Intermediate grade salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma: Is neck dissection indicated [^1179qea5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Abstract

NCCN guidelines recommend a neck dissection addressing at least levels II‐IV for high‐grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and close observation of the lymphatic basins for low‐grade MEC. However, no guidelines exist for intermediate‐grade MEC with clinically and radiologically uninvolved cervical lymph nodes.

- **Objective**: To assess the necessity of neck dissection in intermediate-grade MEC with clinically N0 neck.

- **Study design**: Retrospective analysis.

- **Setting**: Patients with intermediate‐grade MEC with a clinically N0 neck were selected from our tertiary academic institution from 2015 to 2023.

- **Methods**: Evaluation for histologic lymphatic metastases was performed when surgeons elected to perform neck dissection. For patients who did not receive a neck dissection, a review of medical records was conducted to document the results of clinical observation, particularly focusing on regional lymphatic recurrence during long‐term follow‐up.

- **Results**: Thirty‐five patients with N0 intermediate grade MEC were included, composed of 26 patients who underwent primary tumor resection and neck dissection and 9 patients who received resection of the primary tumor without neck dissection. One out of 26 patients receiving neck dissection was found to have lymphatic metastasis. Watchful waiting of 9 patients demonstrated no recurrence at a mean follow-up of 40 months. Consequently, 1 out of 35 patients (2.9% [95% confidence interval: 2.7%‐3.1%]) had documented metastatic disease in the lymphatics.

- **Conclusions**: For patients presenting with intermediate‐grade MEC, there was a low chance (2.9%) of positive histologic or clinical lymphatic metastases in the neck. Given this low risk, we believe the potential benefit of neck dissection is limited.

### Relevance of intraparotid metastases in head and neck skin squamous cell carcinoma [^112DPqmM]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Parotid lymph node metastases are common in head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCCHN). Here we evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of intraglandular lymph node (IGLN) metastases in cSCCHN.

- **Study design**: Retrospective study in a tertiary referral university cancer institute.

- **Methods**: We included patients with cSCCHN who underwent parotidectomy and neck dissection (ND), with or without synchronous resection of the skin primary, between January 1999 and January 2018. The characteristics of cSCCHN with or without IGLN involvement were compared.

- **Results**: Altogether, 68 patients were included. Of the 29 (42.6%) patients classified as cN0, eight were upstaged to pN+ and had concomitant IGLN involvement. Of 21 patients with pN0 disease, IGLN metastases were absent in only three cases, resulting in a specificity and sensitivity of parotid metastases to diagnose occult nodal neck metastases of 14.29% and 100%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 14.29% and 100%, respectively. Univariate analyses displayed a significantly higher rate of moderately and poorly differentiated primaries in patients with IGLN metastases (P = 0.015). Only advanced T-stages were significantly associated with neck recurrences.

- **Conclusion**: IGLN status in advanced cSCCHN is potentially predictive for occult nodal neck metastases. Our results suggest that ND in patients with histopathologically negative IGLNs and clinically negative neck lymph nodes may not be necessary given the high negative predictive value of IGLN status.

### Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva metastasizing to the submandibular gland: a case report and review of the literature [^116HCCWT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Conjunctival malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor with the potential for metastasis and death. It is rare in the Black population because of the protective effect of melanin. Metastases are usually to regional lymph nodes, most commonly the preauricular nodes, deep cervical lymph nodes, and the salivary gland.

- **Case presentation**: We described the case of a 41-year-old Black African woman who presented to our ophthalmology clinic with a painless, right medial pigmented bulbar conjunctival swelling and right preauricular and submandibular swelling. Two years ago, she had similar swelling at the same location in the right eye. She subsequently underwent surgical excision under general anesthesia. Histology of both tissues showed proliferating malignant melanocytes with heavy pigmentation disposed of in solid nests, tongues, and sheets, obscuring cellular details in these areas. Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells to stain for HMB45 and Melan A. This led us to conclude that the tumor was a malignant melanoma. The patient died a year after making the diagnosis.

- **Conclusion**: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare ocular malignancy that should be considered in cases of pigmented lesions of the eye, especially in people with dark pigmentation. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia or a nevus are known as preexisting melanocytic lesions from which conjunctival melanomas might develop. Metastases are often to preauricular and cervical lymph nodes as well as to the salivary gland. This demonstrates the significance of early presentation and thorough history taking.

### Salivary gland cancer: ESMO-European Reference Network on Rare Adult Solid Cancers (EURACAN) clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^114LG2z1]. ESMO Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, specifically for the management of regional lymph nodes, ESMO/EURACAN 2022 guidelines recommend performing elective neck dissection when the neck is entered as an approach to the primary site or for reconstruction in patients with minor SGC. It is advised to avoid elective neck dissection in patients with tumors originating from the laryngeal, sinonasal, external acoustic meatus, and lacrimal gland regions.

- **Elective neck dissection alternatives**: Offer elective neck dissection or elective neck irradiation in patients with oral cavity/oropharynx, T3-T4, and high-grade tumors. The decision on neck dissection levels should depend on the tumor location, comparable to the treatment approach for cN0 head and neck SCC.

### Sarcoidosis of the submandibular gland: A systematic review [^1173tG1K]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Submandibular gland sarcoidosis is rare, and little is known about its clinical presentation aside from the typical neck swelling. The aim of the study was to extract clinical knowledge on submandibular sarcoidosis from the literature.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was performed using a search in Medline with the keywords "sarcoidosis", "submandibular", "submaxillary".

- **Results**: Forty-six articles fitting the search criteria were found, whereas 31 had to be excluded because they did not report submandibular gland sarcoidosis. Twenty cases of submandibular gland sarcoidosis were considered suitable for analysis. Almost all reported cases concerned female patients. In some cases, submandibular gland swelling is the first and only manifestation of the disease.

- **Conclusion**: Sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all progressive and painless swellings of the submandibular gland, especially in women. Rarely, it may be the first manifestation of the disease.

### Bony cystic lesion with associated submandibular lymphadenopathy on a background of breast carcinoma: an unexpected case of cervicofacial actinomycosis [^1115JtCe]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is an uncommon, chronic suppurative granulomatous infection that should be considered a differential diagnosis. A 56-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast carcinoma was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery 2-week wait clinic for a tender sublingual mass and firm erythematous swelling in the right submandibular and submental region. This condition was slowly progressive and had not responded to oral co-amoxiclav. An orthopantomogram revealed a well-defined radiolucency and smaller radiolucent lesions throughout the edentulous right body of the mandible. A contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a right submandibular abscess communicating with cavitating lesions. Differential diagnoses included osteomyelitis, bony metastases, multiple myeloma, or other cystic lesions. The patient underwent incision and drainage of the abscess, alongside biopsies, and was administered intravenous co-amoxiclav. Microbiology cultures confirmed the presence of Actinomyces israelii, leading to a diagnosis of cervicofacial actinomycosis with mandibular osteomyelitis. The patient was successfully treated with prolonged antibiotics.

### Pleomorphic adenoma of the submandibular gland with skull metastasis: A case report [^116Rue4B]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma is a rare entity with a propensity for distant metastasis despite being histologically benign. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with a long-standing right upper neck swelling and a recent-onset swelling over the left side of the scalp. Clinical workup did not reveal any other tumor deposits in the body. Complete excision of the right submandibular gland and the scalp swelling was performed. The case was diagnosed as metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma. The exact cause of the malignant manifestation of this histologically benign entity is unclear. The time of appearance of a metastatic deposit is highly variable and is usually preceded by a local recurrence. Further research on the malignant behavior of this entity is warranted.

### Assessment of second tier lymph nodes in melanoma and implications for extent of elective neck dissection in metastatic cutaneous malignancy of the parotid [^11514hyY]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

The parotid is the most common site of cutaneous metastases in the head and neck. The role and extent of neck dissection in patients with parotid metastatic cutaneous malignancy remain controversial.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission CT (SPECT) of patients with melanoma who had a sentinel node in the parotid to determine the second tier cervical lymph nodes.

- **Results**: Levels II and III cervical nodes make up 82% of second tier lymph nodes for the parotid, and levels IV and V account for 12% and 4%, respectively. Second tier lymph nodes isolated to levels I, IV, or V, bypassing levels II and III, occurred in only 2% of cases.

- **Conclusion**: The risk of harboring occult metastasis in levels I, IV, and V when levels II and III are negative is low. Neck dissection involving levels II and III is likely to be an effective staging procedure in patients with isolated parotid metastases.

### Ectopic submandibular thyroid tissue with a coexisting normally located multinodular goitre: Case report and review of the literature [^111NmK1A]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

The simultaneous finding of submandibular ectopic thyroid tissue and a functional orthotopic thyroid gland is an extremely rare event. The present report describes the case of a woman presenting with a left submandibular mass, distant from a palpable multinodular goitre. Ultrasonography showed an ovoidal solid mass adjacent to the lower margin of the left submandibular gland. Cytological specimens revealed colloid material and thyroid follicular cells with no malignant features. A preoperative CT scan demonstrated a very thin connection between the thyroid and the submandibular mass.

The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and excision of the submandibular mass. The histopathological diagnosis of the thyroid tissue was multinodular goitre, and the submandibular mass was ectopic thyroid tissue showing a hyperplastic pattern. The main differential diagnosis of the submandibular mass was a metastasis from a well-differentiated cancer. This case illustrates that an ectopic thyroid off the midline may not necessarily be a metastasis from thyroid cancer.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration for parotid and submandibular gland lesions [^111scBy4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the parotid and submandibular glands, a retrospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary referral academic center. The study was a case series with a chart review, spanning FNAs performed from 2001 to 2014. A total of 1,283 FNAs were performed for 1,076 patients, of which 343 cases had surgical follow-up (parotid gland, n = 272; submandibular gland, n = 71). Cases included had a preoperative FNA followed by surgical excision, with a correlation of preoperative FNA results to the final surgical pathology, and diagnostic accuracy measures were computed.

Malignancy was identified in 29.0% of parotid tumors and 42.3% of submandibular tumors based on final pathology. FNA was nondiagnostic due to insufficient cellularity for evaluation in 22 of 343 cases (6.4%) and indeterminate in 39 of 343 cases (11.4%). The diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing benign from malignant pathology was determined as follows: sensitivity was 75.0% for the parotid and 91.3% for the submandibular glands; specificity was 95.1% and 94.1%, respectively; positive predictive value was 84.9% for parotid and 91.3% for submandibular; and negative predictive value was 91.2% and 94.4%, respectively.

FNA demonstrates high accuracy in identifying malignancy in parotid and submandibular gland lesions when performed at a high-volume center. Preoperative FNA results provide otolaryngologists with valuable diagnostic information that may influence the surgical management of salivary gland tumors.

### Kimura disease: Diagnostic challenges and clinical management [^116tSuxg]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

Kimura disease is a rare inflammatory lesion of the head and neck region, typically observed in young Asian men. Patients commonly present with a painless mass affecting a major salivary gland accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Studies have suggested an immunologic mechanism as a potential cause of this disease entity. Histopathologically, the tumor comprises vascular proliferation and a lymphoid infiltrate rich in eosinophils. Although the immunohistochemical findings are usually nonspecific, they can aid in ruling out malignancies. The role of fine needle aspiration (FNA) and biopsy procedures appears limited in making the histologic diagnosis of Kimura disease. The natural history of the disease seems indolent, without any reported malignant transformation, though recurrence can be frequent.

This paper describes two cases of Kimura disease with varying presentations, diagnostic challenges, and clinical management strategies. The difficulties encountered in establishing an accurate preoperative diagnosis and the complexity of surgical management underscore the need for an index of suspicion for this clinical entity. Moreover, appropriate surgical management is required to minimize operative morbidity and reduce the risk of recurrence.

### Recent trends in the management of minor salivary gland carcinoma [^112pV6X3]. Head & Neck (2014). Low credibility.

The management of minor salivary gland cancer is critically reviewed. These malignancies often present as submucosal swellings and have been reported at all anatomic subsites of the head and neck. Modern imaging is essential for evaluating the location and anatomic extent of the disease. An incisional or punch biopsy is necessary to determine the histologic type and grade.

Recent advances in molecular biology have yielded diagnostic and potential therapeutic targets that may change our treatment approaches in the future. Complete resection is the treatment of choice. Unfortunately, given the proximity of essential structures, the need to balance functional and cosmetic outcomes with oncologic consequences can interfere with achieving an adequate "clear margin". The neck should be treated when there is evidence of regional metastasis or when subclinical metastatic risk exceeds 15%.

Surgery alone cures most low-stage, low-grade tumors; however, all other stages and grades require postoperative radiotherapy. Systemic treatment for locoregional and distant failure remains disappointing.

### The "small, dark tonsil" in patients presenting with metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy from an unknown primary [^113jRZ1q]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

When squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) involves the palatine tonsils, they are generally enlarged and exhibit intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, enhancing after gadolinium administration. We have identified two patients with SCC of the tonsil where the affected tonsil shows low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images and is smaller than the contralateral normal tonsil. The "small, dark tonsil" emerges as an alternative imaging presentation of SCC and a new sign to consider when evaluating patients with metastatic lymphadenopathy from an unknown primary tumor.

### Level V lymph node dissection in oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma patients with clinically node-positive neck: Is it absolutely necessary [^116u6jN7]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative shoulder dysfunction has been significantly associated with any dissection of level V secondary to traction or with ischemic injury to the spinal accessory nerve. The aim of this study was to determine whether the dissection of level V lymph node pads is absolutely necessary in therapeutic neck dissection as a treatment for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OOSCC) patients with clinically N+ neck.

The study was designed as a retrospective chart review. We performed a retrospective analysis of 93 OOSCC patients who underwent surgical treatment of the primary lesion along with a simultaneous comprehensive neck dissection from January 1992 to December 2003. Of these, only one patient had a clinically positive neck node at level V. During the neck dissection, the contents of the level V lymph nodes were dissected, labeled, and processed separately from the remainder of the major neck dissection specimen. We studied the incidence of pathologic metastasis to level V lymph nodes. In addition, we also evaluated several potential risk factors for metastatic disease in the level V lymph nodes, such as sex, age, T stage, N stage, histologic grade, and presence of other positive lymph nodes.

A total of 96 comprehensive neck dissections were performed in this series. The prevalence of metastases in the level V lymph nodes was 5% (5 of 93) in ipsilateral and 0% (0 of 3) in contralateral necks. One case with clinically positive node at level V had a pathologic positive node in levels II, III, IV, and V. The occult metastasis rate of ipsilateral level V remains a point of interest in determining treatment necessity.

### Incidental suspicious regional lymph nodes on breast sonography: Is sampling necessary [^115vUzP5]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Suspicious regional lymph nodes may be incidentally identified on breast ultrasound examinations in patients who present for sonographic evaluation without a known or suspected breast malignancy. There is a paucity of data on whether biopsy should be performed. This study aims to characterize incidental sonographically detected suspicious regional lymph nodes and determine whether tissue sampling or follow-up imaging is required.

A total of 40,773 consecutive breast ultrasounds were reviewed. Overall, 7 women with nonpalpable, incidental, suspicious axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes in an otherwise unremarkable breast and without a history of malignancy or systemic disease were identified. In all, 5 women with 6 nodes underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, while 2 women with 3 nodes were recommended follow-up ultrasound.

Follow-up imaging, cytology, and all-cause clinical data were reviewed to evaluate outcomes. All 6 biopsied lymph nodes (mean = 1.5 cm) were benign on cytology. Follow-up imaging was available for 3 nodes (mean = 2.6 years), with all-cause follow-up for all nodes being 2.2 years. In the follow-up group, 3 lymph nodes (mean = 1.6 cm) were monitored for a mean of 4.3 years, with all-cause follow-up of 4.7 years.

No new cancers, growth, or suspicious features were found in these nodes during follow-up for either group of women. In conclusion, women without a history of prior malignancy or systemic disease with incidentally detected, nonpalpable, suspicious regional lymph nodes and an otherwise normal breast ultrasound examination underwent fine needle…

### The evolving landscape of salivary gland tumors [^111sjZus]. CA (2023). High credibility.

**Extent of neck dissection for patients with clinically node-positive disease**: Although neck dissection is recommended when clinically involved nodes are observed on physical examination or imaging, the extent of dissection remains controversial. Most experts advocate for selective neck dissection, including levels II-IV or I-IV, depending on the primary site. However, some support a comprehensive neck dissection involving levels I-V. One study demonstrated that 60% of patients undergoing neck dissection with clinically evident anterolateral neck disease also had occult nodal metastases in level V. This study was a single-institution, retrospective study, raising uncertainty about whether these patients could have been adequately treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. It is notable that no regional recurrences were observed in patients who did not undergo level V dissection.

### Prevalence and distribution of cervical lymph node metastases in HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^111Qrk3d]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP-SCC), the prevalence and distribution of clinical and pathological lymph node metastasis in the neck have been extensively reported. It served as the basis for consensus recommendations on selecting lymph node levels in the neck that require treatment. The objective of this study is to compare the prevalence and distribution of neck node metastases in HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) OP-SCC. This is based on a large series of patients with OP-SCC who underwent cervical lymph-node dissection (LND) as part of their treatment.

The study concentrated on OP-SCC patients treated by various neck node dissection (LND) procedures from January 2014 to December 2018 in three French institutions. Patients with prior head and neck cancer, prior neck surgery, the use of induction chemotherapy, or patients with carcinoma of unknown primary were excluded. HPV status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry. For each patient, the clinical and pathological nodal status, as well as the distribution of the positive nodes in each neck level (from Ia to V), were reported.

Two hundred sixty-three patients were included: 126 p16-negative (p16-) and 137 p16-positive (p16+). The rate of clinical positive nodes (cN+) reached 54% in the p16- group and 88.3% in the p16+ group (p < 0.001); the corresponding rate of pathological positive nodes (pN+) reached 61.9% and 91.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). Regarding the clinical lymph node distribution, in p16+ patients, more positive nodes were observed in the ipsilateral level IV (p = 0.003).

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders, including RA, SLE, and SS.

In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review, we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for evaluating lymphadenopathy in the pediatric emergency department: Case series and review of literature [^114LuJXs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Children present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with enlarged lymph nodes due to a broad spectrum of conditions ranging from benign causes like reactive lymph nodes to adverse conditions like malignancy. Identifying sonographic features typical of infection, inflammation, and neoplasms will help assist clinicians in deciding the disposition of the patients from the ED. Point-of-care ultrasound has become an essential adjunct for diagnostic assessment in pediatric emergency medicine. The wider accessibility of ultrasound, along with greater resolution using high-frequency probes, makes this noninvasive, nonradiation-based bedside examination an ideal tool for real-time examination of the lymph nodes in the ED.

- **Case series**: We present a series of cases in which the point-of-care ultrasound examination proved valuable in the timely diagnosis and expedited care of lymph node pathologies secondary to reactive, infectious, and malignant processes.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Point-of-care ultrasound will facilitate diagnosis in children with lymph node swelling and should be considered in children of all ages. While assessing the lymph node pathology at the bedside, describe the shape, size, internal echotexture, borders, vascularity, and the pattern of the perinodal soft tissue to differentiate between normal, reactive, infectious, inflammatory, or malignant underlying pathology.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^1169jQAG]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The suprahyoid neck is frequently the site of many common conditions. Although accessible to clinical examination, some components are better evaluated with imaging; lesions occupying the sublingual space and submandibular space are invisible to the referring clinician. A broad array of pathological processes can occur in these spaces, and pinpointing the origin can narrow the differential and, in certain cases, determine the diagnosis. These lesions can be classified into congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular, and neoplastic processes. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for evaluation, but there may be cases where both are needed in conjunction. This review article discusses the relevant anatomy, clinical highlights, and the characteristic imaging features of the various pathologies that occur within the sublingual and submandibular spaces.

### Presentation and outcomes of patients with clinically T1–2, N0 parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma: The roles of elective neck dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy [^1165nGsG]. Head & Neck (2022). Low credibility.

The type of parotidectomy for early salivary gland cancers, either extracapsular or partial with or without facial nerve dissection, is a topic of debate. Some advocate for a partial parotidectomy when the tumor is cancerous due to the risk of indistinct or infiltrative margins. However, a retrospective series of 30 patients who had a preoperative diagnosis of a benign parotid gland tumor but were found to have a malignancy on histopathology after an extracapsular dissection did not have adverse outcomes on survival. The aforementioned study was a small case series, and the study may not be adequately powered to fully address this question. In a study by Mantsopoulos et al. that included nine patients with primary low‐grade parotid malignant neoplasms who underwent extracapsular dissection, they demonstrated a 5‐year disease‐specific survival of 100%. In a systematic review of 2,202 patients by Guntinas‐Lichius et al, intraparotid metastasis was identified as a negative prognostic factor for primary parotid gland cancer. There is still controversy regarding the extent of parotidectomy (total vs. superficial) for tumors confined to the superficial lobe with superficial intraparotid lymph node metastasis and cervical metastasis without deep lobe intraparotid metastasis. Future studies are warranted to better delineate the role of intraparotid lymph node metastasis.

A parotidectomy, whether partial or total, is the standard of care for MEC, but management of the neck is physician and institutionally dependent. Due to significant heterogeneity among salivary gland cancers, including MEC.

### Ancient schwannoma of the submandibular gland [^112YtAYr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and CT of the neck to evaluate the characteristics, size, and position of the tumor for surgical assessment. The FNA results of the submandibular mass indicated granulomatous sialadenitis, and the official CT scan report described a well-circumscribed multiloculated cystic mass with an enhancing mural solid component and several enhancing septa arising from the superolateral part of the right submandibular gland. The mass measured 3.4 × 3.4 × 4.4 cm, with multiple subcentimeter bilateral cervical lymph nodes (Figure 1).

- **Figure 1**: (A) Axial, (B) coronal, and (C) sagittal views of CT of the neck with contrast media show a well-circumscribed multiloculated cystic mass on the right submandibular gland (arrow).

The side, number, and level of each node basin in the neck must be recorded. A diagram provided by the surgical team should be incorporated into the pathology record where possible. The report must include details of the numbers of nodes found in each individual basin and which nodes were hot, blue, both, or unlabelled. The dimensions of each node must be included, and the macroscopic appearance of the gross and cut surfaces stated.

- **Macrometastasis**: Note the largest dimension of the metastatic deposit in each node, and whether extracapsular spread is present or not.

- **Micrometastasis**: Should be recorded, even in the presence of macrometastasis. The largest dimension should be recorded. Record the anatomical location within the node: capsular, subcapsular, or parenchymal. Specify whether it is unifocal or multifocal. It is often difficult to ascertain exact numbers. Presence of extracapsular spread is permitted if the deposit is peripherally located and associated with a reactive stromal response.

- **Isolated tumour cells**: If evident, should be recorded, even in the presence of macro or micrometastasis. If cohesive, the size of the largest deposit should be stated. If dispersed, note the anatomical distribution.

Benign inclusions, including naevus cells, salivary inclusions, and false-positive cytokeratin artefacts (e.g. dendritic cells or scattered nonviable anucleate cells), should be recorded. The histopathological features of isolated tumour cells need careful description, as the UICC size cut-off, by necessity, encompasses small metastases which vary greatly in size and presumably in biological behavior.

Orolabial herpes can be associated with various symptoms, including crusts around the lips, cervical lymphadenopathy, tingling and painful lesions around the lips, swollen gums, and headache. Additionally, patients may experience mouth sores, oral mucosal erythema, oral vesicles, herpetic whitlow, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Other symptoms can include malaise, herpetic keratitis, blisters around the lips, and a papulovesicular rash. Painful oral lesions, swelling and erythema of the lips, fever, erythema multiforme, facial nerve palsy, lip sores, and a burning sensation around the lips are also possible associated symptoms.

### Anatomic variability of the accessory nerve: Implications for dissection of level IIB [^1174icD9]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

For over a century, the surgical management of cervical lymph nodes has been an integral part of the management of patients with head and neck cancer. The nodes in the upper neck are among the most likely to be involved in metastasis in many head and neck cancers. The Rouvière classification, based on the study of lymphatic flow, described two chains of lymph nodes in the upper neck draining the head and neck: the jugular chain following the internal jugular vein and the spinal accessory chain taking an oblique course. The two chains overlap near the jugular foramen. More recent terminology defines six nodal levels on each side of the neck. Level II comprises the lymph nodes deep to the sternocleidomastoid extending from the skull base to the level of the hyoid. The spinal accessory nerve (SAN) crosses level II and divides it into level IIA inferomedially and level IIB superolaterally. Level II contains the overlapping pathways of both the jugular and the spinal accessory chains.

The morbidity of neck dissection derives in meaningful part from the position of the SAN within level II. Early descriptions of the procedure involved the removal of the spinal accessory nerve in the upper neck to achieve rapid lymphadenectomy while avoiding dissemination of cancer through transgression of lymphatic channels. The nerve supplies the trapezius muscle, including the superior portion which elevates and controls the scapula. After radical neck dissection, patients often have long-term disability related to the shoulder and neck. The SAN must be exposed and dissected when it is preserved.

### Deletion of the entire interferon-γ receptor 1 gene causing complete deficiency in three related patients [^111QggyV]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Physical examination revealed multiple small cervical lymph nodes and one enlarged left pre-sternocleidomastoid node (4 × 2 cm) without fluctuation or redness of the overlying skin. Laboratory analysis showed leukocytosis with increased granulocyte and lymphocyte numbers without leukemic blasts, mild anemia, and a normal thrombocyte count. The chest X-ray was normal. Serologic tests for streptococcus, Bartonella sp., toxoplasmosis, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were negative. A bacterial infection was suspected, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was administered.

In light of progressive enlargement of the cervical lymph node (4 × 6 cm) and the appearance of supraclavicular nodes in the following weeks, other diagnoses, such as malignancy and (atypical) mycobacterial infection, were considered. Screening for anti-nuclear antibodies, sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus, germ cell tumor, and neuroblastoma was negative. Ultrasound did not show abscess formation or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Quantitative immunoglobulin levels revealed marginally raised IgM and IgA levels, while the IgG level was normal. Peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts demonstrated increased CD3 and CD4 counts and CD4 effector-memory population, whereas naïve T-cells were mildly decreased. The tuberculin skin test showed an induration of 7.0 mm. The result of the IFN-γ release assay (QuantiFERON®) showed high values for the specific mycobacterial antigens; however, the assay was interpreted as invalid because of very high IFN-γ values obtained for the negative control (64 IU/ml).

### Imaging of lymphadenopathy in the neck [^111HVVax]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a major role in assessing cervical lymphadenopathy. In infectious diseases, evaluating abscess formation and its relationship to surrounding vital structures is crucial for management. For head and neck malignancies, imaging is helpful for staging. Imaging the neck for nodal metastases is used to detect occult metastases or to assess the operability of palpable metastases. While detection of small occult metastases has limitations because micrometastases cannot be depicted, imaging can help reduce the risk of occult metastases, influencing management decisions. A very sensitive technique is necessary for this purpose. Current radiological criteria lack sufficient sensitivity to significantly reduce the risk of occult metastases. Therefore, more sensitive CT and MRI criteria, and especially ultrasound-guided aspiration, should be employed to assess the clinically negative neck.

### Long-term efficacy of ethanol ablation as treatment of metastatic lymph nodes from papillary thyroid carcinoma [^113GnVKk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment of small neck lymph node metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is challenging. Our institution was among the first worldwide to introduce ultrasound (US)-guided ethanol ablation (EA) as an optional treatment for neck lymph node metastases from PTC in 2004, following promising results from ethanol ablations published by Lewis et al. in 2002. Heilo et al. presented our results from EA treatment over a 5-year period (2004–2009) in 2011.

Neck lymph node metastases are common, found in 20% to 50% of PTC patients at diagnosis. With more sensitive diagnostic methods, studies have reported a frequency of micrometastasis (< 2 mm) approaching 90%. Lymph node metastases are considered an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and locoregional re-disease, though their effect on survival remains controversial. Surgical extirpation is recommended when lymph node metastases are present before or during primary surgery. The benefits of prophylactic lymph node dissection are still debated, but usually recommended for advanced stage primary tumors (T3–4).

Studies have shown a recurrence risk in neck lymph nodes ranging from 5% to 21%, with most cases occurring within 10 years after primary treatment. High-resolution US, thorough morphological evaluation, and sensitive assays for detecting thyroglobulin (Tg) in fine-needle aspiration biopsy washouts (FNAB-Tg) can detect metastases as small as 2 to 3 mm. The availability of these tools contributes to an increased detection rate of small metastases.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^111Zafm9]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and a diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication, requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is particularly relevant in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Sjögren's syndrome (SS).

In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease, which must be considered in the differential diagnosis, because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review, we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease, as well as therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest, will be discussed in detail.

### The EANM practical guidelines for sentinel lymph node localisation in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^116dh8z2]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Issues requiring clarification**: Diseases or previous treatments that affect lymphatic drainage, such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, or previous interventions (radiotherapy and/or surgery) within the neck, can distort normal lymphatic pathways. This distortion can result in unexpected lymph node (LN) uptakes. However, opinion suggests that lymphoscintigraphy is useful in mapping aberrant drainage, particularly in cases where disrupted lymphatic pathways may cause metastasis to occur in unexpected locations.

- **FDG PET/CT**: Due to insufficient negative predictive value, FDG PET/CT does not replace sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in oral cancer. Additionally, due to a lack of specificity, it cannot differentiate malignant from inflammatory lymph nodes, which are highly prevalent in the head and neck area.

- **Number of injections**: The optimal number of injections is four. However, the number of injections can be decreased or increased depending on the individual case.

- **Non-migration or non-visualisation of the lymph nodes**: This is a rare eventuality. If single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is negative, reinjection might be considered.

- **Depth of invasion**: The risk of metastasis increases with tumor depth, but there is no upper or lower limit that can accurately predict the patient's nodal status. Currently, there are no recommendations for neck management based on depth, but this may change with further data.

- **Patients with widespread field change**: Occasionally, large areas of the oral cavity contain unstable epithelium. These patients are not good candidates for sentinel node biopsy (SNB), as the periphery of unstable mucosa is indistinct and it is difficult to assess appropriately.

### Defining the risk of involvement for each neck nodal level in patients with early T-stage node-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma [^1117s8G4]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

To assess the risk of ipsilateral subclinical neck nodal involvement for early T-stage/node-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, patients undergoing multilevel upfront neck dissection at Johns Hopkins Hospital within the last 10 years were identified. These patients had early clinical T-stage (cT1–2) node-positive (cN+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Pathologic involvement of Levels IB-V was determined. For each nodal level, the negative predictive value of imaging results was computed using sensitivity/specificity data for computed tomography (CT). This calculation was used to determine 1 - negative predictive value, representing the risk that a negative level on CT harbors subclinical disease.

A total of 103 patients met the criteria. Radical neck dissection (ND) was performed in 14.6% of patients, modified radical ND in 70.9%, and selective ND in 14.6%. Pathologic positivity rates were found to be 9.5%, 91.3%, 40.8%, 18.0%, and 3.3% for Levels IB-V, respectively. The risks of subclinical disease despite negative CT imaging results were calculated as 3.1%, 76.3%, 17.5%, 6.3%, and 1.0% for Levels IB-V, respectively.

Levels IB and V are at very low (< 5%) risk of involvement, even ipsilaterally to pathologically proven neck disease; this can guide radiation planning. Levels II and III should be included in high-risk volumes regardless of imaging results, and Level IV should be included within the lowest risk volume.

The preoperative imaging acquisition protocol should include the following:

- **Positioning**: Adequate anterior hyper-extension of the neck is required, as long as tolerated by the patient, in order to accurately evaluate the neck levels, especially level I.

- **Dynamic acquisition**: Acquire immediate dynamic images of the neck in anterior view (within 5 min post-injection). The dynamic study should encompass at least the first 10–15 min to identify lymphatic vessels that drain the tumor.

- **Early static images**: Anterior and lateral views should be acquired shortly after dynamic acquisition. Both of these acquisition steps are particularly important to visualize the lymphatic pathways, allowing for the distinction between SLNs and second-tier lymph nodes. To improve the quality of imaging, the distance between the collimator and the neck should be minimal. An adequate zoom factor (×1.5) should also be used to identify the lymph nodes that receive direct drainage from the tumor.

- **Late images**: A late static image at 60–120 min post-injection using the same views as early static images should be acquired, at least anterior views if SPECT/CT is also performed. This part of the imaging process is used to identify additional lymph nodes that receive somewhat slower direct drainage from the tumor. Importantly, comparing early and late images provides a crucial tool to distinguish between the surgically relevant SLNs and irrelevant higher echelon nodes.

### Management of clinically node-negative salivary gland cancer: Observation, neck dissection, or neck irradiation [^115G8Tji]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

An Institutional Review Board-approved registry of head and neck cancers treated at a tertiary care center was queried for diagnoses of salivary gland cancer of major or minor salivary glands between 2000 and 2019. Diagnosis for inclusion in the study was based on final surgical pathology. Clinically node-negative cases were defined as those that did not demonstrate evidence of lymphadenopathy based on physical examination and preoperative radiographic evaluation, if completed.

Negative, but borderline radiographic nodal features were considered as ≥ 1 ipsilateral lymph node(s) measuring 0.7–1.0 cm in the short axis or bilateral, symmetric lymph nodes measuring 1.0–1.3 cm in the short axis. Lymph nodes with maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) between 2.5 and 5.0 on positron emission tomography were defined as borderline, and those with maximum SUV > 5.0 were considered clinically positive and excluded.

Neck dissection (ND) was defined as surgical resection of ≥ 5 lymph nodes, not including intra-parotid nodes standardly resected at the time of parotidectomy. Patients with 0–4 lymph nodes removed at the time of surgery were not included in the ND group. ND is routinely completed for intermediate and grade high neoplasms if that is established at the time of biopsy. ND includes ipsilateral level II–IV, with the inclusion of level I for oral cavity and submandibular gland primary tumors.

Patients were evaluated for receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), and those who received RT were classified as treated to the tumor bed with or without neck irradiation (NI).
