## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of vitiligo in adults (nonsegmental)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating nonsegmental vitiligo in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled topical therapy and its exact dosing constraints. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial data that underpin the label. Next, I will review guideline-backed alternatives for patients who cannot use or cannot access the labeled therapy. After that, I need to consider emerging systemic options and their current evidentiary status. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation with monitoring advice and caveats about coverage and patient selection.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-approved option and its dosing, because that is the most authoritative starting point. Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream (Opzelura) is indicated for topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, with the recommended regimen of a thin layer applied twice daily to affected areas up to 10% of total body surface area, not exceeding 60 g per week or 100 g per 2 weeks, and not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use [^e7192b6d] [^49c8b108] [^a978d780].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for that dosing and the expected timeline to response. The approval rests on two identical phase 3, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2) in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo affecting up to 10% BSA, where 1.5% ruxolitinib cream applied twice daily for 24 weeks produced significantly higher rates of facial VASI75 than vehicle, and continued improvement was observed through 52 weeks; importantly, meaningful repigmentation may require more than 24 weeks, so I should counsel on persistence and reassessment if response is limited at 24 weeks [^8769aafe] [^db97c09c] [^e7192b6d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal applicability; I need to check who is actually eligible for this therapy. The labeled indication is for patients aged 12 years and older with nonsegmental vitiligo, and the pivotal trials excluded patients with more than 10% BSA involvement, so adults with extensive disease are not covered by the current FDA labeling; additionally, the label advises against combining ruxolitinib cream with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, which I should reinforce during counseling [^a978d780] [^e7192b6d] [^db97c09c].

> Next, I should review guideline-supported alternatives for patients who cannot use ruxolitinib or who have disease beyond the labeled BSA limit. The British Association of Dermatologists recommends potent or very potent topical corticosteroids as first-line for localized vitiligo, typically used intermittently to mitigate atrophy risk, and topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily as an alternative or adjunct, particularly on the face or in sensitive areas; these remain off-label for vitiligo but are supported by guidelines and long-standing clinical experience [^a491f2dd] [^90ca0290] [^e681a187] [^3f12e911].

> I will now examine phototherapy options, because combination strategies often outperform monotherapy in localized disease. Narrowband UVB is the first-line phototherapy for generalized vitiligo, and for localized disease, excimer laser or light in combination with topical calcineurin inhibitors can be considered; the HI-Light randomized trial showed that home-based handheld NB-UVB plus potent topical corticosteroid was superior to steroid alone for active, limited vitiligo, though adherence and training are critical to safe implementation [^b758f80f] [^b20b78bd] [^1a643660] [^052647f6].

> But wait, what if the disease is extensive or rapidly progressive and topical therapy is impractical or insufficient? I should confirm the status of systemic JAK inhibitors. Oral JAK inhibitors such as ritlecitinib, upadacitinib, and povorcitinib have shown promising repigmentation in phase 2 trials for extensive nonsegmental vitiligo, yet none are FDA-approved for vitiligo at this time; use would be off-label and should be individualized with careful risk–benefit discussion and, when possible, in the context of clinical trials or specialized centers [^12e25116] [^b108b04d] [^998138d2] [^559c05e3].

> Let me consider combination approaches that include systemic therapy, because emerging data suggest additive benefit. Baricitinib 4 mg daily combined with NB-UVB produced substantial repigmentation in a randomized proof-of-concept trial of adults with severe, active nonsegmental vitiligo, and small real-world series suggest tofacitinib plus NB-UVB can be effective in refractory cases; again, these are not standard-of-care approvals, so shared decision-making and close monitoring are essential [^ddce7047] [^51ce74d4].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring considerations so my recommendation is complete. For ruxolitinib cream, common adverse effects are application-site acne and pruritus, and systemic exposure is low but not negligible; patients should be counseled on proper application, quantity limits, and avoidance of concomitant potent immunosuppressants. For phototherapy, I need to ensure sun protection counseling and discuss the need for prolonged courses and the risk of relapse after cessation. For any systemic JAK inhibitor use off-label, I should screen for infections, malignancy, thrombosis risk, and laboratory monitoring per class safety profiles [^8769aafe] [^e7192b6d] [^c78e4157] [^8196127a].

> Putting this together, my hierarchy is as follows, and I should confirm alignment with evidence and guidelines. First-line for adults with nonsegmental vitiligo affecting up to 10% BSA is ruxolitinib 1.5% cream applied as a thin layer twice daily to affected areas, not exceeding 60 g per week, with reassessment at 24 weeks and continuation through 52 weeks if response is meaningful; if access is limited or contraindications exist, consider potent or very potent topical corticosteroids used intermittently and/or topical tacrolimus 0.1% twice daily, with phototherapy added for broader or refractory disease; for adults with more than 10% BSA or rapidly progressive disease, discuss off-label systemic JAK inhibitors in specialized settings or trials, ideally in combination with NB-UVB when appropriate [^e7192b6d] [^8769aafe] [^a491f2dd] [^e681a187] [^b758f80f] [^12e25116] [^b108b04d] [^ddce7047].

---

The recommended dosage for treating nonsegmental vitiligo in adults is **topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream** [^e7192b6d] applied as a thin layer twice daily to affected areas up to 10% of body surface area, not exceeding 60 g per week or 100 g per 2 weeks [^49c8b108]. Treatment should continue for at least 24 weeks [^e7192b6d]; if there is no meaningful repigmentation by 24 weeks, reassess and consider alternative therapies [^e7192b6d]. For extensive disease (> 10% BSA), consider oral JAK inhibitors (e.g. upadacitinib 11–22 mg daily [^b108b04d] or ritlecitinib 50 mg daily [^12e25116]) in clinical trials or specialist settings. Monitor for adverse effects and adjust therapy as needed [^e20f0b5c].

## Topical therapy

### Ruxolitinib cream (Opzelura)

- **Indication**: FDA-approved for topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adults and pediatric patients aged ≥ 12 years [^a978d780] [^6c75c057].
- **Dosage**: Apply a thin layer twice daily to affected areas up to 10% of body surface area (BSA) [^e7192b6d] [^49c8b108].
- **Maximum usage**: Do not exceed 60 g per week or 100 g per 2 weeks [^e7192b6d] [^49c8b108].
- **Duration**: Continue treatment for at least 24 weeks; reassess if no meaningful repigmentation by 24 weeks [^e7192b6d] [^db97c09c].
- **Application instructions**: For topical use only; avoid ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use [^e7192b6d] [^49c8b108].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting ruxolitinib cream

- **Phase 3 trials**: Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2) demonstrated significant repigmentation with ruxolitinib cream compared to vehicle control [^8769aafe].
- **Efficacy**: At 24 weeks, 29.8% (TRuE-V1) and 30.9% (TRuE-V2) of patients achieved ≥ 75% improvement in facial VASI (F-VASI75) compared to 7.4% and 11.4% with vehicle, respectively [^8769aafe].
- **Safety**: Common adverse effects include application-site acne and pruritus; overall safety profile is favorable [^8769aafe] [^b58fd62c].

---

## Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is considered for patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo (> 10% BSA) or those who do not respond adequately to topical therapy. Currently, **oral JAK inhibitors** are the most promising systemic options, though they are not yet universally approved for vitiligo.

---

### Oral JAK inhibitors

- **Upadacitinib**: A selective JAK1 inhibitor, dosed at 11 mg or 22 mg once daily, has shown significant repigmentation in phase 2 trials for extensive nonsegmental vitiligo [^b108b04d] [^4476f6a7].
- **Ritlecitinib**: A JAK3/TEC inhibitor, dosed at 50 mg daily, has demonstrated efficacy in phase 2b trials for active nonsegmental vitiligo [^12e25116].
- **Povorcitinib**: A selective JAK1 inhibitor, dosed at 15–75 mg daily, has shown substantial repigmentation in phase 2 trials for extensive vitiligo [^998138d2].
- **Limitations**: These therapies are not yet FDA-approved for vitiligo and should be considered in clinical trials or specialist settings due to potential systemic adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy, particularly with **topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors** plus narrowband UVB phototherapy, may enhance repigmentation compared to monotherapy [^596e2844] [^1a643660]. However, evidence quality varies and therapy should be individualized based on patient factors and preferences [^7c8bda45].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess treatment response, monitor adverse effects, and adjust therapy. The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) recommends reassessing topical treatments every 3–6 months and documenting disease progression with medical photography when possible [^757dfe8d] [^7309ff05].

### Efficacy and safety of the oral Janus kinase 1 inhibitor povorcitinib in patients with extensive vitiligo in a phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study [^998138d2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

No repigmentation treatments are approved for vitiligo affecting > 10% body surface area (BSA).

Objective

To assess efficacy and safety of povorcitinib (oral, selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor) in extensive nonsegmental vitiligo.

Methods

This double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2 study (NCT04818346) randomized adult patients 1:1:1:1 to once-daily povorcitinib 15, 45, or 75 mg or placebo for 24 weeks. Subsequently, patients received povorcitinib 45 mg (initially randomized to 45 mg) or 75 mg (initially randomized to placebo, 15, or 75 mg) until Week 52, followed by 24-week post-treatment follow-up. Primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at Week 24.

Results

Of 171 patients (mean T-BSA/T-VASI, 28.2%/25.5) randomized, 82.5% completed the 24-week treatment. At Week 24, povorcitinib significantly improved T-VASI from baseline (15 mg, 19.1%; 45 mg, 17.8%; 75 mg, 15.7%) versus placebo (-2.3%; least squares mean povorcitinib vs placebo, P < 0.01). Continuous improvement was observed through Week 52. Incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events was similar across treatment groups, with no new safety signals.

Limitations

Limited demographic diversity.

Conclusion

Povorcitinib demonstrated substantial total body and facial repigmentation in adult patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo and was generally well tolerated through 52 weeks of treatment.

### Medical and maintenance treatments for vitiligo [^1b4c80d5]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Medical treatments alone, or in combination with phototherapy, are key approaches for treating nonsegmental vitiligo and, to a lesser extent, segmental vitiligo. The treatments are useful for halting disease progression and have been proven effective for inducing repigmentation and decreasing risk of relapses. Although the treatments have side effects and limitations, vitiligo often induces a marked decrease in quality of life and in most cases the risk:benefit ratio is in favor of an active approach. Systemic and topical agents targeting the pathways involved in loss of melanocytes and in differentiation of melanocyte stem cells should provide more effective approaches in the near future.

### Efficacy and safety of oral ritlecitinib for the treatment of active nonsegmental vitiligo: a randomized phase 2b clinical trial [^12e25116]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by depigmented patches of the skin.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ritlecitinib, an oral JAK3 (Janus kinase)/TEC (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocelluar carcinoma) inhibitor, in patients with active nonsegmental vitiligo in a phase 2b trial (NCT03715829).

Methods

Patients were randomized to once-daily oral ritlecitinib ± 4-week loading dose (200/50 mg, 100/50 mg, 30 mg, or 10 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks (dose-ranging period). Patients subsequently received ritlecitinib 200/50 mg daily in a 24-week extension period. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change from baseline in Facial-Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at week 24.

Results

A total of 364 patients were treated in the dose-ranging period. Significant differences from placebo in percent change from baseline in Facial-Vitiligo Area Scoring Index were observed for the ritlecitinib 50 mg groups with (-21.2 vs 2.1; P < .001) or without (-18.5 vs 2.1; P < .001) a loading dose and ritlecitinib 30 mg group (-14.6 vs 2.1; P = 0.01). Accelerated improvement was observed after treatment with ritlecitinib 200/50 mg in the extension period (n = 187). No dose-dependent trends in treatment-emergent or serious adverse events were observed across the 48-week treatment.

Limitations

Patients with stable vitiligo only were excluded.

Conclusions

Oral ritlecitinib was effective and well tolerated over 48 weeks in patients with active nonsegmental vitiligo.

### Combination of baricitinib and phototherapy in adults with active vitiligo: a randomized clinical trial [^ddce7047]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disorder leading to skin depigmentation and reduced quality of life (QOL). Patients with extensive and very active disease are the most difficult to treat.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of baricitinib combined with narrowband UV-B in adults with severe, active, nonsegmental vitiligo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This academic, multicenter, double-blind, noncomparative randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 dermatology departments between July 2021 and April 2023 and included adult patients with extensive and active nonsegmental vitiligo. The study was designed to evaluate the effect of baricitinib plus narrowband UV-B based solely on the results from this experimental group. The placebo group was used as a calibration group. Data were analyzed from August to November 2023.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 3:1 to baricitinib, 4 mg per day, or placebo for 36 weeks alone for the first 12 weeks and then in combination with narrowband UV-B twice a week from weeks 12 to 36.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mean percentage change in total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) score from baseline to week 36 (baricitinib group). The prespecified aim of the study was to show that the reduction in the baricitinib plus narrowband UV-B was significantly greater than 42.9%, a repigmented surface threshold previously observed in patients treated with narrowband UV-B alone. Adverse events and secondary outcomes of change in disease activity and QOL were assessed. Post hoc analyses were additionally performed.

Results

Of 49 included patients, 35 (71%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 49.9 (38.4–59.8) years. A total of 37 patients were randomized to the baricitinib group and 12 to the placebo group. The mean change in total VASI at week 36 was -44.8% (95% CI, -58.4% to -31.3%) for the baricitinib group and -9.2% (95% CI, -27.7% to 24.7%) for the placebo group. This was not significantly greater than the sufficient repigmented surface threshold of 42.9%. Post hoc analyses showed a significant difference at week 36 for total VASI score in the baricitinib plus narrowband UV-B group compared with placebo plus narrowband UV-B (-44.8% vs -9.2%, respectively; P = 0.02). There was a greater improvement in disease activity and QOL in the baricitinib group vs placebo group and no significant difference in the number of adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

This proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial confirmed the efficacy of baricitinib combined with narrowband UV-B in the treatment of patients with extensive and active vitiligo.

Trial Registration

### Review of ruxolitinib for treatment of non-segmental vitiligo [^b58fd62c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of topical ruxolitinib for treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo.

Data Sources

Literature published between January 1983 and October 2022 was reviewed from MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant articles in English and data from clinical trials were included.

Data Synthesis

In 2 phase II trials, treatment with ruxolitinib cream showed significant improvements in Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) scores compared with controls. The 1.5% concentration applied twice daily showed the best results after 52 weeks, with 50% VASI improvement in 58% of patients, 75% VASI improvement in 52% of patients, and 90% VASI improvement in 33% of patients. In 2 phase III trials, more patients achieved at least 75% improvement in facial VASI at 24 weeks (primary endpoint; trial 1: 29.9%, trial 2: 29.9%) than controls (trial 1: 7.5% [P < 0.0001], trial 2: 12.9% [P < 0.01]). Common adverse effects were erythema, pruritus, and acne; all events were mild.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison To Existing Drugs

This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety data regarding topical ruxolitinib for vitiligo. Ruxolitinib is associated with significant clinical improvements with low bioavailability and minimal adverse effects compared with conventional topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, and depigmentation agents.

Conclusions

Ruxolitinib cream is the first therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for repigmentation of nonsegmental vitiligo. Clinicians should consider these benefits when recommending treatment as conventional therapies may be time-intensive and carry greater risks of adverse effects.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^b108b04d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1:1) to one of five treatment groups using an interactive response technology system according to a schedule generated and distributed by randomisation specialists at AbbVie using WebRando. Block randomisation with a block size of 16 was used. Patient randomisation was stratified by age (≤ 50 versus > 50 years), baseline disease severity (T-VASI < 15 versus T-VASI ≥ 15), and status of active vitiligo (Yes versus No). Patients received upadacitinib 6 mg (UPA6), upadacitinib 11 mg (UPA11), upadacitinib 22 mg (UPA22), or placebo (PBO; prespecified to switch to either UPA11 or UPA22 in period 2) once daily for 24 weeks (period 1). For weeks 24–52 (period 2), patients randomised to UPA continued their treatment and patients receiving PBO switched to either UPA11 or UPA22 in a blinded fashion per prespecified randomised assignments. Upadacitinib and PBO tablets were identical in appearance. The AbbVie study team was blinded until the week 24 primary analysis. Patients, study investigators, and study site personnel were blinded to treatment throughout the study.

Procedures

Patients received a single daily, orally administered 6 mg, 11 mg, or 22 mg tablet of upadacitinib or PBO. Patients were encouraged to swallow the tablet at approximately the same time each day, with or without food. Patients were required to discontinue systemic vitiligo therapy (eg, corticosteroids, methotrexate) or supplemental vitiligo therapy (eg, antioxidants, herbal medicine) and any topical vitiligo therapy at least 30 days before the first dose of study drug. Patients could not have received any phototherapy for a minimum of 12 weeks before the first dose of study drug. Patients were allowed to receive natural daily light following a normal routine, but for a prolonged exposure to sunlight, sunscreen was recommended. Efficacy was assessed at baseline and study visits at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 28, 36, 44, and 52. Safety was monitored throughout the study and through 30 days following the last dose of study drug.

### Treatments of vitiligo: what's new at the horizon [^2255888f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a manageable disease. However, current vitiligo treatments can be considered suboptimal as they do not guarantee high efficacy and cannot be standardized for most patients. Recently, combination therapies have been introduced in order to obtain better results and reduce risks in the management of the disease. Novel efficacious products are hereunder discussed to improve the therapeutic options for vitiligo patients.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^d89af78e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary analyses for all efficacy endpoints were conducted after all patients completed week 24 (period 1) or had prematurely discontinued from the study before week 24. This was the only and final analysis of efficacy for these endpoints in period 1. Assuming a week 24 percent change from baseline in F-VASI of 0% in the PBO arm, the planned sample size of 160 adults (40 patients per treatment group) in period 1 of the study would provide > 90% power to detect the treatment difference of 40% reduction (assuming a standard deviation of 54.8%) in at least one upadacitinib group versus PBO. All statistical tests were two-sided at an alpha level of 0.1. There was no control for overall type 1 error or multiplicity; all p values are nominal. Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intention-to-treat population for each period of the study and were defined for period 1 as all patients who were randomised at baseline and for period 2 as all patients who entered period 2. Safety analyses were performed for period 1 on the safety population defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and on the "any upadacitinib treatment" population defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of upadacitinib during the study.

14.2 Nonsegmental Vitiligo

Two double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials of identical design (TRuE‑V1 and TRuE‑V2, NCT04052425 and NCT04057573, respectively) enrolled a total of 674 adult and pediatric subjects aged 12 years and older (11% of subjects were 12 to 17 years of age and 7% were 65 years or older). Females constituted 53% of subjects, 82% of subjects were White, 5% were Black, and 4% were Asian. Fitzpatrick skin types included I (2%), II (30%), III (40%), IV (19%), V (7%), or VI (2%). Subjects had depigmented areas affecting ≥ 0.5% facial body surface area (F-BSA), ≥ 3% non-facial BSA, and total body vitiligo area (facial and non-facial, including hands, feet, upper and lower extremities, and trunk body areas) of up to 10% BSA. At baseline, subjects had a mean affected F-BSA of 1% and a mean affected total BSA of 7.4%. Phototherapy was not permitted during the trial. The mean time since diagnosis of nonsegmental vitiligo was 14.8 years prior to subjects enrolling in the trials.

In both trials, subjects were randomized 2:1 to treatment with OPZELURA or vehicle cream twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks followed by an additional 28 weeks of treatment with OPZELURA BID for all subjects. Lesions on the face were assessed with the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) and lesions on the total body (including the face) were assessed with the total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving at least 75% improvement in F-VASI (F-VASI75) at Week 24. The proportion of participants achieving at least 90% improvement in F-VASI (F-VASI90) was also evaluated.

Efficacy results for OPZELURA at Week 24 from the two trials are summarized in Table 4. The percentage of subjects who achieved F-VASI75 and T-VASI75 (at least 75% improvement in T‑VASI) over the 52-week treatment period in both trials are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

### Expert recommendations on use of topical therapeutics for vitiligo in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients [^568646df]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of vitiligo in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients in the US are needed.

Objective

To develop evidence- and consensus-based expert recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in young patients.

Evidence Review

A process was developed to produce consensus recommendations addressing questions regarding pediatric vitiligo. A librarian-conducted literature review was performed using articles that met the inclusion criteria: published in English, containing primary data (including meta-analysis) and pediatric-specific data, and analysis of 6 or more patients. Included articles were graded by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy criteria and Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine's Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendation. Research questions were reviewed on May 9, 2022, through a video conference. One month after the conference, participants participated in an online survey documenting their level of agreement with the generated statements, using a 5-point Likert scale.

Findings

Articles on topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors (n = 50), topical Janus kinase inhibitors (n = 5), pseudocatalase (n = 2), and microdermabrasion (n = 2) met inclusion criteria. Forty-two recommendations were made on the diagnosis of vitiligo and optimal topical therapeutics, with 33 recommendations obtaining a 70% or greater composite agreement and strong agreement. Topical calcineurin inhibitors twice daily, topical corticosteroids with time limitation due to atrophy risk, and topical ruxolitinib, 1.5%, cream-used off-label for patients younger than 12 years and limited to nonsegmental vitiligo-were identified as evidence-based first-line therapies in the management of pediatric and adolescent patients, with specific guidance on age-based data, minimum therapeutic trial of 6 months or greater, prolonged therapy to prevent recurrence, and the positive benefit of coordinated use of UV therapeutic sources.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence supports the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical corticosteroids, and topical Janus kinase inhibitors as effective therapeutics for vitiligo in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients, with specific decisions on choice of agent based on factors such as site location, body surface area, and age.

Discussion

Vitiligo has traditionally been given a relatively low priority in the dermatology research agenda, as shown by the number and quality of studies on vitiligo to date. The updated systematic reviewis helpful in identifying many important research gaps for clinical trials, but these have come largely from the research community, and may not reflect the questions that patients and clinicians have.

### Apremilast in combination with narrowband UVB in the treatment of vitiligo: a 52-week monocentric prospective randomized placebo-controlled study [^554d9d4a]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Scientific rationale and encouraging first clinical results suggest the interest of using apremilast for treating vitiligo.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of apremilast in combination therapy with narrowband (NB)-UVB versus placebo and NB-UVB treatment for repigmentation in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo.

Design

This was a 52-week prospective randomized placebo-controlled study.

Participants

Adult patients with vitiligo participated.

Interventions

Group A received, in addition to phototherapy, apremilast at the label dosage, and group B received placebo. After 24 weeks, patients who responded (decreased Vitiligo Area Scoring Index > 30%) were rerandomized to receive apremilast or placebo, combined with twice-weekly NB-UVB for 24 additional weeks. Main outcome and measure: The primary outcome measure was the comparison between the two groups of the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index score at 24 weeks.

Results

Eighty patients were randomized (40 in each group). After 24 weeks, the mean Vitiligo Area Scoring Index score decreased from 23.63 to 19.49 (P = 0.011) in the apremilast + UVB group and from 21.57 to 15.25 (P < 0.0001) in the placebo + UVB group. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.18). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups after an additional 24 weeks of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Apremilast does not bring any benefit to NB-UVB for treating vitiligo.

### Ruxolitinib cream for treatment of vitiligo: a randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial [^888cde28]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease resulting in skin depigmentation and reduced quality of life. There is no approved treatment for vitiligo repigmentation and current off-label therapies have limited efficacy, emphasising the need for improved treatment options. We investigated the therapeutic potential of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo and report the efficacy and safety results up to 52 weeks of double-blind treatment.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study for adult patients with vitiligo in 26 US hospitals and medical centres in 18 states. Patients with depigmentation of 0·5% or more of their facial body surface area (BSA) and 3% or more of their non-facial BSA were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) by use of an interactive response technology system to receive ruxolitinib cream (1·5% twice daily, 1·5% once daily, 0·5% once daily, or 0·15% once daily) or vehicle (control group) twice daily on lesions constituting 20% or less of their total BSA for 24 weeks. Patients in the control group in addition to patients in the 0·15% once daily group who did not show a 25% or higher improvement from baseline in facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) at week 24 were re-randomised to one of three higher ruxolitinib cream doses (0·5% once daily, 1·5% once daily, 1·5% twice daily). Patients in the 0·5% once daily, 1·5% once daily, or 1·5% twice daily groups remained at their original dose up to week 52. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor (except members of the interim analysis and primary endpoint analysis data monitoring teams) remained masked to treatment assignment throughout the study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or higher improvement from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI50) at week 24, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03099304.

Findings

Between June 7, 2017, and March 21, 2018, 205 patients were screened for eligibility, 48 were excluded and 157 patients (mean age, 48·3 years [SD 12·9]; 73 [46%] male and 84 [54%] female) were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or the control group. 32 (20%) of 157 were assigned to the control group, 31 (20%) to the 0·15% once daily group, 31 (20%) to the 0·5% once daily group, 30 (19%) to the 1·5% once daily group, and 33 (21%) to the 1·5% twice daily group. F-VASI50 at week 24 was reached by significantly more patients given ruxolitinib cream at 1·5% twice daily (15 [45%] of 33) and 1·5% once daily (15 [50%] of 30) than were treated with vehicle (one [3%] of 32). Four patients had serious treatment-emergent adverse events (one patient in the 1·5% twice daily group developed subdural haematoma; one patient in the 1·5% once daily group had a seizure; one patient in the 0·5% once daily group had coronary artery occlusion; and one patient in the 0·5% once daily group had oesophageal achalasia), all of which were unrelated to study treatment. Application site pruritus was the most common treatment-related adverse event among patients given ruxolitinib cream (one [3%] of 33 in the 1·5% twice daily group; three [10%] of 30 in the 1·5% once daily group; three [10%] of 31 in the 0·5% once daily group; and six [19%] of 31 in the 0·15% once daily group)with three [9%] of 32 patients showing application site pruritis in the control group. Acne was noted as a treatment-related adverse event in 13 (10%) of 125 patients who received ruxolitinib cream and one (3%) of 32 patients who received vehicle cream. All treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and similar across treatment groups.

Interpretation

Treatment with ruxolitinib cream was associated with substantial repigmentation of vitiligo lesions up to 52 weeks of treatment, and all doses were well tolerated. These data suggest that ruxolitinib cream might be an effective treatment option for patients with vitiligo.

Of the 1249 total subjects with atopic dermatitis in clinical trials with OPZELURA, 115 (9%) were 65 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. No clinically meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects less than 65 years and subjects 65 years and older.

Of the 831 total subjects enrolled with nonsegmental vitiligo in clinical trials with OPZELURA, 65 (8%) were 65 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Clinical trials of OPZELURA in subjects with nonsegmental vitiligo did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^d18f0d91]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety was evaluated by the number and proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs). Vital signs were measured, laboratory tests were performed, and physical examinations were completed throughout the study. The following AEs were assessed: treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AEs, TEAEs leading to death, TEAEs considered to be related to study drug, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, any severe TEAEs (grade 3 or above according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5), and TEAEs of special interest prespecified based on previous observations in patients receiving upadacitinib.

For period 1, TEAEs were defined as any AE that began or worsened after initiation of study drug through 30 days following the last dose of study drug in period 1 and before the first dose in period 2. For period 2, TEAEs were defined as any AE that began or worsened after initiation of study drug in period 2 through 30 days following the last dose of study drug in period 2. Exposure-adjusted number of events per 100 patient-years (PYs) for TEAEs occurring during the study were calculated for patients receiving any upadacitinib dose to adjust for differences in duration of upadacitinib treatment and potentially differences in duration of follow-up.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^559c05e3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While the results of this phase 2 dose-ranging study are promising, this study is not without limitations. A large percentage of each treatment group was White, and thus additional studies are needed in underrepresented populations. However, subgroup analyses based on race and Fitzpatrick skin types yielded similar improvements to the overall population. Eligibility criteria for this dose-ranging study were selected with safety in mind and thus, like most clinical trials, the population may not fully reflect the vitiligo patient population in the real-world setting. Additionally, this study evaluated upadacitinib as monotherapy, while many patients with vitiligo conventionally receive a combination of therapies. Because improvements in depigmentation did not reach a plateau through week 52, the current study may not have fully demonstrated the efficacy of upadacitinib in non-segmental vitiligo. Considering that each treatment arm had fewer than 50 patients, the observed treatment difference across dose subgroups may be influenced by variation, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, while this sample size was adequately powered to detect treatment differences in this study, investigation in a larger patient population is warranted. Thus, additional phase 3 studies of vitiligo are necessary to confirm and further explore the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in patients with extensive non-segmental vitiligo.

Overall, the results of this study provide insights into the efficacy of upadacitinib compared with PBO for the treatment of adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo. Both UPA11 and UPA22 demonstrated efficacy based on F-VASI and were associated with a high patient-reported improvement on the Patient's GIC-V. Although UPA6 provided numerical improvement for most assessments, UPA6 failed to show statistical improvement in F-VASI. Upadacitinib is the first oral JAK1 inhibitor to demonstrate significant repigmentation of vitiligo lesions on the face (based on F-VASI) and total body (based on T-VASI) at 24 and 52 weeks. Upadacitinib may offer a new and effective systemic treatment option for adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo. Based on the results from this phase 2 dose-ranging study and exposure-response modelling, the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 15 mg are being investigated in adults and adolescents with non-segmental vitiligo in an ongoing phase 3 trial (Viti-Up;).

### The development of guidelines for the treatment of vitiligo… [^eb17e2a3]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Results Before the development of the guidelines, there was no uniformity in treatment selection, and there was a variability in estimates of treatment outcome. The meta-analysis showed class 3 corticosteroids and narrowband UV-B to be the most effective and safest therapies for localized and for generalized vitiligo, respectively. From another systematic review, it could be concluded that patients with segmental, stable, or lip-tip vitiligo could be successfully treated with most autologous transplantation methods. An evaluation was made of the existing strategies for the treatment of vitiligo using a questionnaire and a structured interview. A meta-analysis of the literature was performed concerning the most currently studied and applied nonsurgical repigmentation therapies and the most current autologous transplantation methods and depigmentation therapies. Autologous transplantation methods were not chosen as first-choice therapy for children by any of the respondents.

For adults, topical corticosteroid therapy was prescribed by 64% of the physicians for localized vitiligo, 71% for generalized vitiligo, and 79% for lip-tip vitiligo. In patients with generalized vitiligo, other treatment choices were narrowband UV-B therapy and oral PUVA. The results of this study allowed us to conclude that class 3 corticosteroids and UV-B were the most effective and safest therapies for localized and for generalized vitiligo, respectively. In adult patients, treatment choice was guided by clinical type. Patients with only localized vitiligo could be treated with class 3 corticosteroids combined with UV-A therapy. If there is no response after 6 months, localized UV-B or topical PUVA therapy could be given as an alternative. Narrowband UV-B therapy was recommended as the most effective and safest therapy for generalized vitiligo. A minimum treatment duration of 6 months was recommended for narrowband UV-B therapy.

Responsive patients could be given this treatment for a maximum of 24 months. After the first course of 1 year, a resting period of 3 months was recommended to minimize the annual cumulative dose of UV-B. The therapy selected as the first choice for segmental, stable, or lip-tip vitiligo was autologous transplantation. In the NIPD, split-thickness skin grafting and minigrafting are performed on a routine basis for these conditions. For patients who do not desire a surgical intervention, alternatives may be considered.

Methods

Study design and participants

This was a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study performed at 33 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, France, and Japan. This 52-week study had a 35-day screening period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period (period 1), a 28-week blinded long-term extension period (period 2), and a 30-day follow-up period (Appendix Supplementary Figure S1).

Eligible patients were aged 18–65 years with non-segmental vitiligo and baseline scores of Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) ≥ 0.5 and Total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) ≥ 5. Patients with skin conditions that may interfere with the evaluation of vitiligo, those with uncontrolled thyroid disease, and patients with > 33% leukotrichia on the face or > 33% leukotrichia on the body (including face) were not eligible. Exclusionary prior therapies included any topical or systemic JAK inhibitor and permanent skin bleaching agents. A complete list of eligibility criteria is provided in the appendix (Supplementary Table S1).

Ethics

Independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each site approved the study protocol, informed consent forms, and recruitment materials before patient enrolment. This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference for Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki. To protect patients' confidentiality, all patients and their associated samples were assigned a numerical code; no identifiable information was provided to the sponsor. All patients provided written informed consent before screening.

All the uncertainties identified by the PSPs are added to the Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments (DUETs) in order to provide reference for funding bodies and researchers. It is known that the research funding bodies in the U.K. systematically scan important research resources to identify evidence gaps and make recommendations for research. This includes Cochrane systematic reviews and more recently DUETs.

DUETs has been established in the U.K. to publish uncertainties about the effects of treatment which cannot currently be answered by referring to reliable up-to-date systematic reviews of existing research evidence. A treatment uncertainty exists when 'no up-to-date systematic review exists, or up-to-date systematic reviews show that uncertainty continues', i.e. more research needs to be done to establish the effectiveness and safety of an existing or innovative intervention.

### Two phase 3, randomized, controlled trials of ruxolitinib cream for vitiligo [^8769aafe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes skin depigmentation. A cream formulation of ruxolitinib (an inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and 2) resulted in repigmentation in a phase 2 trial involving adults with vitiligo.

Methods

We conducted two phase 3, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (Topical Ruxolitinib Evaluation in Vitiligo Study 1 [TRuE-V1] and 2 [TRuE-V2]) in North America and Europe that involved patients 12 years of age or older who had nonsegmental vitiligo with depigmentation covering 10% or less of total body-surface area. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to apply 1.5% ruxolitinib cream or vehicle control twice daily for 24 weeks to all vitiligo areas on the face and body, after which all patients could apply 1.5% ruxolitinib cream through week 52. The primary end point was a decrease (improvement) of at least 75% from baseline in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI; range, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating a greater area of facial depigmentation), or F-VASI75 response, at week 24. There were five key secondary end points, including improved responses on the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale.

Results

A total of 674 patients were enrolled, 330 in TRuE-V1 and 344 in TRuE-V2. In TRuE-V1, the percentage of patients with an F-VASI75 response at week 24 was 29.8% in the ruxolitinib-cream group and 7.4% in the vehicle group (relative risk, 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 8.4; P < 0.001). In TRuE-V2, the percentages were 30.9% and 11.4%, respectively (relative risk, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.9; P < 0.001). The results for key secondary end points showed superiority of ruxolitinib cream over vehicle control. Among patients who applied ruxolitinib cream throughout 52 weeks, adverse events occurred in 54.8% in TRuE-V1 and 62.3% in TRuE-V2; the most common adverse events were application-site acne (6.3% and 6.6%, respectively), nasopharyngitis (5.4% and 6.1%), and application-site pruritus (5.4% and 5.3%).

Conclusions

In two phase 3 trials, application of ruxolitinib cream resulted in greater repigmentation of vitiligo lesions than vehicle control through 52 weeks, but it was associated with acne and pruritus at the application site. Larger and longer trials are required to determine the effect and safety of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo.

### Upadacitinib and its role in the treatment of vitiligo: a new possible therapeutic perspective [^e0af1cf1]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo, a chronic skin disorder characterized by the loss of melanocytes, affects approximately 0.5% to 2% of the global population. Despite its prevalence, the pathogenesis of vitiligo remains not completely understood. It is believed to be a complex disease involving genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and autoinflammatory responses leading to melanocyte destruction. The management of vitiligo has been a challenge because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the variable response to treatment. Traditional therapies have shown some efficacy but are often associated with side effects and inconsistent results.

Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying vitiligo have opened new avenues for treatment. Among these, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. JAKs are a family of tyrosine kinases that play a crucial role in the signaling of various cytokines and growth factors implicated in immune responses and inflammation. Dysregulation of JAK signaling pathways has been implicated in various autoinflammatory diseases. In the context of vitiligo, JAK1 has been found to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Upadacitinib, a second-generation JAK inhibitor highly selective for JAK1, is currently approved for the treatment of several immunological diseases, including atopic dermatitis. Until now, 1 case report has been published about the efficacy of upadacitinib in the treatment of vitiligo.

This is a retrospective unicentric case series where patients with nonsegmental vitiligo were treated with upadacitinib. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Vitiligo Extent Score (VES) from baseline to the time of follow-up, 12 or 24 weeks. In all cases, a basic blood test was conducted, and active infections were ruled out as indicated by the drug's technical data sheet.

Ten patients affected by nonsegmental vitiligo were treated with upadacitinib during a maximum of 24 weeks (Supplementary Table I, available via Mendeley at). Upadacitinib dose was 30 mg daily, with the exception of a 15-year-old patient who was prescribed 15 mg. Mean time of duration of the pathology was 13.7 years. Forty percent of the patients presented with comorbidities, predominantly of an autoinflammatory nature. Only 1 patient was receiving other adjuvant treatment (phototherapy) at the time of starting upadacitinib and none applied topical treatment with corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. No patient had a history of latent tuberculosis infection.

A rational approach to hypopigmented disorders needs a clear and widely accepted classification and meta-analysis of the literature to position the medical, physical, surgical, and combined treatments available in terms of safety and effectiveness profiles. Best available scientific evidence must be rationally adapted to the patient's expectations and to the clinical presentation of the hypopigmentary disease, to reach the most valid final results.

### Guideline for the diagnosis and management of vitiligo [^8982c243]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

This detailed and user-friendly guideline for the diagnosis and management of vitiligo in children and adults aims to give high quality clinical advice, based on the best available evidence and expert consensus, taking into account patient choice and clinical expertise. The guideline was devised by a structured process and is intended for use by dermatologists and as a resource for interested parties including patients. Recommendations and levels of evidence have been graded according to the method developed by the Scottish Inter-Collegiate Guidelines Network. Where evidence was lacking, research recommendations were made. The types of vitiligo, process of diagnosis in primary and secondary care, and investigation of vitiligo were assessed. Treatments considered include offering no treatment other than camouflage cosmetics and sunscreens, the use of topical potent or highly potent corticosteroids, of vitamin D analogues, and of topical calcineurin inhibitors, and depigmentation with p-(benzyloxy)phenol. The use of systemic treatment, e.g. corticosteroids, ciclosporin and other immunosuppressive agents was analyzed. Phototherapy was considered, including narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), psoralen with ultraviolet A (UVA), and khellin with UVA or UVB, along with combinations of topical preparations and various forms of UV. Surgical treatments that were assessed include full-thickness and split skin grafting, mini (punch) grafts, autologous epidermal cell suspensions, and autologous skin equivalents. The effectiveness of cognitive therapy and psychological treatments was considered. Therapeutic algorithms using grades of recommendation and levels of evidence have been produced for children and for adults with vitiligo.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^206865ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, two phase 3 studies (TruE-V1 and TruE-V2) of the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib topical cream demonstrated greater repigmentation of the skin compared with a vehicle control. At week 24, F-VASI 75 was reached by −29.8% (relative risk versus PBO was 4.0; 95% CI 1.9–8.4; p < 0.001) and 30.9% (relative risk versus PBO was 2.7; 95% CI 1.5–4.9; p < 0.001) and T-VASI 50 was reached by 20.6% (relative risk versus PBO was 4.1; 95% CI 1.6–10.5; p = 0.002) and 23.9% (relative risk versus PBO was 3.5; 95% CI 1.7–7.5; p < 0.001) of patients receiving ruxolitinib. However, those studies included exclusively patients with 10% or less of total body surface area depigmentation, and more than 70% of patients across treatment groups had stable disease at baseline. Patients with rapidly progressive or spreading vitiligo defined as a large number of either new lesions or enlargement of lesions within the past 3 months may require systemic agents to achieve disease control and/or improvement. Systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, have been used to treat widespread or active vitiligo; however, the risks of long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment should be fully considered before being implemented, and long-term safety and efficacy data are limited for azathioprine in patients with vitiligo. Findings from a phase 2b study of ritlecitinib, an oral JAK3/TEC inhibitor, demonstrated differences in the LS mean percent change from baseline in F-VASI at 24 weeks (50 mg without loading dose; −18.5 versus 2.1; p < 0.001) compared with PBO, however, a significant difference in the LS mean percent change from baseline in T-VASI was not demonstrated.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are associated with highest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating vitiligo?

Bottom Line

Combination therapies, particularly those involving some form of light (ie, narrowband UV-B) were associated with more improved repigmentation than monotherapies. There was limited evidence to support the association of UV-A alone and UV-B alone with repigmentation for vitiligo. There was moderate evidence to support the association of UV-A and UV-B, when used in combination with psoralens, topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, fluorouracil, azathioprine, and oral prednisolone with improved outcomes for vitiligo. However, combination therapies were associated with more adverse effects.

### FDA approves topical treatment… [^6c75c057]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Action FDA has approved Opzelura cream for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Opzelura is a topical Janus kinase inhibitor currently approved for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older, whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Opzelura is the first FDA-approved pharmacologic treatment to address repigmentation in vitiligo patients. Opzelura is applied twice a day to affected areas of up to 10% of the body's surface area. Satisfactory patient response may require treatment with Opzelura for more than 24 weeks. Disease or Condition Nonsegmental vitiligo is the most common form of vitiligo. The condition involves loss of pigment in patches of skin.

Depigmentation may occur on the face, neck, and scalp, and around body openings such as the mouth and genitals, as well as areas that tend to experience rubbing or impact, such as the hands and arms. Vitiligo is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In people with vitiligo, the immune system appears to attack the pigment cells in the skin. Many people with vitiligo are also affected by at least one other autoimmune disorder. Effectiveness Safety and effectiveness of Opzelura were demonstrated in two clinical trials, NCT04052425 and NCT04057573. In both trials, subjects with nonsegmental vitiligo were randomized to treatment with Opzelura or placebo cream twice daily for 24 weeks, followed by an additional 28 weeks of treatment with Opzelura for all subjects. At the end of the 24-week treatment period, 30% of Opzelura patients had at least 75% improvement in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index, compared with 10% of placebo patients.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^4476f6a7]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of patients with extensive (mean T-VASI of 21.53) non-segmental vitiligo, the primary endpoint of change from baseline in F-VASI at week 24 was achieved by UPA11 and UPA22 dose levels, but not by UPA6. Substantial improvements and clinically meaningful differences with upadacitinib treatment compared with PBO were also observed for most secondary endpoints including the percent change from baseline in T-VASI at week 24. Vitiligo repigmentation is known to require considerable duration of treatment, particularly among patients with active and/or more extensive disease. Thus, improvement in F-VASI and T-VASI at week 24 is notable. The change from baseline in VitiQoL total score did not reveal clinically meaningful difference between groups at week 24. In general, response rates and clinical improvements were highest with UPA22. Treatment with upadacitinib continued to induce progressive improvement in skin repigmentation based on the percentage of patients achieving F-VASI 75 and T-VASI 50 at week 52. The observed improvement in skin repigmentation, as assessed using the continuous measures of LS mean percent change from baseline in F-VASI and T-VASI, as well as the categorical endpoints of F-VASI 75 and T-VASI 50, did not reach a plateau through week 52. Importantly, patient-centric findings showed that the improvement in the clinical scores translated into patient-reported improvement as well. Clinically meaningful improvements were reported at 24 weeks on the VNS by patients who received UPA22 and indicated their vitiligo as either "a lot less noticeable (4)" or "no longer noticeable (5)." A VNS score of 4 or 5 has been suggested to be a successful treatment response. Furthermore, most patients indicated their vitiligo was "much better (1)" or "a little better (2)" based on the Patient's GIC-V, suggesting the improvement induced by upadacitinib was clinically meaningful. Taken together, these data demonstrate substantial differences with UPA11 and UPA22 dose levels compared with PBO in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo and provide insights to the utility of oral JAK inhibitors in the systemic treatment of vitiligo.

### Randomized, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of topical tacalcitol and sunlight exposure in the treatment of adult nonsegmental vitiligo [^f5c9ccee]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is a common skin disease which is difficult to treat. Approximately half of patients acquire the disease before the age of 20 years. This disease has a high stigmatizing impact but no ideal, aetiology-oriented, effective therapy has been found to date. Tacalcitol and other vitamin D analogues have been shown to have stimulating activity both on immunomodulatory mediators and on melanocytes in lesional skin.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of tacalcitol ointment plus sunlight exposure in the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo.

Methods

A single-centre, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study including 80 patients with nonsegmental vitiligo was carried out in a specialized outpatient dermatology clinic within a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Spain. Efficacy was assessed by quantification of the lesional repigmentation area at the end of the study compared with the baseline. Tacalcitol (n = 40) or matching placebo ointment (n = 40) was applied once a day at night. Daily exposure to sunlight for 30 min was performed. Treatment was continued for 4 months. The response of the lesions was clinically verified every 2 weeks by a blinded medical investigator. All adverse effects were recorded.

Results

Eighty adult patients with nonsegmental vitiligo were recruited. Over 16 weeks, 64 patients completed the study requirements. There was no significant difference in the repigmentation response at the 16-week time point between the vehicle + sunlight exposure and the tacalcitol + sunlight exposure groups. No reduction in the size of the lesions > 25% was observed in the tacalcitol-treated patients. No serious adverse effects were observed.

Conclusion

The combination of tacalcitol with heliotherapy has no additional advantages compared with heliotherapy alone.

### Once-daily upadacitinib versus placebo in adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo: a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study [^aa831f0b]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Before the approval of topical ruxolitinib, there were no approved repigmenting therapies for vitiligo; conventional treatment generally includes topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, oral corticosteroids, and systemic immunosuppressants. However, all available treatments have limitations. Topical ruxolitinib can only be applied to less than 10% of the body surface area. Patients with extensive, active, and/or rapidly progressing vitiligo depigmentation may require systemic treatment.

Skin depigmentation associated with vitiligo is thought to involve melanocyte-specific CD8+ T cells infiltrating the affected skin, leading to loss of melanocytes. When melanocyte-reactive CD8+ T cells encounter a melanocyte antigen, they produce interferon gamma, which stimulates keratinocytes to express CXCL9 and CXCL10. These chemokines bind to the CXCR3 receptor of melanocyte-reactive CD8+ T cells and recruit these cytotoxic T cells to the skin. The melanocyte-reactive CD8+ T cells produce more interferon gamma, which causes melanocyte destruction through the production of cytotoxic enzymes. Vitiligo disease progression occurs via this positive-feedback loop of T-cell recruitment leading to continual loss of melanocytes. Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that assist with cytokine-mediated signal transduction through the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. This pathway is activated by interferon gamma and is involved in many immune-related disorders, including vitiligo.JAK inhibition is a promising approach for the treatment of vitiligo as it disrupts the process of immune-mediated melanocyte apoptosis.

Upadacitinib (RINVOQ; AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, IL, USA) is an oral, small-molecule, reversible JAK inhibitor that has greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 than for JAK2, JAK3, or tyrosine kinase 2. Upadacitinib is approved for the treatment of several immune-mediated diseases including atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.

Here, we report the primary results through week 52 from a phase 2 dose-ranging study of upadacitinib monotherapy, which aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib for the treatment of adults with extensive non-segmental vitiligo.

Clinicians should be aware that vitiligo is not merely a cosmetic disease and that there are safe and effective treatments available for vitiligo. It is important to recognize common and uncommon presentations and those with active disease, as well as their implications for clinical management; these were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. Existing treatments include topical and systemic immunosuppressants, phototherapy, and surgical techniques, which together may serve to halt disease progression, stabilize depigmented lesions, and encourage repigmentation. We discuss how to optimize the currently available treatments and highlight emerging treatments that may improve treatment efficacy in the future.

### Real-world use of ruxolitinib cream: safety analysis at 1 year [^9d6b8300]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can have considerable impact on quality of life. AD is highly pruritic with underlying skin defects, and prevalence in adults varies geographically, ranging from 1 to 8%. In vitiligo, autoimmune pathways target melanocytes, which results in depigmentation. The prevalence of vitiligo also varies geographically, ranging from 0.5 to 2% in adults. Topical treatments such as corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors are typically used as treatment for both AD and vitiligo; however, these treatments are off-label for vitiligo, and in both diseases, adherence to treatment may be low due to concerns about adverse events (AEs) and limited efficacy.

Janus kinases (JAKs) are intracellular signaling enzymes that are implicated in the disease pathogenesis of both AD and vitiligo. Ruxolitinib cream is a topical formulation of ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2. In 2021, ruxolitinib cream became the first approved topical JAK inhibitor in the United States (US) for the treatment of mild to moderate AD after phase III studies demonstrated improvements in AD-related signs and symptoms, including itch. Just under a year later, ruxolitinib cream became the first agent to be approved for repigmentation in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo after phase III studies demonstrated substantial repigmentation over 52 weeks.

### Evidence-based management of vitiligo: summary of a cochrane systematic review [^7c8bda45]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitiligo affects around 1% of the world's population. Despite it being relatively common, there is still no effective treatment. The objective of this study was to update the Cochrane systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for vitiligo. We carried out searches of a range of databases to October 2013 for RCTs of interventions for vitiligo regardless of language or publication status. At least two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data using data extraction forms approved by the Cochrane Skin Group. Our primary outcomes of interest were quality of life, > 75% repigmentation and adverse effects. We retrieved 96 studies, of which 39 were new studies, with an overall total of 4512 participants. Repigmentation was assessed in all studies, although only five reported on all three of our primary outcomes. Regarding our two secondary outcomes, six studies measured cessation of spread but none assessed long-term permanence of repigmentation at 2 years' follow-up. Most of the studies evaluated combination treatments, which generally showed better repigmentation than monotherapies. Of the new studies, seven were surgical interventions. The majority of the studies had fewer than 50 participants. The quality of the studies was poor to moderate at best. Very few studies specifically included children or participants with segmental vitiligo. Five years after the last update of this review, there are still important variations in study design and outcome measures in clinical trials for vitiligo, limiting the evidence for the efficacy of different therapeutic options. The best evidence from individual trials showed short-term benefit from topical corticosteroids and various forms of ultraviolet radiation combined with topical preparations. Long-term follow-up and patient-rated outcomes should be incorporated into study design, and more studies should assess psychological interventions.

### Response to ritlecitinib with or without narrow-band ultraviolet B add-on therapy in patients with active nonsegmental vitiligo: results from a phase 2b extension study [^b71f2bed]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ritlecitinib demonstrated efficacy in a phase 2b trial of nonsegmental vitiligo.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ritlecitinib with add-on narrow-band ultraviolet B (nbUVB) phototherapy in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo.

Methods

Following a 24-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging period, patients received ritlecitinib 200 mg for 4 weeks then 50 mg for 20 weeks, with or without nbUVB phototherapy 2x/week. Missing data were handled using last observation carried forward and observed case (OC).

Results

Forty-three patients received ritlecitinib + nbUVB and 187 received ritlecitinib-monotherapy. Nine patients receiving ritlecitinib + nbUVB discontinued due to nbUVB group-specific efficacy criteria requiring > 10% improvement in % change from baseline (% change from baseline) in Total-Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at week 12. At week 24, mean % change from baseline in Facial-VASI score was -57.0 vs -51.5 (last observation carried forward; P = 0.158) and -69.6 vs -55.1 (OC; P = 0.009), for ritlecitinib + nbUVB vs ritlecitinib-monotherapy, respectively. Mean % change from baseline in Total-Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at week 24 was -29.4 vs -21.2 (last observation carried forward; P = 0.043) and -46.8 vs -24.5 (OC; P < .001), respectively. nbUVB addition to ritlecitinib was well tolerated with no new safety signals.

Limitations

Exploratory analysis; discontinuation criterion applied only to the ritlecitinib + nbUVB group; small sample size.

Conclusion

Ritlecitinib alone and with nbUVB therapy improved facial and total body repigmentation and was well tolerated. Adding nbUVB may improve ritlecitinib efficacy.

### Future research into the treatment of vitiligo: where should our priorities lie? Results of the vitiligo priority setting partnership [^7e24ea75]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

To conclude, we wish to note that by recommending the above we are not commenting on the legitimacy of the interventions that have been prioritized, but are reporting what clinicians and patients identified as important research topics in order to meet their needs.

Reflections on the process

One might argue that the response rate for the vitiligo PSP was rather low (consultation stage response rate 20%); however, the number of participants by far exceeded our expectations based on previous PSPs convened by the JLA. This was due mainly to our collaboration and networking with the UK DCTN and the Vitiligo Society. We believe that the innovative and unusual nature of this project means that it is inappropriate to apply the same criteria for the response rate of this PSP as for other surveys. Indeed, the vitiligo PSP far exceeded our original sample size estimates for the number of participants at each stage, and had approximately double the number of participants who took part in previous PSPs.

In order to inform future PSPs, it is helpful to present some of the key challenges that we faced as two recommendations.

Recommendation 1. We recommend that information about the existing research evidence for the different treatments is presented in a patient-friendly format at the beginning of the PSP. This would allow all participants to engage in the process more effectively, regardless of their background, experience or levels of expertise.
Recommendation 2. Most of the uncertainties (during consultation) were broad and nonspecific, or did not specify the comparator, the duration of treatment or the population, when others from the research community were very focused. For that reason, we recommend keeping the uncertainties as broad as possible to allow flexibility but sufficiently narrow to ensure the question is meaningful. Therefore we have developed a standard format for different types of questions submitted (Table 2).

Table 2
Structure used to refine the questions into indicative uncertainties

Implementation of the results

The next step of our research group is to conduct a feasibility study on one of the top 10 uncertainties by working with the UK DCTN.

We are hopeful that by publishing this list of important treatment uncertainties, we will prompt other research groups and pharmaceutical companies to take a fresh look at vitiligo research and the needs of patients with vitiligo and to bring unity to the international efforts into the treatment of vitiligo.

Finally, we would recommend that researchers continue to work with patients and clinicians in meaningful partnerships in developing their future research activity, in line with current guidelines.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^b8fd1283]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitiligo causes depigmented patches of skin and can have a considerable impact on quality of life. Two of the most commonly used vitiligo treatments are topical corticosteroid (TCS) and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB‐UVB)., In the UK, people have mixed experiences of obtaining treatments for vitiligo, including TCS.NB‐UVB treatment is reserved for people with extensive vitiligo, and is administered using whole‐body cabinets in hospital settings. Provision of home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB devices is rare outside a small number of specialist centres.,

The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial, was a three‐arm, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving children (age ≥ 5 years) and adults with vitiligo limited to approximately 10% or less of the body and at least one active patch of vitiligo. Recruitment took place in 16 UK hospitals. Participants were randomized to receive potent TCS plus dummy NB‐UVB, handheld NB‐UVB plus dummy TCS, or a combination of potent TCS plus NB‐UVB. TCS (or dummy) was applied once daily on alternate weeks. NB‐UVB (or dummy) was used on alternate days, with dose adjustment if erythema occurred. Treatments were used for 9 months, with 3‐monthly clinic assessments, followed by 12 months of post‐treatment follow‐up to assess duration of treatment response.

### Future horizons in vitiligo research: focusing on the recommendations of the cochrane systematic review' interventions for vitiligo' 2010 [^c02af21a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The 'Implications for research' section of the Cochrane systematic review, 'Interventions for vitiligo', published in 2010, highlighted three main issues that impact the standard of vitiligo research: (i) lack of consensus on the classification and definition of vitiligo; (ii) lack of consensus on the methods of assessment and outcome measures for vitiligo; and (iii) heterogeneity of interventions compared. This article provides an update of the progress made to resolve these issues since the publication of the Cochrane systematic review in 2010, 'Interventions for vitiligo'.

### Evidence-based, non-surgical treatments for vitiligo: a review [^17cc57e7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder characterized by depigmented macules and patches secondary to the loss of functional melanocytes. It is a chronic disease that affects between 0.1% and 2% of the general population, affecting both sexes and all races. The appearance and the unpredictable course are psychologically and socially devastating. The success of current therapeutic options is limited. The objective of this review was to assess non-surgical treatments of vitiligo and to determine if comparing these studies can lead to (1) practical applications in the clinical setting and (2) recommendations for future research including study design and topics to be investigated further. Combination therapies were found to be more effective than monotherapy, and most combinations included a form of phototherapy, of which narrow-band-UVB was found to be most effective with the least adverse effects. Topical treatment with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, vitamin D analogs, and psoralens had mixed outcomes. Oral therapies including antioxidants were helpful adjuvants to treatment. Studies lacked consistent design, mechanism of disease assessment, and long-term follow-up. Sample size was also frequently limited. This review found that while several non-surgical therapies exist for the treatment of vitiligo, their usefulness, especially in the long term, is not well understood. Those studies that were able to elicit repigmentation often lacked an assessment on quality of life and/or patient satisfaction. More standardized methods of study design and assessment are needed to compare outcomes and make definitive conclusions on treatment effectiveness.

### The vitiligo working group recommendations for narrowband ultraviolet B light phototherapy treatment of vitiligo [^d3a7f5b4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of vitiligo with narrowband ultraviolet B light (NBUVB) is an important component of the current standard of care. However, there are no consistent guidelines regarding the dosing and administration of NBUVB in vitiligo, reflected by varied treatment practices around the world.

Objective

To create phototherapy recommendations to facilitate clinical management and identify areas requiring future research.

Methods

The Vitiligo Working Group (VWG) Phototherapy Committee addressed 19 questions regarding the administration of phototherapy over 3 conference calls. Members of the Photomedicine Society and a group of phototherapy experts were surveyed regarding their phototherapy practices.

Results

Based on comparison and analysis of survey results, expert opinion, and discussion held during conference calls, expert recommendations for the administration of NBUVB phototherapy in vitiligo were created.

Limitations

There were several areas that required further research before final recommendations could be made. In addition, no standardized methodology was used during literature review and to assess the strength of evidence during the development of these recommendations.

Conclusion

This set of expert recommendations by the VWG is based on the prescribing practices of phototherapy experts from around the world to create a unified, broadly applicable set of recommendations on the use of NBUVB in vitiligo.

### Efficacy and safety of Janus kinase inhibitors in patients with vitiligo: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e20f0b5c]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations to our study. First, as previously discussed, we were unable to evaluate the long‐term efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors because of the lack of a comparison group. Second, we could not compare JAK inhibitors with other therapies because different measurement methods were used to assess vitiligo in other studies. Third, the pooled results of our study showed some deviations because we did not distinguish among the different dose groups. Fourth, we excluded studies, including case reports and case series, which could have demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of JAK inhibitors in the real world. However, these excluded studies would have limited our ability to discern whether any outcomes resulted from the intervention because of a lack of comparators and sufficient sample sizes.

In conclusion, this meta‐analysis supports the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in patients with vitiligo and elucidates their differences in terms of selectivity and route of administration, which may influence therapeutic decisions for vitiligo in the future. Larger and longer duration trials are required to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of vitiligo.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in Japan [^d2aa471a]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired pigment disorder in which depigmented macules result from the loss of melanocytes from the involved regions of skin and hair. The color dissimilarity on the cosmetically sensitive regions frequently induces quality of life impairment and high willingness to pay for treatment in patients with vitiligo. The Vitiligo Japanese Task Force was organized to overcome this situation and to cooperate with the Vitiligo Global Issues Consensus Conference. This guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in Japan is proposed to improve the circumstances of Japanese individuals with vitiligo. Its contents include information regarding the diagnosis, pathogenesis, evaluation of disease severity and effectiveness of treatment, and evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of vitiligo. The therapeutic algorithm based on the proposed recommendation is designed to cure and improve the affected lesions and quality of life of individuals with vitiligo.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THIS TOPIC?

There is a dearth of high‐quality evidence regarding Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor monotherapy in patients with vitiligo. Further, little is known about the factors that influence the efficacy and safety outcomes of JAK inhibitors, including selectivity (type of JAK inhibitor) and route of administration.
WHAT QUESTION DOES THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in patients with vitiligo through a comprehensive meta‐analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

This meta‐analysis provides robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of JAK inhibitors in repigmentation and their safety in patients with vitiligo. In addition, JAK1 and JAK1/2 inhibitors are more effective than JAK3 inhibitors, but with lower safety. However, there is insufficient evidence suggesting differences in the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic JAK inhibitors for vitiligo.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

These findings shed light on the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors and further elucidate their differences in terms of selectivity and route of administration, which may influence therapeutic decisions for patients with vitiligo in the future.

### Future research into the treatment of vitiligo: where should our priorities lie? Results of the vitiligo priority setting partnership [^e13f0ad9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Stages 2 and 3: Consultation and collation

Of the 2303 surveys circulated, 461 (20%) were returned. This resulted in 1427 questions about vitiligo. Non-treatment questions (n = 767), about the natural history of vitiligo, its aetiology and prevention, were excluded.

The response rate for members of the Vitiligo Society was 24% (307/1268) and for BAD/UK DCTN members was 14% (119/835). Sixty-six per cent of responses (302/461) were from patients, 31% (142/461) were from healthcare professionals, and 3% were from other sources. More women responded than men (53% women, 30% men, 17% did not specify), and most were aged 30–60 years (8% < 30 years, 50% 30–60 years, 25% > 60 years, 17% did not specify).

Overall, 660 uncertainties that specifically related to the treatment of vitiligo were gathered during the consultation stage. Thirty-one per cent were from healthcare professionals (206/660), 48·5% were from patients (320/660) and 20·5% were unknown (134/660). An additional 58 treatment uncertainties were identified from the BAD guideline and the updated Cochrane systematic review. The resulting 718 uncertainties were refined into a 'long-list' of 93 treatment uncertainties, which were used for the ranking exercise.

### Future research into the treatment of vitiligo: where should our priorities lie? Results of the vitiligo priority setting partnership [^25a38651]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is the most frequent depigmentation disorder of the skin and is cosmetically and psychologically devastating. A recently updated Cochrane systematic review 'Interventions for vitiligo' showed that the research evidence for treatment of vitiligo is poor, making it difficult to make firm recommendations for clinical practice.

Objectives

To stimulate and steer future research in the field of vitiligo treatment, by identifying the 10 most important research areas for patients and clinicians.

Methods

A vitiligo priority setting partnership was established including patients, healthcare professionals and researchers with an interest in vitiligo. Vitiligo treatment uncertainties were gathered from patients and clinicians, and then prioritized in a transparent process, using a methodology advocated by the James Lind Alliance.

Results

In total, 660 treatment uncertainties were submitted by 461 participants. These were reduced to a list of the 23 most popular topics through an online/paper voting process. The 23 were then prioritized at a face-to-face workshop in London. The final list of the top 10 treatment uncertainties included interventions such as systemic immunosuppressants, topical treatments, light therapy, melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogues, gene therapy, and the impact of psychological interventions on the quality of life of patients with vitiligo.

Conclusions

The top 10 research areas for the treatment of vitiligo provide guidance for researchers and funding bodies, to ensure that future research answers questions that are important both to clinicians and to patients.

### Case series of topical 1.5% ruxolitinib cream for pediatric vitiligo [^2e77bf4f]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric vitiligo affects 1.52% of 4 to 11-year-olds and 2.16% of 12 to 17-year-olds within the United States, with nonsegmental vitiligo (NSV) affecting 65% and 69%, respectively, and the residuum segmental vitiligo (SV). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved topical 1.5% ruxolitinib cream for NSV affecting 10% of body surface area or less for 12 years of age or older. Although the TRuEV-1 and TRuEV-2 trials included children as young as 12 years, the data for the subset of children was not separately analyzed in publication. Furthermore, there is no FDA-approved topical agent for SV in any age group. We sought to characterize the efficacy of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream for pediatric vitiligo.

### Interventions for vitiligo [^d37df298]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder characterised by patchy loss of skin colour. Some people experience itching before the appearance of a new patch. It affects people of any age or ethnicity, more than half of whom develop it before the age of 20 years. There are two main types: generalised vitiligo, the common symmetrical form, and segmental, affecting only one side of the body. Around 1% of the world's population has vitiligo, a disease causing white patches on the skin. Several treatments are available. Some can restore pigment but none can cure the disease.

Objectives

To assess the effects of all therapeutic interventions used in the management of vitiligo.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 10), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of treatments for vitiligo.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data.

Main Results

This update of the 2010 review includes 96 studies, 57 from the previous update and 39 new studies, totalling 4512 participants. Most of the studies, covering a wide range of interventions, had fewer than 50 participants. All of the studies assessed repigmentation, however only five reported on all of our three primary outcomes which were quality of life, > 75% repigmentation and adverse effects. Of our secondary outcomes, six studies measured cessation of spread but none assessed long-term permanence of repigmentation resulting from treatment at two years follow-up. Most of the studies assessed combination therapies which generally reported better results. New interventions include seven new surgical interventions. We analysed the data from 25 studies which assessed our primary outcomes. We used the effect measures risk ratio (RR), and odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and where N is the number of participants in the study. We were only able to analyse one of nine studies assessing quality of life and this showed no statistically significant improvement between the comparators. Nine analyses from eight studies reported > 75% repigmentation. In the following studies the repigmentation was better in the combination therapy group: calcipotriol plus PUVA (psoralen with UVA light) versus PUVA (paired OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.43 to 12.64, one study, N = 27); hydrocortisone-17-butyrate plus excimer laser versus excimer laser alone (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.50, one study, N = 84); oral minipulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB-UVB (narrowband UVB) versus OMP alone (RR 7.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 53.26, one study, N = 47); azathioprine with PUVA versus PUVA alone (RR 17.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 291.82, one study, N = 58) and 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) plus sunlight versus psoralen (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.91, one study, N = 168). In these three studies ginkgo biloba was better than placebo (RR 4.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 17.95, one study, N = 47); clobetasol propionate was better than PUVAsol (PUVA with sunlight) (RR 4.70, 95% CI 1.14 to 19.39, one study, N = 45); split skin grafts with PUVAsol was better than minipunch grafts with PUVAsol (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.85, one study, N = 64). We performed one meta-analysis of three studies, in which we found a non-significant 60% increase in the proportion of participants achieving > 75% repigmentation in favour of NB-UVB compared to PUVA (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.45; I² = 0%). Studies assessing topical preparations, in particular topical corticosteroids, reported most adverse effects. However, in combination studies it was difficult to ascertain which treatment caused these effects. We performed two analyses from a pooled analysis of three studies on adverse effects. Where NB-UVB was compared to PUVA, the NB-UVB group reported less observations of nausea in three studies (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.69; I² = 0% three studies, N = 156) and erythema in two studies (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; I² = 0%, two studies, N = 106), but not itching in two studies (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.60; I² = 0%, two studies, N = 106). Very few studies only assessed children or included segmental vitiligo. We found one study of psychological interventions but we could not include the outcomes in our statistical analyses. We found no studies evaluating micropigmentation, depigmentation, or cosmetic camouflage.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found some evidence from individual studies to support existing therapies for vitiligo, but the usefulness of the findings is limited by the different designs and outcome measurements and lack of quality of life measures. There is a need for follow-up studies to assess permanence of repigmentation as well as high- quality randomised trials using standardised measures and which also address quality of life.

### Multicentre, prospective, observational clinical registry of paediatric and adult patients with vitiligo on phototherapy, or novel topical or systemic immunomodulatory therapies [^42b08c91]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder affecting around 1% of the population worldwide. Currently, no national or international registry for patients with vitiligo exists. Individual dermatologists maintain a descriptive database of such patients, which involves patients in one centre. In addition, such single centre registries do not aim to establish short- and long-term safety (pharmacovigilance) and effectiveness of vitiligo therapies. As an initial step for the development of a national UK registry for vitiligo patients, development of a pilot multi-centred registry in the UK is needed. This pilot study is being developed in collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD). VIRTUAL-UK (VItiligo RegisTry for adUlts And children) assesses treatment effectiveness and safety as well as treatment impact on quality of life in children and adults with vitiligo, who receive phototherapy, novel topical and/or systemic immuno-modulatory therapies. Such a registry will ultimately inform treatment guidelines, provide pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic research data, help answer questions on skin cancer risk for vitiligo patients who receive prolonged phototherapy courses, especially regarding high cumulative exposures in children with less deeply pigmented skin, and help to identify those patients likely to experience rapid disease progression, ultimately improving and personalising patient care. With novel topical and oral immunomodulatory therapies having just entering vitiligo clinical practice, the timing is ideal to harness the high-quality data collection offered by the UK NHS.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^f6dd0d7f]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonsegmental Vitiligo In two double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, 449 adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with nonsegmental vitiligo were treated with OPZELURA twice daily for 24 weeks. In the OPZELURA group, 55% of subjects were females, and 81% of subjects were White, 5% were Black, and 4% were Asian. The safety and effectiveness of OPZELURA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years of age. Use of OPZELURA in this age group is supported by evidence from TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2, which included 55 pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years with nonsegmental vitiligo. No clinically meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between adult and pediatric subjects. Of the 831 total subjects enrolled with nonsegmental vitiligo in clinical trials with OPZELURA, 65 were 65 years of age and older. Clinical trials of OPZELURA in subjects with nonsegmental vitiligo did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In adolescent subjects with atopic dermatitis, the mean ± SD Cmax and AUC0–12 for ruxolitinib on Day 1 were 110 ± 255 nM and 801 ± 2019 h*nM, respectively. Drug Interactions Clinical Studies Drug interaction studies with OPZELURA have not been conducted. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. In both trials, subjects were randomized 2: 2: 1 to treatment with OPZELURA, ruxolitinib cream, 0. 75%, or vehicle cream twice daily for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects at week 8 achieving IGA treatment success defined as a score of 0 or 1 with ≥ 2 grade improvement from baseline. Efficacy was also assessed using a ≥ 4-point improvement in Itch NRS.

### Simvastatin and non-segmental vitiligo: a new potential treatment option? [^9aa70733]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a paucity of data about the impact of systemic statins on vitiliginous lesions in non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) patients. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have considered the correlation between lipid disturbances in vitiligo and vitiligo disease activity (VIDA) score. We sought in this study to evaluate the influence of simvastatin on vitiliginous lesions in NSV patients with dyslipidemia and study the correlation between VIDA score and lipid profile. This clinical trial started with 120 patients with NSV, 79 patients had dyslipidemia and received simvastatin 80mg daily (till normalization of lipid profile or for 4 months, which came first) and only 63 patients continued till the end of the study. Lipid profile, vitiligo area severity index and VIDA were assessed before and 6 months after the end of simvastatin use. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein, and LDL/HDL ratio showed statistically significant increases in the NSV than in the control group (p ˂ 0.001). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between VIDA and serum levels of TC and LDL and with LDL/HDL ratio. Simvastatin significantly improved the lipid profile and significantly decreased VIDA (p < 0.011). Negative moderate correlation was found between the decrease in VIDA and duration of disease (r = -0.562, p < 0.001). Simvastatin 80mg daily could be a helpful treatment for NSV patients with dyslipidemia, controlling the vitiligo activity and protecting against the hazardous effects of dyslipidemia. Better results can be obtained in patients with short duration of the disease.

### Clinical patterns of vitiligo in Japan: a descriptive study using the JMDC claims database [^b9108065]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The management recommendations for vitiligo endorsed by the International Vitiligo Task Force in 2023 underscore the importance of shared decision‐making and delineate specific treatment goals and modalities that aim to halt disease progression, stabilize depigmented lesions, and promote repigmentation. Topical treatment, phototherapy, or systemic treatment is suggested for active vitiligo, while maintenance treatment is recommended for stable vitiligo to prevent flares. Surgical techniques are reserved for vitiligo stable for at least 12 months without treatment. The guidelines from the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA), last published in 2013, recommend topical corticosteroids (TCS) as first‐line therapy for mild or moderate vitiligo present on 10%–20% of the body surface area.

Due to outdated JDA guidelines and a lack of comprehensive, up‐to‐date, epidemiologic data on vitiligo in Japan, including sparse prevalence estimates and insufficient quantitative analyses of comorbidities and treatment patterns, there is a critical need for current evidence‐based insights to refine therapeutic strategies. To address these gaps and understand clinical needs, we conducted a real‐world study using data from a claims database to evaluate the prevalence of vitiligo, patient demographics, treatment patterns, and comorbidities in Japanese patients over a 13‐year period.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^73a5afc5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

These reflect the most common reasons motivating participation in the HI‐Light Trial. Some participants hoped that it would bring them access to new treatments for themselves or their children, while some subsequently hoped for complete remission and others hoped that their disease would stop spreading. For a minority of participants there was a sense of 'nothing to lose':
Adult participant 5: '… had hoped it would totally recover the nine months or earlier you know, the sort of blemishes would disappear'.Adult participant 4: ' I decided to take part because why not, it would be working on my skin or not but I just decided to take part to see what happened'.
It is not appropriate for all

However, neither the online survey respondents nor participants in the site investigator focus group indicated that combination treatment would be appropriate for all people.

Site investigators described how personal circumstances, such as mental health issues, other health problems or significant caring responsibilities (e.g. multiple children), might affect an individual's ability to follow a complex treatment regimen. They also said that people with unrealistic expectations of treatment response (e.g. rapid and dramatic improvements) might be less suitable candidates for combination treatment, as they might ignore the treatment regimen to accelerate improvements:
Site investigator focus group: Nurse 10: 'It would be great if people did comply, and if it could be monitored. But, then not so great if people are not complying and using it as and when. That's my reservation'.
Similarly, trial participants expressed the opinion that where improvement did not match expectations, an individual might prematurely cease treatment. Some of those trial participants allocated the dummy NB‐UVB phototherapy described their frustrations:
Adult participant 1: ' I think I only really found it onerous because I was just convinced it was a dummy, and I just felt as if I was… wasting [20 minutes] basically because I thought this was not going to be any good at all'.Adolescent participant 2: '… as soon as I realised that it wasn't even tanning my skin I just, it was really hard to continue because it was really time consuming'.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^052647f6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The trial demonstrated that for people with active, limited vitiligo, combination treatment with potent TCS and home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB offers a better treatment response than potent TCS alone. It also demonstrated that combination treatment offers better value for money than NB‐UVB or potent TCS used in isolation in the treatment of active, limited vitiligo.

However, there are uncertainties in how best to implement this treatment combination in clinical practice. The benefits of this treatment combination (home‐based treatment, which reduces hospital visits; localized treatment, which minimizes exposure of unaffected skin to NB‐UVB) may need to be balanced against safety concerns, the complexities of combining treatment regimens, and the practicalities of testing and providing equipment within existing care pathways.

Here we report summary findings of a process evaluation nested within the HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial. Evaluating the opinions of stakeholders [people with vitiligo, parents of children with vitiligo, health service commissioners, healthcare professionals (HCPs)] we addressed three specific questions: (i) Can combination treatment be used safely and effectively by people with vitiligo?; (ii) Should combination treatment be made available as routine clinical care?; and (iii) Can combination treatment be integrated within current healthcare provision?

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^e47441d2]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the process of running the HI‐Light Trial, we developed various resources that can be used to support delivery of a home‐based phototherapy service using handheld devices, including a training video, a dosing schedule and treatment diary/handbook, and instructions on how to measure minimal erythema dose.

The strengths of the study were that it was a comprehensive process evaluation, drawing upon the experiences of participants who received TCS plus NB‐UVB combination treatment for vitiligo, those who delivered the treatment and those who might commission it in the future. The findings complement the clinical and economic assessments reported elsewhere, and provide an important context to inform future service development and delivery. Regarding limitations, we acknowledge that centres and participants were to some extent self‐selecting and that qualitative data analysis is in part an interpretative (rather than objective) process. Although we tried to avoid bias by including trial participants with both 'successful' and 'unsuccessful' treatment outcomes, all had continued treatment for the full 9‐month period and so their views may not have been fully representative. Further research with other patients, HCPs or a larger sample of commissioners may have yielded different findings.

### Effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib combined with narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy for patients with refractory vitiligo in real-world clinical practice [^51ce74d4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo is a chronic treatment-resistant autoimmune disorder characterized by circumscribed depigmented maculae. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib combined with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy for refractory nonsegmental vitiligo. Fifteen patients with nonsegmental vitiligo resistant to conventional therapies were administered oral tofacitinib at 5 mg twice daily plus topical halometasone cream, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, or pimecrolimus cream twice daily and NB-UVB three times per week for 16weeks. The control group comprised 19 patients with nonsegmental vitiligo treated with topical drugs plus NB-UVB same as the combination group. Treatment efficacy was measured by the percentage of repigmentation of vitiligo lesions at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th week after beginning treatment. From 8th week, the repigmentation level was significantly higher in the combination group than in the controls. From fourth week, the response rate was significantly higher in the combination group than in the controls. Only one patient in the combination group reported mild pain in the hand and foot joints, but the pain subsided with cessation of therapy. No other severe adverse effects occurred. So, tofacitinib in combination with NB-UVB phototherapy may be an effective and safe alternative modality for refractory vitiligo.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^fbbcb57d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the combination treatment of TCS plus NB‐UVB is relatively complex to manage and will not be suitable for all patients, we found that, in the absence of other treatment options, people with vitiligo and HCPs were positive about its potential. Given the economic challenges of commissioning new services, a 'mixed economy' model of provision (where people with vitiligo purchase or hire devices) may be worth considering, although this would need to be explored in more detail, by directly asking people with vitiligo about their likely willingness to pay in such a model. Regardless of how the NB‐UVB devices might be provided, concerns regarding the safe use of TCS and NB‐UVB mean that training, monitoring and ongoing support to those using combination treatment are essential. The need for medical physics support may mean that a regional service is more practical than a local one.

Complexity in combining treatments

Although easy to manage individually, some site investigators were concerned that the complexity of managing two treatments in combination could be challenging for the people using them. Increasing or decreasing the NB‐UVB dose (as part of the treatment protocol or in response to erythema) seemed to confuse and cause difficulties for certain trial participants. Some site investigators were concerned that some individuals never fully understood the process of incremental dose change.
Site investigator focus group: Nurse 1: 'I think they struggled with the alternate days, I think they forgot about it, sometimes it didn't fit, they skipped a day if they had work commitments. It [the combination of treatments] complicated it terribly was the impression that I got… '
Nurse 2: ' You can see that in their diaries, you can see the confusion, lots of crossings out… so confusing'.
Data presented by trial participants suggested that this assessment was accurate for some:

Vitiligo is a common disorder with a severe impact on quality of life. The authors review recent advances in phototherapy for vitiligo focusing on narrowband ultraviolet B including mechanisms, treatment recommendations, and combination therapies. Phototherapy is the first-line treatment of choice for vitiligo with narrowband UVB preferred for widespread vitiligo and excimer used for localized lesions. However, unfamiliarity with prescribing phototherapy may be limiting clinicians from using it to its full potential. This article provides clinicians with the critical information needed to safely and effectively provide phototherapy for their patients with vitiligo.

### Vitiligo nonsurgical treatment: a review of latest treatment researches [^5be9bbe8]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common depigmenting acquired disorder affecting about 1–2% of the world population, regardless of race, ethnic background, or gender. It is characterized by the appearance of milky white maculae because of a loss of melanocytes. The disfiguring nature of vitiligo causes high psychosocial morbidity. This is especially pronounced in populations with darker skin tone, likely because of the marked contrast. A variety of nonsurgical treatment regimens are currently employed in vitiligo. We reviewed the latest studies carried out on different nonsurgical treatment modalities used in vitiligo. All nonsurgical treatment aid to repigment or depigmentation the skin, however, many of them require a prolonged treatment course and may yield minimal results as well as carry unwanted side effects. There is a need for further research into the causes of vitiligo and into discovering better treatments.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^de557730]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The HI‐Light Trial demonstrated that for active, limited vitiligo, combination treatment with potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) and handheld narrowband ultraviolet B offers a better treatment response than potent TCS alone. However, it is unclear how to implement these findings.

Aim

We sought to answer three questions: (i) Can combination treatment be used safely and effectively by people with vitiligo?; (ii) Should combination treatment be made available as routine clinical care?; and (iii) Can combination treatment be integrated within current healthcare provision?

Methods

This was a mixed‐methods process evaluation, including semi‐structured interviews with a purposive sample of trial participants, structured interviews with commissioners, and an online survey and focus groups with trial staff. Transcripts were coded by framework analysis, with thematic development by multiple researchers.

Results

Participants found individual treatments easy to use, but the combination treatment was complicated and required nurse support. Both participants and site investigators felt that combination treatment should be made available, although commissioners were less certain. There was support for the development of services offering combination treatment, although this might not be prioritized above treatment for other conditions. A 'mixed economy' model was suggested, involving patients purchasing their own devices, although concerns regarding the safe use of treatments mean that training, monitoring and ongoing support are essential. The need for medical physics support may mean that a regional service is more practical.

Conclusion

Combination treatment should be made available for people seeking treatment for vitiligo, but services require partnership with medical physics and ongoing training and support for patients.

### Randomized controlled trial of topical corticosteroid and home-based narrowband ultraviolet B for active and limited vitiligo: results of the HI-light vitiligo trial [^1a643660]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the effectiveness of vitiligo treatments is limited.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of (i) handheld narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) and (ii) a combination of potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) and NB-UVB, compared with TCS alone, for localized vitiligo.

Methods

A pragmatic, three-arm, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial (9-month treatment, 12-month follow-up). Adults and children, recruited from secondary care and the community, aged ≥ 5 years and with active vitiligo affecting < 10% of skin, were randomized 1: 1: 1 to receive TCS (mometasone furoate 0·1% ointment + dummy NB-UVB), NB-UVB (NB-UVB + placebo TCS) or a combination (TCS + NB-UVB). TCS was applied once daily on alternating weeks; NB-UVB was administered on alternate days in escalating doses, adjusted for erythema. The primary outcome was treatment success at 9 months at a target patch assessed using the participant-reported Vitiligo Noticeability Scale, with multiple imputation for missing data. The trial was registered with number ISRCTN17160087 on 8 January 2015.

Results

In total 517 participants were randomized to TCS (n = 173), NB-UVB (n = 169) and combination (n = 175). Primary outcome data were available for 370 (72%) participants. The proportions with target patch treatment success were 17% (TCS), 22% (NB-UVB) and 27% (combination). Combination treatment was superior to TCS: adjusted between-group difference 10·9% (95% confidence interval 1·0%-20·9%; P = 0·032; number needed to treat = 10). NB-UVB alone was not superior to TCS: adjusted between-group difference 5·2% (95% CI - 4·4% to 14·9%; P = 0·29; number needed to treat = 19). Participants using interventions with ≥ 75% expected adherence were more likely to achieve treatment success, but the effects were lost once treatment stopped. Localized grade 3 or 4 erythema was reported in 62 (12%) participants (including three with dummy light). Skin thinning was reported in 13 (2·5%) participants (including one with placebo ointment).

Conclusions

Combination treatment with home-based handheld NB-UVB plus TCS is likely to be superior to TCS alone for treatment of localized vitiligo. Combination treatment was relatively safe and well tolerated but was successful in only around one-quarter of participants.
