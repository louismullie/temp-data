## Question

Multi-fibroid uterus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a multi-fibroid uterus, including imaging, treatment branches by fertility goals, procedural nuances, risks, reintervention data, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and characterizing fibroid burden. Then, I should assess symptom severity and patient-centered factors. Next, I'll stratify management by fertility intentions and detail evidence-based options and technical considerations. After that, I need to balance efficacy with reintervention risk and oncologic safety, including morcellation counseling. Finally, I'll outline post-treatment surveillance and synthesize a practical selection algorithm, validating each step against guidelines and comparative outcomes data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and diagnosis. A multi-fibroid uterus implies numerous leiomyomas of varied sizes and locations; this is common, with lifetime prevalence estimates up to 20–80% by age 50, but I should verify that with imaging and clinical correlation rather than assume based on symptoms alone. I need to check the initial imaging pathway: transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with duplex Doppler is first-line for suspected fibroids, reserving pelvic MRI to precisely map size, number, FIGO types, and cavity relationship when planning treatment or if ultrasound is nondiagnostic, which is critical for multi-fibroid anatomy and procedural planning [^117PKinh].

> Next, I should review symptom profile and patient-centered factors before jumping to treatment. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — severity of bleeding, bulk, pain, and pressure symptoms; anemia; age and menopausal status; and race-related disease burden all influence choices, as do desires for fertility or uterus preservation, tolerance for invasive procedures, and acceptance of reintervention risk [^112DATDu]. I need to ensure we explicitly capture the FIGO classification, distortion of the endometrial cavity, and patient values, noting that Black women often experience more severe disease and earlier onset, which may shift the risk–benefit calculus and timing of intervention.

> Now I will stratify by fertility goals. For patients desiring fertility, let me consider uterine-preserving surgery first. Myomectomy is recommended as first-line in symptomatic patients who wish to preserve fertility or the uterus, prioritizing approach by fibroid location: hysteroscopic myomectomy for FIGO 0–2 submucosal lesions distorting the cavity, and laparoscopic (or open) myomectomy for intramural and subserosal disease when feasible; I should confirm cavity-distortion status, as benefit is clearest when the cavity is impacted [^111Q1bUe] [^117CKcDv] [^116rsmuM] [^112PfvTj]. Wait, I should double-check that this aligns with guideline strength — SOGC and AAGL both support this hierarchy, and preoperative MRI mapping strengthens selection in multi-fibroid uteri [^117PKinh].

> Technical execution matters for reproductive outcomes; I need to ensure multilayer myometrial closure to reduce rupture risk and minimize electrosurgery during laparoscopic or open myomectomy to preserve myometrium and reduce adhesion risk [^113yyTZE]. Let me verify intraoperative blood-loss strategies: vasopressin, tranexamic acid, and misoprostol are reasonable adjuncts, with mechanical strategies like peri-cervical tourniquet or temporary uterine artery occlusion and barbed suture to improve efficiency in multi-fibroid cases [^1131zbhr]. For hysteroscopic cases, hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought "isotonic" distension was the key, but I should confirm the energy and fluid pairing; with monopolar electrosurgery, electrolyte-free media such as mannitol 5% or glycine are appropriate, and strict, weighted fluid deficit monitoring with institutional stop thresholds is essential to safety; additionally, avoid resecting opposing walls in a single session and consider adjunctive laparoscopy or ultrasound guidance for deep type 2 myomas to limit trauma and adhesions [^111WSGNd] [^115MBFPt] [^111QYq2S] [^1124JwZ9].

> Counseling for the fertility branch should be transparent. I should confirm that myomectomy, while fertility-sparing, often carries greater operative risk than hysterectomy on a per-procedure basis and has a nontrivial reintervention risk — about 12.2% at five years for abdominal/laparoscopic myomectomy; hysteroscopic myomectomy has an estimated 7% five-year reintervention rate, which I need to contextualize for patients balancing symptom relief with future pregnancies [^113S4LfR] [^115VMZBi]. Let me consider long-term trade-offs: hysterectomy eliminates recurrence but precludes pregnancy; even with ovarian conservation it may affect ovarian function, so definitive surgery is not a benign default for those desiring fertility [^116dP1Ri].

> I should also specify what to avoid when fertility is desired. Hold on, I should verify this — uterine artery embolization and other embolic occlusion therapies are not recommended in patients with submucosal fibroids who have infertility or wish to conceive, and ablation-type therapies are likewise inappropriate in those pursuing pregnancy, given uncertain endometrial and myometrial effects that can impair implantation and gestation [^1177RWsK] [^113Wf2PW].

> For patients not desiring fertility, I will now examine less invasive symptom control first. Medical options include progestin-containing regimens such as levonorgestrel IUD, combined oral contraceptives, and depot medroxyprogesterone; NSAIDs and tranexamic acid help with heavy bleeding; and GnRH agonists or antagonists can be used short term for symptom control or preoperative shrinkage, but I need to confirm that long-term use is constrained by hypoestrogenic adverse effects and recurrence after discontinuation [^112DATDu] [^116Qmaq4]. Wait, let me verify the safety of ulipristal if considered: monthly liver enzyme monitoring and post-course testing are required, with careful counseling about hepatotoxicity warning signs [^112cdSjh].

> Radiologic uterus-sparing interventions are next. Uterine artery embolization is an evidence-supported, minimally invasive option for symptomatic patients who wish to preserve the uterus; five-year reintervention risk averages about 14.4%, and in those who later attempt conception, pooled estimates suggest roughly 39% pregnancy, 69% live birth, and 22% miscarriage — although I should emphasize heterogeneity and age-related confounding when counseling [^117GFEmX] [^115VMZBi] [^116sa89q]. High-intensity focused ultrasound is truly noninvasive and reasonable for select, accessible fibroids, but I should confirm patients understand its higher five-year reintervention risk near 53.9% and generally less favorable quality-of-life outcomes, as well as insufficient data on reproductive safety; this should temper expectations and selection [^111KMGww] [^115VMZBi] [^1116Pj4v].

> Tissue-sparing ablation deserves a careful check. Radiofrequency ablation can yield symptom outcomes comparable to myomectomy with less blood loss and faster recovery in appropriately selected patients without fertility goals, which can be valuable in multi-fibroid symptom control strategies [^112wnYeV]. Endometrial ablation can be added in those with heavy bleeding and submucosal components when future fertility is not desired, and in selected cases may reduce subsequent surgery after hysteroscopic myomectomy; wait, I initially stated it "causes permanent infertility", but let me reconsider — pregnancy may still rarely occur and is hazardous, so the correct counseling is that ablation is contraindicated for women who desire future pregnancy and should be reserved for those definitively not pursuing fertility, not that it is a guaranteed sterilization method [^11348Co3] [^114BCiN4] [^113Wf2PW].

> Definitive surgery should be discussed candidly. Hysterectomy remains the definitive cure for fibroid symptoms and is indicated after failed conservative therapy, severe or refractory symptoms, patient preference for a definitive solution, or suspicious features raising concern for sarcoma; I should also counsel that even with ovarian conservation, hysterectomy can impact ovarian function and may be associated with earlier menopause and some long-term risks, which must be weighed against the certainty of symptom resolution and zero reintervention for fibroids [^117PcFxm] [^116dP1Ri].

> Special issues in multi-fibroid uteri require a pragmatic approach. Let me think about cases with numerous fibroids, very large uteri, or mixed submucosal and subserosal disease where single-modality therapy is suboptimal. A combined or two-step approach — uterine artery embolization to devascularize and shrink burden followed by interval myomectomy — can reduce blood loss and make complex myomectomy safer; preliminary series report high technical success and symptom resolution without transfusion, but I should confirm that evidence remains limited and selection is key [^1179fFVV]. But wait, what if hemorrhage risk is paramount in a single-stage myomectomy? Emerging strategies, including preemptive embolization, have been explored to reduce bleeding, though patient selection and institutional expertise are critical and data are still evolving [^113bcWc3].

> I need to ensure oncologic safety and extraction risk counseling are not overlooked. The risk of occult sarcoma in submucosal fibroids under age 50 is extremely low, yet I must maintain vigilance; when sarcoma is suspected, complete removal of an intact uterus is the gold standard, and minimally invasive techniques should only be used if uterine integrity can be assured to avoid tumor dissemination [^111VPovU] [^114Ba1Xp] [^114DQCi5]. I should confirm patients are counseled about morcellation risks and containment options when tissue extraction is required during myomectomy, particularly in perimenopausal patients or when pathology is uncertain [^112JvX2S].

> Before finalizing choices, I should double-check reintervention risks across options to align with patient priorities. At five years, reintervention rates are approximately 7% for hysteroscopic myomectomy, 12.2% for abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy, 14.4% for uterine artery embolization, and 53.9% for high-intensity focused ultrasound; symptom-related quality of life improves across modalities but appears least favorable after HIFU in comparative analyses, which should be discussed explicitly in shared decision-making [^115VMZBi].

> Post-treatment surveillance needs structure. I will now examine appropriate imaging follow-up based on modality and symptoms: pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler, and when needed pelvic MRI, are appropriate for post-procedure surveillance and for assessing residual or recurrent disease or complications such as infarction patterns after embolization [^114zqnR1]. Hold on, I should verify intrauterine adhesion risk after multiple submucous resections; a second-look hysteroscopy with adhesiolysis can be considered when fertility is a goal, and I need to be alert for post-ablation fibroid expulsion that may require hysteroscopic removal in selected cases [^1176xZf4] [^11721bMC].

> Bringing this together into a treatment selection pathway, let me summarize without oversimplifying. If fertility is desired, prioritize myomectomy tailored to anatomy — hysteroscopic for FIGO 0–2 submucosal distortion and laparoscopic or open for intramural or subserosal disease — with meticulous technique and adhesion prevention, while avoiding UAE and ablation-type therapies that threaten reproductive outcomes; if fertility is not desired, begin with medical therapy for bleeding and pain, escalate to UAE or radiofrequency ablation when uterus-sparing symptom control is preferred, consider HIFU only with full counseling regarding high reintervention risk, and proceed to hysterectomy when definitive cure is desired or conservative options fail; in complex multi-fibroid uteri, consider combined UAE plus interval myomectomy to optimize safety and efficacy, always tailoring to patient goals, anatomy, and local expertise, and incorporating reintervention and safety data into shared decision-making [^111KMGww] [^115VMZBi] [^117GFEmX] [^1179fFVV].

---

A multi-fibroid uterus is defined by the presence of **multiple benign leiomyomas** within the uterus, often causing **heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and infertility** [^111VPovU]. Diagnosis relies on **pelvic ultrasound and MRI** for detailed mapping and treatment planning [^117PKinh] [^113DMLrF]. Management is **individualized** [^112DATDu], with medical therapy (e.g. GnRH analogs, tranexamic acid) [^116Qmaq4] for symptom control; myomectomy for fertility preservation [^111Q1bUe] [^1158h8mj]; uterine artery embolization or high-intensity focused ultrasound for minimally invasive symptom relief [^117GFEmX] [^111KMGww]; and hysterectomy as definitive therapy when childbearing is complete [^117PcFxm]. Recurrence is common [^115VMZBi], so ongoing surveillance and patient counseling are essential [^114zqnR1].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Patients with a multi-fibroid uterus may present with a **variety of symptoms**, including:

- **Abnormal uterine bleeding**: Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) [^116Qmaq4], intermenstrual bleeding, or prolonged menstrual periods [^111VPovU].

- **Pelvic pain and pressure**: Chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort due to the enlarged uterus and multiple fibroids [^113aLJ8g].

- **Reproductive complications**: Infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth [^111VPovU].

- **Bulk-related symptoms**: Urinary frequency, constipation, and abdominal distension due to the enlarged uterus [^113By9fo].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and characterization of a multi-fibroid uterus require a **combination of clinical assessment and imaging** studies:

- **Clinical examination**: Bimanual pelvic examination may reveal an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus [^112DATDu].

- **Ultrasound imaging**: Pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound [^117PKinh] is the initial imaging modality of choice, providing information on the number, size, and location of fibroids [^113DMLrF].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: MRI [^117PKinh] is highly sensitive and specific, particularly useful for detailed mapping of multiple fibroids, especially when surgical intervention is planned.

- **Hysteroscopy**: Useful for evaluating submucosal fibroids and intrauterine cavity distortion [^111VPovU].

---

## Management strategies

Management of a multi-fibroid uterus is **individualized** [^112DATDu] based on symptoms, age, fertility goals, and fibroid size and location. Treatment options include medical, surgical, and minimally invasive interventions:

---

### Medical management

Medical therapy aims to control symptoms, particularly **abnormal uterine bleeding and pain**. Options include **hormonal therapies** such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) [^116Qmaq4], and progestin-containing agents (e.g. a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device) [^114aqLZ2], as well as **non-hormonal therapies** such as tranexamic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for symptomatic relief [^113EeLKM].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical intervention is considered for symptomatic patients, particularly when **fertility preservation** is desired. **Myomectomy** [^111Q1bUe] removes fibroids while preserving the uterus and can be performed via laparotomy, laparoscopy, or hysteroscopy, depending on fibroid size and location [^1158h8mj]. **Hysterectomy** [^117PcFxm] is a definitive treatment for patients who have completed childbearing or have severe symptoms refractory to other treatments.

---

### Minimally invasive procedures

Minimally invasive procedures offer symptom relief with shorter recovery times. **Uterine artery embolization (UAE)** [^117GFEmX] effectively reduces fibroid size and symptoms but may impact fertility and pregnancy outcomes [^113DMLrF]. **High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)** is a non-invasive option for symptom relief, though reproductive outcomes remain uncertain [^111KMGww] [^1116Pj4v]. **Radiofrequency ablation** is an emerging minimally invasive technique with promising results in symptom control [^112wnYeV].

---

## Impact on fertility and pregnancy outcomes

A multi-fibroid uterus **significantly impacts fertility and pregnancy outcomes**:

- **Infertility**: Fibroids, particularly submucosal and intramural types, can impair implantation [^115tsVoM] and increase the risk of infertility [^111VPovU].

- **Pregnancy complications**: Increased risk of miscarriage, preterm labor, placental abruption, and cesarean delivery [^113aLJ8g].

- **Fertility preservation**: Myomectomy is the preferred surgical option for women desiring future fertility, although recurrence of fibroids is common [^117CKcDv].

---

## Recurrence and long-term outcomes

Recurrence of fibroids after treatment is **common**, particularly after myomectomy or minimally invasive procedures [^115VMZBi]. Long-term outcomes depend on the chosen treatment modality, patient age, and hormonal factors. Regular follow-up and imaging surveillance are recommended to monitor for recurrence and manage symptoms effectively [^114zqnR1].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Effective management of a multi-fibroid uterus requires comprehensive patient counseling and **shared decision-making**. Patients should be informed about the risks, benefits, and potential complications of each treatment option, including the impact on fertility, recurrence rates, and long-term outcomes [^112DATDu].

---

A multi-fibroid uterus is characterized by multiple benign leiomyomas, causing significant symptoms and impacting fertility. Management is **individualized**, including medical, surgical, and minimally invasive options, with recurrence common and ongoing surveillance essential [^113aLJ8g].

Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyoma, are growths that develop in the uterus. These benign growths can vary in size, number, and symptomatology. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, between 20% and 80% of women develop fibroids by age 50. In addition to existing pharmaceutical treatments, several interventions are used to treat fibroids or their symptoms, including hysterectomy, myomectomy, radiofrequency ablation, uterine artery embolization, endometrial ablation, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. Treatment decisions consider many factors, including experienced symptoms, size and location of the fibroids, patient's age, patient preferences regarding uterine-sparing procedures, and the provider's clinical expertise and experience. Treatment decisions also consider the risk of an occult uterine sarcoma in a woman undergoing surgical intervention for presumed fibroids.

Despite the large burden of disease, evidence on the relative safety and effectiveness of available uterine fibroid interventions remains sparse. Given the paucity of comparative studies, there is a clear need for the systematic collection of post-market real-world data for women undergoing treatments using medical devices, with careful consideration of which patient characteristics, procedural data, and health outcomes are most important to capture from a clinical perspective. Pre-market studies for uterine fibroid treatment technologies include a relatively small number of patients compared with the large number of women affected by fibroids.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of uterine fibroids, specifically in relation to their clinical presentation, the AAGL 2012 guidelines recommend recognizing that submucous fibroids contribute to infertility. Although their removal improves pregnancy rates, fertility rates remain lower than in females with a normal uterus. Submucous fibroids are associated with an increased risk of early pregnancy loss and a higher incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding, most commonly heavy menstrual bleeding. However, the mechanisms underlying this increased bleeding are unclear.

The direct source of abnormal uterine bleeding in patients with submucous fibroids is usually the endometrium itself. This allows for the selection of medical therapies aimed at the endometrium or for endometrial destruction, provided fertility is not an issue. The incidence of sarcoma in submucous fibroids is extremely low in patients under 50 years old. Clinical decisions for such patients should consider that submucous lesions are very rarely malignant.

Surgical or interventional therapy

If medical management proves insufficient, surgical or interventional procedures are the next approach to treating symptomatic fibroids. A myomectomy (laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or abdominal) removes fibroids to address symptomatic disease but has a high rate of recurrence, requiring sequential treatment or a second line of therapy to manage the disease. While myomectomy preserves fertility, the cumulative risk of multiple surgeries must be considered when pursuing this course of action. Hysterectomy is the only definitive cure for fibroids, but it eliminates the option of pregnancy and may have long-term health impacts. In fact, fibroids account for one-third of all hysterectomies.

The short- and long-term trade-offs of these procedures vary. Hysterectomy, even with ovarian conservation, affects ovarian function and leads to early menopause, but it shows better outcomes for fibroids within 3–5 years post-surgery compared to other medical treatments. However, in the longer term, hysterectomy, particularly when conducted with oophorectomy, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fracture risk, pelvic floor dysfunction, and neurologic issues. These complications are not fully understood and often are not adequately discussed with patients.

Endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization are not only less invasive procedures but also inhibit fertility. Alternatively, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRg-FUS) is an emerging noninvasive treatment recommended for patients who have fewer and larger fibroids.

There is insufficient evidence to suggest that one hysteroscopic fluid distention medium is safer than another, provided careful fluid monitoring and adherence to protocols designed to terminate procedures if unacceptable thresholds are met. Mannitol 5% is recognized as isosmolar and an osmotic diuretic, features that make it theoretically safer than other electrolyte-free options for uterine distention.

### Uterine fibroid embolisation for symptomatic uterine fibroids: a survey of clinical practice in Europe [^117MSxsY]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing age. Symptomatic fibroids can cause a diversity of symptoms, which can be divided into four categories: bleeding symptoms (irregular and/or heavy menstrual bleeding), pain (in the pelvic region and the back), bulk-related symptoms (pressure on bladder and bowel as well as increase in abdominal circumference), and subfertility. These symptoms often lead to medical or surgical treatments.

During the last two decades, minimally invasive therapeutic options for uterine fibroids have increased considerably. Uterine fibroid embolisation (UFE) was introduced in 1994 and is currently a well-acknowledged and proven alternative to surgical treatment. UFE is a percutaneous transcatheter embolisation technique using embolisation material to occlude the (end-)arteries supplying the fibroid. Devascularisation causes infarction and consequently decreased fibroid size, which may result in effective alleviation of symptoms.

However, after the introduction of UFE as an alternative to more invasive approaches, a widespread breakthrough, especially in general interventional radiology (IR), did not occur. Information on UFE still seems to be unavailable to a large number of women in Europe, and many gynecologists do not provide the option of UFE, or they inaccurately inform patients using misleading facts. Specific data on the number of centers and interventionalists performing UFE in Europe and the number of UFE procedures per center do not exist.

This publication reports the outcome of a survey on clinical practice related to UFE across Europe.

### Conservative two-step procedure including uterine artery embolization with embosphere and surgical myomectomy for the treatment of multiple fibroids: preliminary experience [^1179fFVV]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility and safety of combined uterine artery embolization (UAE) using Embosphere and surgical myomectomy as an alternative to radical hysterectomy in premenopausal women with multiple fibroids.

Mid-term clinical outcomes (mean, 25 months) of 12 premenopausal women (mean age, 38 years) with multiple and large symptomatic fibroids who desired to retain their uterus and who were treated using combined UAE and surgical myomectomy were retrospectively analyzed. In all women, UAE alone was contraindicated because of large (> 10 cm) or subserosal or submucosal fibroids, and myomectomy alone was contraindicated because of too many (> 10) fibroids.

UAE and surgical myomectomy were successfully performed in all women. Myomectomy was performed using:

- **Laparoscopy**: n = 6
- **Open laparotomy**: n = 3
- **Hysteroscopy**: n = 2
- **Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy**: n = 1

The mean serum hemoglobin level drop was 0.97 g/dL, and no blood transfusion was needed. No immediate complications were observed, and all women reported resumption of normal menses. During a mean follow-up period of 25 months (range, 14–37 months), a complete resolution of initial symptoms along with a decrease in uterine volume (mean, 48%) was observed in all women. No further hysterectomy was required in any woman.

In conclusion, in premenopausal women with multiple fibroids, the two-step procedure is a safe and effective alternative to radical hysterectomy, allowing for uterus preservation. Further prospective studies, however, should be conducted to determine the actual benefit of this combination.

### Conservative stepwise surgical approach for management of placenta previa accreta: A prospective case series study [^112eEvxM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

To describe a stepwise surgical approach for conservative management of placenta previa accreta to preserve the uterus and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach in controlling postpartum hemorrhage, including intrapartum hemorrhage, a prospective case series study was conducted. Sixty-two pregnant women with one or more cesarean deliveries diagnosed with placenta previa accreta between January 2018 and June 2019 at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital participated in the study.

- **Methods**: All participants underwent a conservative stepwise surgical approach through a Pfannenstiel skin incision, with fetal delivery through a uterine incision just above the upper border of the placenta. This was followed by bilateral uterine artery ligation with myometrial excision of the remaining adherent placenta and cervico-isthmic sutures by MMG (the main surgeon) and MS.

- **Results**: Among the 62 women, the surgical approach was successful in controlling postpartum hemorrhage and preserving the uterus in 50 (80.64%) participants. Three women (4.83%) sustained urinary bladder injuries, which were all managed intraoperatively during the cesarean section. Additionally, five women (8%) experienced postpartum pyrexia, and another five women (8%) had postpartum endometritis. All cases were managed conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

- **Conclusion**: The stepwise surgical approach can be applied to the conservative management of placenta previa accreta to avoid unnecessary cesarean hysterectomy.

### Thermal ablation of uterine fibroids using MR-guided focused ultrasound — a truly non-invasive treatment modality [^111pfxAE]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a significant source of morbidity for women of reproductive age. Definitive treatment has traditionally been a hysterectomy, but increasingly women are not prepared to undergo such an invasive procedure for a benign and usually self-limiting condition. Although a number of minimally invasive techniques are now available, focused ultrasound has a considerable advantage over them as it is completely non-invasive and does not require an anaesthetic. Improvements in imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have enabled the accurate planning, targeting, and monitoring of treatments.

We review the early experience of focused ultrasound surgery for the treatment of fibroids, and, in particular, the results of the recent phase I, II, and III multi-centre clinical trials. These trials and other studies demonstrate that MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation is feasible, safe, and appears to have an efficacy that is comparable with other treatment modalities. This technique has the advantages of being non-invasive and being deliverable as an outpatient procedure.

### Reintervention risk and quality of life outcomes after uterine-sparing interventions for fibroids: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VMZBi]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

To compare uterine-sparing treatment options for fibroids in terms of reintervention risk and quality of life, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Women with uterine fibroids undergoing a uterine-sparing intervention were considered in this analysis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Reintervention risk after uterine-sparing treatment for fibroids was assessed at 12, 36, and 60 months, along with quality of life outcomes based on validated questionnaires. Two separate analyses were performed:
	- Abdominal approach procedures, including myomectomy, uterine artery embolization (UAE), artery ligation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
	- Procedures managing intracavitary fibroids, using a hysteroscopic approach, including hysteroscopic myomectomy and hysteroscopic RFA.

The results included 85 articles that represented 17,789 women. Stratifying by treatment options, the reintervention risk after 60 months was 12.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2%-21.2%) for myomectomy, 14.4% (95% CI 9.8%-19.6%) for UAE, 53.9% (95% CI 47.2%-60.4%) for HIFU, and 7% (95% CI 4.8%-9.5%) for hysteroscopy. For other treatment options, no studies were available at 60 months. For quality of life outcomes, symptoms improved after treatment for all options, with the HIFU procedure showing the least favorable outcomes.

Despite the substantial heterogeneity of the study population, this meta-analysis provides valuable information on relative treatment efficacy.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^112JNBku]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions & Health Technologies (2022). Low credibility.

The accumulation of data through a prospective, multicenter coordinated registry network (CRN) is a robust and cost-effective way to gather real-world evidence on the performance of uterine fibroids treatment technologies for device-based and intervention-based studies. To develop the CRN, a group of uterine fibroids experts, consisting of representatives from professional societies, the US Food and Drug Administration, academia, industry, and the patient community, was convened to discuss the role and feasibility of the CRN and to identify the core data elements needed to assess uterine fibroid treatment technologies.

- **Design**: A Delphi method approach was employed to achieve consensus on a core minimum data set for the CRN. A series of surveys were sent to the panel and answered by each expert anonymously and individually. Results from the surveys were collected, collated, and analyzed by a study design team from Weill Cornell Medicine. Questions for the next round were based on the analysis process and discussed with group members via a conference call. This process was repeated twice over a 3-month period until consensus was achieved.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine experts participated in the Delphi surveys, which began with an initial list of 200 data elements. The working group reached final consensus on 97 data elements capturing patient medical history, imaging data, procedure-related data, post-procedure data, and long-term follow-up data.

- **Conclusions**: The CRN successfully convened an expert panel on uterine fibroids treatment technologies and used the Delphi methodology to develop a core minimum data set.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, specifically concerning technical considerations for surgery, the AAGL 2012 guidelines recommend the administration of preoperative laminaria, prostaglandins, or an intraoperative intracervical injection of a low-dose dilute vasopressin solution for cervical preparation. This approach aims to reduce the requirement for dilation and potentially decrease the incidence of uterine trauma associated with hysteroscopic surgery, including hysteroscopic myomectomy for submucous fibroids.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^115xB8hV]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). Low credibility.

Because the correlation between fibroid anatomy and symptoms is poor, "objective" measures of success, such as residual fibroid volume, are not particularly helpful for evaluating effectiveness. They do not allow for comparisons between procedures that affect fibroid size and those that physically remove the fibroids or the uterus itself. In addition, the lack of standards for reporting fibroid imaging further limits the utility of anatomic measurements as a relevant outcome. The participants focused on patient-reported outcomes related to symptoms but recognized that there is also a lack of clinical consensus on how best to measure and report fibroid-related symptoms.

If validated patient-reported instruments, such as the Uterine Fibroid Symptom Health-Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL), can be easily incorporated into clinical practice, perhaps through patient-facing electronic portals or applications, adding them to this core dataset would be important. There are both general and specific limitations to our methodology. Although multiple stakeholders were represented, the final consensus includes trade-offs and may not represent the priorities of individual stakeholders or those who did not participate.

In addition, the desire to capture data currently routinely captured as part of clinical care means that other important outcomes are not included. In particular, because validated quality-of-life instruments are not regularly collected as part of routine practice, treatment effectiveness within the data elements can only be estimated through identification.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: Developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^111cngnc]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal neoplasms of the myometrium, representing the most common tumors in women worldwide. At the time of writing, no long-term or noninvasive treatment option exists for hormone-dependent uterine fibroids due to the limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying their initiation and development. This paper comprehensively summarizes recent research advances on uterine fibroids, focusing on risk factors, developmental origin, pathogenetic mechanisms, and treatment options.

Additionally, we describe the treatment interventions for uterine fibroids and summarize future perspectives on studies. Deeper mechanistic insights into tumor etiology and the complexity of uterine fibroids can contribute to the progress of newer targeted therapies.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^114m7C1N]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). Low credibility.

The uterine fibroids working group consisted of 29 expert members, including practicing physicians, reviewers and medical officers from the FDA, researchers, industry representatives, and one patient representative. The working group co-chairs reduced the initial list of more than 350 potential data elements to 200 data elements that were included in the Delphi process. Completion of the Delphi surveys and group consensus resulted in the selection of 97 data elements, which are reported in the appendix. These data elements were identified as relevant to surgical devices used for the treatment of uterine fibroids.

Patient demographic variables, such as age and race, were not included in the Delphi selection process. This was due to the use of a standard, harmonized set of demographic variables selected based on prior work by a multistakeholder project sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The final data elements may be entered by patients, by physicians, or through a hybrid approach based on available technology.

Heterogeneity reflects the variance from each included study and arises from differences in participants, study design, treatments, duration of follow-up, analysis methods, participants' inclusion criteria, or other characteristics among studies. We estimated the heterogeneity using the I² statistic and its 95% confidence interval (CI).

A random-effects model was used if there was significant heterogeneity (I² > 50%), and a fixed-effect model was used if there was no statistically significant heterogeneity (I² ≤ 50%). If I² values indicated significant heterogeneity, we considered performing subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The statistical significance was further assessed using Egger's linear regression asymmetry test.

### Uterine artery embolisation: Fertility, adenomyosis and size - what is the evidence [^116sa89q]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Low credibility.

Uterine artery embolisation is well established as a treatment for symptomatic fibroids; however, some uncertainties remain. We have carried out a focused literature review on three particularly challenging aspects: post-procedure fertility, symptomatic adenomyosis, and large volume fibroids and uteri. This review aims to enable operators to utilize evidence-based guidance in patient selection, consent, and management.

- **Literature review**: Literature searches were performed using the PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The outcomes of our analysis of studies recording fertility rates in women desiring pregnancy following UAE for symptomatic fibroids found an overall mean pregnancy rate of 39.4%, a live birth rate of 69.2%, and a miscarriage rate of 22%. The major confounding factor was patient age, as many studies included women over 40 years who already have lower fertility compared to younger cohorts. Miscarriage rates and pregnancy rates in the studies analyzed were comparable to the age-matched population.

- **Adenomyosis treatment**: Treatment of pure adenomyosis and adenomyosis with co-existing uterine fibroids with UAE has been shown to produce symptomatic improvement, with better outcomes in those with combined disease. Although the effectiveness is not as high as in pure fibroid disease, UAE provides a viable and safe alternative for patients seeking symptom relief and uterine preservation.

- **Large volume uteri and fibroids**: Our analysis of studies assessing the outcomes of UAE in patients with large volume uteri and giant fibroids (> 10 cm) demonstrates no significant difference in major complication rates.

### Specialty-specific values affecting the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids [^115nWA5z]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

To better understand why interventional radiologists and gynecologists differ in their approaches to symptomatic uterine fibroids, conversational interviews were conducted with 26 interventional radiologists and gynecologists about their professional roles, clinical reasoning, and practice variation within and outside their specialty. Interview transcripts were systematically analyzed using NVivo 10 software (QSR International, Burlington, Massachusetts) according to grounded theory and content analysis to identify key themes and compare these themes across specialties and practice environments. Data were supplemented with retrospective analysis of 7,659 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids treated at a large academic center over 11 years.

Interventional radiologists' shares of symptomatic uterine fibroid treatment and endovascular stent treatments have remained constant (P > .05) for 11 years at a large medical center, whereas minimally invasive gynecologic fibroid treatments and the percentage of interventional radiology (IR) procedures reimbursed by Medicaid/Medicare have increased significantly (r > .90, P < .001 and r = .93, P < .001). Interventional radiologists and gynecologists shared a commitment to do "the right thing" for patients, but each group possessed distinct professional values affecting how they viewed medical evidence, outcomes, and their colleagues. When differences were apparent and concerning, physicians tended to suspect ulterior motives not in patients' best interests.

### Surgical treatment of fibroids for subfertility [^113vrhY3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Fibroids are the most common benign tumors of the female genital tract and are associated with numerous clinical problems, including a possible negative impact on fertility. In women requesting preservation of fertility, fibroids can be surgically removed (myomectomy) by laparotomy, laparoscopically, or hysteroscopically depending on the size, site, and type of fibroid. Myomectomy, however, is not without risk and can result in serious complications. It is therefore essential to determine whether such a procedure can result in an improvement in fertility and, if so, to then determine the ideal surgical approach.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect of myomectomy on fertility outcomes and to compare different surgical approaches.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Epistemonikos database, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), LILACS, conference abstracts on the ISI Web of Knowledge, and OpenSigle for grey literature from Europe. We also reviewed the reference list of relevant papers. The final search was conducted in February 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of myomectomy compared to no intervention or where different surgical approaches are compared regarding the effect on fertility outcomes in a group of infertile women suffering from uterine fibroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis were conducted systematically using established guidelines to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings.

### Uterine-artery embolization or myomectomy for uterine fibroids [^1158h8mj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common type of tumor among women of reproductive age and are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, abdominal discomfort, subfertility, and a reduced quality of life. For women who wish to preserve their uterus and who have not responded to medical treatment, myomectomy and uterine-artery embolization are therapeutic options.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate myomectomy, as compared with uterine-artery embolization, in women who had symptomatic uterine fibroids and did not want to undergo hysterectomy. Procedural options included open abdominal, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome was fibroid-related quality of life, as assessed by the score on the health-related quality-of-life domain of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) at 2 years; adjustment was made for the baseline score.

- **Results**: A total of 254 women were recruited at 29 hospitals in the United Kingdom and randomly assigned: 127 to the myomectomy group (of whom 105 underwent myomectomy) and 127 to the uterine-artery embolization group (of whom 98 underwent embolization). Data on the primary outcome were available for 206 women (81%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean (± SD) score on the health-related quality-of-life domain of the UFS-QOL questionnaire at 2 years was 84.6 ± 21.5 in the myomectomy group and 80.0 ± 22.0 in the uterine-artery embolization group.

### Surgical management of uterine fibroids: A large retrospective study [^116brc6u]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze trends in the surgical management of uterine fibroids and identify factors influencing surgical decisions among Chinese women over the past decade.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at four campuses of Tongji Hospital, a tertiary care center in Wuhan, China. Out of 104,430 women screened, 13,344 diagnosed with uterine fibroids and who underwent surgical treatment between 2013 and 2022 were included. Exclusion criteria were adenomyosis, uterine fibroids found unexpectedly during unrelated surgery (e.g. genital cancer), and pregnant women with uterine fibroids.

Interventions included hysterectomy and myomectomy. Data from surgical inpatients were analyzed for annual rates of hysterectomies and myomectomies. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the choice of surgery. From 2013 to 2022, hysterectomy rates decreased from 42.3% to 33.1%, with the most pronounced decline observed in the 45–49 age group (a 21.1 percentage point decrease), followed by the 40–44 age group (a 15.6 percentage point decrease). Myomectomy rates increased from 57.7% to 66.9%.

Factors associated with an increased likelihood of hysterectomy included clinically significant symptoms, lower pre-operative hemoglobin (Hb), multiple uterine fibroids, older age at admission, later age at menarche, and higher body mass index (BMI). Notably, among hysterectomy patients, 34.9% also had oophorectomy, compared to 1.1% in the myomectomy group.

In conclusion, surgical management of uterine fibroids showed notable trends and influencing factors over the past decade.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, specifically related to myomectomy, the ASRM 2017 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to conclude the following:

- **Removal of subserosal fibroids**: It is unclear if this improves fertility.

- **Myomectomy (laparoscopic or open)**: There is no conclusive evidence that it reduces miscarriage rates.

- **Hysteroscopic myomectomy**: The procedure does not appear to significantly reduce the likelihood of early pregnancy loss in patients with infertility and submucous fibroids.

### Non-surgical management of myomas [^113EeLKM]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Uterine myomas are a common condition and the leading cause of hysterectomy. Clinically, myomas can be challenging because they range from asymptomatic to causing severe, debilitating symptoms and occur in many women before childbearing is complete. Thus, women often seek uterine-conserving and nonsurgical management of their myomas.

In this review, the available uterine-conserving treatment options from medical management through minimally invasive procedures are discussed. To the extent of research available, the sustainability of symptom improvement and the effects on future fertility are reviewed. Future research may lead to therapies that reduce the risks of major surgery, decrease side effects, and offer primary or secondary prevention options.

### Addressing heterogenous outcomes in uterine fibroid research: A call to action [^116rxj4D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroid tumors are the most common benign pelvic tumors in women, with complications including heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, reproductive complications, and bulk-related symptoms. Although the majority of uterine fibroid tumors are asymptomatic, women who experience symptoms can face substantial burdens on quality of life and daily functioning. Comparative effectiveness reviews of available medical, surgical, and radiologic treatments have found that a lack of high-quality data to inform treatment decisions is due, in part, to the use of heterogeneous outcomes and instruments in clinical studies.

With multiple new interventions emerging, this call-to-action encourages the development and use of a core outcome set that will capture the most relevant, patient-important outcomes in late-phase and after-marketing therapeutic trials for uterine fibroid tumors. The core outcome set should be developed by a diverse, multistakeholder group comprised of key healthcare decision-makers. The development and uptake of a core outcome set ensures that a consistent, collaboratively vetted set of outcomes will be accessible across different studies and promotes transparency for innovators who seek to anticipate the evidence needs of patients, providers, payers, regulators, and other stakeholders.

### Intrauterine expulsion of a submucosal fibroid following transcervical radiofrequency fibroid ablation [^11721bMC]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Several options exist for managing fibroids with a mainly intramural location, including hysterectomy, uterine artery embolisation, and laparoscopic/laparotomic myomectomy.

An alternative, uterine-sparing, minimally invasive treatment was developed: the Sonata system. Since the Sonata system is still a relatively new treatment, little is known about its possible consequences. The most common postoperative adverse effects described are postoperative pain, increased menstrual vaginal bleeding, and dysmenorrhea.

Recently, a retrospective publication reported on the outcomes after treatment with the Sonata system. It is the first publication to account for a relatively large number of hysteroscopic myomectomies as a consequence of treatment with the Sonata system on submucosal and intramural fibroids. The reintervention rate in this study was found to be significantly higher than previously seen in studies. Of the 53 patients treated in this retrospective study, 24 women (45.3%) underwent a reintervention. The most frequently performed reintervention was a hysteroscopic myomectomy after intrauterine expulsion of the previously ablated fibroid, which occurred in 11 of 24 cases (45.8%).

Additionally, another publication reported an expulsion rate of 1.4% after Sonata treatment during a total follow-up of 12 months in 147 patients. It was not defined what FIGO type of fibroid expulsion occurred after treatment with Sonata, nor the degree of expulsion, whether transcervical or intrauterine.

### Minimally invasive approaches to myoma management [^114wJ9pG]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients affected by the presence of leiomyomas may incur a substantial physical, emotional, social, and financial toll, as well as a loss in their quality of life. Although many myomas are not amenable to medical therapy or hysteroscopic resection, many others are amenable to minimally invasive surgical approaches.

For patients who prefer to retain their fertility, laparoscopic myomectomy should be considered the intervention of choice. In this review, we expand on the surgical techniques of both conventional laparoscopic and robotic-assisted myomectomies.

- **Port placement**: Discusses the strategic placement of ports for surgical access.
- **Enucleation of myomas**: Covers the procedure of removing the myomas while preserving the uterus.
- **Tissue extraction**: Details methods for extracting tissue post-removal.
- **Minimization of blood loss**: Explains techniques to reduce blood loss during surgery.
- **Adhesion prevention**: Reviews strategies to minimize postoperative adhesions.
- **Closure of uterine incisions**: Describes the technique for closing uterine incisions effectively.

Finally, we discuss the available data supporting the use of these two approaches as the preferred, safe, and effective fertility-sparing surgical options. We also briefly address the emerging technologies of uterine artery embolization, ultrasound surgery, and radiofrequency ablation.

### Hemostatic techniques for myomectomy: An evidence-based approach [^111YucDC]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign gynecologic tumors. They are also a significant cause of morbidity, necessitating treatments ranging from hormonal suppression to surgical intervention. Myomectomy, the removal of these highly vascular tumors, offers significant quality of life and fertility-sparing benefits for patients affected by uterine leiomyomas. However, there is a risk of substantial intraoperative blood loss. This risk of hemorrhage can lead to an increased transfusion rate and the need for hysterectomy, along with other potential operative complications. Numerous medical and surgical techniques have been developed to minimize potentially significant blood loss during abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted myomectomies. Combined with judicious preoperative assessment, these techniques substantially enhance patient safety during a myomectomy and improve outcomes during recovery.

### Surgical management of fibroids: A changing landscape [^116K5aif]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids affect patients' quality of life and contribute significantly to healthcare costs. Studies from 2009 to 2011 demonstrated that fibroids disproportionately affect Black women, with lower odds of uterine preservation and minimally invasive approaches.

This retrospective cohort study uses data abstracted from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2015 to 2019 to examine trends in surgical management of uterine fibroids and explore disparities in surgical approach in a modern cohort.

- **Results**: In total, 52,909 women underwent hysterectomy, and 15,485 women underwent myomectomy between 2015 and 2019. Over the study period, the overall number of surgeries for fibroids increased by 44.2%, with minimally invasive hysterectomy responsible for the majority of this increase. The proportion of patients who underwent myomectomy significantly increased (20.85% to 24.62%, p value < 0.0001), whereas hysterectomy significantly decreased (79.15% to 75.38%, p value < 0.0001).

Bivariate analysis identified younger age, non-White race, and body mass index (BMI) < 25 as significantly associated with the performance of myomectomy. Non-Hispanic Black (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.23–3.89), Asian (aOR: 3.26, 95% CI: 2.80–3.80), and Hispanic Black (aOR: 5.50, 95% CI: 3.29–9.25) women were more likely to undergo myomectomy than non-Hispanic White women. Surgical treatment for fibroids increased over time, shifting toward uterine preservation, with myomectomy performance associated with lower age.

### Minimally invasive surgical techniques versus open myomectomy for uterine fibroids [^112Rrwku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Fibroids are common benign tumors arising in the uterus. Myomectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for women with symptomatic fibroids who prefer or want uterine conservation. Myomectomy can be performed by conventional laparotomy, mini-laparotomy, or minimal access techniques such as hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.

- **Objectives**: To determine the benefits and harms of laparoscopic or hysteroscopic myomectomy compared with open myomectomy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (inception to July 2014), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (inception to July 2014), MEDLINE(R) (inception to July 2014), EMBASE (inception to July 2014), PsycINFO (inception to July 2014) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (inception to July 2014) to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched trial registers and references from selected relevant trials and review articles. We applied no language restriction in these searches.

- **Selection criteria**: All published and unpublished randomized controlled trials comparing myomectomy via laparotomy, mini-laparotomy, or laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy versus laparoscopy or hysteroscopy in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids diagnosed by clinical and ultrasound examination were included in the meta-analysis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We conducted study selection and extracted data in duplicate. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain.

### Cervical ectopic pregnancy - the first case of live birth and uterus-conserving management [^117GMDfL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, the following approaches enabled a live birth and uterus-conserving management in our patient: cerclage, prevention of ascending infection, fetal delivery outside of the placental bed, the LISA (leaving the placenta in situ approach), UAE (cervical branches), and re-laparotomy with rapid removal of the placenta and cervical internal os plasty. Taking all these approaches together, a successful pregnancy and live birth with preservation of the uterus as well as fertility was possible.

### Alternative therapies in management of leiomyomas [^116G5tTP]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Leiomyomas are benign soft-tissue neoplasms that arise from smooth muscle. Relief of symptoms, such as abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, and pressure, is the major goal in managing women with significant symptoms. While hysterectomy is a definitive solution for symptomatic myomas, there are emerging less-invasive options. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery, cryomyolysis, and temporary occlusion of the uterine arteries are treatment options that provide minimally invasive interventions while preserving the uterus. This review summarizes procedure techniques, eligibility, complications, and outcomes associated with these alternative therapies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of uterine fibroids: 2023 update [^113DMLrF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumor in women of reproductive age and can present with symptoms including bleeding, bulk-related symptoms, and infertility. Several treatment options are available for the management of uterine fibroids, including medical management and minimally invasive therapies such as uterine artery embolization and MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation. Surgical interventions range from laparoscopic myomectomy to open hysterectomy. Given this wide range of therapeutic interventions, it is important to understand the data supporting these interventions and to be able to apply it in different clinical settings.

This document provides a summary of recent trials supporting various therapies for uterine fibroids, including recent evidence for MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation. It also includes a detailed discussion of fertility outcomes in myomectomy and uterine fibroid embolization. The American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method user manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Uterine artery embolisation: Fertility, adenomyosis and size - what is the evidence [^116JaAyy]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Low credibility.

Uterine artery embolisation is well established as a treatment for symptomatic fibroids; however, some uncertainties remain. We conducted a focused literature review on three particularly challenging aspects — post-procedure fertility, symptomatic adenomyosis, and large-volume fibroids and uteri — to enable operators to utilize evidence-based guidance in patient selection, consent, and management.

- **Review**: Literature searches were performed using the PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Our analysis of studies that recorded fertility rates in women desiring pregnancy following UAE for symptomatic fibroids found an overall mean pregnancy rate of 39.4%, live birth rate of 69.2%, and miscarriage rate of 22%. The major confounding factor was patient age, with many studies including women over 40 years who already have lower fertility compared to younger cohorts. Miscarriage rates and pregnancy rates in the studies analyzed were comparable to the age-matched population.

- **Treatment outcomes**: Treatment of pure adenomyosis and adenomyosis with co-existing uterine fibroids with UAE has been shown to produce symptomatic improvement, with better outcomes in those with combined disease. Although the effectiveness is not as high as in pure fibroid disease, UAE provides a viable and safe alternative for patients seeking symptom relief and uterine preservation. Our analysis of studies assessing the outcomes of UAE in patients with large-volume uteri and giant fibroids (> 10 cm) demonstrates no significant difference in major complication rate.

### Surgical treatment of fibroids for subfertility [^112eUQxR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Fibroids are the most common benign tumors of the female genital tract and are associated with numerous clinical problems, including a possible negative impact on fertility. In women requesting preservation of fertility, fibroids can be surgically removed (myomectomy) by laparotomy, laparoscopically, or hysteroscopically depending on the size, site, and type of fibroid. However, myomectomy is a procedure that is not without risk and can result in serious complications. It is therefore essential to determine whether such a procedure can lead to an improvement in fertility and, if so, to then determine the ideal surgical approach.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect of myomectomy on fertility outcomes and to compare different surgical approaches.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), LILACS, conference abstracts on the ISI Web of Knowledge, and OpenSigle for grey literature from Europe, as well as ongoing clinical trials registered online. The final search was conducted in June 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials examining the effect of myomectomy compared to no intervention or where different surgical approaches are compared regarding the effect on fertility outcomes in a group of infertile women suffering from uterine fibroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis were conducted in accordance with the procedure suggested in the guidelines.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^112HTLmZ]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). Low credibility.

There was a consensus on including specific data elements from any imaging studies obtained prior to the procedure, including date, type of modality, and fibroid characteristics — location, size, number visualized, and number measured, as well as uterine dimensions if recorded. As with menstrual history, there was a recognition that there is considerable variability in how fibroid imaging is reported and recorded, and further work on developing standards was needed. There was also consensus that any radiologic suspicion of adenomyosis, endometriosis, or a potentially malignant uterine lesion should also be recorded.

- **Procedure data**: The participants reached consensus on minimal data elements for all procedures, including whether the originally planned procedure was performed, procedure and discharge dates, an identifier for the primary surgeon, occurrence of any intraoperative adverse events, and an assessment about the relationship between the event and any devices used. Other relevant intraoperative findings (e.g. the presence of adhesions) and other procedures performed (e.g. oophorectomy) were also noted. Relevant pathology findings, depending on the procedure, include uterine and ovarian pathology, uterine weight (for hysterectomy), number and cumulative weight of excised fibroids (for myomectomy), and use of morcellation (including device and containment status). For procedures that do not specifically remove tissues, such as uterine artery embolization, MRI-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation, stakeholders agreed to include details on the embolized arteries.

### Guideline no. 461: The management of uterine fibroids [^117CKcDv]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, specifically with respect to myomectomy, the SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend offering myomectomy to patients with cavity-distorting fibroids to optimize fertility and pregnancy outcomes. It is important to recognize that for patients with non-cavitary-distorting fibroids, it remains unclear whether fertility is improved and perinatal risks are reduced with myomectomy.

### Surgical management of leiomyomas for fertility or uterine preservation [^115nsQ6B]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Leiomyomas are the most common pelvic tumors in women. These tumors are not always symptomatic but can cause abnormal uterine bleeding and anemia, pelvic pressure and pain, urinary frequency, and adverse reproductive outcomes — symptoms that can significantly diminish the quality of life for women. Myomectomy is the primary treatment modality for women with symptomatic leiomyomas who are of reproductive age and desire future fertility. Myomectomy can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life and, in some clinical situations, improve reproductive outcomes.

There are robust surgical outcome data supporting the use of a minimally invasive approach, such as laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, over laparotomy. Perioperative outcomes and return to normal activity are significantly better with a minimally invasive approach, and reproductive outcomes are not adversely affected. Detailed preoperative imaging is required for these minimally invasive procedures to be successful. Various evidence-based techniques can be employed to reduce blood loss during surgery. However, the role of robotic technology in enhancing surgical outcomes has not been clearly defined.

### With the advent of selective progesterone receptor modulators, what is the place of myoma surgery in current practice [^113YYs69]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign uterine tumors. This review examines the different management strategies, involving mainly surgery, and evaluates them in light of new developments with selective progesterone receptor modulators. On the one hand, hysteroscopic and laparoscopic (or minilaparotomic) myomectomy is the treatment of choice in women who wish to preserve their uterus, and hysterectomy has long been considered the standard surgical approach in symptomatic women who no longer wish to conceive. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ulipristal acetate in the medical management of myomas. Analyzing the respective advantages of both medical and surgical therapy, we propose new guidelines for the management of fibroids that take into account the most important symptoms (bleeding, infertility) and the age of the patients.

### Reducing the risk of bleeding after myomectomy: Is preemptive embolization a valuable tool [^113bcWc3]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas are the most common tumors of the female genital tract, with an incidence estimated between 40% and 60% at age 35 and between 60% and 70% at age 50 in the general population. Patients with uterine fibroids are most commonly asymptomatic. Nevertheless, 20% to 50% experience symptoms such as acute pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or infertility and will require treatment.

Symptomatic uterine fibroids are treated with either conservative or radical approaches, depending mainly on the patient's childbearing desire. Conservative treatments include hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, or open surgery myomectomy, and the radical option is a hysterectomy.

These tumors are densely vascularized, making myomectomy a challenging procedure with significant risk of per-operative and post-operative bleeding, prolonged surgical procedure duration, post-operative complications, and need for transfusion. The literature shows that transfusion is necessary in up to 20% of cases following abdominal myomectomy.

- **Risk factors**: Some fibroid characteristics have been identified as risk factors for complications in open surgery myomectomy, including past myomectomy history, uterine volume larger than 20 weeks of amenorrhea, per-operative extraction of more than 10 fibroids, and midline incisions.

- **New strategies**: To diminish the rate and severity of complications, new medical, surgical, and combined interventional strategies have emerged, significantly reducing per-operative bleeding.

The efficiency of uterine artery embolization (UAE) is being explored, but the sentence seems truncated here.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on treatment of uterine leiomyomas [^113By9fo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas, or fibroids, are the most common tumors in women of reproductive age and cause significant morbidity. Depending on their location, fibroids can lead to various symptoms, including abnormal uterine bleeding, constipation, urinary frequency, and pain. Historically, hysterectomy has been the primary treatment option, and uterine fibroids remain the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States. However, for women seeking alternatives to hysterectomy, several less invasive options are available, such as uterine artery embolization.

This article discusses uterine artery embolization as well as other treatment strategies for symptomatic uterine fibroids. In many cases, there may not be a single best treatment option, but rather several viable alternatives. Each option is evaluated based on outcomes, complications, and, when possible, cost-effectiveness. The recommendations in this article are based on the evidence-based consensus of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

Since the introduction of uterine artery embolization as a minimally invasive treatment option for uterine fibroids, there has been a great deal of effort made toward developing other options for these patients. These options approach the problem differently, either with direct targeting of individual fibroids, organ-wide targeting of multiple fibroids, and systemic therapy to address the problem of fibroids using a hormonal approach. This review will focus on the different techniques and different philosophies that have been applied to the treatment of fibroids during the past decade.

### Uterine artery embolisation: Fertility, adenomyosis and size - What is the evidence [^112ikZiz]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Low credibility.

Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) is a safe and effective therapeutic option for symptomatic uterine fibroids. Originally described for the management of post-partum haemorrhage, Ravina et al. were the first to describe UAE for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids. Subsequently, UAE has grown in popularity as a well-tolerated, minimally invasive alternative to existing surgical methods. However, there are specific aspects surrounding UAE which remain a source of debate and uncertainty.

The effect of UAE on future fertility remains controversial. Joint guidelines by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Radiologists of the United Kingdom (UK) acknowledge there is little high-quality evidence available to help draw conclusions in this matter. They recommend UAE should only be offered to women of childbearing age who wish to preserve fertility after an informed discussion, whereas many other international guidelines recommend avoiding UAE altogether in this cohort. This illustrates the difficulties faced by operators in dealing with patients seeking UAE while wishing to maintain fertility.

Many patients with symptomatic adenomyosis also have uterine fibroids, and whilst there are publications outlining the use of UAE to treat these patients with encouraging results.

### Uterine fibroids [^117NRG8V]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas or myomas, are common clonal neoplasms of the uterus. These fibroids include smooth muscle and fibroblast components, as well as a substantial amount of fibrous extracellular matrix, all of which contribute to the pathogenetic process. They are extremely heterogeneous in pathophysiology, size, location, and clinical symptomatology, forming part of a range of diseases where some variants exhibit facets of malignant behavior, although they are overall benign.

The risk of developing fibroids is associated with race; black women have a higher risk of developing fibroids earlier in life compared to their white counterparts and tend to develop more severe forms of the disease. Clinically, fibroids account for one-third to half of all hysterectomies and are linked to substantial morbidity and healthcare costs for women of reproductive age. Treatments are primarily surgical and interventional, with approximately three-quarters of all fibroid treatments being hysterectomies. However, clinical innovations are emerging, particularly in the use of progesterone receptor modulators as a medical therapy.

New information is rapidly accumulating about the genetic subgroups that lead to fibroid formation, which could further elucidate the clinical heterogeneity of this disease and pave the way for individualized treatments. This information represents a crucial development, given the lack of high-quality evidence on which to base therapeutic decisions.

### The modern management of uterine fibroids-related abnormal uterine bleeding [^116Qmaq4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common form of benign pelvic tumors in females, affecting more than 60% of patients aged 30–44 years. In many cases, uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and may be identified incidentally via transvaginal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. However, approximately 30% of cases impact quality of life and women's health, with abnormal uterine bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding being the most common complaints, along with iron deficiency (ID) and ID anemia.

Medical treatments for UFs-related abnormal uterine bleeding include symptomatic agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid. Hormonal therapies are also used, including combined oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists, levonorgestrel intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators, and aromatase inhibitors. Despite these options, few drugs are specifically approved for UF treatment, with most managing only the symptoms.

Surgical options consist of fertility-sparing treatments like myomectomy or nonconservative treatments such as hysterectomy, particularly for perimenopausal women unresponsive to other treatments. Radiologic interventions are available, including uterine artery embolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound or magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation. Additionally, the management of ID and ID anemia due to acute and chronic bleeding should be considered, involving iron replacement therapy both during medical treatment and beyond.
