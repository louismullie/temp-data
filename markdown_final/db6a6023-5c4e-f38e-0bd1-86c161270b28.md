## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best describes the primary goal of quality assurance in healthcare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of quality assurance and how it differs from quality improvement. Then, I should verify which option aligns with patient-centered outcomes and satisfaction. Next, I will examine whether cost reduction or professional policing are legitimate primary goals. After that, I should consider whether "guaranteeing" needs is too absolute. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions. Quality assurance is a process that regularly examines activities or products to ensure they meet required standards of excellence; in clinical contexts, it ensures care processes adhere to evidence-based standards and regulations, whereas quality improvement is iterative and proactive in enhancing care over time [^1119i7eA] [^114nxMFn].

> Now, I need to check which option maps most directly to patient-centered outcomes. Option B states improving the health status and satisfaction of patients, which aligns with the Institute of Medicine's six domains of healthcare quality (safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, equitable) and with palliative care guidance that embeds continuous quality improvement to improve patient and family outcomes and experience of care [^114nxMFn] [^115zbdDy].

> Hold on, let's not conflate QA with cost control. Option A focuses on reducing costs, but while efficiency is a quality domain, cost reduction is not the primary goal of QA; rather, QA seeks to ensure appropriate, evidence-based care that can, as a secondary effect, reduce waste and unnecessary spending, as illustrated by utilization review processes that optimize care and control costs without making cost the primary aim [^1114WFfC] [^114nxMFn].

> I should double-check the policing angle. Option C frames QA as policing incompetence, but QA is fundamentally about system-level process assurance and standardization, not disciplinary surveillance of individuals; professional oversight and licensure are separate functions, even though QA processes may surface performance issues that warrant remediation or referral to credentialing bodies [^1119i7eA] [^114nxMFn].

> Wait, let me verify the wording of Option D. "Guaranteeing" that needs are met sounds too absolute for QA, which monitors adherence to standards and detects deviations; it does not guarantee outcomes. Moreover, QA is broader than serving only a particular group, whereas equity-focused efforts are important but are encompassed within the broader aim of improving health status and satisfaction for all patients [^1119i7eA] [^114nxMFn].

> Let me synthesize. The primary goal of quality assurance is to ensure that healthcare delivery consistently meets established standards so that patients experience improved health status and satisfaction; cost containment and professional policing are secondary or tangential, and "guaranteeing" needs overstates what QA can deliver. Therefore, Option B best captures the essence of QA's purpose [^114nxMFn] [^115zbdDy].

The primary goal of quality assurance in healthcare is to **improve patient health outcomes and satisfaction** by ensuring care is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable [^114nxMFn] [^115zbdDy]. Quality assurance achieves this by systematically monitoring processes, identifying defects, and implementing corrective actions to reduce errors, enhance care quality, and align services with patient needs and preferences [^112xn5bs] [^113gr49Z]. While cost control and professional oversight can occur, they are secondary to the core aim of **optimizing patient outcomes and experience** [^1114WFfC].

---

## Core objectives of quality assurance

Quality assurance in healthcare encompasses several **core objectives** that collectively contribute to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction:

- **Safety**: Minimizing preventable harm to patients through error reduction and risk mitigation strategies [^114nxMFn].

- **Effectiveness**: Ensuring clinical practices are evidence-based and consistently applied to achieve desired health outcomes [^116tQqq2].

- **Patient-centeredness**: Aligning care with patient preferences, values, and needs, fostering shared decision-making, and enhancing patient engagement [^115zbdDy].

- **Timeliness**: Reducing delays in care delivery and improving access to services [^114nxMFn].

- **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource utilization to deliver high-quality care without unnecessary waste [^1144ww6t].

- **Equity**: Addressing disparities in care delivery and ensuring equitable access and treatment for all patient populations [^113jnh31].

---

## Relationship between quality assurance and patient outcomes

Quality assurance directly influences patient outcomes by **identifying and correcting deficiencies** in care delivery. For example, systematic monitoring and feedback mechanisms have been shown to improve adherence to clinical guidelines, reduce medical errors, and enhance patient safety [^117GeMki]. Additionally, quality assurance initiatives that incorporate patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction surveys provide valuable insights into patient experiences, enabling healthcare providers to tailor services to better meet patient needs [^115XeSEL].

---

## Role of quality assurance in patient satisfaction

Patient satisfaction is a critical component of healthcare quality, and quality assurance significantly contributes to its improvement by ensuring that care delivery is **consistent, respectful, and responsive to patient preferences**. Quality assurance processes that include patient feedback, shared decision-making, and effective communication have been associated with higher patient satisfaction rates [^115zbdDy] [^113gr49Z].

---

## Distinction between quality assurance and related concepts

It is essential to distinguish quality assurance from related concepts such as quality improvement and cost reduction:

| **Concept** | **Definition** | **Primary focus** |
|-|-|-|
| Quality assurance | Systematic process of monitoring and evaluating care to ensure adherence to standards and regulations | Ensuring compliance and consistency in care delivery |
| Quality improvement | Continuous process of identifying and implementing changes to enhance care quality | Improving processes and outcomes |
| Cost reduction | Efforts to minimize healthcare expenditures | Financial efficiency |

---

While cost reduction and professional oversight may be incidental benefits of quality assurance, they are **not its primary goals**. The overarching aim remains the improvement of patient health outcomes and satisfaction [^114nxMFn].

---

## Conclusion

The primary goal of quality assurance in healthcare is to **improve patient health outcomes and satisfaction** by ensuring care is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Quality assurance achieves this through systematic monitoring, identification of deficiencies, and implementation of corrective actions, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of healthcare delivery [^114nxMFn].

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^116tQqq2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### Inappropriate vitamin D supplementation among multimorbid older patients: a multicountry analysis [^115F6rTV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing age was associated with vitamin D underuse. Older people may experience decreased endogenous vitamin D synthesis due to possible limited outdoor sunlight exposure and age-related decline in production of vitamin D through UV in the skin. However, several clinical studies have failed to provide compelling evidence of supplementing vitamin D at a population level for several outcomes, although there are no studies that focus specifically on multimorbid older people. According to the most recently published guidelines of the US Preventive Services Task Force, evidence to recommend supplementing all older adults with vitamin D to prevent fractures or other diseases is not currently available. However, these guidelines do not apply in high-risk groups, which may benefit from vitamin D supplementation. We identified that a considerable number of multimorbid older patients belonging to high-risk groups received no vitamin D supplementation. Though it is important to avoid overscreening, it is important not to miss persons belonging to these high-risk groups. The underuse of vitamin D among older adults may be attributed to several factors, among them, the lack of awareness about high-risk conditions, a desire to minimize polypharmacy, unclear or conflicting guidelines, and controversies surrounding the perceived benefits of vitamin D supplementation and further research is needed. The inclusion of further high-risk groups, as described from several guidelines in the high-risk definition in our cohort of multimorbid patients resulted in a strikingly high proportion of underuse. This is particularly important in the context of multimorbid older individuals. This should be taken into account when considering guidelines for screening and supplementation, since this could lead to overscreening particularly in this population. Specific studies and guidelines for multimorbid individuals are needed.

### Health disparities in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a blueprint for action. An official American Thoracic Society statement [^116FGuNf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) health disparities — recommendations for practice and research emphasize data capture, partnerships, education, bias mitigation, workforce diversity, and policy. The statement specifies that "PAH registries must be organized to reliably capture information concerning race/ethnicity and SES of patients" and that "Genetic screening of large populations should include patients with PAH belonging to minority groups and address the existence of unique genetic determinants". It adds that "SES should be included in the risk stratification to help identify patients with PAH who may be at greatest risk for noncompliance" and that "Hospitals, health insurers, and providers should be educated on the importance of data on key determinants of health and encouraged to increase their efforts to collect data such as SES as well as race/ethnicity". It further states that "Partnership with public health divisions, community-based health centers, and existing heart failure outreach programs should be encouraged to collect relevant data concerning adverse environmental exposures and clinical outcomes on vulnerable PAH populations". Education-focused directives include that "A cross-cultural curriculum should be mandatory and implemented early in medical training" and that "The PHA and other patient-centered organizations, with the help of specialists in the field, should develop more educational resources for patients and providers in minority communities". It also specifies that "Cross-cultural competence needs to be framed as a skill set — similar to a review of systems, or checklist — that can help providers manage challenging cross-cultural cases" and that "It must be seen as (a) practical, actionable, and time efficient, (b) should be taught in a case-based fashion that creates clinical challenges, (c) must be linked to evidence-based guidelines and the peer-reviewed literature, and (d) must leave students with a concrete set of tools and skills". The statement says that "Formal training courses should be developed that address health disparities and cross-cultural competency through online training/modules for accreditation" and tailored for PAH needs, and calls to "Increase awareness among physicians regarding the impact of implicit or unconscious bias toward particular population groups in the setting of PAH" and to "Increase the amount of racial and ethnic minority physicians in the healthcare provider workforce to promote race- and language- concordant patient–physician interactions". Finally, it urges to "Legislate governmental standards regarding access to cultural- and language-appropriate services across all healthcare organizations".

### Measuring patient-reported outcomes: moving beyond misplaced common sense to hard science [^115XeSEL]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

QoL is the primary outcome of relevance and importance to patients. When dealing with chronic diseases, the aim is frequently stated to be to improve the QoL of patients. This is particularly true where therapies cannot promise a cure or an extension to life. QoL is not intended to be an aid to diagnosis or a guide to the most appropriate intervention for a specific patient. However, its careful assessment should be able to determine which alternative interventions patients as a group would prefer within the context of a clinical trial. Despite this crucial role, there are several other requirements of clinical trials. For example, a product must be shown to improve objective health status and to be cost-effective. There are several chronic conditions for which steroid treatment improves QoL but does not necessarily improve the patient's health status in the long term.

The needs-based model of QoL resulted from analysing the transcripts from patient interviews conducted during the development of the Quality of Life in Depression Scale. Figure 2 illustrates how the function of employment fits into the needs model. The objective purpose of employment is to earn money. However, being employed can lead to the satisfaction of a wide range of needs. Depressed patients who were unable to be employed reported problems with structuring their days, with identity and status and with reduced social interaction. Such needs can also be met in different ways, for example, by doing voluntary work or by joining sporting or interest clubs. Research has shown that unemployed people who stay active in these ways are able to maintain their health.

The needs-based approach to QoL assessment has a number of advantages for measurement of the impact of disease and its treatment. Rather than asking directly about a function, it is possible to enquire about the needs that could be satisfied by that function. For example, questions about sexual performance are frequently left unanswered in questionnaires because of their irrelevance or unacceptability. The needs approach allows questions to be asked about needs related to sexual functioning that can also be satisfied in other ways, such as love, intimacy, touching and sharing with another person. The needs-based approach also copes well with patient adaptation. A chronically ill person can maintain a reasonable level of QoL by remaining independent through the use of aids and/or assistance. Patients who have activity limitations can still be shown to have a good QoL, as the concern here is the degree to which they can meet their needs, regardless of how this is achieved.

### Balancing stakeholder needs in the evaluation of healthcare quality improvement [^1159wcXT]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Consulting a wider variety of stakeholders confers three kinds of benefits. First, ethical practice is better assured, given that QI affects a broader range of people than evaluators might assume. Second, an evaluation is more likely to be useful, given that various perspectives and evaluation questions are considered from the start and employed to make sense of the results. Third, as this example demonstrates, there is a better chance that evaluation will have impact, because political buy-in is more likely — or at least, the danger spots will be known well in advance.

In the primary care example, the obvious stakeholders for QI evaluation were the healthcare organisations' patients, front-line practitioners and line managers. Yet other stakeholders had power over the situation, both for the improvement and for sustainability. Powerful stakeholders in other situations might include tax payers through their political representatives, patient care advocacy groups and those who have fiduciary responsibility system-wide to assure high quality care. Even for highly specific, local QI evaluations, why not highlight the effort to others, such as QI teachers and researchers, or those who might want to adopt the QI strategy elsewhere? A generic list of stakeholders, from a useful guide, can be seen in figure 1.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113GhQYa]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) vitamin D deficiency screening — research needs and gaps emphasize that more research is needed to determine whether total serum 25 (OH)D levels are the best measure of vitamin D deficiency and whether the best measure varies by subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, or sex; to determine the cutoff that defines vitamin D deficiency and whether that cutoff varies by specific clinical outcome or by subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, or sex; and that when vitamin D deficiency is better defined, studies on the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency will be helpful.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^112o6sPE]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) components and workforce implications are outlined. The figure defines inclusion as "Thoughts, ideas, and perspectives of all individuals matter", equity as "Constantly and consistently recognizing and redistributing power", diversity as "Multiple identities represented in an organization", and belonging as "An org that engages full potential of the individual, where innovation thrives, and views, beliefs, and values are integrated". The text states that "Underrepresentation and inequalities are pervasive in today's cardiovascular world", and that "Structures, cultures, and systems need to be reconfigured to address all aspects of DEIB… to effectively reduce disparities, to empower marginalized groups, and to eliminate injustice". It emphasizes "the need to achieve diversity within the cardiovascular workforce and its leadership to better reflect and represent the patients and populations served", notes that "The cardiology workforce includes proportions of women and Black, Hispanic, and Native American individuals that are lower than in the US population; there has been little improvement in the past decade", and records that the ACC and AHA "recognize the fundamental need to 'benefit from a diversity of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives in leadership, cardiovascular healthcare delivery, business, education and science'.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^112Z1CSi]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and legal aspects of care — Guideline 8.4 treatment and ongoing decision-making states that, within the limits of applicable laws and standards, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments. The patient's plan of care reflects ethical principles and the assessment of treatment preferences and is accurately documented to reflect the patient's previously stated goals in terms of providing, forgoing, and discontinuing care. The IDT ensures that existing treatments align with the patient's goals and the standard practices of care, and the team actively works to prevent medically non-beneficial care. When a family member or surrogate decision-maker seeks to override the patient's documented treatment decisions, the patient's preferences are reviewed, and ethics consultation is sought if needed, and failure to honor patient preferences is considered an ethical concern and is addressed by the IDT. Children receive open and honest, developmentally appropriate information about their serious illness and treatment options and are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making according to their wishes, age, and developmental capacity, and when the child's wishes differ from those of the adult decision-maker, staff is available to assist the child and family work towards a resolution, prioritizing fidelity to the patient. When parents or legal decision-makers express a strong preference for non-disclosure of a poor prognosis to a seriously ill child or adolescent, the IDT assesses family motivations and values regarding truth-telling practices and preferences; while it is sometimes ethically permissible to defer to family values regarding nondisclosure of prognosis, clinicians work collaboratively with the family to meet the child or adolescent's individual needs while respecting the parent or decision-makers' expectations and boundaries. All treatments provided are directed at the relief of suffering, in accordance with the doctrine of double effect, and the IDT educates the patient and family regarding the cost of care and financial burdens associated with treatment options. In cases where the wishes of the patient or surrogate conflict with the clinicians caring for the patient, processes are in place to honor clinician conscientious objection in a manner that ensures patients are never abandoned and continue to receive quality, safe care, and when treatments are forgone or discontinued, the IDT ensures appropriate symptom control at all times, as aligned with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

### The WHO-INTEGRATE evidence to decision framework version 1.0: integrating WHO norms and values and a complexity perspective [^111QhS5h]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

All criteria are important and should be reflected on, but their relevance varies depending on the type of health decision and the decision-making context. In contrast, not all subcriteria are always relevant. At the start of a guideline or other decision-making process, an appropriately composed guideline panel or other decision-making group needs to discuss which of the subcriteria are applicable and useful in relation to the nature and specific characteristics of the intervention (see table 1); this group will also need to consider the specific information needed to populate criteria or subcriteria (see table 3). Complexity in the intervention and complexity in the system into which this intervention is implemented can usually be detected; the critical question is whether it is of value to examine this complexity in depth (see box 1 in this paper and box 2 in an earlier paper in this series). This prioritisation process should take the views of relevant stakeholder groups into account; which stakeholder groups are relevant depends on the nature of the problem and the institutional as well as broader physical and social context. In principle, these should include those directly affected by the intervention (eg, patients, beneficiaries), those financing (eg, health insurance providers, ministries of health, other ministries) or implementing the intervention (eg, healthcare providers, public health professionals, professionals outside of the health sector), as well as the general public.

Table 3
WHO-INTEGRATE framework version 1.0: criteria and suggested types of primary studies, evidence synthesis methods and approaches to assessing quality of evidence

A systematic weakness in many guideline development and other health decision-making processes is that consumer participation is obviated and guideline panels often substitute their own values and views for those of patients/beneficiaries. The voices of patients/beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholder groups can be incorporated through direct participation or representative surveysas well as qualitative research (see table 3).

The guideline panel will also need to decide how best to populate the criteria with evidence and whether a formal evidence synthesis or a more pragmatic approach is warranted for each. This decision will be influenced by the relevance of criteria and subcriteria in relation to a specific intervention or decision, and by the likely types and quantity of evidence available, as well as time and resource constraints. At the end of the process, the guideline panel will need to reassess the criteria and relevant subcriteria in light of the assembled evidence and make a judgement regarding each criterion.

### A summary of guidance on addressing racial and ethnic health equity in systematic reviews and evidence-based guidelines [^113jnh31]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Racial and ethnic health equity is the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health and well-being among persons belonging to different racial and ethnic groups. This article summarizes current guidance and identifies practices for systematic reviewers and guideline groups to develop clinical practice guidelines that mitigate such inequities. Current guidance recommends that systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines ensure a wider perspective; identify, prioritize, and develop equity-focused topics and questions; and apply specific methods and processes to answer equity-focused questions. Ensuring a wider perspective involves incorporating persons with lived experiences and other relevant nonclinical expertise into review and guideline teams as well as engagement of patients and members of affected populations in the review and guideline process. Examples for identifying and developing equity-focused topics and questions include using health equity as a criterion to select and prioritize topics, developing topics specific to mitigating racial and ethnic health inequities, and addressing upstream drivers of inequities and implementation considerations. Appropriate methods and processes might include considering different types of study designs, selecting the type of review accordingly, and using suitable evidentiary frameworks and thresholds to answer a broader set of equity-relevant questions. Several review, health technology assessment, guideline, and other health care decision-maker groups are implementing guidance to address racial and ethnic health equity.

### Guardians for health: a practical approach to improving quality of life and longevity in people with type 2 diabetes [^112xn5bs]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality Monitoring

Quality assurance is achieved via the implementation of processes that define, ensure, maintain and improve quality, and is carried out by entities that are separate from those responsible for delivering the care. The only way to ensure best practice and outcomes whenever new guidelines or pathways are implemented is by way of quality assurance. This must be the bedrock of any healthcare improvement programme, and must show the positives and negatives of any intervention. Without measuring quality — whether in the form of patient-related outcomes, patient satisfaction or appropriate and timely use of therapies — it is not possible to justify a new programme to either patients or payers.

Quality assurance needs to be standardised, but also localised (i.e. there should be the same level of quality assurance across the board, and that assurance should be localised to the care provider and area). This is to ensure that the programme meets the criteria for cost effectiveness, safety and outcome measures. Monitoring should occur at regular intervals to ensure that the programme, pathway or guidance is being implemented and followed. Assurance can also be linked closely to key performance indicators, which can provide the necessary checks and balances to ensure sustainability and show proof of concept where needed. Quality assurance coupled with key performance indicators can provide the necessary information to indicate whether or not a programme is transferrable and reproducible in other areas. This can help to reduce variation in care and improve outcomes across the board.

### Clinical, technical, and environmental biases influencing equitable access to clinical genetics / genomics testing: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^112vgZEV]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG Statement — diversity, equity, and social constructs — defines diversity (population) as a nonhomogeneous group of people from varied backgrounds or beliefs and focuses on increasing underrepresented populations; characterizes inclusion as more than simple diversity, involving authentic and empowered participation with a true sense of belonging and full access to opportunities; defines equity as an ethical concept based on fairness and justice that focuses on outcomes most appropriate for a given group, recognizing different challenges, needs, and histories; describes justice as a future state in which the root causes of inequity have been dismantled and barriers removed; explains exploitation as the systematic transfer of the power of some persons or groups to others and a structural relation between social groups; describes social determinants of health as the conditions in which people are born and live shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources and mostly responsible for avoidable differences in health status; and clarifies race as a social and power construct not rooted in biology and ethnicity as social characteristics such as language, religion, regional background, traditions, and culture not rooted in biology.

### More quality measures versus measuring what matters: a call for balance and parsimony [^1144ww6t]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

If the USA continues with the proliferation of required quality measures, we will go from hundreds of required metrics to thousands. There are thousands of diseases, injuries, clinical states and interventional procedures that have a large and growing list of evidence-based care processes, and every special interest group could lobby for 'their' disease, injury or procedure to enjoy the 'legitimacy' and command for resources that are associated with being designated as a required quality metric. At the same time, providers of care have a genuine need to develop internal mechanisms to continuously measure and improve the processes of care delivery (ie, what they do) and the outcomes and costs of care that they provide.

We believe that if current trends in the growth of required quality measures continue, providers will need to invest so much money to report externally imposed measures that there will be scant funds left to support provider-specific internal measurement systems needed for monitoring and improving quality and for capturing longitudinal measures and cascading them to major clinical programmes and front-line clinical microsystems. Unchecked growth in mandated quality measures will lead to a commensurate growth in quality metric budgets devoted to 'required metrics' and thereby leave few 'discretionary' dollars to focus on internal quality measurement systems or on the results that matter most to the end users. In short, the drive to increase the scope and depth of required measures to judge quality could have the unanticipated consequence of decreasing providers' ability to manage and improve quality and meet our need for better quality, better outcomes and lower per capita costs.

To summarise, the growth in the number of publicly reported and externally mandated quality measures has generated positive and negative effects. We ask, has the time come to provide guidance and principles for the future development of quality metrics that providers are required to produce? We think the answer to this question is 'yes'. Even if we can shift some of the measurement burden to patients through greater reliance on patient reported measures, a development we support, the exponential growth of other measures will overtake our limited resources. Thus, the resources that might be devoted to 'end user' value will be diverted to cover a plethora of quality-performance metrics that may have a limited impact on the things that patients and payers want and need (ie, better outcomes, better care and lower per capita costs).

### Characterising complex health needs and the use of preventive therapies in the older population: a population-based cohort analysis of UK primary care and hospital linked data [^114Qdhpa]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Identification of patients with complex health needs

Following the recommendation of the NICE multimorbidity guideline, we used UK primary care data and inpatient records to select patients with complex health needs. The utilisation of primary care data allows for a systematic and comprehensive approach to identify potential target groups for preventive measures, who might benefit most from care optimisation. We defined patients with "complex health needs" as those individuals belonging to the top quintile of the distribution of the respective heath markers. While multiple definitions for polypharmacy and frailty are used side-by-side, we opted for a data-driven approach to identify the most vulnerable among the older population, allowing for a uniform definition applicable in different healthcare settings, data types and patient collectives. Access to large and representative population-based data allowed us to anchor our definitions based on their public health relevance.

Although the association between frailty, polypharmacy and healthcare utilisation has been described previously, no direct comparison of patient groups identified by these distinct markers has been done.

Polypharmacy

While no standard is agreed upon, the concomitant prescription of ≥ 5 medicines is considered polypharmacy, with ≥ 10 prescriptions referred to as excessive, severe or hyper-polypharmacy. While our approach to cumulatively assess drug use might overestimate the number of drugs taken concomitantly, it reflects the patients' treatment burden with respect to both acute and chronic indications over a long time, providing a pragmatic screening tool.

Healthcare utilisation

Prevention of unplanned and avoidable hospitalisations are a public health priority, as they present a major burden for the affected patients and substantial costs for the health care system. Our study found that 19.1% of the study population was admitted to hospital. Visits with general practitioners were significantly more common in the frailty, polypharmacy and overlap cohort compared to the background population, highlighting their complex health needs.

Frailty

While drug prescriptions and unplanned hospitalisations are well recorded in real world data, the assessment of a patients' frailty status is challenging. Physical and mental fitness vary greatly among patients of the same age and while a patient's frailty will greatly influence a general practitioners treatment decision, such characteristics are typically not recorded in primary care databases. Therefore, frailty is one of the most important confounders in pharmaco-epidemiological studies among the older population.

The concept of frailty rapidly evolved over the last two decades, with the two major concepts of "frailty phenotype" and "frailty indexes" being established. In recent years, different approaches have been developed to identify frailty in routinely collected data.

### Utilization review in worker's compensation: current status and opportunities for improvement [^1114WFfC]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Utilization review in workers' compensation — purpose, process, and goals are described as follows: utilization review (UR) "is intended to be a collaborative process in which proposals to perform medical service for reimbursement are compared with high-quality, evidence-based guidelines for the purpose of assuring that patients receive the reasonable appropriate care necessary while avoiding ineffective, potentially harmful, and low-value care". When proposed care does not align with a guideline, "a mutually respectful discussion needs to occur between the treating provider who is proposing care and the reviewing physician" to clarify whether "the guideline criteria are met and if not, is there a compelling medical rationale for departing from the guideline". The article states that "UR typically does not review causation and is not a guarantee of carrier payment" and that "when the UR process works well, patient care can be optimized, outcomes improved, risk of patient harm decreased, costs controlled, and care efficiently delivered". The document adds that "the fundamental goals of the UR process are to be "patient-centric" and return the worker to healthy function, noting these goals may be impeded if UR does not minimize conflicts of interest or function "in an efficient, expedient, fair, and confidential manner", and emphasizes that "open and transparent evidence-based guidelines are at the heart of an efficient UR process" and related criteria "should be stated clearly in peer-reviewed reports so the evidence-based criteria that were met or not met can be shared with treating providers and injured workers".

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^1143RW23]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines — scope and principles emphasize that Preferred Practice Patterns provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual, and that the Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations. The series is based on three principles: each Preferred Practice Pattern should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners; each recommendation that is made should be given an explicit rating that shows its importance to the care process; and each recommendation should also be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence that supports the recommendation and reflects the best evidence available. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation, and these practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results.

### Rehabilitation needs for older adults with stroke living at home: perceptions of four populations [^115Asqv2]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Socio-health system

At the medical care level, all the groups agreed on needs relating to financial and human resources (scarcity of resources), and most participants talked of difficulty accessing the services (delays and disparities) and obtaining follow-up. Partially met or unmet needs were reported at several levels of rehabilitation. For ease of understanding in Table 6, all the interventions aimed at improving a person's potential were classified under "rehabilitation", while those concerning adjustment to the human and physical environment were classified under "adjustment". Adjustment becomes necessary when an individual's rehabilitation has reached a plateau; at that stage the individual's disabilities must be compensated by the human or physical environment. The themes arising from the discussions indicate that rehabilitation is not often personalized to the needs of the patient and that, for reasons of budget and availability of resources, the emphasis is put more on evaluating patients than on rehabilitation activities. Lack of resources in psychology, speech therapy and neuropsychology was also reported. On the issue of adjustment, the caregivers and health professionals exposed a number of problems relating to services for adapting the patient's home or vehicle and with respect to obtaining technical assistance. In addition to the disparities and delays in the various services, there are also persistent problems in the continuity of these services. Furthermore, on the issue of adjustment, not enough support is given to patients and caregivers to identify the resources available to them in the community. Finally, the psychosocial support offered to families who are in the process of rehabilitation is not necessarily available at the right time. To sum up the needs with respect to the socio-health system, social assistance emerges as an unmet need that is criticized by many. Access to support groups for caregivers, sitting and respite services and temporary lodging remain unmet needs expressed by many participants.

Regarding the education system, with respect to other types of instruction (not related to academics), there is a pressing need to educate caregivers and to give the instruction at the right time. The need for education was discussed in all the groups and to a greater degree among the health professionals. Insofar as public infrastructure is concerned, only the need for accessible/adapted transportation or paratransit was described as being partially met or unmet. The issue of community resources was hardly raised at all; this appeared to be a little known subject by all the groups of participants. Finally, with respect to support from community organizations, the caregivers and health professionals were the two main groups who expressed concerns about needs in this area.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^111hv64n]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Applications to practice, research, and consultation — psychology services for diverse populations are framed by the Office of Minority Health's directive to "Provide effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs". Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are described as "the gold standard in service research" but "are costly and often fail to recruit the number from any specific identity group that would allow assessment of intervention effectiveness". From an organizational perspective, "there is a responsibility to ensure sufficient outreach to allow community feedback and monitoring of services", to ensure providers are "well versed in the practice of multicultural competence", and to provide community education on "signs and symptoms of behavioral health problems and how to access services". In practice, "members of diverse groups are less likely to seek help from mental health providers" and are "less likely to participate in research and interventions", and "less likely to continue in therapy or research once enrolled", with "Dropout rates among persons of color… generally higher than those found among non-Latino/Hispanic/Latinx, White/White American clients and participants". Reasons include "problems with the development of a therapeutic or research alliance, distrust, or a feeling that the intervention or research lacks relevance to the individual's life and circumstances", and reluctance "due to their legal status, stigma associated with mental health disorders, gender identity, and unfamiliarity with the idea of research or with the healthcare system".

### Current status of inclusion of older groups in evaluations of new medications: gaps and implementation needs to fill them [^115zvJjw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Under-representation of subgroups of the population in clinical trials has been and continues to be a problem despite goals of academia, industry, and government. Older adults are among the groups that are under-represented in trials of medications that they are likely to receive once marketing approval has been received. Recent legislation that mandates that clinical trial participants be representative of patient population has been passed and creates hope that greater numbers of older adults will be enrolled in clinical trials and that they will be representative of "typical" geriatric patients. However, there is the need for collection of current data on disease prevalences with granularity as to age, gender, and race as well as geriatric co-morbidities to assess the representativeness of clinical trial participants relative to patient populations. Consensus on definitions and collection of data relevant to geriatric patient populations are needed to evaluate effects of comorbidities, frailty, cognitive and physical function. There will also be a need for expansion of the geriatric research workforce, facilities for research both in academic centers but also in the community and long-term care facilities, and for engagement with and involvement of communities that have been traditionally under-represented to conduct clinical trials that enroll truly representative patient populations.

### Medicare part D research and policy highlights, 2012: impact and insights [^117G6mrL]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the 6 years since the implementation of Medicare Part D in the United States, the program has been reported to improve quality, offer better beneficiary protections, and lower drug costs.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to highlight the latest key peer-reviewed research findings on Medicare Part D and major public policy initiatives for Part D for 2012.

Methods

PubMed was searched for studies on Medicare Part D published in 2011 in biomedical/scientific, peer-reviewed, English-language journals. For the policy update, sources included the Federal Register, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, the 2012 Final Call Letter, and guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Results

Medicare Part D has been associated with increased medication utilization, reduced out-of-pocket expenditures, and an overall decrease in cost-related non-adherence and nonpersistence. Its impact on reduction in non-drug utilization of health services has been more apparent after the transition year in 2006 and among subsets of Medicare beneficiaries. Recent policy changes promise to make Part D more user-friendly, simplify choice, and offer greater protection to beneficiaries. The coverage gap will phase out by 2020. Both the quality rating system for prescription drug plans and medication therapy management programs were enhanced.

Conclusions

Although Part D was designed to improve drug benefits, improvements may be needed in plan selection and simplification, quality assessment (especially with regard to long-term impact and health outcomes), evidence-based improvements in medication therapy management, and disparities among priority subpopulations. Medicare Parts A, B, and D could be coordinated to offset costs by increasing medication expenses and decreasing expenses for nonprescription medical services, thereby improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the Medicare program.

### People are primary: a perspective from the keystone IV conference [^112mjn72]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

As a person invested in personal doctoring, what promises are you willing to make about when and where you will "be there" for others? Attendees of the G. Gayle Stephens Keystone IV Conference answered that question on submitted index cards and through ongoing conference discussions. Those data were analyzed using grounded theory and combined to develop the following answer in aggregate: We will be held accountable to those who need us. We understand the need for expertise and compassion as we help others to navigate the intersection of science and humanism. We will serve as leaders in personal, public, and political conversations. We will mark a path for the profession ensuring alignment of personal practices with professional principles. We will not allow the needed conversations of processes, data points, and determinations of value to undermine our relationships with our patients. We will be there for you. Attentive and fully present. We will care for you when you have no need and you do not ask. We will center that care in your lived experience of health and illness, knowing you over time. We will be here for you now, over time and across distance, in ways that foster the feeling of wholeness and belonging. We will use the best knowledge, best tailored to meet our shared understanding of your goals and aspirations.

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^115oJNuy]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The final AGREE instrument consists of 23 key items (Table 1

Table 1
The AGREE instrument) categorised into six domains (see:). Each domain is intended to measure a separate dimension of guideline quality.

Scope and purpose (items 1–3): These items are concerned with the overall aim of the guideline, the specific clinical questions and the target patient population.

Stakeholder involvement (items 4–7): These items focus on the extent to which the guideline represents the views of its intended users. Guideline development needs to be carried out by a multidisciplinary group involving all stakeholders whose clinical activities are likely to be covered in the proposed guideline. This also includes patient groups.

Rigour of development (items 8–14): These items relate to the process used to gather and synthesise the evidence, and the methods used to formulate the recommendations and to update them. The recommendations should be explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. However, because most current guidelines use a mixture of 'expert' judgement and literature review, disclosure of disagreement or uncertainties encountered during the development may help to clarify the process. Guidelines should be reviewed externally before publication, and the process used clearly described. They should also always include a date of publication, and because guidelines need to reflect current research, they should contain a clear statement about the updating procedures.

Clarity and presentation (items 15–18): These items deal with the language and format of the guidelines. Since the main role of guidelines is to help clinicians and patients make better decisions, busy clinicians need simple, patient-specific, user-friendly guidelines that are easy to understand. Good guidelines present clear information about the management options available and the likely consequences of each. This information can be presented in a variety of formats to suit the needs of the user.

Applicability (items 19–21): These items cover the likely organisational, behavioural and cost implications of applying the guidelines. Guidelines should be feasible to use in the current organisation of care and must fit into routine practice and the time constraints present. In addition, review criteria should be developed that link the guideline use to audits and other quality improvement initiatives.

### Standards of practice for nutrition support nurses [^113jh487]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2007). Medium credibility.

A.S.P.E.N. standards — level of care and terminology indicate that the standards of practice represent a range of competencies that should be provided by any NSN within or outside the context of a formal nutrition support service or team, and the application of standards in any individual case should be determined by the best judgment of the NSN. The standards are presented in the most generic terms possible, with details of patient care left to the discretion of the individual NSN, healthcare professionals, nutrition support services, or teams, and they aim to assure sound and effective nutrition care for patients in all healthcare settings in need of nutrition support therapy. Terminology includes: "Shall indicates standards strictly to be followed", "Should indicates that among several possibilities, one is particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required", and "May indicates a course of action that is permissible within the limits of recommended practice".

### High need patients receiving targeted entitlements: what responsibilities do they have in primary health care? [^114BNXHk]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

Patient responsibilities in primary health care are controversial and, by comparison, the responsibilities of high need patients are less clear. This paper aims to suggest why high need patients receiving targeted entitlements in primary health care are free to have prima facie special responsibilities; why, given this freedom, these patients morally have special responsibilities; what these responsibilities are, and how publicly funded health systems ought to be able to respond when these remain unmet. It is suggested that the special responsibilities and their place in public policy acquire moral significance as a means to discharge a moral debt, share special knowledge, and produce desirable consequences in regard to personal and collective interests. Special responsibilities magnify ordinary patient responsibilities and require patients not to hesitate regarding attendance for primary health care. Persistent patient disregard of special responsibilities may necessitate limiting the scope of these responsibilities, removing system barriers, or respecifying special rights.

### Rehabilitation needs for older adults with stroke living at home: perceptions of four populations [^115EoJRy]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Sociocultural factors

Just one sociocultural factor was discussed: the social network. This aspect remains an unmet need that was identified unanimously by the caregivers, health professionals and patients alike. The main points raised concerned relations with family, friends and organizations promoting awareness in the community.

Physical factors

At the development level of the DCP model's physical factors, partial and unmet needs were addressed, if succinctly, in terms of architecture, national and regional development and technology related to medical devices or assistive technology used by people with stroke.

Needs related to life habits

Table 7 presents all the themes that emerged per life habit according to the Disability Creation Process. Eleven life habit areas were documented out of a possible twelve; only "Education" was not discussed. One life habit was the subject of heated discussions in all the groups: interpersonal relationships. The managers and patients in particular reported various problems persisting in relationships with friends, family members, partners, other patients and in the community. The issue of carrying out personal care at home also emerged as an unmet need and was discussed by all four groups, more especially by the health professionals. The main difficulties lie in dressing, use of the toilet, and personal hygiene. Travelling short and long distances was also reported as a widespread problem, but only by the caregivers and the patients. Eating food and maintaining a healthy body and mind were problematic life habits, mainly for the patients. The health professionals in particular underlined the persistant difficulty in carrying out leisure activities. Finally, the problem of sending and receiving messages was raised by the caregivers and health professionals, with respect to the need for more stimulation in oral and written communication. Finally, four life habits were discussed that could not be compared among the four groups: habits related to housing, taking responsibilities, community life and employment (including volunteer activities).

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^114EBf3j]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Serious illness — definition and care needs are outlined, noting that individuals who are seriously ill need care that is seamless across settings, can rapidly respond to needs and changes in health status, and is aligned with patient-family preferences and goals. In this document, serious illness is defined as "a health condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either negatively impacts a person's daily function or quality of life or excessively strains their caregiver". The text emphasizes that providing "crisis-care" to individuals with a serious illness whose ongoing care needs are poorly managed has resulted in increased health care spending that does not necessarily improve quality of life, and that patients with serious illness and their family caregivers are seldom able to have their care needs reliably met, leading to symptom exacerbation crises and emergency department visits and/or repeated hospitalizations. It also highlights unmet care needs across all ages and areas of the country that burden families and the US health care system.

### Balancing stakeholder needs in the evaluation of healthcare quality improvement [^115THoEd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Quality improvement (QI) efforts affect a broader range of people than we often assume. These are the potential stakeholders for QI and its evaluation, and they have valuable perspectives to offer when they are consulted in planning, conducting and interpreting evaluations. QI practitioners are accustomed to consulting stakeholders to assess unintended consequences or assess patient experiences of care, but in many cases there are additional benefits to a broad inclusion of stakeholders. These benefits are better adherence to ethical standards, to assure that all legitimate interests take part, more useful and relevant evaluation information and better political buy-in to improve impact. Balancing various stakeholder needs for information requires skill for both politics and research management. These challenges have few pat answers, but several preferred practices, which are illustrated with practical examples.

Improving access while supporting patient culture, values, and preferences — panel discussions highlighted the challenges patients face in finding adequate mental health treatment and particularly access to evidence-based interventions; consequently, the panel encourages clinicians to strive to address potential barriers to treatment with the patient, and clinicians are encouraged to engage in shared decision-making with the patient to ensure that the patient's needs and wants are taken into consideration. The panel identified many such barriers to adequate treatment from the research literature and from feedback from individuals with lived experience, and these barriers generally fell into two categories: structural barriers (all related financial costs, affordable transportation, clinic hours and locations, and childcare) and attitudinal barriers (experiences of racial, ethnic, and cultural bias), with practical examples listed in the table below.

### Primary care: the next renaissance [^111ofrBr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Three decades ago, a renaissance helped create the foundations of primary care as we know it today. In recent years, however, new challenges have confronted primary care. We believe that the current challenges can be overcome and may, in fact, present an opportunity for a new renaissance of primary care to address the needs of our population. In this paper, we suggest seven core principles and a set of actions that will support a renaissance in, and a positive future for, primary care. The seven principles are 1) Health care must be organized to serve the needs of patients; 2) the goal of primary care systems should be the delivery of the highest-quality care as documented by measurable outcomes; 3) information and information systems are the backbone of the primary care process; 4) current health care systems must be reconstructed; 5) the health care financing system must support excellent primary care practice; 6) primary care education must be revitalized, with an emphasis on new delivery models and training in sites that deliver excellent primary care; and 7) the value of primary care practice must be continually improved, documented, and communicated. At the start of the 21st century, a vital, patient-centered primary care system has much to offer a rapidly changing population with increasingly diverse needs and expectations. If we keep the needs of persons and patients clearly in sight and design systems to meet those needs, primary care will thrive and our patients will be well served.

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^11169hab]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

PROBLEMS WITH GUIDELINES

Various problems with guidelines and their development that can impede their maximal use and profit have been reported:

Lack of quality: There are currently too many low-quality guidelines. There seems to be a 'guideline industry' emerging in many Western countries with a considerable variation in guidelines from different sources. Physicians and other professionals are probably overwhelmed by all these guidelines, particularly since guidelines on the same topic sometimes present different recommendations for practice. Many of the current guidelines have not been developed in a rigorous and systematic way, and are not based on the best evidence or present the vested interests of specific parties, including health-care industries. A series of recent studies assessing the quality of clinical guidelines show that many guidelines do not meet important quality criteria. The unsystematic development of guidelines can contribute to this low quality (Burgers et al, 2003a).

Lack of evidence: A second problem is that despite a rigorous search and analysis of the scientific literature, clear evidence is available for only part of the practical actions and decisions recommended in the guidelines. There is a large grey area where expert opinions, practitioners' and patients' preferences as well as societal priorities are more important in the development of guidelines than research results. When evidence is missing, reliable procedures for including expert opinions and stakeholders' preferences are required; such procedures are not present in many guideline development programmes.

Translation of evidence into recommendations for practice: Even when evidence has been summarised, it is often difficult to translate it into recommendations for practice. Guideline users deal with a more heterogeneous population of patients and more complex health-care processes than those covered in the original research. Most cancer clinical research deals with separate diagnostic or treatment decisions in selected samples of patients, while the practice of cancer care usually involves dealing with complex multidisciplinary care processes in a variety of patient groups. There has been very little research into the best way to manage such processes and chains of related actions and decisions by different care providers. Also, it is not easy to translate guideline recommendations into decisions in practice, since guidelines can never cover all the relevant clinical details necessary for individual patients. Most guidelines fail to take these issues into account.

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^112wHnfz]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (community-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of community-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (660 female, 500 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 community-based care (care provided by a social worker, nurse, or licensed therapist care consultant) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.5 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.61 to 0.37). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.5 points vs. 10.6 points; MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.74) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.42 points vs. 4.69 points; MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.27) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.2 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.29). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, community-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^114QDKfE]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Collaborative treatment planning in psychological practice — psychologists seek to participate in collaborative treatment planning with patients and others when appropriate. Shared decision-making is the process through which the psychologist, the patient, and, when appropriate, others jointly discuss treatment options to develop a treatment plan consistent with the patient's goals and needs, and treatment planning typically includes consideration of the relative benefits and risks of each treatment option as well as the possibility of no treatment, and it is documented as part of the informed consent process. Psychologists strive to engage patients and appropriate others in collaborative discussions about treatment, typically begin treatment planning by ensuring that patients understand their rights and responsibilities related to treatment in accordance with the ethical mandate for informed consent, and seek to share information about different treatment methods, the efficacy of each method, and the associated risks and side effects; they also acknowledge when the efficacy of a particular treatment has not been adequately evaluated. When recommending a treatment, they strive to rely on the best available research, their clinical expertise, applicability of the treatment to the setting and patient characteristics, as well as patient values and preferences, and they aim to avoid treatments that have been discredited or found harmful. Psychologists actively seek patients' input during treatment planning, frequently inquire about patients' goals for treatment and work towards agreement on how they will collaborate to achieve these goals, aspire to respect their patients' autonomy and do not coerce them to participate in an unwanted or aversive treatment, and in most cases, the patient makes the final treatment decision. Exceptions include situations involving immediate risk to the patient or others, crises and threats to safety or stability, or lack of decisional capacity; at times, crisis situations and patient safety may compel psychologists to provide services in the absence of patient consent, in which instances they attempt to involve relevant others in treatment decisions as appropriate and share important information and decisions with the patient to the extent possible, and when stabilization and safety are attained, more collaborative discussions can occur. When research evidence is limited, psychologists attempt to proceed cautiously based on the best available research relevant to the clinical situation, their clinical expertise, consultation with knowledgeable colleagues, and patient input; psychologists appreciate that no treatment is universally efficacious and that different patients may respond differently to any given treatment, and if a patient has a history of non-response to a given treatment, the psychologist attempts to understand why the prior treatment was not successful, tries to assess any current treatment barriers, and recommends the most suitable treatment course based on the information learned.

### Survivorship care for people affected by advanced or metastatic cancer: MASCC-ASCO standards and practice recommendations [^113cMj3h]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Standard 4: evaluated and communicated care specifies that ensuring the routine and systematic evaluation and monitoring of supportive care needs, along with appropriate referral to relevant survivorship care services and healthcare professionals, requires a foundation of established, multidirectional communication among all healthcare professionals and people affected by advanced or metastatic cancer. This holistic evaluation approach aids identifying the full spectrum of challenges experienced by this population, and aids tailoring and delivering quality cancer survivorship care. Moreover, effective communication in this context should be timely, clear, effective, respectful, and appropriate.

### Health-services utilisation amongst older persons during the last year of life: a population-based study [^113q4UR2]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Analyses of costs, both hospital and non-hospital costs, were beyond the scope of this project. While cost is not the only driver for considering healthcare options at end of life, data from other sources indicate that costs at this time of life are significant. Importantly, we were unable to explore the lived experiences of patients and their carers, individuals' goals and choices, or quality-of-life aspects of healthcare use during the last year of life. Although we observed high levels of hospital-based healthcare use in this cohort of older persons in the last year of life, we could not explore whether this met patient and carer expectations for end-of-life care. At a government level, policy planning could begin to address this by advocating for the inclusion of patient reported outcome measures - both in care and data sets - and by supporting the funding and adoption of models of care that truly reflect patient/family-centred approaches to care.

As detailed above, data capture was incomplete and or/dissatisfactory in a number of areas, including documentation of palliative care provision. There is great potential for health service evaluation to progress significantly if careful attention and consideration could be given at a health system level to the optimal suite of indicators that might routinely be collected to inform evaluation of care at this time of life. As examples, this might include enhanced service-related data - for example more detailed community and inpatient palliative care indicators as well data extracted from patient reported measures as they become more commonly available.

From a research perspective, specific exploration of other aspects of end-of-life care could enhance our understanding of our findings in this study which focussed on specific measures of hospital-based care. These could include, for example, specific exploration of the availability and accessibility of community and social supports (which might influence care settings and use of hospital-based services) and the impact that life-prolonging and symptomatic medications or interventions have on outcomes as these may benefit or burden patients towards end-of-life. In addition, focussed studies are needed to explore the needs of potentially vulnerable groups such as people with dementia, those living to extreme old age, and individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This could be complimented by studies which begin to specifically explore the reasons for some of our findings such as high rates of healthcare service use in certain patient subgroups, evaluation of appropriateness of care, and analyses of patients' and family caregivers' experiences and preferences during the end-of-life period.

These include demographic (for example, age, ethnicity, gender identity), social and economic (for example, employment status, living location, educational attainment), disease-specific (for example, having rare diseases) and health status-related (for example, having mental health conditions, having multimorbidities, being pregnant) characteristics. Failure to include research participants who represent target populations limits the generalizability of research findings. Different groups might respond differently to an intervention for a range of reasons. Without representative participation, clinical trials cannot capture differences in interventional response. This can introduce bias and affect research quality, resulting in a reluctance to offer interventions to specific groupsand contributing to health inequality and inequity.

Although improving the diversity of clinical trial participants is increasingly prioritized, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated the need to generalize research findings to groups experiencing the greatest health burdens. Minoritized populations, such as Black African and Caribbean and Southeast Asian groups in the UK, as well as Black, Hispanic and Native American communities in the United States, experienced disproportionate risks of severe COVID-19 complications and death yet are generally underrepresented in COVID-19 research. Underrepresentation is endemic in health research (for example, for groups marginalized by ethnic and racial status, gender, ageand having comorbiditiesor severe mental illness), limiting the value of research evidence when applied in broader clinical contexts.

Initiatives to improve research representativeness have emerged through an increased understanding of structural inequities resulting from historical and ongoing discriminatory practicesand their continued impact on individual and group outcomes. Equity focus in a healthcare context means deliberately considering the impact of research design and implementation, policies and practice on underserved groups to identify and address complex and multifactorial barriers. The US National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 acknowledged the underrepresentation of women and minority groups and addressed clinical research equity by requiring justification for their exclusion. Subsequently, the US Food and Drug Administration encouraged the inclusion of underserved groups, including older adults, womenand minority racial and ethnic groups, through interrogating inclusion criteria, promoting accessibilityand adopting an equity focus in specific clinical areas. In the UK, efforts have been led by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), including through guidance development.

### How to assess quality of primary research studies in the medical literature? [^114AQZxs]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Accuracy studies are the cornerstone of the evaluation of new diagnostic tests. In an accuracy study, patients with a clinical suspicion of disease undergo both the new tests that is being evaluated, and the reference test or "gold-standard" test for the disease. Patients are stratified according to the test result and to whether or not the diagnosis was confirmed by the reference test. Main accuracy indices include the sensitivity (proportion of patients who test positive among those who have the disease), specificity (proportion of patients who test negative among those without the disease), as well as the positive and negative predictive values (proportion of patients with the disease among those with a positive test, and of patients without the disease among those with a negative test, respectively). In appraising an accuracy study, the reader should check that the study design and analysis follow methodological standards. The study population should be representative of the population in which the test will be used in practice. The new test should be interpreted in a blinded and independent fashion from the reference standard to avoid expectation bias, and should not be used to establish the diagnosis (incorporation bias). The reproducibility should be verified. Interpretation criteria and technical aspects should be described with enough details to allow replication. Provided that these conditions are met, the next step is to decide whether the test may be used for patient care. The clinical setting in which the test will be used, and the corresponding pretest probability of disease, will determine how best can the test be used in practice.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis: an overview of key concepts, recommendations, controversies, and pitfalls [^112MYtpQ]. Academic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The field of radiology has witnessed a burst of technological advances that improve diagnostic quality, reduce harm to patients, support clinical needs, and better serve larger more diverse patient populations. One of the critical challenges with these advances is proving that value outweighs the cost. The use of cutting-edge technology is often expensive, and the reality is that our society cannot afford all the screening and diagnostic tests that are being developed. At the societal level, we need tools to help us decide which health programs should be funded. Therefore, decision makers are increasingly looking toward scientific methods to compare health technologies in order to improve allocation of resources. One of such methods is cost-effectiveness analysis. In this article, we review key features of cost-effectiveness analysis and its specific issues as they relate to radiology.

### Influencing health equity: role of the effective consumer scale in measuring skills and abilities in a middle income country [^116rR6Ep]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The 2008 World Health Report emphasizes the need for patient-centered primary care service delivery models in which patients are equal partners in the planning and management of their health. It is argued that this involvement will lead to improved management of disease, improved health outcomes and patient satisfaction, better informed decision-making, increased compliance with healthcare decisions, and better resource utilization. This article investigates the domains captured by the Effective Consumer Scale (EC-17) in relation to vulnerable population groups that experience health inequity. Particular focus is paid to the domain of health literacy as an area fundamental to patients' involvement in managing their condition and negotiating the healthcare system. In examining the possible influence of Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) on health equity, we used the recent translation and validation of the EC-17 scale into Spanish and tested Argentina as an example. Future plans to use the EC-17 with vulnerable groups include formal collaboration and needs assessment with the community to tailor an intervention to meet its needs in a culturally relevant manner. Some systematic reviews have questioned whether interventions to improve effective consumer skills are appropriate in vulnerable populations. We propose that these populations may have the most to gain from such interventions since they might be expected to have relatively lower skills and health literacy than other groups.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) — increasing payer awareness and knowledge: Healthcare professionals and patient advocacy groups should develop and disseminate information on the costs and cost-effectiveness of PR to payers. The process and outcomes of PR should be made more transparent to payers by PR service providers. Healthcare professionals should investigate the cost-effectiveness of PR in countries where this information is lacking. Respiratory disease societies and PR providers, in collaboration with primary care health professional groups and patient advocacy groups, develop methods of detailing the benefits, costs, and value of PR to be communicated to payers, enhance platforms and assure increased resources for communicating the effectiveness of PR to payers, and develop a coordinated advocacy strategy to facilitate incorporation of PR into healthcare systems and practices as a "standard of care" component of the overall integrated care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

### Perceived contraceptive counseling quality among veterans using VA primary care: data from the ECUUN study [^117Ne1gm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Veterans who are capable of pregnancy are one of the fastest-growing and most diverse groups of patients served by the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Among the population of over 200,000 Veterans aged 18–44 identified as women in VA administrative data, nearly half (48%) belong to a minoritized racial or ethnic group. Furthermore, this population has complex medical and mental health needs, as well as a high prevalence of psychosocial stressors such as homelessness, intimate partner violence, and sexual trauma, including military sexual trauma (MST). –

Providing reproductive health services that meet the needs of this population is a high priority for VA. Contraceptive counseling is one of the most commonly needed health services for people capable of pregnancy, including Veterans. With fewer than 10% of Veterans who are able to become pregnant actively seeking pregnancy, high-quality contraceptive counseling and care are critical to ensure Veterans can avoid unwanted pregnancy and achieve their family formation desires. National guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Office of Population Affairs outline key components of high-quality contraceptive counseling and care, which include recommendations that contraceptive care is provided in a patient-centered manner and that people have access to information about the full range of contraceptive options available.

Patient-centered care, as defined by the National Academies of Medicine, is care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensures that patient values guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered counseling is particularly important for contraception, which is a preference-sensitive decision in which people have multiple options and the best option depends on individuals' assessment of the relative importance of different characteristics or potential outcomes. Studies demonstrate that people's preferences about contraception vary widely, such as how important it is that a method is effective at preventing pregnancy or whether or not a method contains hormones. Furthermore, explicitly prioritizing preferences, needs, and values in communication about contraception is particularly critical for low-income people and Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, given the USA's long history of abuses of reproductive autonomy through coercive practices and policies related to contraception and sterilization in those populations.

### Defining complex patient populations: implications for population size, composition, utilization, and costs [^114Zcajj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Interventions to support patients with complex needs have proliferated in recent years, but the question of how to identify patients with complex needs has received relatively little attention. There are innumerable ways to structure inclusion and exclusion criteria for complex care interventions, and little is known about the implications of choices made in designing patient selection criteria.

Objective

To provide insights into the design of patient selection criteria for interventions, by implementing criteria sets within a large health plan member population and comparing the characteristics of the resulting complex patient cohorts.

Design

Retrospective observational descriptive study.

Subjects

Patients identified as having complex needs, within the membership population of Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, population-based health plan with more than 4 million members. We characterize five commonly used archetypes of complex needs: high-cost patients, patients with multiple chronic conditions, frail elders, emergency department high-utilizers, and inpatient high-utilizers.

Measures

We selected an initial set of criteria for identifying patients in each of the archetypical complex populations, based on available administrative data. We then tested multiple variants of each definition. We compared the resulting patient cohorts using univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics.

Key Results

Overall, 32.7% of the 3,112,797 adults in our population-based sample were selected by at least one of the 25 definitions of complexity we tested. Across definitions the total number of patients identified as complex ranged from 622,560 to 1583 and complex patient cohorts varied widely in demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, healthcare utilization, spending, and survival.

Conclusions

Choice of patient population is critical to the design of complex care programs. Exploratory analyses of population criteria can provide useful information for program planning in the setting of limited resources for interventions. Data such as these should be generated as a key step in program design.

### The need for research in primary care [^114R539X]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Making evidence from scientific studies available to clinical practice has been expected to directly improve quality of care, but this expectation has not been realised. The notion of quality of care is complex, and quality improvement needs medical, contextual, and policy evidence. In primary care, research is needed that takes into account the specific characteristics of its population and the presentation and prevalence of illness and disease. The context of the doctor-patient encounter plays a major part, and needs better understanding. At the policy level, issues of equity must be addressed. The knowledge base for family practice must be expanded by integration of multiple methods of comprehension, so we can bridge the gap between evidence and practice.

### Transforming health care through the medical home: the example of heart failure [^111NVzbM]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Amid ongoing legislative efforts to achieve universal coverage and reduce costs while improving quality of care, heart failure represents a major public health problem, challenging us to restructure systems of reimbursement and care. The "medical home" represents the best option for aligning and incentivizing multidisciplinary groups of providers to optimize decision-making for individual patients and the population, at large, and to compete based on quality and cost. For the medical home to meet the needs of patients with heart failure, it must eliminate barriers and facilitate collaboration among specialists, primary care physicians, and other providers. It must provide sufficient expertise for the complex and diverse population of heart failure patients to individualize recommendations that range from heart transplant to palliative treatments. Where appropriate, patients should be offered the choice between an emphasis on quality versus quantity of life. Although rewards and penalties based on specific externally driven metrics may be useful as an intermediate step in the current fee-for-service environment, this approach has important limitations and should transition quickly to a medical home approach. The current drive to change US health care should seek to transform our system of reimbursement and care to one that provides for continuous multidisciplinary management of all patients, including those with complex, chronic conditions such as heart failure.

### Special populations: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^111Decgj]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Special populations — research needs and planning conclusions emphasize that there is a paucity of research evidence to direct care for special populations during mass critical care, leaving recommendations based on expert opinion and small case series. Patients on dialysis appear to have an advantage in disaster planning because hemodialysis is done in registered centers and long-term patients can be tracked, and this has allowed governmental, professional, and advocacy groups to develop a proactive and reactive support network during disasters. A central data bank of patients with chronic diseases who require homogeneous treatment, such as oxygen supplementation, would help governmental, advocacy, and professional society stakeholders to streamline care during a disaster as well as develop the continuum of crisis standard of care guidelines for the initial critical care of special populations. Cumulatively fragile and chronically ill patients need to be preidentified and considered during disaster planning, and preparation on all levels is necessary to mitigate a disaster's impact on this population who will likely decompensate and may need scarce critical care resources. The model offered by KCER is a template that may prove useful in other special populations.

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^112Mr2mK]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (health system-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of health system-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (688 female, 472 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 health system-based care (care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.8 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.33, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.67). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.7 points vs. 10.6 points; MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.99) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.7 points vs. 4.69 points; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.55) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.1 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, health system-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### Transferring patients home to die: what is the potential population in UK critical care units? [^115dgka1]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of the study was to determine the size and characteristics of the critical care population who could potentially be transferred home to die, based on a set of predetermined criteria about clinical parameters. Approximately 20% of patients who died in ICU and HDU environments in our sample met these criteria and could therefore potentially be considered for transfer home to die, should this be their wish. These patients are likely to be those who are breathing spontaneously, not requiring cardiovascular support and not having complex care needs.

This is the first large scale study to quantify this particular critical care population. In doing this, it takes the reporting in this area beyond case reportsand provides more detailed information on the types of patients for whom transfer home may be an option. This may help inform the debate about how patient wishes at end of life might be addressed in critical care.

This study has only explored physiological and care delivery indicators to determine size and characteristics of this group. Individual preferences, cultural and spiritual factors and availability of healthcare resource can significantly influence decisions about transferring patients' home to die. These factors need further consideration. The data collection tool was developed for the adult population. Any replication studies outside this field for example, neonates, paediatrics will require refinement of the data collection tool.

### Coproduction: when users define quality [^113gr49Z]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

How might coproduction be part of mainstream healthcare?

What is different in a coproduction approach?

A coproduction cycle

In a traditional approach to long-term conditions, assessment and diagnosis lead to unilateral recommendations. The patient is then asked to monitor whether the treatment is effective. Follow-up adjustments are done as needed by the clinician. This approach can often be successful, but there is a well-known risk that unilateral recommendations may not align well with individual priorities, preferences or constraints, and so problems occur.

Coproduction is different because it involves a collaborative process (see figure 1), where an individual's goals help determine the plan, as well as professionally set targets, guidelines or clinical recommendations. What might appear to be a subtle shift of power can lead to a profound difference in roles and approach. The clinician and patient work together to coassess the patient's situation, paying attention to the impact of illness on the patient's life and well-being. Critical, to codeciding the best treatment is based on an explicit discussion of the patient's goals regarding symptoms, function and other priorities, such as key milestones in life. The third step, codesigning the care plan, takes other contextual factors into account, and critically considers how the patient and their families could contribute. In this design process, a number of different capabilities to codeliver the care will be considered and leveraged.

Figure 1
Coproduction cycle: cooperation for optimal care.

Role shifts

Coproduction demands new work from everyone: it relies on patients sharing their concerns and goals, participating in decisions, and in many situations learning to manage long-term conditions. Clinicians need to become curious about patients' goals and work collaboratively to codecide and codesign care, so that care can be codelivered. These new roles require new skills and often significant attitude changes.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^112Lvd5y]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and Legal Aspects of Care — IDT ethics infrastructure emphasizes that IDT protocols are developed to ensure patient and family access to ethics resources and support in all care settings. IDT members maintain professional boundaries with clear role expectations while balancing objectivity with caring compassion, and attention is paid to patient and family cultural and spiritual values that impact care preferences and potentially conflict with clinicians' values; the IDT is aware that cultural factors can influence decision-making and autonomy. Guidance is provided to surrogate decision-makers about the legal and ethical basis for surrogate decision-making including honoring the patient's known preferences, substituted judgment, and best-interest criteria, and social justice principles and costs of care are considered in the allocation of resources across all populations to improve the health outcomes of seriously ill people and address healthcare disparities. IDTs without ready access to ethics consultation identify avenues to access consultations and resources (eg, consult with specialty palliative care experts or establish a collaborative relationship with a medical center ethics program), and ensuring IDT sustainability and avoiding clinician burnout is considered an ethical obligation in all care settings to preserve team members' health and ability to remain engaged in palliative care.

### Practical assessment and management of vulnerabilities in older patients receiving systemic cancer therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114H8EuU]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — equity and clinical trial participation notes that the accrual of older adults into clinical trials remains well below their representation as patients with cancer, and most of those enrolled in current trials are White, more highly educated, with greater access to care, and of greater functional capacity. Just as older adults have been systematically excluded from clinical trials, so have many other vulnerable groups based on race, sex, gender, country of origin, disability status, non-English language use, and other forms of discrimination. The GA has been shown to improve communications and patient and family satisfaction with care, suggesting a mechanism to improve outcomes for vulnerable groups; thus, utilization of the GA and facilitating GAM care should improve health equity in clinical trial evaluation and may help to narrow the gap that exists in health care decision making and considerations for trial inclusion for vulnerable populations with cancer. Structural changes to address these systematic exclusions, such as economic support and transportation provision, are needed, and beyond trial exclusion, the widespread adoption of GA and GAM, which depends on having the necessary resources to implement and act upon them, would enhance the clinical care for those most in need of it. ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^116pkyC9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Expanded carrier screening — panel content thresholds and limitations are described: Carrier screening panels should not include conditions primarily associated with a disease of adult onset, and for some conditions (eg, β-thalassemia and Tay–Sachs disease) the genetic testing method offered by the panel may not be the most sensitive method of carrier detection, so the need for ancillary screening methods for such disorders should be considered. Selection of conditions with a carrier frequency of 1 in 100 or greater, which corresponds with a disease incidence of 1 in 40,000, is a useful threshold, but some conditions are so rarely seen outside of a particular ethnic group that a population-wide carrier rate cannot be calculated and, therefore, only the ethnic-based carrier rate is known; thus, for these conditions, a residual risk calculation is not possible. The large number of disorders being screened may result in more than one half of patients being found to be carriers for one or more disorders, which could result in the need for additional testing for a woman's partner, extensive genetic counseling, and increased anxiety.

### Allergy and immunology practice parameters and guidelines: the new normal [^111fzCPK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Revised classification (Table 2) — recommendation rating scale with clinical implications specifies: Strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B); clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C); clinicians also should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Weak option means that the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in decision making and be alert to new published evidence; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Strength categories in this revised schema also include LB (Laboratory based) and NR (Not rated).

### Evaluating an integrated primary care approach to improve well-being among frail community-living older people: a theory-guided study protocol [^111WggfF]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Quality of integrated primary care for frail community-dwelling older people

In order to effectively redesign primary healthcare for frail community-living older people, it is important to consider promising components of successful innovative primary care approaches aimed at supporting their needs to realize well-being. An overall state of well-being is determined by an older person's ability to achieve universal goals of social and physical well-being that are, in turn, achieved through five instrumental goals (stimulation and comfort for physical well-being and status, behavioral confirmation, and affection for social well-being). Integrated care in the primary care setting is expected to support these needs and therefore improves or protects well-being. Earlier research already showed that quality of care affected the well-being of community-dwelling COPD patients. Integrated care is defined as 'a well planned and well organized set of services and care processes, targeted at the multi-dimensional needs/problems of an individual client, or a category of people with similar needs/problems'. The World Health Organization, for example, stated that by introducing integrated care, health services will be more responsive to frail older people's needs. A systematic review of Eklund and Wilhelmson indeed provided some evidence regarding the benefits of integrated care for frail community-dwelling older people. In general, these integrated care approaches consist of multiple interrelated components, such as proactive case finding, case management, medication review, self-management support, and working in multidisciplinary teams. Efforts to improve primary care for frail older people should integrate these promising interrelated components in order to assure that activated, informed older adults can productively interact with prepared, proactive healthcare professionals of primary care teams. Still, we lack understanding of the underlying mechanisms that explain how integrated primary care delivery affects outcomes. Earlier research investigating mechanisms explaining the effectiveness of integrated care showed that cognitive and behavioral components of healthcare professionals and older patients drive effectiveness in terms of productive patient-professional interactions and well-being.

### Development and validation of the FRAGIRE tool for assessment an older person's risk for frailty [^113WxS8n]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants

A prospective multicenter recruitment of older people (> 60 years old) was undertaken between May 2013 and July 2013 in Bourgogne-Franche Comté, France. Patients belonged to the GIR 5 (people need occasional help with bathing, meal preparation and housekeeping) and 6 (people still autonomous for the main activities of daily life) groups of dependency (Additional file 1). Elderly subject in states GIR 5 and 6 cannot benefit from a systematic personal autonomy allowance from French institutions, but in particular situations they may receive a financial help of 3500 euros/year (pension additional plan [PAP]) for the following benefits: home care including cleaning, laundry, help with shopping and meal preparation; meal deliveries; little assistance with using the toilet, or home installation improvement. To be eligible for the PAP attribution elderly need to detail the motivation for such request. Whatever the amount of the retirement pension received, the elderly people could be eligible for the financial help weighted according to the pension received.

Patients selection was based on a hypothesis that the elderly in GIR 5 and 6 populations who claim the PAP, contrary to those who do not (the groups matched by age and gender), are probably more at risk to become frail and thus represent an acceptable surrogate population for frailty prediction.in GIR 5 and 6 population who are not yet frail. Based on this hypothesis, the subjects were classified into one of two groups: financially helped (FH, with financial assistance) group and non-financially helped (NFH, without any financial assistance) group.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for each population are described in Additional file 2. Written consent was obtained from all subjects and the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^1176y6C2]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 6: Cultural aspects of care — communication, workforce practices, evaluation, staffing preferences, and community assessment are addressed as follows: Communication occurs using verbal, nonverbal, and/or symbolic means appropriate to the patient, with particular attention to cultural and linguistic considerations, cognitive capacity, the presence of learning or developmental disabilities, and the developmental stage across the lifespan. The IDT implements policies regarding recruitment, hiring, retention, and promotion practices to reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the community it serves, to the extent possible. The care team regularly evaluates and, if needed, modifies services, policies, and procedures to maximize cultural sensitivity and reduce disparities in care. Input from patients, families, and community stakeholders is elicited and integrated into this process. The IDT is aware of cultural factors that may necessitate changes in staffing assignments (eg, a patient who can only receive hands-on care from someone of the same gender). Policies and procedures are in place to identify these issues and substitute staff, when possible, so that patient preferences are respected. The IDT performs a community assessment to identify underserved populations in need of palliative care.

### Revascularisation of patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis: bypass surgery versus PCI-analysis of routine statutory health insurance data [^1126yt8R]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations and external validity of health insurance data

Registries usually have to rely on complete and accurate information without being able to validate the data. Since they are especially set up for future analyses, variables which are not routinely provided can be included in the report forms. Registries provide larger and more unselected data sets than clinical trials, although here source data verification guarantees valid information of the selected group of patients who met the inclusion criteria.

Using health insurance data for large-scale outcome analyses has become increasingly popular and compared to study and registry data they hold a number of advantages. The most obvious advantage is the large sample size and the completeness of available data, thus avoiding selection and recall bias. In particular data from clinical trials exclude a large number of patients, often older and multimorbid. Health insurance data also have the great advantage of providing intersectoral data from the inpatient and outpatient healthcare system.

On the other hand, health insurance data are not originally generated to analyse processes and patient outcome but are primarily needed for budgeting and reimbursement. Thus, valuable information is lacking, including data on coronary anatomy, quality of life and lifestyle-related risk factors. Also, specific budget regulations can cause particular coding behaviour. Additionally, data from one health insurance do not necessarily represent the whole population of one country.

One limitation of secondary data analyses is caused by a lack of international coding of diseases (ICD-10) codes for the clinical classification of diseases. There is no specific ICD code for patients with ESRD by which these patients can be identified. We therefore chose to select patients with ESRD on the basis of the dialysis procedure rather than ICD codes.

Patient outcome after revascularisation is dependent on the chosen revascularisation strategy, and on the quality of postrevascularisation care. This important factor is not reflected in the current analysis.

### Cultural competence education for health professionals [^112T9S6y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cultural competence education for health professionals aims to ensure all people receive equitable, effective health care, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. It has emerged as a strategy in high-income English-speaking countries in response to evidence of health disparities, structural inequalities, and poorer quality health care and outcomes among people from minority CALD backgrounds. However there is a paucity of evidence to link cultural competence education with patient, professional and organisational outcomes. To assess efficacy, for this review we developed a four-dimensional conceptual framework comprising educational content, pedagogical approach, structure of the intervention, and participant characteristics to provide consistency in describing and assessing interventions. We use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in terms used by study authors.

Objectives

To assess the effects of cultural competence education interventions for health professionals on patient-related outcomes, health professional outcomes, and healthcare organisation outcomes.

There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and controlled clinical trials of educational interventions for health professionals working in health settings that aimed to improve: health outcomes of patients/consumers of minority cultural and linguistic backgrounds; knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals in delivering culturally competent care; and healthcare organisation performance in culturally competent care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the conceptual framework as the basis for data extraction. Two review authors independently extracted data on interventions, methods, and outcome measures and mapped them against the framework. Additional information was sought from study authors. We present results in narrative and tabular form.

Main Results

We included five RCTs involving 337 healthcare professionals and 8400 patients; at least 3463 (41%) were from CALD backgrounds. Trials compared the effects of cultural competence training for health professionals, with no training. Three studies were from the USA, one from Canada and one from The Netherlands. They involved health professionals of diverse backgrounds, although most were not from CALD minorities. Cultural background was determined using a validated scale (one study), self-report (two studies) or not reported (two studies). The design effect from clustering meant an effective minimum sample size of 3164 CALD participants. No meta-analyses were performed. The quality of evidence for each outcome was judged to be low. Two trials comparing cultural competence training with no training found no evidence of effect for treatment outcomes, including the proportion of patients with diabetes achieving LDL cholesterol control targets (risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02; 1 study, USA, 2699 "black" patients, moderate quality), or change in weight loss (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.55, 1 study, USA, effective sample size (ESS) 68 patients, low quality). Health behaviour (client concordance with attendance) improved significantly among intervention participants compared with controls (relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 women, low quality). Involvement in care by "non-Western" patients (described as "mainly Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean and Surinamese patients") with largely "Western" doctors improved in terms of mutual understanding (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality). Evaluations of care were mixed (three studies). Two studies found no evidence of effect in: proportion of patients reporting satisfaction with consultations (RD 0.14, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.31, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality); patient scores of physician cultural competency (SMD 0.11 95% CI -0.63 to 0.85, 1 study, USA, ESS 68 "Caucasian" and "non-Causcasian" patients (described as Latino, African American, Asian and other, low quality). Client perceptions of health professionals were significantly higher in the intervention group (SMD 1.60 95% CI 1.05 to 2.15, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 "Black" women, low quality). No study assessed adverse outcomes. There was no evidence of effect on clinician awareness of "racial" differences in quality of care among clients at a USA health centre (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.94. P = 0.07) with no adjustment for clustering. Included studies did not measure other outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analyses using different values for the Intra-cluster coefficient (ICC) did not substantially alter the magnitude or significance of summary effect sizes. All four domains of the conceptual framework were addressed, suggesting agreement on core components of cultural competence education interventions may be possible.

Authors' Conclusions

Cultural competence continues to be developed as a major strategy to address health inequities. Five studies assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals on patient-related outcomes. There was positive, albeit low-quality evidence, showing improvements in the involvement of CALD patients. Findings either showed support for the educational interventions or no evidence of effect. No studies assessed adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence is insufficient to draw generalisable conclusions, largely due to heterogeneity of the interventions in content, scope, design, duration, implementation and outcomes selected. Further research is required to establish greater methodological rigour and uniformity on core components of education interventions, including how they are described and evaluated. Our conceptual framework provides a basis for establishing consensus to improve reporting and allow assessment across studies and populations. Future studies should measure the patient outcomes used: treatment outcomes; health behaviours; involvement in care and evaluations of care. Studies should also measure the impact of these types of interventions on healthcare organisations, as these are likely to affect uptake and sustainability.

### New "Core quality measures": only a beginning [^112jooQ4]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A plethora of quality measures are used in health care for quality improvement, accountability (including reimbursement), and research. The Core Quality Measures Collaborative, with input from the American Association of Family Physicians, recently released several groups of reduced core measure sets, including one for primary care. The proposed measures are less helpful for the increasing proportion patients with multiple morbidities or advancing illness. Going forward, the development of quality measures that assess multidimensional patient experiences and how closely the health care patients receive matches their goals in the face of multiple morbidities and advancing illness should be the focus.

### A national cohort study of community belonging and its influence on premature mortality [^111LDQW1]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Social relationships have been shown to influence overall well-being and life satisfaction. Community belonging, in particular, describes the sense of connection and identity people share within a group or community. Several indicators related to social cohesion are associated with increased levels of physical activity, increased use of preventive health servicesand reduced risks for poor health and mortality.

Supporting a strong sense of community belonging and related social infrastructure is thus a promising upstream target for government policies and health systems to improve population well-being. However, there is limited insight into how the influence of community belonging on health may vary across the life course. Previous cross-sectional work has demonstrated life stage-specific variations in the level of community belonging and the strength of its association with population health outcomes, such as self-rated health, but a lack of cohort studies that consider life stage remains a gap. This is an important consideration given that people transition into and out of milestone social roles throughout their lives, during which the importance of community and how this specific need for belonging is met may vary. This study focuses on premature mortality, which has not been studied in relation to community belonging and is a particularly relevant population health outcome because such deaths are considered avoidable and reducible through treatment and preventative policy interventions.

This study aims to fill the gap in the literature and to estimate the baseline influence of community belonging on premature mortality in the future across three life stages: early, middle and late adulthood.

### Delphi analysis of how the practice team should organise event analysis in primary care [^113zaaCM]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Important to consider human factors as this helps to drive concentration on systems rather than individuals. Too often we still see self analysis rather than (analyse the) system.

Alignment with policies and guidelines

it is crucial that supporting evidence in professional guidelines and policy is used to justify decisions taken but also an exploration if the SAE identifies any shortcomings in current policy/guidelines.

Meeting outcome- action and followup

I think if learning needs / actions are identified then we do as a team need to act on those findings to reduce the risk of any further SEA in relation to the same thing. Having action points helps to create a useful summary and then also having a timeframe to ensure completed.

I think that it is helpful for the family to know what action has been taken and the outcome of any discussion.

Recording and dissemination

Agree with insertion of "Ideally" - until protected time is (ideally) contracted for this - meanwhile just maintaining a file doesn't create action or improvement - the aspiration would be each practice should maintain an action log regarding practice learning events.

### Combining qualitative and quantitative operational research methods to inform quality improvement in pathways that span multiple settings [^112jBJYG]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

Combined OR

In the final workshop, the operational researcher drew on learning from the Rich Picture and conceptual models (Activity Diagrams) to guide structured decision-making about feasible and acceptable service improvements, and on the data visualisation to facilitate a process of targeting these at patient groups. The qualitative and quantitative OR approaches were therefore both integral to the decision-making process, and complementary in that neither approach could have fulfilled the role of the other. At the end of the workshop, the Working Group had agreed on a coherent set of targeted recommendations for service improvement deemed acceptable from each professional perspective as well as desirable and feasible from a system perspective (see ref.for details of the recommendations themselves).

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^111sam4M]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — assessment instruments in diverse populations emphasize that applying standard tools can lead to erroneous conclusions when clients belong to groups facing nonstandard problems or translation errors, and that some populations, including Latino/Hispanic/Latinx elders, are more likely to express somatic symptoms indicative of depression; assessment tools that omit somatic symptoms may therefore have the potential for underestimation of depression. The psychologist seeks to understand that assessment tools may function very differently in different populations, with findings that only one of six items revealed different outcomes on an ethnic identity measure comparing Black/African American/Black American and White/White American adults, whereas Kim and colleagues found differential item functioning in 80% of items on a depression scale comparing Mexican American and White/White American elders and 10% of items when Blacks/African Americans/Black Americans and White/White Americans were compared. While the significance of differential item responses is ambiguous, the differences raise the possibility that instrument scores may not reflect underlying problems across different groups, and this is particularly true for less studied groups, such as the LGBTQ+ and refugee communities; investigating prior use of the instrument with the target audience can be informative. For interventions, one strategy to deal with the potential misfit of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and evidence-based treatments (EBTs) is to adapt them to the needs of the target population, but the danger of EBT adaptation is that the resulting intervention is no longer evidence-based, unless additional research specific to the adaptation is conducted; hence the psychologist strives to review culturally adapted interventions for evidence of fidelity to the original approach and to balance fidelity with fit of the intervention to the client's needs. The document notes that culturally adapted research and intervention is a hallmark of community-based participatory research (CBPR), and that the latter is a form of community-engaged research.

### Implementation strategies for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^113BW2qd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A key function of health systems is implementing interventions to improve health, but coverage of essential health interventions remains low in low-income countries. Implementing interventions can be challenging, particularly if it entails complex changes in clinical routines; in collaborative patterns among different healthcare providers and disciplines; in the behaviour of providers, patients or other stakeholders; or in the organisation of care. Decision-makers may use a range of strategies to implement health interventions, and these choices should be based on evidence of the strategies' effectiveness.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the available evidence from up-to-date systematic reviews about the effects of implementation strategies for health systems in low-income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on alternative implementation strategies and informing refinements of the framework for implementation strategies presented in the overview.

Methods

We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ-Evidence up to December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well-conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of implementation strategies on professional practice and patient outcomes and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the review findings. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence) and assessments of the relevance of findings to low-income countries.

Main Results

We identified 7272 systematic reviews and included 39 of them in this overview. An additional four reviews provided supplementary information. Of the 39 reviews, 32 had only minor limitations and 7 had important methodological limitations. Most studies in the reviews were from high-income countries. There were no studies from low-income countries in eight reviews. Implementation strategies addressed in the reviews were grouped into four categories - strategies targeting:1. healthcare organisations (e.g. strategies to change organisational culture; 1 review);2. healthcare workers by type of intervention (e.g. printed educational materials; 14 reviews);3. healthcare workers to address a specific problem (e.g. unnecessary antibiotic prescription; 9 reviews);4. healthcare recipients (e.g. medication adherence; 15 reviews). Overall, we found the following interventions to have desirable effects on at least one outcome with moderate- or high-certainty evidence and no moderate- or high-certainty evidence of undesirable effects.1. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers: educational meetings, nutrition training of health workers, educational outreach, practice facilitation, local opinion leaders, audit and feedback, and tailored interventions.2. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers for specific types of problems: training healthcare workers to be more patient-centred in clinical consultations, use of birth kits, strategies such as clinician education and patient education to reduce antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care settings, and in-service neonatal emergency care training.3. Strategies targeted at healthcare recipients: mass media interventions to increase uptake of HIV testing; intensive self-management and adherence, intensive disease management programmes to improve health literacy; behavioural interventions and mobile phone text messages for adherence to antiretroviral therapy; a one time incentive to start or continue tuberculosis prophylaxis; default reminders for patients being treated for active tuberculosis; use of sectioned polythene bags for adherence to malaria medication; community-based health education, and reminders and recall strategies to increase vaccination uptake; interventions to increase uptake of cervical screening (invitations, education, counselling, access to health promotion nurse and intensive recruitment); health insurance information and application support.

Authors' Conclusions

Reliable systematic reviews have evaluated a wide range of strategies for implementing evidence-based interventions in low-income countries. Most of the available evidence is focused on strategies targeted at healthcare workers and healthcare recipients and relates to process-based outcomes. Evidence of the effects of strategies targeting healthcare organisations is scarce.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^117FNhqn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Clinical Guideline Centre methods — quality standards are defined as statements that act as markers of high-quality, cost-effective patient care and are based on the best available evidence using clinical guidelines if they exist. The standards are not limited to using only "strong" recommendations as their basis; other NHS Evidence–accredited sources may also be used if required. Methods for producing quality standards are currently being developed in light of feedback from the first few pilot topics. Quality standards can be used in many ways, including in national audit, to monitor quality improvements, to show that high-quality care is being provided, to highlight areas for improvement, and they can be used by patients and the public to find out about the quality of care they can expect to receive from their health care provider.

### Mapping outcomes in quality improvement and system design activities: the outcome identification loop and system impact model [^111qwSdC]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Filtering, converging, iterating and stopping

As figure 4 's loop implies, it is possible to continue elaborating the impact model almost indefinitely — stopping criteria are required. As a minimum, the process should ensure that stakeholders and outcomes of the greatest concern have been identified. The impact model should contain, on the left-hand side, those outcomes directly influenceable through QI intervention and on the right-hand side, outcomes experienced directly by stakeholders. Beyond this, OIL can be used to elaborate the impact model and test its validity until the end user judges it to be sufficient.

To focus the OIL process on the outcomes of greatest concern, it is important to prioritise the content of the impact model periodically, filtering out unnecessary detail. This means assessing the relative importance of outcomes as they are identified. Outcome valuation in complex systems is not a trivial task and it is subject to the limitations of 'bounded rationality'. To compensate for this, it might be necessary to revisit and update impact models in multiple outcome-identification exercises or workshops. It is possible to accommodate impact model iterations within QI cycles, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act iterations.

Completing the SIM: criteria for setting the system boundary

Healthcare is complex, with outcomes emerging in different contexts, to various stakeholders. In the UK NHS, for example, where services are free at the point of access: costs, clinical outcomes and patient experience might appear quite removed from one another, but they all constitute value.

While some outcomes emerge within a system as intermediate factors and others emerge coincidentally, the most meaningful outcomes are those which we purposefully deliver or avoid. They are located at the boundary of the system being designed in QI and collectively model the value of the system to a given stakeholder group. As shown in figure 5, boundary definition in an impact model literally involves connecting sets of these 'boundary outcomes' of interest. This process completes the SIM for a stakeholder group.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on recognizing and responding to clinical deterioration outside the ICU: 2023 [^116RdEYv]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

RRT/MET goals-of-care education — Education/guidance for clinicians regarding discussions about patients' goals of care involved heterogeneous interventions that were associated with increased revelation and documentation of patients' goals of care preferences and change in resuscitation status, with no effects on palliative care consultations or functional status at discharge and uncertain effects on discharge to residential setting and lengths of stay. The panel considered it important that an emergency response team contain some members who are comfortable with discussing disease severity and goals of care and establishing treatment plans that best reflect a patient's wishes and prognoses, judged that the intervention improves communication and documentation around goals of care and may reduce administration of therapies inconsistent with patients' preferences and prognoses, and concluded that improved patient communication and choice outweighed potential undesirable effects and that clear documentation of goals of care discussions in the medical record is an essential element in this process; to enhance health equity, clinicians should 1) not approach goals of care discussions with a prespecified outcome in mind, 2) provide all patients with the opportunity to discuss their values and goals, regardless of race, ethnicity, and cultural background, and 3) adapt discussions to diverse languages and cultures.

### Telehealth: improving access to and quality of pediatric health care [^116Hc342]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Telehealth — pediatric access, standards, and resource needs — states that remote care coordinated by the medical home can improve access to both primary and specialty care for children when an in-person visit is not possible, and that pediatricians practicing remote care will be best able to ensure that these services meet the same standards of care as the services that they provide in person. Telehealth can help reduce inequities and improve children's overall health and well-being by expanding the reach of the medical home, particularly for children with special health care needs and children who have not had access to high-quality care in the past, and under-resourced communities can also have improved access to pediatric care, which requires adequate resource support for infrastructure to allow for equitable implementation. The time, effort, and medical decision-making required for a patient visit are largely unchanged whether care is delivered virtually or in person, and telehealth visits that require conversion to an in-person evaluation are currently paid as a single visit, while use of telehealth in a traditional practice setting does not reduce the need for office overhead expenses and can increase costs associated with technology; adequate payment for these services is necessary to ensure that they will continue to be available to children.

Domain 1: Structure and Processes of Care — care plan development and implementation centers the plan of care on the patient's preferences, needs, values, expectations, and goals, as well as the family's concerns; the IDT collaboratively discusses and documents patient status, patient and family needs, treatment options, and symptom management, and develops, implements, and coordinates the care plan with the patient and family, other clinicians, and community providers when indicated and possible. The care plan is always accessible to the patient, IDT, and other involved clinicians and, with the patient's consent, is shared with family, caregivers, and community providers, and it is updated and reviewed at regular intervals and when the patient experiences a significant change in status based on evolving needs and shifting priorities in goals of care. When appropriate, the patient is referred to hospice. The IDT facilitates implementation to ensure the patient and family have access to medications and treatments, that new medications, medical equipment, tests, and therapies are authorized by payers, and that the patient and family can safely and effectively manage and administer medications.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 731: group prenatal care [^114SENTC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Group prenatal care — conclusion and research priorities — experts suggest that "group prenatal care is an innovative and promising model with comparable pregnancy outcomes to individual prenatal care in the general population and improved outcome in some demographic groups", and studies "appear to demonstrate high levels of patient satisfaction, obstetric outcomes equally efficacious as individual prenatal care, and improved outcomes for some populations". Further research is needed because "group prenatal care offers a promising alternative for patients, their partners, and obstetricians and other obstetric care providers", with priorities that include clarifying effects "on patients at higher risk of preterm delivery, including black women, adolescents, and others", examining "the effect on partners", and evaluating adaptations that "have the potential to lower cost and increase the reach of group prenatal care and also deserve careful study", with "Long–term assessment of the effect of the group prenatal care model" and "Individual and group care models" both warranting additional study to identify populations that benefit most.

### Patient-mediated interventions to improve professional practice [^117GeMki]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Healthcare professionals are important contributors to healthcare quality and patient safety, but their performance does not always follow recommended clinical practice. There are many approaches to influencing practice among healthcare professionals. These approaches include audit and feedback, reminders, educational materials, educational outreach visits, educational meetings or conferences, use of local opinion leaders, financial incentives, and organisational interventions. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of patient-mediated interventions. These interventions are aimed at changing the performance of healthcare professionals through interactions with patients, or through information provided by or to patients. Examples of patient-mediated interventions include 1) patient-reported health information, 2) patient information, 3) patient education, 4) patient feedback about clinical practice, 5) patient decision aids, 6) patients, or patient representatives, being members of a committee or board, and 7) patient-led training or education of healthcare professionals.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of patient-mediated interventions on healthcare professionals' performance (adherence to clinical practice guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice).

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Ovid in March 2018, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in March 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) in September 2017, and OpenGrey, the Grey Literature Report and Google Scholar in October 2017. We also screened the reference lists of included studies and conducted cited reference searches for all included studies in October 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised studies comparing patient-mediated interventions to either usual care or other interventions to improve professional practice.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using Mantel-Haenszel statistics and the random-effects model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) using inverse variance statistics. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE).

Main Results

We included 25 studies with a total of 12,268 patients. The number of healthcare professionals included in the studies ranged from 12 to 167 where this was reported. The included studies evaluated four types of patient-mediated interventions: 1) patient-reported health information interventions (for instance information obtained from patients about patients' own health, concerns or needs before a clinical encounter), 2) patient information interventions (for instance, where patients are informed about, or reminded to attend recommended care), 3) patient education interventions (intended to increase patients' knowledge about their condition and options of care, for instance), and 4) patient decision aids (where the patient is provided with information about treatment options including risks and benefits). For each type of patient-mediated intervention a separate meta-analysis was produced. Patient-reported health information interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 26 (95% CI 23 to 30) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 17 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). We are uncertain about the effect of patient-reported health information interventions on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (very low-certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes and adverse events were not reported in the included studies and resource use was poorly reported. Patient information interventions may improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 42) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 20 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient information interventions may have little or no effect on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of patient information interventions on undesirable patient health outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. Patient education interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 46 (95% CI 39 to 54) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 35 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient education interventions may slightly increase the number of patients with desirable health outcomes (low-certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. Patient decision aid interventions may have little or no effect on healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 43) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 37 per 100 in the comparison group (usual care). Patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that two types of patient-mediated interventions, patient-reported health information and patient education, probably improve professional practice by increasing healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate-certainty evidence). We consider the effect to be small to moderate. Other patient-mediated interventions, such as patient information may also improve professional practice (low-certainty evidence). Patient decision aids may make little or no difference to the number of healthcare professionals' adhering to recommended clinical practice (low-certainty evidence). The impact of these interventions on patient health and satisfaction, adverse events and resource use, is more uncertain mostly due to very low certainty evidence or lack of evidence.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^113w6meS]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 2: Physical aspects of care — Practice Example D2-E (community-based home health and hospice agency) outlines a palliative care program that utilizes advanced practice providers who collaborate with the primary care provider and/or treating specialists and are supported by commercial insurance and Medicare Part B reimbursement. All home health patients are screened for palliative needs by the home health nurse — most people who screen positive have cancer or chronic progressive illnesses with recurrent hospitalizations — and social workers and chaplains from the hospice program collaborate actively with nurses in home health to develop a coordinated plan of care. The advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant engage with these patients simultaneously with home health, particularly when prescribing authority is needed, to facilitate continued support for high-risk patients once home health care goals are reached. Patient/family and provider satisfaction with the program is high, the hospice sees an increase in appropriate and timely admissions with program growth, and when eligible patients are admitted to hospice care they experience greater continuity with team members, identified as a key value-add to the program.

### SPIRIT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for protocols of randomised trials [^1113hDGC]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

The main goal of recruitment is to meet the target sample size (item 19). However, difficulties in recruitment are common in clinical trials. For example, a review of 151 trials from 2004 to 2016 funded by the UK Health Technology Assessment Programme found that 44% did not reach their recruitment targets. Inadequate enrolment reduces statistical power and can lead to early trial stoppage or to extensions resulting in delayed results and greater costs.

Strategies to promote adequate enrolment are thus important to consider during the planning of trials. Recruitment strategies can vary depending on the trial topic, context, and site. Different recruitment methods can substantially affect the number and type of trial participants recruitedand can incur different costs. Design issues such as the number and stringency of eligibility criteria will also directly affect the number of eligible trial participants.

Although most trials will use strategies to promote enrolment of participants, this information is often incompletely reported in trial protocols. For example, reviews of two samples of 108 and 292 trial protocols from 2016 found that less than 44% of protocols reported the location of recruitment, individuals to be recruited, or expected recruitment rate.

In the protocol, descriptions of where participants will be recruited (eg, primary care clinic, community), by whom (eg, surgeon), when (eg, time after diagnosis), and how (eg, advertisements, review of health records) can be helpful for assessing the feasibility of achieving the target sample size and the applicability of the trial results in practice. Other relevant information to explicitly provide in the protocol includes expected recruitment rates, duration of the recruitment period, plans to monitor recruitment during the trial, and any financial or non-financial incentives provided to trial investigators or participants for enrolment.

### Induction of labour: creation of a classification of grenoble allowing an assessment of the evaluation of practices [^112KFqQC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Concerning the groups 6 and 7, the allocation of each patient to one of the groups does not depend on the severity of the condition for which she is classified. It is not considered that a maternal pathology has priority over a fetal pathology. In case of maternal and fetal pathology in the same patient, it is necessary to know whether the maternal pathology is responsible for the fetal pathology. If this is not the case, we need to define which pathology makes the decision to induce. For example, in the case of a patient with severe pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation, the maternal pathology is responsible for the fetal picture and the patient belong to group 6. On the other hand, in the case of intrauterine growth retardation without pre-eclampsia, the patient belong to group 7.

The group of inductions without medical indication is an increasingly important part of this practice and varies greatly from one maternity hospital to another.

The single breech pregnancy (group 2) and multiple pregnancies (group 1) represent a small number of the population studied. However, their particularities did not allow them to be included in the other groups.

In order to classify each patient in her group, it is necessary to use a simple system based on a maximum of 7 successive questions (Fig. 2). The order of the groups has been defined according to the order of the questions to be asked. For each question, if the answer is positive, the patient is placed in the corresponding group. Conversely, if the answer is negative, the process is continued until a positive answer is given to one of the questions. If all the questions are answered in the negative, the patient is placed in group 8.

### Making useful clinical guidelines: the ESGAR perspective [^112NjEJi]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Step by step consensus process

Evidence selection and synthesis

The guideline development group will construct and circulate an initial questionnaire in order to identify the scope and aims of the guideline, and prioritise topics for detailed literature review. Thereafter, where possible these topics will be converted into specific clinical questions adopting the PICO format (patients/participants, intervention, control/comparators, outcomes). These clinical questions will then serve as the basis for the literature search. The literature search, including the databases used, search terms, inclusion dates and language restrictions, will be documented clearly and used uniformly by the guideline group. Relevant articles will be retrieved and summarised into evidence tables with accompanying explanatory text, including an assessment of the literature quality.

Consensus statements and committee voting

Using the evidence synthesis tables and explanatory text, the guideline group will construct draft consensus statements for the final guideline. Where the evidence is contradictory or incomplete, relevant statements can still be constructed, but may need to be based on the group's opinion with anonymous voting, using a modified Delphi process. Each voting member will be asked regarding their agreement with a given statement on a five-point scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree and strongly agree). For a statement to achieve consensus, 80% of guideline group members must agree or strongly agree with that statement. Statements not achieving consensus initially may be modified and subjected to repeat voting; a maximum of three iterations is suggested as the upper limit before a statement is defined as failing to reach consensus. Statements that do not achieve consensus may be included in the Discussion of the final guideline document, but should not be recommended by the group.

### The need to systematically evaluate clinical practice guidelines [^1133zqz4]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines abound. The recommendations contained in these guidelines are used not only to make decisions about the care of individual patients but also as practice standards to rate physician "quality". Physicians' confidence in guidelines is based on the supposition that there is a rigorous, objective process for developing recommendations based on the best available evidence. Though voluntary standards for the development of guidelines exist, the process of guideline development is unregulated and the quality of many guidelines is low. In addition, the few tools available to assess the quality of guidelines are time consuming and designed for researchers, not clinicians. Few guidelines are evaluated, either before or after their dissemination, for their impact on patient outcomes. Just as with pharmaceuticals and other products that can affect patients for better or worse, perhaps it is time to develop more standardized ways to evaluate the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines to ensure a similar balance between risk and benefit.

### Pragmatic measures: what they are and why we need them [^113NL18p]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pragmatic measures are important to facilitate implementation and dissemination, address stakeholder issues, and drive quality improvement. This paper proposes necessary and recommended criteria for pragmatic measures, provides examples of projects to develop and identify such measures, addresses potential concerns about these recommendations, and identifies areas for future research and application. Key criteria for pragmatic measures include importance to stakeholders in addition to researchers, low burden, broad applicability, sensitivity to change, and being actionable. Examples of pragmatic measures are provided, including ones for different settings (e.g., primary care, hospital) and levels (e.g., individual, practitioner, setting) that illustrate approaches to produce broad-scale dissemination and the development of brief, standardized measures for use in pragmatic studies. There is an important need for pragmatic measures to facilitate pragmatic research, guide quality improvement, and inform progress on public health goals, but few examples are currently available. Development and evaluation of pragmatic measures and metrics would provide useful resources to advance science, policy, and practice.

### Health outcomes in primary care: a 20-year evidence map of randomized controlled trials [^114HNjPS]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the given limitations, we systematically collected a compilation of published RCTs in PC and categorized them according to their primary outcome. We revealed potential research gaps in all types of health care, and in all types of interventions. It should be noted that identified gaps in our study may not necessarily be translated to research needs. However, our work may contribute to determine research needs after considering the importance, desirability, feasibility, and potential impact of identified research gaps, highlighting the necessity of stakeholder engagement in this process.

### A user guide to the American Society of Hematology clinical practice guidelines [^111tS5kE]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Interpreting strong and conditional recommendations — stakeholder perspectives outlines practical implications for different audiences. For patients, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation indicates "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action", while a conditional recommendation acknowledges "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations mean "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations", but conditional recommendations entail that "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and "On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence", whereas conditional recommendations are "likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adoption) by additional research".

### Assessment of unmet health-related social needs among patients with mental illness enrolled in Medicare advantage [^117Sv7vM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The CMS developed the AHC model, which provides funding for health care organizations to screen for HRSNs and develop the infrastructure needed to connect individuals with needs to community resources. Recipients can also use funding to develop networks and enhance coordination across community-based organizations. Through these community coalitions, multiple factors associated with mental health, such as housing, community violence, and education, can be addressed. In response, health care organizations are transforming to better coordinate care by broadening care teams, creating linkages to community organizations, and moving resources out of the clinic and into the community. Some have succeeded in improving outcomes and reducing costs, but these models require additional training and coordination among payers, practices, hospitals, and public health agencies. The need to refine, implement, and scale new models of delivering public health, mental health, and primary care has only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Public Health Implications

Although true integration of public health, mental health, and primary care remains a goal, value-based care payment models have led to important changes in the delivery of health care. By sharing data, reducing administrative barriers, and realigning financial incentives, these Medicare Advantage programs have reimagined how care is delivered for a wide range of patients with high-cost conditions, including beneficiaries with mental illness. The findings of this study also have implications for the payment and measurement of care. Given the importance of quality measures in value-based payment arrangements, organizations have called for measures to be adjusted to account for social risk factors and have released reports describing the rationale behind and the methods needed to make such adjustments. These calls have come in response to recognition that individuals with social risk factors have worse outcomes on quality measures and that clinicians caring for these patients have worse performance. Although this study did not assess the association between HRSNs and adverse patient outcomes or clinician performance, examining whether and to what extent HRSNs are associated with quality of care could guide improvements for patients with mental illness.

### Identifying and using good practice guidelines [^111MKCJ1]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Performance measurement and payment are increasingly linked to goals established by practice guidelines. The best guidelines are based on systematic reviews and patient-oriented evidence, use an evidence-rating system such as the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, and are prospectively validated. The guidelines also should have a transparent development process, identify potential conflicts of interest, and offer flexibility in various clinical situations.

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^111BQGg2]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study D-Health was published by Bridie Thompson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Acute ischemic stroke. In the D-Health study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in older adults? In the D-Health study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D-Health study, the population was: 21302 patients (9777 female, 11525 male). The inclusion criteria were adult participants aged 60–84 years. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism; kidney stones; osteomalacia; sarcoidosis; receipt of > 500 IU/day supplemental vitamin D; or unable to give consent because of language or cognitive impairment. In the D-Health study, the interventions were: n = 10658 vitamin D (oral dose of 60,000 IU/month for 5 years) n = 10644 placebo (matching oral placebo for 5 years). In the D-Health study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in major cardiovascular event (6% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01). In the D-Health study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) No significant difference in coronary revascularization (3.9% vs. 4.3%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01) No significant difference in stroke (1.6% vs. 1.6%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.23). In the D-Health study, the conclusion was: in adult participants aged 60–84 years, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular event.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^116eA2mL]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 5: Spiritual, religious, and existential aspects of care — Guideline 5.1 Global — patient and family spiritual beliefs and practices are assessed and respected, and palliative care professionals acknowledge their own spirituality as part of their professional role and are provided with education and support to address each patient's and family's spirituality. Palliative care interdisciplinary teams (IDT) serve each patient and family in a manner that respects their spiritual beliefs and practices, and the IDT has clearly defined policies and processes in place to ensure spiritual care is respectful of patient and family age, developmental needs, culture, traditions, and spiritual preferences. Either directly, through referral, or in collaboration with the professional chaplain, the IDT facilitates spiritual and cultural rituals or practices as desired by the patient and family, and IDT members respect patient and family beliefs and practices, never imposing their individual beliefs on others. The spiritual needs of family members may differ from those of the patient and are recognized and supported, and care of children, adolescents, and their family members recognizes that spirituality is integral to coping with serious illness and is provided in a developmentally appropriate manner. In all settings, the IDT includes professional chaplains who have evidence-based training to assess and address spiritual issues frequently confronted by pediatric and adult patients and families coping with a serious illness; the professional chaplain is the spiritual care specialist, conducting the assessment and addressing the spiritual aspects of the care plan. Professional chaplains develop community partnerships to ensure patients have access to spiritual care providers trained and supervised by a professional chaplain, and the IDT and community spiritual care providers share information and coordinate services.

Implementing shared medical appointments to reduce hospital admissions for patients with diabetes using GTO: a further illustration

We now illustrate how GTO would approach the same problem, following the steps in table 2. The first three evaluation steps correspond roughly to the three fundamental questions of the model for improvement in figure 1, and are designed to find an appropriate solution to the problem. To begin the GTO process at the health clinic, the leaders of the health system work with personnel in the health clinic to develop a GTO team, comprising clinic administrators, healthcare providers and patient representatives. The GTO team begins with Step 1: Needs and Resources Assessment and addresses the needs and resources of the clinic's patients. The team answers these questions using methods that include data compiled from electronic health records and interviews with health clinic staff and patients. The data suggest that the majority of persons with diabetes are diagnosed with type II diabetes and that providers find it difficult to address behavioural and psychosocial determinants of diabetes management in 15 min appointments. Resources identified include: staffing person/hours, administrative and healthcare support (including the use of the electronic health record system).

In Step 2, the GTO team sets goals and objectives to determine progress. Findings from the needs and resources assessment are used to identify goals and desired outcomes for the clinic's patients. The GTO team sets goals at both the patient (eg, reduce individual blood glucose levels within 6 months) and clinic levels (eg, decrease hospital admissions due to disease management, decrease healthcare costs). In Step 3: Best Practices, the GTO team identifies evidence-based practices that may be used to reach goals set in Step 2. The team reviews the literature and discusses options with other staff knowledgeable about strategies for addressing diabetes. Several options for meeting the goals include: (1) individual self-management, (2) group self-management and (3) shared medical appointments. Introducing shared medical appointments is attractive, since research suggests shared medical appointments have demonstrated positive patient benefits (eg, improved blood sugar values) and clinic benefits (eg, reduced clinic visits for diabetic patients). At the end of Step 3, the GTO team arrives at the same conclusion as the model for improvement team — shared medical appointments are a good best practice to consider using in the clinic.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^11746XSD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study D2d was published by Anastassios G Pittas and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements. In the D2d study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency? In the D2d study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D2d study, the population was: 2423 patients (1086 female, 1337 male). The inclusion criteria were adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency. The key exclusion criteria were any glycemic criterion in the diabetes range affecting the glycated hemoglobin level; use of diabetes or weight-loss medications; use of supplements containing vitamin D at a dose > 1,000 IU/day or calcium at a dose > 600 mg/day. In the D2d study, the interventions were: n = 1211 vitamin D supplementation (at a dose of 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplementation) n = 1212 placebo (matching placebo). In the D2d study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of new-onset diabetes (9.39 events /100 py vs. 10.66 events /100 py; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.04). In the D2d study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypercalcemia, fasting urine calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.375, low eGFR, nephrolithiasis. In the D2d study, the conclusion was: in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of new-onset diabetes.

### Participant characteristics and exclusion from phase 3 / 4 industry funded trials of chronic medical conditions: meta-analysis of individual participant level data [^115RaFgn]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard to measure the effectiveness of a new intervention or treatment because of their high internal validity. Women, older people (especially of 70 years and older), people with multi-morbidity, and people from ethnic minorities are inadequately represented in trials and therefore underserved. This systematic under-representation undermines the generalisability of trial findings and confidence in the selection of optimal treatment strategies for these groups. Furthermore, this under-representation poses ethical issues: healthcare policies based on trials that are not inclusive widens health inequalities, which can undermine broader public confidence and willingness of underserved populations to participate in health research. The trial forge guidance 3 seeks to provide practical guidance on how better to recruit and retain participants from ethnic minority groups. However, despite commitments from funders, journal editors, trialists, and policy makers to improve the recruitment and retention of people from underserved populations, no changes over the past decade are evident.

To become a trial participant, individuals undergo two rounds of selection: an invitation to the screening phase and a screening phase proper (figure 1). In the invitation phase, individuals receive and accept an invitation to attend screening. Such invitees are identified using diverse methods, including routine clinical encounters, prescreening using electronic patient databases, and usually by members of healthcare staff rather than the research trial team. Under such diverse prescreening methods, the invitation to screening phase may be a major source of inequity in participation in research, which poses a serious threat to external validity.

Figure 1
Schematic of the barriers to trial completion

In the screening phase, trial staff apply formal inclusion and exclusion criteria (based on demographic and clinical characteristics) to individuals, and eligible people are invited to participate. Ineligibility has been reported as a primary reason for screen failure across trials in varied index conditions; however, uniformly applied eligibility criteria may disproportionately and unconsciously restrict participation of underserved populations. For example, minimum thresholds for kidney function commonly restrict participation of individuals with chronic kidney disease: seen more commonly among women (compared with men), people with multimorbidity, and race or ethnic groups other than white. Additionally, underserved populations may be disproportionately excluded by human biases in the application of subjective eligibility criteria (in the opinion of the investigator).

### Conscientious commitment, professional obligations and abortion provision after the reversal of… [^115K9Mj9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

This might be difficult to establish in certain cases. Some would say that in every case in which a woman requests an abortion, the abortion is in her best medical interest because the counterfactuals mentioned above matter for the purpose of determining the best medical interest. Others would say that it is only in a woman's best medical interest when not receiving an abortion would result in some physical or mental health impairment for the woman because of the continuation of the pregnancy. Addressing these issues requires providing a definition of health that allows to determine whether a woman's health can be said to be negatively affected by the failure to obtain a safe abortion. Here, we just want to point out that according to this criterion, this is the kind of issue that would need to be settled by professional organisations to determine when abortion provision falls within the proper scope of professional practice.

Many, including many medical professionals and some sectarian professional bodies (such as the Catholic Medical Association), believe that the best medical interest of the fetus should be factored in. Indeed, the US States that will prohibit abortion will likely do so precisely because many people living there believe that a fetus has moral status that warrants protection of the fetus' interests and rights.

Now, the moral status of the fetus is a contested issue, e. How much priority should women have over foetuses, when it is not their life to be at stake, but their health or perhaps just their preference? This is a difficult question to answer. However, on the assumption that it is at least reasonable to think that foetuses do not have a moral status that outweighs the value of women's health and autonomy, the 'best medical interest' criterion implies that at very least doctors will be professionally justified in providing abortions to women in jurisdictions where it is illegal, when there is a serious threat either to their life or to their health. After all, they are acting on an ethical view, that is, by hypothesis, reasonable according to the ethical standards of the profession. Whether they are also professionally required depends on whether stronger ethical claims about the lack of moral status of foetuses and, therefore, their status as patient can be made, but we will not discuss this here.
