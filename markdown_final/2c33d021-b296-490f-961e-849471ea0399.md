## Question

Levothyroxine to heal peptic ulcer disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether levothyroxine can be used to heal peptic ulcer disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about levothyroxine's approved indications and whether any guideline or label supports its use in peptic ulcer disease. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care therapies that actually heal peptic ulcers and the strength of that evidence. Next, I will examine potential pharmacologic interactions between ulcer therapies and levothyroxine that might be driving the question. After that, I need to consider formulation strategies for levothyroxine when acid suppression is necessary. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable conclusion with monitoring recommendations and guardrails from endocrine and gastroenterology guidance.

> Let me first confirm the indication for levothyroxine; I need to ensure I'm not missing any off-label evidence for ulcer healing. Levothyroxine is indicated for hypothyroidism and related scenarios such as TSH suppression in differentiated thyroid cancer, not for gastrointestinal ulcer disease, and there is no label or guideline suggesting a role in peptic ulcer healing, so I should be careful not to extrapolate beyond its endocrine use [^112HeKzG] [^113yCqyy] [^notfound]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if levothyroxine had any plausible ulcer-healing mechanism, it would likely appear in gastroenterology guidance or large reviews, yet authoritative sources on ulcer management focus on acid suppression, Helicobacter pylori eradication, and NSAID modification rather than thyroid hormones, which supports that levothyroxine does not heal ulcers [^111ouN86] [^112REd7m] [^117HW5ag].

> Next, I should review what actually heals peptic ulcers to anchor the comparison. Proton pump inhibitors achieve high rates of ulcer healing within 4–8 weeks depending on ulcer size, while eradication of H. pylori and cessation or mitigation of NSAIDs are critical disease-modifying steps that dramatically reduce recurrence, which I should emphasize because these are the proven levers rather than thyroid hormone manipulation [^111ouN86] [^117HW5ag]. I will now examine acute care contexts; for bleeding peptic ulcers, early endoscopy plus high-dose PPI protocols reduce rebleeding and mortality, whereas eradication therapy is recommended for H. pylori–positive bleeding ulcers to prevent recurrence, again with no role for levothyroxine in ulcer control or hemostasis [^113bg1h3] [^113Ben1u] [^1139Lwma].

> Wait, let me verify the suspected interaction that might be causing confusion here. The consistent signal in endocrine literature is actually in the opposite direction: gastric acid suppression and other high-gastric-pH states impair levothyroxine tablet dissolution and absorption, leading to higher LT4 dose requirements, rather than levothyroxine benefiting the ulcer physiology, which is a key clinical distinction I need to make explicit [^112S5Ffy]. Mechanistically, tablet LT4 dissolution is optimal at gastric pH 1–3, drops below 60% by pH 4, and to less than 40% by pH 5, and PPI-induced hypochlorhydria can necessitate approximately a 30–40% LT4 dose increase to maintain target TSH, confirming the directionality of concern [^112S5Ffy] [^112qaJAX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a small volunteer study suggesting famotidine or esomeprazole did not significantly alter acute LT4 absorption over 8 hours; I should double-check how that fits with the broader body of evidence. That negative short-term finding in healthy subjects does not outweigh multiple clinical series showing sustained biochemical impact of chronic PPIs on LT4 control and the robust pH–dissolution data; thus, the weight of evidence still supports clinically meaningful malabsorption with acid suppression in real-world hypothyroid patients on LT4 tablets [^115GZgXu] [^112S5Ffy] [^112qaJAX].

> I will now examine whether formulation changes can mitigate this problem if a patient legitimately needs both PPI therapy for ulcer disease and thyroid replacement. Switching from tablet to liquid LT4 corrects PPI-induced malabsorption with significant TSH reductions at the same microgram dose, and soft gel capsules show relative pH-independence with preserved exposure under PPI coadministration, which I should consider first-line strategies before escalating LT4 dose when acid suppression cannot be avoided [^112twjrb] [^113fJ9eB] [^112MpcZD].

> Let me think about practical endocrine management; I should confirm an approach that aligns with current guidelines. If PPIs are required for PUD, maintain a consistent LT4 brand or preparation, space LT4 from potential binders, and recheck TSH and free T4 about 6 weeks after any change in PPI therapy or LT4 formulation; if targets are not met, prioritize switching to liquid or soft gel LT4 before large dose escalations, and consider an LT4 absorption test in refractory cases after excluding drug–nutrient interferences, which is consistent with European Thyroid Association guidance and endocrine best practices [^111wnznq] [^112wunJX] [^116vMBwp] [^112VueCg]. I should confirm baseline dosing principles as well; in adults, typical full-replacement LT4 is about 1.6 mcg/kg/day with adjustments individualized to target TSH in primary hypothyroidism or free T4 in central hypothyroidism, followed by interval reassessment to avoid over- or under-replacement [^115iuzjg] [^1119MaBD].

> But wait, what if someone argues that improving hypothyroidism might somehow aid mucosal healing indirectly? I need to ensure I don't overstate speculative physiology; there is no clinical evidence that correcting thyroid status accelerates peptic ulcer healing beyond standard gastroenterologic therapy, and thyroid hormone should not be repurposed for non-endocrine indications such as ulcer treatment, reinforcing that levothyroxine remains outside the therapeutic armamentarium for PUD [^111ouN86] [^117HW5ag] [^112HeKzG]. I should also reiterate safety labeling boundaries to avoid off-label misuse pressure; thyroid hormone products carry warnings against use for unrelated conditions, underscoring that levothyroxine is not an ulcer therapy and should be used strictly for approved endocrine indications with appropriate monitoring [^112dt8VH] [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line so there is no ambiguity. There is no evidence that levothyroxine heals peptic ulcer disease; the established and guideline-supported therapies are acid suppression with PPIs, H. pylori eradication when present, and NSAID risk modification, with endoscopic therapy in bleeding, whereas the clinically important interaction runs the other way: PPIs and hypochlorhydria impair LT4 tablet absorption, often necessitating formulation changes or dose adjustments with TSH monitoring [^111ouN86] [^112REd7m] [^1139Lwma] [^117HW5ag]. Hold on, I should verify the practical next steps one more time; when PUD requires PPI therapy, consider liquid or soft gel LT4, reassess thyroid function 6–8 weeks after changes, and only titrate dose if needed, rather than attempting to use levothyroxine as an ulcer-healing agent, which it is not [^112twjrb] [^113fJ9eB] [^111wnznq].

Levothyroxine **does not heal peptic ulcer disease (PUD)** [^1139Lwma]. It is a thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and has no role in ulcer healing or symptom relief [^113yCqyy]. Standard PUD therapy is **acid suppression [^117HW5ag] and H. pylori eradication** [^111ouN86] [^1139Lwma]. Levothyroxine is not indicated for PUD and should not be used for this purpose [^112HeKzG] [^113yCqyy].

## Pharmacological properties of levothyroxine

Levothyroxine is a **synthetic form of thyroxine (T4)** [^113yCqyy], a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, primarily used to treat hypothyroidism — a condition characterized by insufficient thyroid hormone production. It works by replacing or supplementing endogenous thyroid hormone, thereby normalizing metabolic processes and physiological functions affected by hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is absorbed primarily in the **small intestine** [^112S5Ffy], and its absorption can be influenced by various factors, including gastrointestinal conditions, medications, and dietary habits [^112fTtaR]. It has a narrow therapeutic index, requiring careful dose titration and monitoring of thyroid function tests to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes [^114cuoXF] [^1119MaBD].

## Pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease

Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by the formation of ulcers in the **gastric or duodenal mucosa**, primarily due to the imbalance between aggressive factors (gastric acid, pepsin, Helicobacter pylori infection, NSAID use) [^111ouN86] and defensive factors (mucosal barrier, bicarbonate secretion, prostaglandins) [^112REd7m]. The primary causes of PUD include:

- **Helicobacter pylori infection**: Present in approximately 42% of PUD cases [^111ouN86].
- **NSAID use**: Responsible for approximately 36% of PUD cases [^111ouN86].
- **Gastric acid hypersecretion**: Contributes to mucosal damage and ulcer formation [^113Ben1u].

Standard treatment for PUD involves **acid suppression therapy [^117HW5ag] and H. pylori eradication**, with discontinuation or modification of NSAID use [^1139Lwma] [^111ouN86].

---

## Evidence regarding levothyroxine and peptic ulcer disease

A comprehensive review of the available literature reveals **no evidence supporting the use of levothyroxine in the treatment or healing of peptic ulcer disease** [^1139Lwma]. Levothyroxine is not mentioned in any clinical guidelines or recommendations for PUD management [^112REd7m], and its pharmacological action as a thyroid hormone replacement does not address the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PUD, such as gastric acid secretion, H. pylori infection, or NSAID-induced mucosal damage [^111ouN86]. Furthermore, **levothyroxine is not indicated for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions**, including peptic ulcer disease [^112HeKzG]. Its primary indication remains the management of hypothyroidism and related thyroid disorders [^113yCqyy].

---

## Potential interactions and considerations

While levothyroxine itself does not directly influence peptic ulcer healing, it is important to consider potential interactions between levothyroxine and medications commonly used in PUD management: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists, frequently prescribed for acid suppression in PUD, **can impair levothyroxine absorption** [^112S5Ffy] by increasing gastric pH, potentially leading to suboptimal thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^112twjrb] [^112fTtaR]. Patients receiving both levothyroxine and acid-suppressive therapy may **require careful monitoring of thyroid function tests** [^111wnznq] and potential dose adjustments [^112qaJAX] to maintain euthyroid status.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines from major endocrinology and gastroenterology societies **do not recommend levothyroxine for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease** [^113yCqyy]. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines focus on levothyroxine's role in hypothyroidism management, with no mention of its use in gastrointestinal conditions such as PUD [^111wnznq]. Similarly, **gastroenterology guidelines emphasize acid suppression therapy** [^1139Lwma], **H. pylori eradication** [^111ouN86], and **NSAID management** [^112REd7m] as the cornerstone of PUD treatment, with no reference to levothyroxine as a therapeutic option.

---

## Conclusion

Levothyroxine **does not heal peptic ulcer disease** [^1139Lwma]. It is a thyroid hormone replacement therapy indicated for hypothyroidism and related thyroid disorders [^113yCqyy]. There is no scientific evidence or clinical guideline supporting its use in the treatment or healing of peptic ulcer disease [^113bg1h3]. The standard management of PUD involves acid suppression therapy, H. pylori eradication, and NSAID management, with no role for levothyroxine in this context [^117HW5ag].

- **Importance**: In the US, peptic ulcer disease affects 1% of the population and approximately 54,000 patients are admitted to the hospital annually for bleeding peptic ulcers.

- **Observations**: Approximately 10% of patients presenting with upper abdominal pain in a primary care setting have a peptic ulcer as the cause of their symptoms. The principal causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection, which affects approximately 42% of patients with peptic ulcer disease, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, which are etiologic factors in approximately 36% of people with peptic ulcer disease. Complications of peptic ulcer include bleeding (73% of patients), perforation (9% of patients), and pyloric obstruction (3% of patients). Annually, 10,000 people die of peptic ulcer disease in the US. Endoscopy definitively diagnoses peptic ulcer disease. Acid blockers, such as omeprazole, can heal peptic ulcers in approximately 80% to 100% of patients within 4 weeks, but gastric ulcers larger than 2 cm may require 8 weeks of treatment. Eradication of H. pylori decreases peptic ulcer recurrence rates from approximately 50% to 60% to 0% to 2%. Discontinuing NSAIDs heals 95% of ulcers identified on endoscopy and reduces recurrence from 40% to 9%. When discontinuing an NSAID is not desirable, changing the NSAID (e.g. from ketorolac to ibuprofen), adding a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, and eradicating H. pylori with treatment such as bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline combined with omeprazole, can reduce recurrence rates.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: A meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117HW5ag]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

This meta-analysis of data from more than 1,200 randomised trials of the main gastroprotectant drugs currently in use, which included more than 200,000 participants in total, showed that gastroprotectant therapies are effective for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its main complication, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, in a wide range of clinical circumstances. However, the absence of individual trials that recorded large numbers of ulcer complications and the paucity of reliable information on drug safety are limitations that constrain the wider use of such treatments.

The results of trials of a gastroprotectant versus control, and of one gastroprotectant versus another gastroprotectant of a different class, were consistent, with PPIs being more effective than other classes of gastroprotectant drugs; this superiority was observed uniformly in the separate clinical circumstances in which these agents are used in peptic ulcer disease, namely prevention, healing, and treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In the context of prevention, most information was available from trials assessing the effects of gastroprotectant drugs on endoscopic ulcers, but the evidence of benefit was corroborated by similar findings in the smaller number of trials assessing their effects on symptomatic ulcers. The relative benefits of gastroprotectants for the prevention of endoscopic ulcers, symptomatic ulcers, and bleeding were large and of broadly similar magnitude irrespective of whether patients were taking an NSAID (including aspirin).

### The levothyroxine absorption test: A four-year experience (2015–2018) at The Mayo Clinic [^117HpsZ7]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the mainstay of therapy for hypothyroidism. Yet, despite physician efforts at dose titration, some patients remain hypothyroid on LT4 doses in excess of weight-based calculations, a condition known as refractory hypothyroidism. The LT4 absorption test (LT4AT) has been proposed to have utility in these patients by enabling the distinction of LT4 malabsorption from pseudomalabsorption, a condition of intentional nonadherence. Given its rare use in clinical practice, we reviewed our institution's experience with the LT4AT to assess its impact on the management of refractory hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of 16 patients diagnosed with refractory hypothyroidism and who had completed the LT4AT between January 2015 and January 2019. The primary aim was to determine the utility of this test in distinguishing LT4 malabsorption from pseudomalabsorption. Secondary aims were to determine whether the results of this test impacted physicians' management decisions, as well as to report on clinical outcomes at follow-up. Our LT4AT is a six-hour test wherein patients receive a weight-based dose of LT4 followed by serial measurements of total thyroxine (TT4) and thyrotropin (TSH). Percentage absorption is calculated using the following formula, with normal absorption being ≥ 60%: [Formula: see text]

- **Results**: Percentage absorption was calculated in 13 of 16 patients due to a lack of TT4 data for 3 patients. Absorption was impaired in one patient (% absorbed = 0), who had known causes of malabsorption. The remaining 12 patients had normal absorption.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, the ETA 2025 guidelines emphasize levothyroxine therapy, particularly maintenance dosing. These guidelines recommend maintaining treatment with the same brand or preparation of levothyroxine in patients who have achieved optimal biochemical hormonal replacement and have no clinical contraindication. If a change is necessary, a measurement of FT4 and TSH should be obtained after 6 weeks, considering the clinical situation.

### Efficacy of levothyroxine sodium soft gelatin capsules in thyroidectomized patients taking proton pump inhibitors: An open-label study [^112qaJAX]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine sodium (LT4) is the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism. In patients with no significant comorbidities, the recommended LT4 full replacement dose is about 1.6–1.7 μg/kg/day. The absorption of oral LT4 occurs in the small intestine, and several factors, including medications, may interfere with it, thereby necessitating LT4 dose adjustments and more careful monitoring.

In the stomach, the degree and rate of LT4 dissolution is essential for efficient absorption and relates directly to gastric acidity. In vitro studies have shown that an increase in medium pH affects the dissolution of LT4 tablets, and similarly, an increase in gastric pH may affect dissolution and subsequent LT4 absorption.

Drugs that block the secretion of gastric acid, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), cause hypochlorhydria and affect thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. Omeprazole treatment was associated with an increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels in 10 patients treated with LT4 tablets, an effect that was reversed by an increase in the LT4 dose by 37%.

### Are we restoring thyroid hormone signaling in levothyroxine-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism [^111jJi9V]? Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) at doses that maintain serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range constitutes the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. This treatment eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients within a few months, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. However, a small percentage of patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms despite normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.

- **Objective**: To provide a summary of progress in the approach to patients with hypothyroidism who exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature, focusing on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue, and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3).

- **Results**: A series of clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective; however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3. Desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results. A practical approach to treating these patients…

### Are proton pump inhibitors a double-edged sword in the treatment of infection [^115PwaoX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is closely associated with peptic ulcers, gastric malignancy, and iron deficiency anemia. Triple eradication therapy, based on either bismuth compounds or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), is the routine method used to treat H. pylori infection. It is commonly believed that PPIs are safe and effective for patients with peptic ulcer. The adverse effects are extremely rare for PPIs, occurring in approximately 1–3% of cases, with reports of interstitial nephritis with omeprazole, hepatitis with omeprazole and lansoprazole, and disputed visual disturbances with pantoprazole and omeprazole. PPIs do not cause atrophic gastritis, although they may mildly increase serum gastrin concentration and induce apoptosis.

PPIs are not associated with gastric or esophageal cancers. However, in one recent case report, a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell characteristics was suggested to be induced by hypergastrinemia secondary to long-term PPI use.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite general consensus on initiating and adjusting levothyroxine, maintaining consistent euthyroidism involves many nuances and complexities. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage, as well as considering age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goals, life stage, and quality of life when adjusting levothyroxine can be challenging and continually evolving. As levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid the risks of overtreatment or undertreatment.

For patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, it is crucial to consider all possible contributing factors, including coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors. If these factors do not appear to contribute, and biochemical euthyroidism has been achieved, a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be beneficial. Although this is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, it may be corroborated by studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, any trial of combination therapy should be continued only if it benefits the patient. Monitoring for adverse effects is particularly important in older or frail individuals, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has been considered.

### Factors contributing to high levothyroxine doses in primary hypothyroidism: an interventional audit of a large community database [^116W86fw]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

While few hypothyroid patients require more than the expected weight-related dose of levothyroxine, the underlying causes of larger-than-expected dosing requirements have not been studied in a single cohort. Our aim was to determine and quantify the multiple factors contributing to high-dose levothyroxine requirements in a cohort of patients with hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: The Grampian Automated Follow-Up Register (GAFUR) monitors around 17,500 hypothyroid patients. In 2008, 190 (1%) patients took > 225μg of levothyroxine daily. A questionnaire was sent to 174 patients (16 were untraceable) to assess causes and to offer blood tests for endomysial, parietal cell (PCA), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies. Primary care practices were contacted for medication details. All patients with positive endomysial autoantibodies were referred to a gastroenterologist. Thyroid function tests and levothyroxine doses were re-evaluated in 2011.

- **Results**: A total of 125 questionnaires (72%) were returned. Mean levothyroxine dose was 248μg daily. Twenty-six patients (20.8%) took medication known to interfere with levothyroxine absorption, and 21 patients (16.8%) admitted to compliance issues. Seven patients had positive anti-endomysial antibodies on initial screening, with four being new diagnoses of celiac disease, and PCA were positive in 27 (21.6%) patients. At follow-up in 2011, the mean levothyroxine dose had decreased in patients on interfering medications and in the four new cases of celiac disease.

- **Conclusions**: Causes of patients needing high-dose levothyroxine repl

### Armour thyroid [^1127TFcy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics -

Animal studies have demonstrated that levothyroxine (T4) is only partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The absorption level depends on the vehicle used for administration, the character of the intestinal contents, intestinal flora, plasma protein, and soluble dietary factors, which bind thyroid and make it unavailable for diffusion. When administered in a gelatin capsule, only 41% is absorbed, as opposed to a 74% absorption rate when given with an albumin carrier.

Depending on additional factors, absorption has varied from 48 to 79% of the administered dose. Fasting increases absorption, while malabsorption syndromes and dietary factors, such as children's soybean formula and the concomitant use of anionic exchange resins like cholestyramine, cause excessive fecal loss. Liothyronine (T3) is almost entirely absorbed, with a 95% absorption rate in 4 hours. Hormones contained in desiccated thyroid extract preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to synthetic hormones.

More than 99% of circulating hormones are bound to serum proteins, including thyroid-binding globulin (TBg), thyroid-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBa). The capacities and affinities of these proteins vary for the hormones. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both TBg and TBPA compared to liothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of T4. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112MpcZD]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The prescription of liquid LT4 is promising and limited. As revealed by a meta-analysis by Laurent et al. based on eight prospective or randomized controlled studies, reduced TSH levels were observed in patients with malabsorption who were taking liquid formulations. However, TSH levels did not differ significantly between tablets and liquid preparations in the nonmalabsorption group. Clinicians should follow the guidelines of the Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, namely, "liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects (1) with hampered LT4 absorption or (2) who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals for LT4 replacement". A web-based survey of Italian endocrinologists also supported the prescription of liquid LT4 for patients (3) with unexplained poor biochemical control of hypothyroidism. From a clinical standpoint, we also recommend the prescription of liquid LT4 for patients (4) with difficulty swallowing.

- **Soft gel capsules**: Commercial soft gel capsules were introduced to the market around the same time as LT4 solutions, but somewhat later, in August 2007. The LT4 powder is dissolved in glycerin solvent and then encapsulated with a soft gelatin shell. After drying, a translucent flat oval capsule is produced. Colucci et al. conducted a clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers according to the Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacokinetic protocol for bioequivalence. The study confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence between LT4 soft gel capsules and tablets. However, controversy still exists. Data from 104 hypothyroid patients show conflicting results, indicating the need for further research in this area.

### Tablet formulation of levothyroxine is absorbed less well than powdered levothyroxine [^112fUgHV]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

The comparative bioavailability of oral doses of levothyroxine (LT(4)) formulation taken as tablets, after being crushed, or chewed before swallowing has not been well studied. Three patients with hypothyroidism, who showed persistent elevation of serum thyrotropin (TSH) despite taking 200, 150, and 125 micrograms of LT(4) tablets per day, are presented. They did not show signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal illness that could interfere with the absorption of LT(4), nor did they have a history of such a condition. They did not concurrently take medications known to affect the absorption of LT(4) from the gut. Their serum TSH levels normalized when the tablets were taken after being pulverized. The difference appeared attributable to the slow dissolution of the tablets in the gut of these patients.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^116vMBwp]. European thyroid journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment adherence, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a levothyroxine absorption test in levothyroxine-refractory patients. This is advised after excluding interference from nutrients, drugs, and comorbidities, when clinically appropriate.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: When to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. However, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment.

Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least two months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L.

While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age-dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115bXReC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from the T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells, while 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in L-T4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in L-T4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with L-T4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis, which may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidecto…

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^115Uk4Y6]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

The screening visit occurred within 28 days before first dose administration. All subjects were admitted to the clinic at least 10 hours before drug administration and remained onsite until the 48-hour post-dose blood draw for each period, reflecting a highly controlled research setting. The 72-hour post-dose samples were collected on return visits. Serum samples were taken at three different times at baseline, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. The washout period was at least 35 days.

The study lasted approximately 2.5 months in total. Serum concentrations of total (bound and free) T4 were measured using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method. Safety monitoring included adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory results (i.e. hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and serology), vital signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examinations. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that occurred on or after study drug administration and were classified according to the MedDRA® dictionary, version 23.0.

- **PK parameters**: PK parameters were calculated using standard noncompartmental methods for total T4, using serum concentrations and baseline-adjusted serum concentrations. For baseline correction, the baseline value (mean of 3 pre-dose samples) was subtracted from each measured concentration for each subject and in each period. Parameters included maximum observed concentration (C max), time of observed maximum concentration (t max), and area under the concentration–time curve.

### Combination treatment with T4 and T3: Toward personalized replacement therapy in hypothyroidism [^114dAJph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy is the traditional lifelong replacement therapy for hypothyroid patients. Over the last several years, new evidence has led clinicians to evaluate the option of combined T3 and T4 treatment to improve the quality of life, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action in hypothyroidism. The aim of this review is to assess the physiological basis and the results of studies on this topic.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms:
	- **Hypothyroidism and treatment**: hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid, guidelines, treatment
	- **Mechanisms**: deiodinases, clinical symptoms
	- **Outcomes and wellbeing**: quality of life, cognition, mood, depression, body weight, heart rate, cholesterol, bone markers, SHBG, patient preference for combined therapy

	The search was restricted to reports published in English since 1970, but some reports published before 1970 were also incorporated. We supplemented the search with records from personal files and references of relevant articles and textbooks. Parameters analyzed included the rationale for combination treatment, the type of patients to be selected, the optimal T4/T3 ratio, and the potential benefits of this therapy on symptoms of hypothyroidism, quality of life, mood, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The outcome of our analysis suggests that it may be time to consider a personalized regimen of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients.

- **Conclusions**: Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed.

### The effect of famotidine, esomeprazole, and ezetimibe on levothyroxine absorption [^115GZgXu]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

Recent literature describing the effect of gastric acid suppression on levothyroxine absorption has been inconsistent. Eztemibe, a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol, may also interfere with levothyroxine absorption. The objective of this study was to measure changes in levothyroxine absorption before and after famotidine, esomeprazole, or a single dose of ezetimibe.

- **Methods**: We conducted levothyroxine absorption testing on 30 healthy volunteers, excluding those with thyroid disease. Subjects were randomized to receive one of three regimens: 1 week of either famotidine or esomeprazole, or a single dose of ezetimibe administered simultaneously with levothyroxine (n = 10 in each group). Baseline levothyroxine absorption testing was performed on all subjects using 600 mcg of Synthroid, with thyroid hormone levels checked at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after administration. Testing was then repeated 6 weeks later after administration of one of the three study drug regimens. The area under the curve (AUC) over 8 hours for serum thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and free T4 index, and the mean peak hormone levels achieved during levothyroxine absorption testing at baseline and following administration of one of the three study medications were compared using paired t-tests.

- **Results**: Peak mean hormone levels and AUCs of T4, T3, and free T4 index during absorption testing before and after each of the three study medications did not differ. Results for differences before and after study medication did not reach significance.

### Peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection: Common questions and answers [^112REd7m]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting 1 out of 12 people in the United States. Approximately 1 in 5 peptic ulcers is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, with most of the rest due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. The combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use synergistically increases the risk of bleeding ulcers more than sixfold. The H. pylori test-and-treat strategy is the mainstay of outpatient management.

Patients younger than 60 years who have dyspepsia without alarm symptoms should be tested and, if positive, treated to eradicate the infection. If negative, they should be treated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for patients 60 years and older with new symptoms and for anyone with alarm symptoms. Noninvasive testing for H. pylori using a urea breath test or stool antigen test is preferred.

- **First-line treatment**: Bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy (nonbismuth quadruple therapy) is the preferred first-line treatment for eradication because of increasing clarithromycin resistance.
- **NSAID use**: To lower the risk of ulcers associated with long-term NSAID use, clinicians should consider coadministering a PPI or substituting an NSAID with less effect on gastric mucosa, such as celecoxib.
- **H. pylori eradication**: Eradicating H. pylori in NSAID users reduces the likelihood of peptic ulcers by one-half.

Potential risks of long-term PPI use include fractures, interaction with antiplatelet medications, chronic kidney disease, Clostridioides difficile infection, dementia, and magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 micronutrient deficiencies.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^113ttofv]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) sodium is a standard treatment for hypothyroidism. Its absorption and bioavailability, when taken as a tablet, have been shown to be significantly decreased with concomitant food ingestion. Therefore, LT4 formulations are recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30, ideally 60, minutes before breakfast, potentially affecting adherence to therapy. A novel LT4 solution (Tirosint®-SOL) has been shown to result in a faster absorption process than tablets or soft-gel capsule formulations.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the bioavailability of this preparation taken 15 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie meal in comparison with the minimally recommended 30-minute interval.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six (33 completers, 24 males and 9 females) healthy volunteers participated in the randomized study. They took 600 mcg of LT4 oral solution as single doses following a 10-hour fast, 15 or 30 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie, FDA-approved standardized meal in a controlled research setting. Serum total thyroxine was measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and multiple time points up to 72 hours after LT4 administration. The predefined equivalence boundaries for the extent of exposure reflected by the area under the curve (AUC) were 80–125%. The washout period was at least 35 days.

- **Results**: The geometric mean ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for the baseline-adjusted extent of exposure, represented by AUCs truncated at both 48 and 72 hours after dosing, were AUC 0–48: 90% [90% CI 86–94]; and AUC 0–72: 92%.

### Switching levothyroxine from the tablet to the oral solution formulation corrects the impaired absorption of levothyroxine induced by proton-pump inhibitors [^112twjrb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) impair tablet levothyroxine (LT4) intestinal absorption by increasing the gastric pH and decreasing LT4 dissolution in the stomach. The purpose of this study was to verify whether a liquid formulation of LT4 would correct LT4 malabsorption induced by PPIs.

This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted from 2012 to 2013, with a mean follow-up duration of 23.7 ± 11.9 weeks, at a tertiary university hospital outpatient clinic. Upon informed consent, we recruited 24 consecutive adult patients (18 women and 6 men) who took LT4 for replacement (n = 14) or suppressive purposes (n = 10) and had absorption of tablet LT4 impaired by PPIs. The 24 patients were switched from the tablet to the oral solution LT4 at the same daily dose.

- **Main outcome measures**: Significantly lower mean TSH levels were seen with the oral solution than with the tablet, as were significantly greater rates of serum TSH less than or equal to the specified cutoff values (replacement [REP] group) or ≤ 0.10 mU/L (suppressive [SUP] group) with the oral solution than with the tablet.

- **Results**: Serum TSH was lower with the oral solution than with the tablet formulation (REP group, 1.7 ± 1.0 mU/L vs. 5.4 ± 4.3, P < .0001; SUP group, 0.1 ± 0.3 mU/L vs. 2.1 ± 2.7, P < .0001). In the REP group, the rate of TSH values of ≤ 4.12 or ≤ 2.5 mU/L was 29 of 30 (96.7%) or 24 of 30 (80.0%) postswitch but only 17 of 36 (47.2%) or 9 of 36 (25.0%) preswitch (P < .0001).

### New formulations of levothyroxine in the treatment of hypothyroidism: Trick or treat [^1131185T]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) as a medication is used by up to 5.3% of the adult population. For optimal efficacy, the traditional tablet formulation (LT4tab) requires that patients avoid concomitant ingestion with food, drinks, and certain medications, as well as maintain excellent patient compliance. Some comorbidities influence the bioavailability of LT4 and may mandate repeated dose adjustments. New LT4 formulations, such as soft gel (LT4soft) and liquid (LT4liq) containing predissolved LT4, are claimed to improve bioavailability, presumably by facilitating absorption. Thus, these formulations may be more suitable than LT4tab for patients whose daily requirements are subjected to variations in bioavailability. Here, we review the evidence and indications for the use of new LT4 formulations and highlight areas of uncertainty that are worthy of further investigation.

- **Bioequivalence**: While bioequivalence is established for LT4soft and LT4liq administered to healthy volunteers compared with LT4tab in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, therapeutic equivalence of the new formulations seems to differ in several clinical settings.

- **Mitigation of requirements**: Some evidence suggests that new formulations of LT4 may mitigate the strict requirements relating to concomitant ingestion with food, drinks, and certain medications, which apply to traditional LT4 tablets.

- **Principal indication**: The principal indication is in selected patients with disease fluctuations and intermittent therapies with interfering medications, where the need for frequent dose adjustments and office visits may be diminished.

Use of LT4soft or LT4liq in patients is an area worthy of further scientific inquiry and validation.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113WyXiu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with free thyroxine (fT4) in the reference range, affects up to 6%–18% of older adults. Although clinical guidelines differ on which patients should be treated, SHypo is frequently treated with levothyroxine (LT4). This contributes to levothyroxine being one of the most prescribed medications in the United States and Europe. In older adults, two recent international, double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) and the IEMO80+ Thyroid Trial — and a meta-analysis found no benefit of levothyroxine on hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life, even among those with high symptom burden. However, specific subgroups might still benefit, such as patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Phosphate binders as a cause of hypothyroidism in dialysis patients: Practical indications from a review of the literature [^111qq9eE]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Many physiological and pathological conditions can alter levothyroxine absorption. In addition to gastrointestinal diseases, such as gastritis and Helicobacter infection, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal infections, and malabsorption, several foods and beverages, including dietary fibers, soybeans, herbal remedies, papaya, grapefruit, and coffee, affect the absorption of levothyroxine.

However, for patients on polypharmacy, pharmacological interferences are the major cause of levothyroxine malabsorption. Several drugs are listed, and the effect is usually higher when taken simultaneously or less than one hour before or after taking levothyroxine. The potential list in dialysis patients is long and includes gastro-protective agents, antibiotics, bile acid sequestrants, oral iron, potassium binders (sodium polystyrene sulphonate), and, most importantly, phosphate binders.

Phosphate binders are probably the drugs most widely used by dialysis patients, and virtually all phosphate binders interfere with levothyroxine absorption. These include aluminum hydroxide, calcium salts (calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, and calcium acetate), sevelamer, magnesium hydroxide, lantanum carbonate, and sucroferric oxyhydroxide.

The mechanism of phosphate binding differs among agents. Some use ionic interactions to attract, bind, and precipitate phosphate, resulting in the excretion of the insoluble phosphate compound in the feces. Aluminum hydroxide, calcium salts, magnesium hydroxide, and lantanum carbonate are inorganic salts that release ions to trap dietary phosphate.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: A meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111VY3RF]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Added value of the study**: This meta-analysis of more than 1,200 trials included around 200,000 participants and quantified the relative treatment effects of available gastroprotectants in the settings of ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The findings provide evidence for benefits of gastroprotectant therapy in all three clinical contexts, with PPIs showing consistent superiority to other agents. The relative benefits of gastroprotectants were of broadly similar magnitude irrespective of whether patients were taking NSAIDs. In the absence of large-scale randomised trials, however, some uncertainty remains about whether the effect size estimates in this meta-analysis were inflated by small study bias, and insufficient reliable information is available on the safety of such treatments.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: This study indicates that, in the context of peptic ulcer disease, gastroprotectants — and in particular PPIs — are effective in ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and in reducing rebleeding. The relative benefits appear similar irrespective of concomitant NSAID use. Reliable information is still needed about the long-term safety of PPIs; in particular, there is concern that PPIs might have adverse cardiovascular effects. The large ongoing COMPASS trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in 17,000 patients with stable cardiovascular disease might provide useful safety information, and could also help to determine the true size of any beneficial effects.

### The interplay between vitamin C and thyroid [^113nf5gb]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The effects of vitamin C on the absorption of levothyroxine in hypothyroid individuals have been investigated in the literature. High doses of levothyroxine may be needed in some patients, and hypoacidic conditions in the gastric environment could influence the drug's absorption, leading to unresponsiveness to the medication. The impact could be to the extent that, in some case reports, parenteral levothyroxine was administered without a clear reason for the underlying pathophysiological malabsorption mechanism.

A study by Antúnez et al. investigated the effect of vitamin C administration in 28 hypothyroid patients requiring > 1.70 μg/kg of levothyroxine but with normal TSH levels. The TSH level was measured before and after treatment with 1 g/day of vitamin C administered with levothyroxine, while the levothyroxine dose was constant. It was found that the patients had statistically lower TSH levels after the intervention.

Similarly, a study by Jubiz et al. assessed the effect of vitamin C on the concentration of TSH, T3, and T4 in hypothyroid cases with gastrointestinal abnormalities and elevated TSH levels. It concluded that vitamin C can increase T3 and T4 and subsequently reduce TSH. While there is no clear explanation of vitamin C's effect on levothyroxine malabsorption, there has been a suggestion that high gastric pH may interfere with levothyroxine absorption. Therefore, decreasing pH via vitamin C can enhance the drug's absorption. This idea could be supported by a recent systematic review which demonstrated a potential connection.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^114p9PDV]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Many concomitant diseases or conditions have been reported to interfere with the efficacy of oral or non-oral LT4. The underlying mechanisms of impaired efficacy due to these diseases or medical conditions vary. Some gastric disorders, including H. pylori infection and autoimmune gastritis, reduce drug efficacy via hypochlorhydria. Gastroparesis may delay stomach emptying and enable residual food to adsorb more oral LT4. Similarly, gastric sleeve surgery and other bariatric surgeries can cause malabsorption in some LT4-treated patients. Recently, systemic sclerosis and esophageal achalasia were found to cause severe hypothyroidism. Researchers hypothesized that tablets did not completely reach the stomach and that an inadequate dissolution phase was the main reason for malabsorption.

- **Summary of concomitant diseases and conditions which interfere with the bioavailability of LT4**:
	- *Impaired bioavailability* induced by these conditions has been reported to be relieved by novel formulations (liquid solution and/or soft gel capsule).
	- *Malabsorption* induced by these conditions has been reported to be relieved by crushed tablet powder.
	- *Malabsorption* induced by these conditions has been reported to be relieved by intravenous or intramuscular injection.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112S5Ffy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The intraluminal digestion of LT4 tablets comprises disintegration and dissolution in the stomach and absorption mainly in the small intestine. A physiological gastric pH (1.0–3.0) is essential for tablet dissolution, which removes the sodium ion and converts LT4 into a lipophilic molecule. Several studies have demonstrated that an elevated pH due to Heliobacter pylori infection, autoimmune gastritis, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) antagonize subsequent absorption. This phenomenon is explained by the ionization status at different environmental pH values.

As revealed during in vitro studies by Kocic et al. and Pabla et al, the dissolution–pH profile is V-shaped. The solubility of LT4 tablets at 30 minutes is approximately 100% at pH 1.2 and 2.4. Its solubility decreases substantially to less than 60% at pH 4.0, regardless of the brand. The nadir is reached at pH 5.0, where the percentage of dissolution at 60 minutes decreases to less than 40%. As the environmental pH becomes more alkaline, the dissolution rate gradually increases to 80% to 85% at pH 8.0.

More recently, direct in vivo proof for the role of gastric juice pH on LT4 absorption was provided by Virili et al. in a retrospective study. The LT4 requirement increased with the increasing gastric pH (P = 0.0007). Notably, generic and brand name tablets exhibit different dissolution–pH profiles, suggesting that excipients and manufacturing techniques influence tablet dissolution. Pulverized LT4 tablets were better absorbed than the entire tablet.

### Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). High credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24-month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

- **Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication**: If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range), a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care. If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^114w9NTL]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Similar results have been obtained in concomitant disease-associated malabsorption. Fallahi et al. studied TSH levels in patients who underwent bariatric surgery after switching from tablets to solutions. Seventeen patients were followed for 3 to 8 months post-surgery and 2 to 3 months after the switch without dose adjustment. TSH levels decreased in all 17 patients after the switch (13 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses: 7.58 ± 3.07 vs. 3.80 ± 1.83 mU/L, P < .001; 4 biliary pancreatic diversions: 8.82 ± 2.76 vs. 3.12 ± 1.33 mU/L, P < .01). Pregnancy is assumed to have little effect on the malabsorption of LT4 but impairs bioavailability through estrogen-induced TBG elevations. A retrospective cohort study by Cappelli et al. in 31 pregnant patients with hypothyroidism showed decreased daily LT4 doses in 14 patients taking liquid solutions and 17 patients taking tablets, with no significant differences in age, weight, or TH levels. Better absorption of liquid LT4 may explain these findings. Additionally, case reports have shown that liquid LT4 has superior efficacy compared to tablets in patients with autoimmune gastritis, gastroparesis, celiac disease, giardiasis, liver cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome.

However, the weaknesses of these studies are evident. Among the 31 included articles investigating LT4 formulations, 14 were case reports or case series, 5 were retrospective cohort studies, 2 were prospective cohort studies, and 8 were prospective pre-post self-control studies. Only 2 studies were well-designed (randomized and crossover). The levels of evidence were generally low, and obviously, there…

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^116aZJ4Z]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The tablet form is the predominant preparation of LT4, accounting for more than 95% of LT4 prescriptions. Generally, a dose of LT4 of 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg body weight is sufficient for the normalization of thyroid function. Unfortunately, more than 30% to 50% of LT4-treated patients are estimated to be either undertreated or overtreated. Impaired bioavailability of LT4 is a common cause of off-target serum TH levels and has been reported in patients with many medical conditions, including concomitant diseases, coingestion with drugs or food, a switch in the LT4 preparation, improper storage, or poor compliance. Patients will present with elevated TSH levels and reduced T3 and T4 levels, thus requiring a dose adjustment (> 1.9 µg/kg). Identification of the underlying cause is required to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms.

- **Algorithm for management**: A proposed algorithm exists for patients with elevated TSH and impaired bioavailability for LT4. Abbreviations used include LT4 (levothyroxine), T3 (triiodothyronine), T4 (thyroxine), TH (thyroid hormone), TSH (thyrotropin), p.r. (per rectum), and i.v. (intravenous).

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111GKQvJ]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The major strengths of this meta-analysis are the large number of events overall, which allowed precise quantitative estimates of treatment effects, together with the diversity of inclusion criteria among the large number of trials. This diversity facilitated the study of a wide range of patients at risk of peptic ulcer disease. However, the study has a number of limitations. By far the most important of these is the absence of large placebo-controlled randomised trials that individually recorded substantial numbers of upper gastrointestinal complications. Almost all of the available trials were short term and included small numbers of bleeds, and furthermore, many did not publish all relevant outcomes. Additionally, the decision to report particular findings in any given trial might have been determined post hoc by their statistical significance alone, which could inflate estimates of efficacy. This possibility is reinforced by the implausibly large effect sizes observed for some of the treatments and outcomes in our meta-analysis. Even though analysis of funnel plots in this meta-analysis did not provide consistent evidence of publication bias, such plots are known to be insensitive, and it is possible that small study bias might have led to overestimation of the magnitude of the relative and absolute benefits.

Second, although the results of trials comparing a gastroprotectant versus control and of trials comparing different classes of gastroprotectant yielded broadly consistent results on the relative effectiveness of PPIs, H2RAs, and prostaglandin analogues, and our exploratory network…

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^11699wKX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

The study is strengthened by including hypothyroid patients under LT4 monotherapy due to radioactive iodine intake for treating Graves' Disease, with no or negligible residual secretion of endogenous T3 and T4, and using modern techniques for measurement of thyroid hormones. Evaluation of the two combinations of LT4 + SR-T3 enabled us to choose a more appropriate combination based on the participant's body weight, rather than a fixed dosage as in previous studies. The pharmacokinetic (PK) study was performed after three months of treatment to achieve equilibrium in thyroid hormones, rather than by single-dose drug intake. However, the study is limited by evaluating the PK study only within 24 hours and the low potency of the LT4 component in the combined therapy, which necessitated an increase in total dosage to restore euthyroidism.

In conclusion, combined treatment with levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine in hypothyroid patients, with ratios of 1:5, might restore euthyroidism in hypothyroid patients, yielding improved T3/T4 serum ratio and T3-derived pharmacokinetics, while keeping serum T3 concentrations relatively stable within 24 hours with minimal excursions. Single-dose administration of LT4 + SR-T3 maintains serum T3 concentration approximate to normal ranges up to 24 hours, with minimal variation in serum T3 not exceeding 25 ng/dl, indicating a longer duration of SR-T3 release in the intestine compared to other preparations. Although maximum serum T3 concentration (Tmax) is achieved during 3–4 hours, there is minimal difference in serum T3 concentrations at serial measurements.

### Efficacy of levothyroxine sodium soft gelatin capsules in thyroidectomized patients taking proton pump inhibitors: An open-label study [^114ycPnY]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The study population included adult patients with a history of hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy, on LT4 tablets (different brands and generics) with a dose between ≥ 88 and ≤ 250 μg/day, stable for at least 6 weeks, and TSH at screening within the range of ≥ 0.3 and ≤ 4.0 mIU/L. To be eligible, participants were required to have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or associated gastrointestinal issues treated chronically with prescription doses of PPIs.

Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded from participation: history of malabsorption, gastric bypass surgery, short-gut syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and other conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that could affect drug absorption; parenteral or assisted enteral feeding; presence of any medical condition that could affect the safety of the patient or the reliability of data; pregnancy; breast-feeding; regular consumption of foods known to affect LT4 absorption.

The study plan included a 4- to 6-week run-in period, during which eligible patients continued taking LT4 and PPIs as prescribed. If a subject required LT4 dose adjustment, it was possible to re-screen the patient until TSH normalization was achieved. At the end of the run-in period (baseline), patients were switched to treatment with Tirosint, at the same dose under which they were currently being treated. Soft capsules were taken for 12 weeks (treatment period), with an intermediate assessment of THs after 6 weeks.

During the entire study (both run-in and treatment periods), LT4 was to be taken as a single daily dose in the morning, on an empty stomach.

### Response to letter to the editor from Bonnema et al: "Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine + liothyronine in hypothyroidism" [^116dhQdi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

We thank Bonnema et al. for giving us the opportunity to provide further details on our recent publication while addressing their insightful questions.

In reference to the consequences of long-term treatment with liothyronine (LT3), we respectfully point out that there is now solid data that LT3 does not increase the frequency of adverse reactions if serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels are maintained within the normal range. For example, an observational study from 1997 to 2014 compared nearly 34,000 patients taking only levothyroxine (LT4) with those using LT4 + LT3 (n = 327) or LT3 alone (n = 73) during a mean follow-up of 9.3 years (SD 5.6) and a maximum follow-up of 17.3 years. The study did not reveal a higher mortality or morbidity risk due to cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, or fractures.

An analysis of 20 clinical trials, which included almost 1,000 patients observed for up to 1 year, indicated that peaks of serum 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine observed after the LT3 tablets only minimally affected serum TSH, heart rate, and blood pressure; the frequency of adverse reactions was similar to patients taking LT4. Bone turnover markers were studied in two trials and remained within normal range. This was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis by Millan-Alanis et al. in which 18 clinical trials comparing LT4 vs. LT4 + LT3 therapy found no differences in adverse events. We are unaware that combination therapy containing LT3 has ever been associated with an increased occurrence of adverse reactions in patients maintaining normal TSH levels.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, particularly concerning thyroid replacement therapy, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy in congenital and severe forms of central hypothyroidism (such as TSHβ mutations) as soon as possible. Optimally, this should occur within two weeks after birth, at doses used for primary congenital hypothyroidism, to rapidly normalize serum free T4 levels and ensure optimal treatment as quickly as possible.

In the medical management of hypothyroidism, particularly concerning levothyroxine therapy formulations, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend a thorough interview regarding drugs concomitantly used by patients treated with levothyroxine. Discontinuation of the interfering drug is advised when possible. If discontinuation is not feasible, it is important to schedule an appropriate lag time between levothyroxine and the interfering drug. Additionally, adjust the dose of levothyroxine for the treatment period when interference is expected due to medications prescribed for more than two weeks.

### Effect of vitamin C on the absorption of levothyroxine in patients with hypothyroidism and gastritis [^114QcS3J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

Malabsorption of l-T4 is a major clinical problem. Changes in gastric pH caused by several medical illnesses are associated with difficulties in the control of patients with hypothyroidism receiving the hormone. Means to correct these alterations would be of clinical value.

- **Objectives**: Our objective was to study the effect of vitamin C on the absorption of l-T4 in patients with hypothyroidism and gastritis.

- **Design**: Thirty-one patients with hypothyroidism (28 females, aged 47.5 ± 13.5 years, and 3 males, aged 55.7 ± 11.2 years) ingested the dose of l-T4 in 120 mL water, either containing or not containing 500 mg vitamin C in a solution with pH 2.9 ± 0.1. Serum concentrations of free T4 and TSH were measured at the end of three periods of two months each — two controls and one vitamin C period. Serum total T3 was measured in 16 of the patients, both before and at the end of the vitamin C period. Serum TSH and free T4 and T3 were measured by a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay. All patients had gastrointestinal pathology and were not in good control when taking l-T4 before the study, with 23 having autoimmune thyroiditis or idiopathic hypothyroidism. The median l-T4 dose was 100 μg with an interquartile range of 50 μg. The protocol was reviewed and approved by our institution's ethics committee. Patients were asked to sign a written consent to participate in the study.

- **Results**: Serum concentrations of TSH, free T4, and T3 improved while on vitamin C. Serum TSH decreased in all patients (control, 11.1 [10.5] μIU/mL, median [interquartile range]).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: Prepared by the American Thyroid Association Task Force on Thyroid Hormone Replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Recent advances in thyroid physiology may elucidate why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. This task force aimed to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, optimal prescription practices, sources of dissatisfaction, evidence on treatment alternatives, and identified knowledge gaps. The intention was to evaluate whether new, well-designed studies justify changes in the standard of care. The document aims to support clinical decision-making for thyroid hormone replacement therapy but is not a substitute for individualized clinical judgment.

- **Methods**: Task force members identified 24 relevant questions concerning hypothyroidism treatment. The corresponding clinical literature was reviewed. Mechanistic and bench research literature reviews were conducted by translational scientists when relevant. Bioethical reviews were provided when necessary. Responses to questions were framed as formal clinical recommendation statements whenever possible. When formal recommendations were unsuitable, summary response statements were developed instead. The supporting evidence for clinical recommendations was appraised, and the strength of each recommendation was assessed.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^117Q99WZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which has a high mortality risk. The standard therapy for acute peptic ulcer bleeding combines medication administration and endoscopic therapies. Both pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies have developed continuously in the past few decades. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have already reached a high efficacy in ulcer healing and have been widely used over the past few decades.

Endoscopic hemostasis, which includes local epinephrine injection, heater probe coagulation, use of hemostatic clips, and/or band ligation, is highly effective with an overall hemostatic success rate of 85%–90%. However, 10%–20% of patients could not be cured by the standard combination treatment. Reulcer bleeding, despite initial successful hemostasis, is also a significant problem, leading to longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and higher complication rates, especially in cases of malignant ulcer bleeding.

How to manage all types of peptic ulcer bleeding and prevent early repeptic ulcer bleeding remain unresolved clinical problems. Recently, several novel medications and endoscopic methods have been developed. Potassium competitive acid blockers have demonstrated stronger and longer acid suppression than PPIs. Hemostatic powder spray and hemostatic gel emulsion are novel hemostatic options with emerging evidence, potentially filling gaps in current treatment approaches. This literature review will explore the development of endoscopic hemostasis and the prospects for novel endoscopic treatments.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^111cpkBq]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend adjusting the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, it is advised to avoid complicated regimens and minute adjustments of levothyroxine dose for improving quality of life (QoL) or modulating body weight, as they are not useful.

### Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^111gP4aT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-hour telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre, which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112GMb8Q]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The ideal normalization of thyroid hormone (TH) levels in these patients relies on the elimination of or an improvement in conditions and diseases. In hypothyroid patients with parasitosis or H. pylori infection, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels usually return to the target range with a normal dose after antiparasitic or antibiotic therapy. A lactose-free formulation or gluten-free diet can alleviate impaired absorption in patients with lactose intolerance or celiac disease, respectively. Additionally, switching from levothyroxine (LT4) tablets to liquid preparations can restore thyroid function in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Surprisingly, liquid solutions also alleviate malabsorption induced by some non-gastrointestinal disorders, such as nephrotic syndrome and pregnancy. Similarly, crushed tablet powder might resolve hypothyroidism due to bariatric surgery and lactose intolerance. Unusual administration routes, including intravenous (IV) injection and intramuscular (IM) injection, can also decrease unsuppressed TSH levels in patients with digestive tract disorders. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware that severe refractory hypothyroidism is uncommon in patients with concomitant diseases or conditions. Many patients with malabsorption can achieve a serum TSH level within the target range with an increased dose of LT4.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^113Ben1u]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Gastric acid impairs clot formation, induces platelet disaggregation, and facilitates clot lysis. Acid suppression to keep intragastric pH > 3 over 20 hours is the mainstay of peptic ulcer treatment. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can inhibit gastric acid secretion by blocking the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity through covalent binding to the sulfhydryl group of parietal cells in the stomach. PPIs are prodrugs requiring gastric acid secretion to be converted to their active form. After conversion into active sulfenamide or sulfenic acid, PPIs can maintain intragastric pH > 4 for approximately 20 hours per day. In contrast, H2 receptor antagonists can only maintain intragastric pH > 4 for 8 hours, and tachyphylaxis may occur within 3–5 days of regular use.

In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved six types of PPIs: omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole. For peptic ulcer-related active bleeding, intravenous esomeprazole and pantoprazole are suggested. Before endoscopic evaluation, administration of intravenous PPI can reduce the proportion of participants with signs of recent hemorrhage (SRH) and the requirement for endoscopic therapy. After standard endoscopic treatment, a bolus (80 mg) with continuous infusion of high-dose (8 mg/hr) esomeprazole or pantoprazole for 72 hours is suggested for patients with major SRH to reduce the rate of rebleeding, need for surgery, and mortality. For patients with a minor SRH peptic ulcer or a clean-based ulcer, a standard dose of oral PPI is sufficient for ulcer healing.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^115QsyGh]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The protocol of the LT4 absorption test involves a simulated alteration of serum total T4 levels. Before the test, a thorough patient medical history should be reviewed to rule out any conditions responsible for impaired LT4 bioavailability. After fasting overnight, the patient ingests a high dose of LT4 (usually in tablet form) with water. The standardized dose, determined by the patient's age and body mass index (BMI), is 1000 µg for patients aged between 18 and 65 with a BMI of 65. Blood specimens are collected over a 6-hour period (at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours) and tested for total T4 and TSH. At the conclusion of the test, vital signs and symptoms are reassessed. During the process, the patient must not ingest any food or medication.

Where Increment TT4 equals peak [TT4] minus baseline [TT4], and Vd (volume of distribution) is calculated as 0.442 × BMI. A 60% absorption rate is defined as normal absorption, indicating a diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption.

Soft gel capsules can also eliminate the impaired bioavailability induced by interfering medications or concomitant disease. Malabsorption due to calcium supplements, PPIs, breakfast, H. pylori infection, and gastroparesis was eradicated after switching from tablets to capsules. Yue et al. conducted a randomized, two-arm, crossover trial in euthyroid volunteers with a washout period of 45 days. Thirty-two individuals were recruited in the LT4 absorption test. In line with previous studies, IV esomeprazole reduced the AUC of tablets, whereas the AUC of the capsules was not altered by esomeprazole. An in vitro study revealed that the dissolution time of soft gel capsules was approximately 20 minutes regardless of pH, explaining the discrepancy in AUCs in the trial. In 2013, Vita et al. found that coffee had little effect on LT4 capsule pharmacokinetics. Patients taking soft gel capsules experienced fewer dose adjustments and improved symptoms compared to those taking tablets. In conclusion, it can be postulated that soft gel capsules have superior efficacy over tablets.

There are some advantages of capsules over liquid solutions. As discussed above, the dosing of liquid solutions is inconvenient, as it requires breaking a vial, pouring it into a glass of water, and swallowing it. Capsules are obviously easier to take. Additionally, the package of capsules is smaller and easier to carry. Although soft gel capsules are expensive, considering that some "hard to treat with pill" patients need more blood tests and dose adjustments, soft gel LT4 is more cost-saving for patients requiring one or more dose adjustments.

### Gastrointestinal malabsorption of thyroxine [^112fTtaR]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine, a widely prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic index, is often a lifelong treatment. The therapeutic efficacy of T4 may be marred by behavioral, pharmacologic, and pathologic issues acting as interfering factors. Despite a continuous search for an optimal T4 treatment, a significant number of patients fail to show a complete chemical and/or clinical response to this reference dose of T4.

Gastrointestinal malabsorption of oral T4 represents an emerging cause of refractory hypothyroidism and may be more frequent than previously reputed. In this review, we examine the pharmacologic features of T4 preparations and their linkage with the intestinal absorption of the hormone. We have emphasized the major biochemical and pharmacologic characteristics of T4 and its interaction with the putative transporter at the intestinal level.

We have examined the interfering role of nutrients, foods, and drugs on T4 absorption at the gastric and intestinal levels. The impact of gastrointestinal disorders on T4 treatment efficacy has also been analyzed, in keeping with the site of action and the interfering mechanisms. Based on the evidence obtained from the literature, we propose a schematic diagnostic workup for the most frequent and often hidden gastrointestinal diseases impairing T4 absorption.

### Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of different levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of human thyroid disease [^114cuoXF]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

At the present time, optimal therapy for hypothyroidism requires the replacement of the deficiency in thyroid hormone with synthetic levothyroxine. Precise titration of this narrow therapeutic index drug is necessary to return the patient to a chemically and clinically euthyroid state. Seven levothyroxine formulations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, and four are available to the physician. Proper dosage is established based on thyrotropin (TSH) testing and clinical evaluation. Each levothyroxine preparation must comply with FDA standards for bioavailability but may vary with respect to its dissolution and absorption properties and are not interchangeable. This equivalence testing is done on normal volunteers and requires a suprapharmacologic dose of levothyroxine to determine bioavailability.

In this review, we discuss the various methods used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of thyroid disease. These are relevant to the physician and patient because small differences in efficacy can lead to undesirable effects of either underreplacement or overreplacement.
