## Question

Does Lexapro help with anger

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Lexapro (escitalopram) helps with anger. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the medication's approved indications and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about anger-related adverse effects and monitoring. Next, I will examine the direct clinical evidence for escitalopram on anger symptoms across conditions like GAD, MDD, PMDD, and IED. After that, I should consider mechanistic plausibility via serotonergic modulation of aggression. Finally, I will synthesize practical guidance on when escitalopram may be appropriate for anger, including dosing, safety monitoring, and alternative treatments if needed.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Lexapro is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) approved for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Its core effect is increased synaptic serotonin, which can stabilize mood and reduce anxiety-related irritability, although anger reduction per se is not an FDA-approved indication [^113jHXi8] [^111Y8Hc3].

> Wait, let me verify something I initially assumed: I thought escitalopram might have explicit labeling for anger, but hold on, I should double-check the FDA label. I need to ensure we're not overstating indications; the label emphasizes monitoring for activation symptoms including irritability, hostility, and aggressiveness, which actually warns me that anger can worsen in some patients, especially early in treatment or during dose changes, so anger reduction is not a labeled claim [^111mqFqa].

> Next, I should review the adverse event profile in pediatrics, because that sometimes clarifies signal detection for anger-related outcomes. In pediatric GAD trials, anger was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event at 2% on escitalopram vs 0% on placebo; that means anger can emerge during treatment in a small subset, reinforcing the need for close monitoring rather than assuming anger improvement will occur automatically [^116ZootJ].

> Now, let me examine direct evidence for anger improvement outside of labeled uses. In premenstrual dysphoric disorder, intermittent luteal-phase escitalopram reduced self-rated irritability and anger in randomized crossover designs, with consistent symptom reductions across multiple studies; this supports clinically meaningful anger reduction in a hormonally mediated subtype of anger symptoms [^112URbCK] [^117TxsqA] [^114Tibb7].

> Hold on, I should verify generalizability to broader anger syndromes like intermittent explosive disorder (IED). Systematic reviews indicate SSRIs, including escitalopram, are used off-label for IED and can reduce aggression and anger in some patients, though high heterogeneity exists and psychological treatments like CBT may outperform medications in aggregate; this suggests escitalopram can help selected IED patients, but effect sizes vary and evidence quality is limited [^111zzmhB] [^117CNhjp] [^115PDeoM].

> Let me consider mechanism to see if it's biologically plausible that escitalopram reduces anger. Enhanced serotonergic transmission modulates impulsivity and reactive aggression, and in PMDD specifically, escitalopram improves aspects of impulsivity and attention control during the luteal phase. Mechanistically, this aligns with reduced anger expression when emotional control improves, although translation to all anger phenotypes is not guaranteed [^114ZYRFV] [^113rNRBV] [^111C4hdD].

> But wait, what if the anger is driven by depression or anxiety rather than primary aggression pathology? I should confirm whether improving MDD or GAD indirectly lessens anger. In MDD and GAD, successful treatment often reduces irritability and associated anger, and long-term relapse prevention data for escitalopram in MDD support durable mood stabilization, which plausibly reduces anger when it is a secondary symptom of mood or anxiety disorders [^113jHXi8] [^115FDmwo].

> I need to ensure we account for risks and monitoring. Escitalopram can worsen agitation, irritability, hostility, and impulsivity in some patients, especially early in treatment or with dose changes; this mandates vigilant monitoring and dose adjustment or discontinuation if anger worsens. There is also a boxed warning for increased suicidality in patients 24 years and younger, which heightens the importance of close follow-up when treating anger in youth [^111mqFqa] [^115isjko] [^111biMkr].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing guidance if we proceed off-label for anger. Typical dosing follows the GAD/MDD framework: start 10 mg daily, titrate to 20 mg if needed, with slower titration in sensitive populations. For PMDD, intermittent luteal-phase dosing around 20 mg has evidence, and in hepatic impairment a maximum of 10 mg is advised. I should confirm that citalopram should not be coadministered and that drug interactions, bleeding risk, and QT considerations are screened before initiation [^111EPFJ2] [^115DvZFv] [^111vabRa] [^112URbCK].

> Let me synthesize. Does Lexapro help with anger? The answer is: sometimes, depending on context. For primary anger syndromes like IED, evidence is mixed and generally weaker than for psychological therapies; for secondary anger due to MDD or GAD, improvement is likely if the underlying disorder responds; and for hormonally mediated premenstrual anger, escitalopram shows consistent and clinically meaningful reductions. I should double-check that shared decision-making includes alternatives like CBT, mood stabilizers, or antipsychotics for severe impulsive aggression, and that we set expectations about variable response and the need for close monitoring during initiation and dose changes [^115PDeoM] [^117CNhjp] [^112URbCK] [^111mqFqa].

Lexapro (escitalopram) is **not FDA-approved** for anger, but it can reduce anger when it stems from depression or anxiety by improving mood and impulse control [^notfound]. It is sometimes used **off-label** for irritability in disorders such as PMDD [^112URbCK], IED [^117CNhjp], and BPD [^notfound], with modest benefits. However, anger may worsen early in treatment or during dose changes [^111absYG], so **close monitoring is essential** [^111rgZMo]. If anger persists or worsens, adjust the dose or switch medications, and consider psychotherapy or mood stabilizers.

---

## Clinical evidence on Lexapro and anger

### Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

For MDD and GAD, **indirect anger reduction** occurs as Lexapro improves core symptoms, which can lessen irritability and anger. In MDD, **FDA-approved use** applies to adults and adolescents 12–17 years, and in GAD, **FDA-approved use** applies to adults [^113jHXi8].

---

### Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)

Intermittent **luteal-phase dosing** of escitalopram reduced premenstrual irritability and anger in randomized crossover studies [^114Tibb7] [^112URbCK]. However, **limited generalizability** applies because effects were seen in women with severe premenstrual irritability/anger, not in broader PMDD populations [^114Tibb7].

---

### Intermittent explosive disorder (IED)

Off-label use of SSRIs, including escitalopram, is common for IED, with **modest reductions** in anger and aggression reported [^117CNhjp]. However, **limited evidence** means high-quality RCTs are lacking, and effects are inconsistent across studies [^114Ah6BS].

---

### Borderline personality disorder (BPD)

SSRIs may reduce anger in BPD, but **limited evidence** shows small effects and a need for more robust trials [^116GKfUa].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to anger

Lexapro increases synaptic serotonin, which can **modulate anger and aggression** via serotonergic pathways implicated in impulse control and emotional regulation [^111zzmhB]. It may also reduce **impulsivity**, potentially lowering anger-driven behaviors [^114ZYRFV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Off-label use**: Escitalopram may be considered for anger in PMDD, IED, or BPD when comorbid with depression or anxiety, but evidence is limited [^117CNhjp].

- **Monitoring**: Clinicians should monitor for increased irritability, aggression, or suicidality, especially early in treatment or during dose changes [^111rgZMo].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Psychotherapy (e.g. CBT, anger management) is often recommended alongside medication for optimal outcomes [^115PDeoM].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Initial worsening**: Anger or irritability may increase early in treatment or during dose adjustments [^111absYG].

- **Activation symptoms**: Akathisia, agitation, or mania/hypomania can occur, potentially exacerbating anger [^111absYG].

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Abrupt stopping can cause irritability and mood instability, worsening anger symptoms [^111fNbEx].

---

## Comparison with other medications

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Evidence for anger management** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | - Escitalopram <br/> - Fluoxetine | - Modest evidence <br/> - Especially in PMDD and IED | Generally well-tolerated; slow onset |
| Mood stabilizers | - Lithium <br/> - Valproate | Strong evidence for impulsive aggression | Require monitoring for toxicity |
| Antipsychotics | - Quetiapine <br/> - Risperidone | Effective for severe aggression | Risk of metabolic side effects |
| Benzodiazepines | - Lorazepam <br/> - Clonazepam | Short-term relief only | Risk of dependence and sedation |

---

## Clinical scenarios where Lexapro may be beneficial

Lexapro may help with anger in the following scenarios:

- **Comorbid depression/anxiety**: Anger is secondary to MDD or GAD [^113jHXi8].

- **PMDD**: Significant premenstrual irritability/anger [^113DnizM].

- **IED**: Mild-to-moderate impulsive aggression with comorbid mood symptoms [^111zzmhB].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Lexapro may not be beneficial

Lexapro may not help, or may worsen anger, in the following scenarios:

- **Primary aggression disorders**: Severe aggression without mood symptoms [^notfound].

- **Bipolar disorder**: Risk of mania/hypomania activation [^111fNbEx].

- **History of SSRI-induced activation**: Previous agitation or irritability with SSRIs [^111absYG].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Screening**: Assess for comorbid depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and substance use before prescribing [^111EPFJ2].

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at 10 mg/day, titrate based on response and tolerability [^112ok9FT].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for increased irritability, aggression, or suicidality, especially early in treatment [^111absYG].

- **Combine with psychotherapy**: Use CBT or anger management for comprehensive care [^115PDeoM].

- **Reassess regularly**: Adjust treatment if anger symptoms persist or worsen [^111absYG].

---

Lexapro can reduce anger when it is linked to depression or anxiety, with modest benefits in PMDD and IED, but **evidence is limited** and anger may worsen early in treatment; careful monitoring and individualized care are essential.

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^117JoBsy]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the current study showed that intermittent treatment with escitalopram during the symptomatic luteal phase of the menstrual cycle may have a beneficial impact on specific aspects of impulsivity and inattentiveness in women with severe premenstrual irritability and anger. Moreover, our findings showed that self-reported urgency increased, whereas self-reported sensation seeking decreased in the luteal versus the follicular phase, suggesting that different facets of impulsivity may be of different significance to premenstrual complaints. The current study advances the understanding of the roles of impulsivity and inattentiveness, both in terms of the therapeutic action of SSRIs and in terms of natural fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.

This review covers all significant randomized controlled trials and open trials of medications for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. New developments in the effectiveness of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are discussed. Differences were found in the effectiveness of medications based on the presence or absence of depression and significant anger symptoms. Medications continue to be recommended as adjuncts to psychotherapy. Most of the trials discussed require replication, and more trials that investigate the effectiveness of medications in combination with psychotherapy are recommended.

4 Discussion

This systematic review and meta‐analysis were the first to comprehensively assess the effects of various psychological, pharmacological treatment on improvements in core symptoms of IED. This dual approach provides a robust framework for understanding the relative efficacy of different treatment modalities and their application in clinical settings. Our analysis included 12 RCTs published between 1999 and 2023, encompassing a total of 616 participants and 14 case studies published between 1985 and 2022, encompassing a total of 19 patients. The studies were categorized into pharmacological and psychological interventions, focusing on various outcome measures related to aggression and anger.

4.1 Main Results From Both RCT and Case Studies (RQ1)

4.1.1 Aggression Reduction

The meta‐analysis of eight RCTs found no significant differences in the mean change of OAS‐M aggression scores between treatment and control groups, suggesting that, on average, neither pharmacological nor psychological interventions significantly outperformed controls in reducing aggression. However, the high statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 95.34%) indicates substantial variability in treatment effects, potentially due to differences in intervention types, duration and patient characteristics.

Subgroup analyses identified follow‐up time and intervention type as key moderators. Psychological interventions, particularly CBT and CRCST‐G, were associated with more favourable outcomes in specific time frames. This finding suggests that these therapies might be more effective for reducing aggression when implemented in shorter or more focused sessions. In contrast, pharmacological interventions showed a general trend towards reducing aggression scores, but their effectiveness varied widely depending on the drug type and patient demographics.

Meta‐regression analysis reinforced these findings, demonstrating that intervention types had a differential impact on aggression scores. While pharmacological treatments generally reduced aggression, psychological therapies, especially CRCST‐G, appeared more effective than Fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed medication for aggression in IED. This highlights the potential superiority of tailored psychological approaches over pharmacological treatments in specific patient populations. Future research should explore optimizing intervention duration and frequency, as well as tailoring interventions to patient‐specific factors, to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

### A single dose of fluoxetine reduces neural limbic responses to anger in depressed adolescents [^113Pdt6H]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adolescence is a developmental period in which the risk of experiencing psychological disorders increases significantly. Depression is common during this age period, being associated with a high rate of recurrence and significant risk of suicide. Clinically, adolescents with depression display the same symptoms as seen in adulthood, but there are some key differences: depressed youth often exhibit irritability rather than (or in addition to) low mood. This is reflected in the high rates of irritability reported in community and clinical youth samples with depression, varying between 30 and 85% –. For this reason, irritability is included as a cardinal symptom in the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among children and adolescents but not adults. More recently, irritability has also been recognised as a core antecedent of depression in young people, therefore playing an important etiological role in the development of depressive states. This association is further supported by evidence showing that depression and anger/irritability share overlapping genetic factors.

Despite being a common disorder, the pharmacological treatments available to treat adolescent depression are limited, with only fluoxetine and escitalopram approved for use in the US and only fluoxetine in the UK. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that we still know very little about the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying antidepressant action in children and adolescents, which constrains the development of new drug treatments.

It is well established that depression in adolescence is associated with altered activity in the cortico-limbic circuitry underpinning affective processing. Indeed, it has been reported that depressed adolescents show overactive responses in the amygdala to negative stimuli, including to facial displays of anger, as well as an increased tendency to detect angry faces. The amygdala plays an important role in facilitating attention to salient stimuli and subsequent behaviour. Such anger bias has therefore been hypothesised to fuel irritable symptoms frequently seen in this population. Conversely, young people with depression show functional abnormalities in key areas subserving the development of emotional regulation, in particular the dorsal ACC (dACC). The dACC is a key neural substrate supporting the development of self-regulatory capabilities in adolescence, given its role in goal maintenance and integration of sensory and affective information to guide behaviour. Functional impairments in this region are therefore thought to contribute to the difficulties experienced by depressed adolescents in self-regulating their negative emotions.

### Dealing with difficult patients in your pain practice [^111EtXqd]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pain patients can be difficult. They can provoke negative feelings of frustration and anger among clinicians and damage the doctor-patient relationship. This article helps practitioners to identify those pain patients who would be prone to difficult behavior and sheds light on some of the reasons behind the behavior that give rise to difficult feelings. Issues of comorbid psychopathology, hostility, suicidality, aberrant drug behavior, and chronic noncompliance are discussed. Specific recommendations are also given of the best ways to manage patients with difficult behavior.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^116SbYPi]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Adolescents

The efficacy of Lexapro as an acute treatment for major depressive disorder in adolescent patients was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro 10–20 mg/day to placebo in outpatients 12 to 17 years of age inclusive who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome was change from baseline to endpoint in the Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R). In this study, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the CDRS-R.

The efficacy of Lexapro in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study with racemic citalopram 20–40 mg/day. In this outpatient study in children and adolescents 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, citalopram treatment showed statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline, compared to placebo, on the CDRS-R; the positive results for this trial largely came from the adolescent subgroup.

Two additional flexible-dose, placebo-controlled MDD studies (one Lexapro study in patients ages 7 to 17 and one citalopram study in adolescents) did not demonstrate efficacy.

Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.

### Can we not work together to help family practitioners become more effective pain managers? [^113VLVKU]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The review article also states, "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and opioids are optional third-line medications". The role of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating pain associated with DPN is questionable, even to be suggested as a third-line medication. While there is a connection between mood and pain perception, SSRIs have no established mechanism or role in managing pain associated with DPN. Norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibition, as seen with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants, is the primary mediator of the analgesic effect. The review article highlighted that "Combined data from four small studies reveal an NNT [number needed to treat] of 7 for pain reduction with this class of medications". The supporting reference is, "SSRIs have been studied in a few trials which have demonstrated a weak analgesic effect, but the clinical relevance of these compounds is questionable", by Finnerup et al. There are concerns in these studies, as the methods, sample size, and results have dubious clinical relevance from which to draw conclusions about their role in DPN. The study of paroxetine for neuropathic pain involved 19 participants in an alternating crossover every 2 weeks in each arm, in which, for example, one group of six participants received a placebo for 2 weeks, followed by imipramine for 2 weeks, then paroxetine for 2 weeks. There are methodological weaknesses with the study, including blinding and crossover design without a washout period, as well as utilizing a drug with long elimination half-life (19 hours), of which the therapeutic effects remained during paroxetine group's test period. Similar to the paroxetine study, the citalopram study followed a 3-week crossover with a placebo in 15 participants. Finally, the study for escitalopram utilized a verbal pain rating scale ("complete", "good", "slight", "none", or "worse") corresponding to a score of 0–11. Escitalopram showed improvement by 1 point with a wide standard deviation, with the largest improvements compared to placebo falling mostly in the "none" and "slight" pain relief designations. There was no statistically significant difference in quantitative sensory testing between both the groups. None of these trials utilized a parallel group with an active comparator that was selective for NE reuptake inhibition. For these reasons, SSRIs are not currently found among recommendations for any current treatment guideline for the management of neuropathic pain.–As a matter of fact, the International Association for the Study of Pain cites level A/B rating for inefficacy or discrepant results for SSRIs in neuropathic pain. Therefore, citing SSRIs as a third-line option may be interpreted as continuing SSRIs to treat DPN in patients who are already on SSRIs for mental health indications rather than switching to evidence-based medications such as serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

5.10 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness

Clinical experience with escitalopram oral solution in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using escitalopram oral solution in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

Escitalopram oral solution has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.

In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution in hepatically impaired patients is 10 mg/day [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with escitalopram oral solution, however, it should be used with caution in such patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

5.11 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including escitalopram oral solution, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of escitalopram oral solution and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Lexapro, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

5.3 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram oral solution. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram oral solution has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram oral solution, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram oral solution treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram oral solution should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram oral solution or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram oral solution in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram oral solution and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram oral solution treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram oral solution, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^113jHXi8]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lexapro® is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for:

Acute and Maintenance Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents aged 12–17 years (1.1)
Acute Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults (1.2)

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Lexapro (escitalopram) is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Lexapro is indicated for the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^111absYG]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers [see also Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Prescriptions for Lexapro should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^111C4hdD]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The self-report measure of impulsivity, the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, suggested higher levels of urgency and lower levels of sensation seeking in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. As reported previously (Gröndal et al.), and in line with previous studies, participants reported a significant decrease in irritability/anger and mood swings in the daily symptom ratings in the luteal phase of the escitalopram cycle compared with the placebo cycle. Regarding the laboratory measures of attention and impulsivity, participants in the luteal phase had a lower rate of anticipatory responses and higher response speed consistency in the escitalopram cycle than in the placebo cycle.

With respect to self-reported impulsivity, the finding that urgency increased significantly among participants in the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase suggests emotion-related impulsivity in premenstrual complaints and aligns with previous findings (Dawson et al.). In contrast to urgency, participants' sensation seeking was found to decrease in the symptomatic phase. Unlike the other facets of the UPPS, sensation seeking has been associated with adaptive functioning (Ravert et al.). For instance, it is associated with extraversion (Whiteside & Lynam,), which, in turn, is associated with well-being (Costa & McCrae). Future studies on the role of various forms of impulsivity in PMDD appear warranted.

2.1.3 Data Extraction for Meta‐Analysis of RCTs

The following variables was extracted and coded from the studies meeting inclusion criteria: author, publication year, comparisons (including the type of intervention [e.g. CBT and medication]) and the characteristics of the control condition (e.g. wait‐list, placebo and alternative treatment), time‐point of post‐treatment measures, pharmacological or psychological treatment, mean age and gender of the participants, diagnosis criteria (e.g. DSM and ICD), treatment dosage (medication dosage or the number of therapy sessions) and treatment duration (e.g. weeks of treatment), outcome variables and measurement tools (primary and secondary outcome variables including the specific measures used to assess these outcomes) and time‐point of outcome assessment (the time‐point of post‐treatment measures and any follow‐up measurement intervals).

2.1.4 Risk of Bias (Quality) Assessment for Meta‐Analysis of RCTs

Two reviewers (F.Q.L. and X.S.Y.) performed a quality appraisal of each study independently using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (CRBT). This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of bias in the results of RCTs. It evaluates several domains such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other biases (Higgins et al.). The exact CRBT result for each included RCT study is listed as Appendix S1.

2.1.5 Type of Outcome Measure for Meta‐Analysis of RCTs

The primary outcomes include measures of aggression, irritability, response to treatment and full remission rates in patients with IED. Additionally, any relief from other relevant symptoms is carefully assessed and interpreted. Validated outcome instruments for IED, such as the Overt Aggression Scale‐Modified (OAS‐M), were utilized. To be included in the analysis, studies must report quantitative measures of the intervention's effect on IED.

The secondary outcomes focus on the subtypes of anger symptoms in IED, primarily including Anger Expression‐Out (STAXI‐AXO), Anger Expression‐In (STAXI‐AXI), Anger Control‐Out (STAXI‐ACO), Anger Control‐In (STAXI‐ACI) and State Anger State (STAXI‐SAS). Additionally, any adverse effects reported are considered.

### A single dose of fluoxetine reduces neural limbic responses to anger in depressed adolescents [^115hMFUx]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The effect seen here on anger processing is consistent with our previous research and could therefore represent a key mechanism of fluoxetine for treating young people with depression, who frequently show irritability. Indeed, depressed adolescents are particularly prone to detect angry faces, and show hyperactive amygdala responses in response to this emotion. Neural abnormalities in the amygdala, including to facial stimuli of anger, are also seen in other disorders characterised by irritability −. Fluoxetine may therefore act to reduce the salience of anger cues in the environment, an effect that could help reduce the symptoms of irritability over time. This hypothesis is supported by clinical evidence showing that fluoxetine is effective in treating anger in the context of adult depression with anger attacks, intermittent explosive disorder, and pre-menstrual disorder. There are also preliminary data suggesting that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) – including fluoxetine - are beneficial in treating pathological symptoms of irritability/aggression across several paediatric disorders, not only depression, but also severe mood dysregulation and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (see Kim and Boylan for a review). Future research should therefore examine the extent to which neural changes in response to anger are associated with behavioural changes in irritability following treatment with fluoxetine in a wide range of disorders. There is evidence from depressed adults showing that early SSRI-induced reductions in neural activity, including in the amygdala and ACC, to negative vs. positive faces are predictive of later therapeutic improvements. It would be important for similar experimental medicine studies to be conducted in young people. Newer measures are also being developed to quantify irritability, and these should form an integral part of future research into antidepressant effects in children and adolescents (see Vidal-Ribas for useful review).

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^1172ouQe]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedure

A flow chart of the study procedure is presented in Figure 1. The study extended over three menstrual cycles: Cycle 1 (without intervention) and Cycles 2 and 3 (with intervention). In Cycle 1, participants recorded emotional symptoms over a complete menstrual cycle to validate the presence of premenstrual irritability/anger in the luteal phase (for details, see Participants). For Cycles 2 and 3, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups for the treatment phase. One group received active SSRI treatment (escitalopram, 20 mg) in Cycle 2 and placebo in Cycle 3, while the other group received the treatments in the reverse order (i.e. first placebo, then escitalopram). The packaging and tablets were identical in appearance for the escitalopram and placebo treatments, respectively.

Figure 1.
Flowchart of the study procedure.

Participants completed CPT 3 twice, once in the luteal phase of the escitalopram cycle and once in the luteal phase of the placebo cycle. In addition, they filled out the UPPS twice (once in the follicular phase and once in the luteal phase of the placebo cycle).

In addition to the CPT 3 testing, the participants were also the subject of sampling for an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (the results of which will be published elsewhere) in both luteal phases and in one of the follicular phases. It was deemed important that both the order of the cycle phases and the order of the two treatments given in the luteal phase were randomized, and also that the follicular phase sampling did never take place shortly after a luteal phase where the participant had received active drug; hence, follicular sampling occurred in the first cycle of subjects receiving escitalopram in this cycle and in the second cycle of those receiving placebo in the first. This is why a double-blind design was not feasible.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials of escitalopram, there were reports of escitalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 600 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of escitalopram, escitalopram oral solution overdoses involving overdoses of over 1000 mg have been reported. As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of escitalopram has been rarely reported.

Symptoms most often accompanying escitalopram overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, included convulsions, coma, dizziness, hypotension, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, somnolence, and ECG changes (including QT prolongation and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdose

Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for escitalopram oral solution.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^114Jnkfe]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Patients

Psychiatrists recruited patients in private practice or hospital outpatient clinics. Those eligible for study were outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD (assessed by psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), moderate or severe, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, and who gave informed consent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail by Gorwood et al. Patients were required to have a MADRS score ≥ 22 and an MMSE score ≥ 24 at entry. Patients with severe or unstable medical co-morbid diseases were excluded.

Medication treatment

Study medications were tablets for oral administration of identical appearance, taste and smell. The oxalate salt of escitalopram, or a placebo, was used in the tablets. After the open-label period, eligible patients were assigned to escitalopram or placebo according to a computer-generated randomisation list drawn up by H. Lundbeck A/S. Details of the randomisation were unknown to any of the investigators and were contained in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. At each study center, sequentially enrolled patients were assigned the lowest randomisation number available in blocks of four. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.

Assessments

After baseline assessment of efficacy measures, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of open-label treatment. For patients randomised to double-blind treatment, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed 1, 2, and 4 weeks after randomisation, and then every 4 weeks until the last dose of double-blind treatment (Week 24 of double blind, also Week 36 of the full study).

Efficacy assessments at baseline and each follow-up visit included the MADRS, Clinical Global Impression - Severity of illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of illness (CGI-I). The primary analysis of efficacy was the time to relapse from the start date of double-blind treatment. Prior to the study, all investigators attended a joined MADRS and CGI rating session chaired by an experienced research psychiatrist.

The tolerability and safety evaluations were based on spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), vital signs, body weight, and physical examination.

### Intermittent escitalopram treatment and reactive aggression in women with premenstrual irritability and anger: a crossover study [^114Tibb7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the primary treatment for premenstrual mood symptoms and particularly effective in reducing reactive aggression in the forms of irritability and anger. The present study examined whether behavioral responses in laboratory measures of reactive aggression are influenced by medication with the SSRI escitalopram in women reporting high levels of premenstrual irritability/anger.

Methods

Participants (N = 34) rated the cardinal mood symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder over three menstrual cycles. During the second and third cycles, participants received escitalopram (20 mg) or placebo in a single-blind, cross-over design. In the luteal phase of the intervention cycles, participants completed two aggression tasks: The Anger-Infused Ultimatum Game (AI-UG) and the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Additionally, they rated expression and control of anger using the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2) once in the luteal phase and once in the follicular phase.

Results

While irritability/anger was reduced in the treatment (vs. placebo) cycle, no effect of escitalopram was detected in the PSAP. Escitalopram decreased reactive aggressive behavior in the AI-UG but only for a subset of participants who experienced a sharp premenstrual rise in outwardly expressed anger and/or did not experience a premenstrual rise in inwardly expressed anger.

Limitations

The participants' symptoms were based on the severity of only premenstrual irritability/anger, limiting the generalizability to the broader group of PMDD patients.

Conclusion

The results suggest that the behavioral consequences of severe premenstrual irritability/anger are not easily captured by traditional measures of reactive aggression and underline the importance of considering individual differences in symptom expression.

17.1 Information for Patients

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Lexapro.

General Information about Medication Guide

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Lexapro and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Lexapro. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Lexapro.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^117TxsqA]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

It is well-established that premenstrual symptoms can be effectively reduced by treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; Eriksson et al; Sundblad et al.). The symptom reduction occurs rapidly within a few days after commencing SSRI medication, and the treatment can therefore be administered intermittently, typically from ovulation until the onset of menstruation (Eriksson et al; Steinberg et al.). Importantly, the premenstrual symptoms particularly alleviated by intermittent SSRI treatment are those with emotional characteristics, specifically irritability/anger and affect lability (Landén et al.).

The effectiveness of SSRIs in mood-related premenstrual complaints suggests serotonergic transmission to play a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Yonkers et al.). In line with this, sex hormones and their associated receptors are known to modulate serotonin transmission (Rubinow et al.) and are found abundantly in brain regions responsible for regulating emotions and their behavioral outcomes, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (Brinton et al; Hara et al.). Support for an involvement of serotonin in PMDD includes findings that tryptophan depletion – a precursor to serotonin – can induce premenstrual mood symptoms (Menkes et al.), while serotonin receptor antagonists may block the symptom-relieving effects of SSRIs (Roca et al.). Moreover, a positron emission tomography study has recently provided direct support for an altered serotonergic function during the premenstrual phase in PMDD patients (Sacher et al.).

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^112T19ms]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Explosive/rage symptoms in tic disorders — anger and rage outbursts are reported as not uncommon, with a survey estimating 37% of patients present with anger control problems; in clinic-referred tic samples, up to 80% of youth are estimated to have co-occurring disruptive behavior disorders. In some cases, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms or sensory issues may serve as triggers, and behavioral therapies that address antecedents and anger management may be useful. There are no controlled pharmacological studies in youth with tic disorders and aggressive/anger outbursts; although there are preliminary data for olanzapine, aripiprazole and risperidone in reducing disruptive behavior disorder symptoms, findings should be interpreted cautiously. A reduction in rage attacks was observed after an 8-week open trial of paroxetine, but the age range was markedly variable (i.e., ages 6–55 years) and self-report was used to assess rage.

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^114ZYRFV]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Heightened impulsivity has been suggested to become exacerbated in the luteal phase (Ko et al.) and to be a trait feature of patients with PMDD (Yen et al.). The current study did not investigate the trait dimension of impulsivity. That is, we do not know how participants' self-rated levels of impulsivity would compare with a population without premenstrual irritability and anger. Instead, our study shows how different types of impulsivity vary within individuals between symptomatic and nonsymptomatic phases.

The parameters of the impulsivity dimension of CPT 3 are efficient in identifying rapid-response impulsivity and failures to suppress inappropriate actions in situations where the individual is required to make time-limited evaluations and discriminations. The current findings suggest that escitalopram improved the ability of the participants to inhibit anticipatory responses, which is in line with previous studies of how serotonin may impact impulsive action or behavioral inhibition (Miyazaki et al; Roberts et al.). Moreover, participants also processed stimuli more effectively throughout the task compared with the placebo cycle, indicating improved attention during the active treatment cycle. Attention performance has previously been studied, albeit to a limited extent, in different cycle phases in women with PMDD (Le et al.), but there is currently no consensus on how attention-related performance is affected in women with severe premenstrual complaints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report addressing the possible impact of an SSRI on the outcome of the CPT 3.

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^113rNRBV]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Impulsivity-related disabilities and associated cognitive complaints often occur alongside dysfunctional affective symptoms in psychiatric conditions (Okon-Singer et al.). As serotonin is suggested to play an important physiological role in the regulation of impulsivity (da Cunha-Bang & Knudsen; Dalley & Roiser,), it is of interest to assess whether enhanced impulsivity may be a facet of premenstrual dysphoria, and, if so, whether SSRI treatment may impact this symptom. In line with this, previous research has found increases in impulsive, risky, or maladaptive behaviors during the luteal phase (Eisenlohr-Moul et al.), as well as positive correlations between emotion-related impulsivity and the severity of other PMDD symptoms (Dawson et al.). While impulsivity has been suggested as a trait feature in patients diagnosed with PMDD (Yen et al.), periodically exacerbated impulsivity during the luteal phase has also been observed (Ko et al.). When examining different types of impulsivity, Petersen et al (2016) found behavioral but not cognitive trait impulsivity to be elevated in PMDD patients (vs. controls). In sum, previous findings highlight the importance of studying different varieties of impulsivity.

### Comprehensive review and meta-analysis of psychological and pharmacological treatment for intermittent explosive disorder: insights from both case studies and randomized controlled trials [^117CNhjp]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluoxetine is typically administered in oral capsules or liquid form, with initial doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg daily, and the dose can be gradually increased depending on the patient's response and tolerance (Sohel et al.). Other SSRIs, such as sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro), have also been used off‐label for IED (Edinoff et al; Sanchez, Reines, and Montgomery). These drugs share similar mechanisms of action as fluoxetine, but they differ in terms of adverse effect profiles and individual response rates. For instance, while all SSRIs enhance serotonergic transmission, the incidence of side effects such as nausea, insomnia or sexual dysfunction may vary across medications, and treatment decisions are often tailored to patient‐specific needs (Chu and Wadhwa).

In addition to SSRIs, mood stabilizers are another prominent class of drugs used in managing IED, particularly when impulsive aggression is severe or coexists with mood dysregulation (Gould, Chen, and Manji). Lithium, valproate (Depakote) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) are the most commonly used mood stabilizers in this context (Coccaro and McCloskey). Lithium, in particular, has been widely studied and is known to modulate neurotransmitter activity, specifically balancing dopamine and serotonin, which helps regulate mood swings and reduce aggression (Malhi et al.). However, lithium's use requires close monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic window and significant side effects, such as hand tremors, polyuria (Gitlin; Malhi et al.) and potential long‐term effects on the kidneys and thyroid (Boivin et al.). Regular blood tests are necessary to prevent toxicity, which could result in neurological complications (Gitlin).

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Escitalopram is excreted in human breast milk. Limited data from women taking 10–20 mg escitalopram showed that exclusively breast-fed infants receive approximately 3.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of escitalopram and 1.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of desmethylcitalopram. There were two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a racemic citalopram-treated mother; in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of racemic citalopram by its mother and, in the second case, no follow-up information was available. Caution should be exercised and breastfeeding infants should be observed for adverse reactions when Lexapro is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has not been established in pediatric patients (less than 12 years of age) with Major Depressive Disorder. Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has been established in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) for the treatment of major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients with Major Depressive Disorder has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.

Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Decrease appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as Lexapro.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The following have been reported with escitalopram tablet overdosage:

Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.
Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co-ingestants including alcohol.
Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).

Prolonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in escitalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk.

Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a escitalopram overdose.

Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials of escitalopram, there were reports of escitalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 600 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of escitalopram, Lexapro overdoses involving overdoses of over 1000 mg have been reported. As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of escitalopram has been rarely reported.

Symptoms most often accompanying escitalopram overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, included convulsions, coma, dizziness, hypotension, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, somnolence, and ECG changes (including QT prolongation and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdose

Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for Lexapro.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.

5.9 Angle Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including escitalopram tablets, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

5.10 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness

Clinical experience with escitalopram in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using escitalopram in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

Escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease.

Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.

In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The recommended dose of escitalopram in hepatically impaired patients is 10 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with escitalopram, however, it should be used with caution in such patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

5.11 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including escitalopram, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of escitalopram and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.

### Escitalopram-induced parkinsonism [^112wfJis]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Since the early reports associating extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), SSRIs have been pointed as more common offenders among antidepressants in producing EPS. The induction of EPS by SSRIs has been thought to be a consequence of serotonergically mediated inhibition of the dopaminergic system. We would like to present a case of escitalopram-induced Parkinsonism to increase awareness of this clinical problem.

Method

A 29-year-old male patient complaining of anger outbursts was started on escitalopram 10 mg/day without titration for impulse control in an outpatient clinic. Personal and family history was not significant for any chronic disorder, including movement disorders.

Results

Two weeks after the initiation of escitalopram, the patient started complaining of tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, use of small steps when walking difficulty to rise when seated, disturbance of speech and along with the development of a mask-like facial expression. An MRI of the brain revealed normal findings. With a diagnosis of drug-induced Parkinsonism, he was started on 4-mg/day biperiden leading to full resolution of symptoms in 4 weeks, with no further complaints at follow up for 1.5 years.

Conclusion

As described, drug-induced Parkinsonism may persist or remit slowly despite prompt discontinuation of the offending drug. Some patients may require medications temporarily to relieve symptoms.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.
Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co-ingestants including alcohol.
Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).

Prolonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in escitalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk.

Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a escitalopram overdose.

Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### A single dose of fluoxetine reduces neural limbic responses to anger in depressed adolescents [^11249ZPf]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, the current study has important strengths. First, studies of neural effects of antidepressant drugs in young people are rare. Here we found that fluoxetine acts on neural correlates that have been previously implicated in adolescent depression and pathological irritability. Hence, this psychopharmacological approach could prove useful to screen new drug targets for adolescent depression and test the potential efficacy of fluoxetine in treating disorders in which anger and irritability are key symptoms. Second, the implementation, for the first time, of a single dose placebo-controlled design in unmedicated depressed adolescents allowed us to determine that the effects of fluoxetine on anger processing occurred prior to clinical changes in symptoms and independently of treatment expectations. Third, the drug effects in the amygdala-hippocampal region emerged in the whole brain analysis, therefore surviving a stringent correction for multiple comparisons.

1.2 Pharmacological Treatment for IED

Pharmacological treatments for IED aim to mitigate the frequency and intensity of explosive outbursts by targeting the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the disorder (Coccaro, Lee, et al; Felthous et al; van Schalkwyk et al.). Specific medications increase the threshold at which emotional stimuli trigger aggressive reactions in individuals with IED (Brodie et al.). SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed class of medications for IED due to their ability to regulate mood, decrease impulsivity and reduce aggressive behaviour (Chu and Wadhwa). Although none of these medications are FDA‐approved specifically for IED, they are often used off‐label because of their efficacy in treating similar impulsivity‐driven disorders.

Among SSRIs, fluoxetine (Prozac) is the most frequently employed medication in treating IED. Fluoxetine functions by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin in the brain, leading to increased levels of this neurotransmitter in synaptic spaces, which enhances mood stabilization and improves impulse control (Patel and Galarneau). This is particularly important for IED patients, who often display low serotonin activity linked to impulsive aggression (Seo, Patrick, and Kennealy). Clinical trials, such as those conducted by Coccaro, Lee, and Kavoussi, have demonstrated that fluoxetine significantly reduces the frequency of anger episodes and overall aggression in individuals with IED, particularly those who have comorbid conditions like anxiety and depression. These comorbidities often exacerbate IED symptoms, and fluoxetine's ability to alleviate them contributes to its effectiveness in preventing anger outbursts (Coccaro, Lee, and Kavoussi).

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^111vabRa]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Abnormal Bleeding

Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of Lexapro and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Concomitant Medications

Since escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions.

Continuing the Therapy Prescribed

While patients may notice improvement with Lexapro therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.

Interference with Psychomotor Performance

Because psychoactive drugs may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Lexapro therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Alcohol

Patients should be told that, although Lexapro has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of Lexapro and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.

Pregnancy and Breast Feeding

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they

become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.
are breastfeeding an infant.

Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program

Lexapro is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for MDD that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all adolescents with this syndrome. Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro in MDD has not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. Antidepressants are not intended for use in the adolescent who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe antidepressant medication will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient's symptoms.

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^1146bmBH]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The distress experienced by a subset of women in the days or weeks preceding menstruation has been studied for many decades (Frank). Considerable evidence supports the idea that such periodically expressed symptomatology is linked to the fluctuations of sex hormones and their metabolites throughout the menstrual cycle (Hantsoo & Epperson). Premenstrual complaints encompass both physical and psychological symptoms, but mood-related symptoms, such as irritability and mood swings, are identified as exerting the most substantial harmful impact and functional impairment in the affected individual (Pearlstein; Studer et al.). Those who experience multiple severe premenstrual complaints may be diagnosed with the mood disorder premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD; American Psychiatric Association). PMDD is distinguished by the recurring appearance of a minimum of five symptoms during the luteal phase with full remission of symptoms in the week after the onset of menses. While the existence of premenstrual mood symptoms is widely documented, their relationships with transdiagnostic behavioral factors, such as impulsivity and inattention, are less well understood.

### Autism gene variants disrupt enteric neuron migration and cause gastrointestinal dysmotility [^111joKjB]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment rescues gut dysmotility following Dyrk1a inhibition

Serotonin signaling is known to control enteric neuron activity and gut motility. Therefore, we selected 8 FDA-approved drugs that impact serotonin signaling at various points in the pathway (Fig. 4a) and tested whether acute treatment alters gut movement with our in vivo gut motility assay in unmanipulated mature tadpoles. Of these drugs, at the concentration we tested (10 µM), only the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram oxalate was able to promote gut motility greater than 1 standard deviation compared to negative control treatment DMSO (Fig. 4b). Escitalopram oxalate (also known as Lexapro) is a common SSRI that interacts with SERT, the serotonin transporter, to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic cell, thereby prolonging serotonin pathway activation (Fig. 4a). This result is consistent with previous studies in which activating or prolonging active serotonin signaling promotes gut motility in mammals –.

14.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults was demonstrated in three, 8-week, multicenter, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies that compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients between 18 and 80 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD. In all three studies, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).

There were too few patients in differing ethnic and age groups to adequately assess whether or not Lexapro has differential effects in these groups. There was no difference in response to Lexapro between men and women.

Pediatric Patients 7 years of age and older

The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-V criteria for GAD. The primary outcome was change from baseline to Week 8 in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) severity score for GAD. In this study, Lexapro showed a statistically significant treatment difference when compared to placebo on the PARS severity score for GAD (Least squares mean difference: −1.42, 95% confidence interval [−2.69, −0.15]).

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

In a longer-term trial, 274 patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder, who had responded during an initial 8 week, open-label treatment phase with Lexapro 10 mg or 20 mg daily, were randomized to continuation of Lexapro at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 36 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined by having a decrease of the MADRS total score to ≤ 12. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the MADRS total score to ≥ 22, or discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response. Patients receiving continued Lexapro experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse compared to those receiving placebo.

Pediatric Patients 12 years of age and older

The efficacy of Lexapro as a treatment for major depressive disorder in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients 12 to 17 years of age inclusive who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary outcome was change from baseline to endpoint in the Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R). In this study, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the CDRS-R.

The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment of major depressive disorder in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study with racemic citalopram 20 mg to 40 mg daily. In this outpatient study in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, citalopram treatment showed statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline, compared to placebo, on the CDRS-R; the positive results for this trial largely came from the 12 to 17 year subgroup.

Two additional flexible-dose, placebo-controlled MDD studies (one Lexapro study in patients ages 7 to 17 years and one citalopram study patients 13 to 18 years) did not demonstrate efficacy. The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with MDD.

### Improvement of anger at one week predicts the effects of sertraline and placebo in PTSD [^1156Jk9S]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

In previous work we demonstrated an early, robust and sustained effect for sertraline vs placebo on irritability and anger in subjects with PTSD. In this report, we explore the same dataset to assess whether a clinician might usefully predict ultimate response to sertraline, on the basis of its effect upon anger after one week. Three hundred and eighteen subjects were assessed. Outcome was measured by whether or not the score was reduced by at least 50% from baseline. Ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate the effects of change in anger at one week. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the effects on odds of a 50% drop in score. Cut points were developed for one-week change scores on anger for sertraline and placebo. The best cut point was selected as predictive of non-response, i.e. a cue suggesting that treatment switch would be in order. An increase in anger of 30% at one-week best predicted the likelihood of not responding to treatment in both the drug and placebo groups. Twenty-five percent of all non-responders were incorrectly identified, while only 7% of all improvers were incorrectly categorized as non-responders using this cutoff. Our findings imply that, for patients similar to those in this study, an increase in anger after one week of treatment might be one factor to consider when making a decision about continuation of the medication.

2.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The recommended dosage of escitalopram in adults is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of escitalopram demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of escitalopram, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Depending on clinical response and tolerability, dosage may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage of 20 mg once daily at an interval of no less than 1 week.

Pediatric Patients 12 years of age and older

The recommended dosage of escitalopram in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 10 mg once daily. Depending on clinical response and tolerability, dosage may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage of 20 mg once daily at an interval of no less than 3 weeks.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1127mihJ]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Child/adolescent pharmacotherapy — scope of recommendations: While there is clear evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials for the use of fluoxetine (Prozac) in children and adolescents, there is limited evidence meeting the IOM or AMSTAR criteria for other antidepressants, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidepressant for youth, escitalopram (Lexapro). In the panel's review of the evidence for escitalopram, we were unable to recommend for or against this medication, and the panel has elected not to provide a recommendation on the use of Nefazodone (Serzone) as an antidepressant given its lack of clinical relevance for current practice. The panel concludes that the strongest evidence for a pharmacologic treatment for adolescent depression is for fluoxetine (Prozac), and if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.

5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

2.1.6 Statistical Analyses for Meta‐Analysis of RCTs

The majority of data analysis work was conducted using STATA Software (Version 17, USA), focusing exclusively on postoperative outcomes to compare intervention and control groups. For certain studies, reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and standard errors (SEs) were converted into SDs to ensure uniformity in effect estimation.

Continuous outcomes such as aggression scores, anger, depression, anxiety and quality of life were assessed using the mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI. For dichotomous outcomes, including response rates, full remission and adverse events, the log odds ratio and its 95% CI were determined. Meta‐analyses were executed using the metan command where the mean change from preoperative to postoperative data was compared between both groups (intervention vs. control). Subgroup analyses were conducted where possible, based on the available number of trials, and categorized by measurement timepoints (weeks), intervention categories (pharmacological vs. psychological treatment) and specific intervention types (drug names).

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^116HDcVp]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The above findings need to be interpreted with caution, as CPT 3 includes several parameters in the impulsivity and inattentiveness dimensions, and only one parameter in each dimension was significantly improved by escitalopram treatment. Thus, we need to limit our claim such that some aspects of the multidimensional impulsivity and inattention constructs appear to improve as a result of SSRI medication. Caution also needs to be applied when linking the CPT 3 findings to the reduction of self-reported irritability/anger and mood swings in the escitalopram (vs. placebo) cycle. While the experience of negative emotions can be exacerbated in the presence of dysfunctional impulsivity (Barratt & Slaughter; Lynam & Miller,) and inattention (Hammar et al.), the current findings do not reveal whether reduced impulsivity and inattention actively contribute to the reduced symptom ratings. Laboratory research on premenstrual disorders is in its infancy, and it remains unclear whether the associated cognitive impairments can be attributed to negative affective experiences and psychological symptoms or whether they are direct effects of hormonal dysregulation or sensitivity. Nonetheless, the current findings indicate that effects on impulsivity and inattention may be important components in understanding the therapeutic effects of SSRIs in premenstrual irritability/anger and mood swings.

### Topiramate in treatment of depressive and anger symptoms in female depressive patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113L5tsG]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is associated with increased aggression and diminished ability and quality of life. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of topiramate in influencing depressive symptoms, aggression, ability, and health related quality of life in depressive women.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 10-week study of topiramate in 64 female subjects from the general population who met criteria for recurrent major depressive disorder. Primary outcome measures were changes on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), the Test of Attention (d2), and the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36).

Results

According to the intent-to-treat principle, a significant difference on the HDRS (P = 0.02), all scales of STAXI (all P < 0.001), Total efficiency of d2 (P < 0.001), and on most scales of SF-36 (P between 0.15 and < 0.001) were observed in the topiramate-treated subjects comprised the placebo group. The reduction in expression of anger correlated significantly with changes on the HDRS, and several scales of d2 and SF-36. Additional weight loss, which was significantly more pronounced in the topiramate group than in those treated with a placebo, was ascertained (difference in weight loss between the two groups: 4.2 kg, P < 0.001). All the patients tolerated topiramate relatively well.

Limitations

Only moderately ill women were included.

Conclusions

Topiramate appears to be an effective agent in the reduction of depressive symptoms and anger and in the improvement of ability and health-related quality of life in depressive women. Additional weight loss can be expected.

Moreover, the impulsivity and aggression associated with IED can propel adolescents towards juvenile delinquency (Yu et al.). The inability to manage anger effectively can lead to confrontations with authority figures, vandalism (Carvalho et al.) and other aggressive acts that often result in legal issues and juvenile detention (Barra et al.). This trajectory of behavioural issues highlights the critical need for early intervention and consistent therapeutic support to mitigate long‐term negative outcomes.

During adulthood, the ramifications of IED can persist, with individuals who have a history of the disorder being more susceptible to engaging in criminal activities (Scott, de Vries, et al.). The chronic pattern of impulsive and aggressive behaviours, if untreated, can evolve into more severe antisocial behaviours. Adults with a history of IED may find themselves involved in domestic violence, assault (Sontate et al.) and other criminal activities, such as manslaughter or murder, driven by the same inability to control their aggressive impulses that affected them during adolescence (Puiu et al.). This underscores the importance of continuous support and management strategies for individuals with IED, to prevent the escalation of their symptoms into more severe and legally consequential behaviours.

Current treatment options for IED are diverse, yet their efficacy varies and are not universally established, due to the complexity of the disorder. These treatments often include psychological treatments, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), or off‐label use of medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Meanwhile, although there is an increasing trend in IED diagnosis, there are currently no drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for treating IED (Rynar and Coccaro). This lack of FDA‐approved medications presents a significant challenge in the management of IED, highlighting the need for continued research into effective pharmacological treatments.

Overall, while current treatment modalities offer some relief, the variability in their effectiveness underscores the urgent need for more robust, evidence‐based treatment protocols. This ongoing challenge emphasizes the importance of further research to expand the knowledge base on the underlying mechanisms of IED and to develop targeted treatments that can more consistently and effectively manage the disorder's symptoms (Costa et al; Olvera).

In all three studies, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).

There were too few patients in differing ethnic and age groups to adequately assess whether or not Lexapro has differential effects in these groups. There was no difference in response to Lexapro between men and women.

Comprehensive search terms for case study.

The population‐intervention‐comparator‐outcomes‐study design (PICOS) framework was used to identify eligible cases. Details of the criteria established a priori were as follows:

Population: Individuals diagnosed with IED based on standardized diagnostic criteria (such as DSM‐5‐TR, ICD‐10 and IED‐IR). Both children and adults are included, with no restrictions on gender, ethnicity or comorbid conditions.

Intervention: Pharmacological treatments, such as SSRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and other medications. Psychological treatments, including CBT, anger management programs and other psychotherapeutic approaches. Combined interventions that utilize both pharmacological and behavioural treatments will also be included if presented.

Comparator: Placebo treatments or sham interventions. Alternative treatments, including different pharmacological agents or behavioural therapies. No treatment or standard care, if applicable in the context of the case reports.

Outcomes: Primary outcomes: Reduction in the frequency and severity of explosive outbursts, as measured by validated scales (e.g. OAS‐M, STAXI‐2 and the Clinical Global Impression Scale). Secondary outcomes: improvements in quality of life, social functioning and overall psychiatric health. Adverse effects: documentation of any side effects or negative reactions to the treatments.

Material and methods

Study design and settings

The study had a randomized and placebo-controlled crossover design. For logistical reasons, the treatment was single-blind rather than double-blind – that is, the participants but not the staff were unaware of the order of the escitalopram cycle and the placebo cycle, respectively. Participants received 1,000 SEK (~100 USD) for each of the three lab visits and were additionally reimbursed for travel and/or loss of income due to these visits. All procedures were approved by the University of Gothenburg Institutional Review Board (Dnr854–13/EudraCTnr2012–000309–60). In a previous article based on the same study, the outcome of tests reflecting aggressive behavioral responses was reported (Gröndal et al.).

### Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder [^116GKfUa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is prevalent (2% in the general population, 20% among psychiatry in-patients) and has a major impact on health facilities as those affected often present in crisis but then make poor use of further attempts to help them.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.

Search Strategy

We conducted a systematic search of 26 specialist and general bibliographic databases (October 2002) and searched relevant reference lists for further trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials comparing any psychoactive drugs with any other treatment for people with borderline personality disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI), and where possible the number need to help/harm (NNT/H). For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were synthesised using a weighted mean difference (WMD).

Main Results

We found ten small (total n = 554), short, randomised studies involving eight comparisons from which we could extract usable data. Studies comparing antidepressants with placebo were small (total n = 79, 2 RCTs) but for ratings of anger fluoxetine may offer some improvement for those on antidepressant therapy over placebo (n = 22, 1 RCT, RR anger not improved 0.30 CI 0.10 to 0.85, NNT 2 CI 2 to 9). The one small study investigating the important outcome of attempted suicide found no difference between mianserin and placebo (n = 38, 1 RCT, RR 0.82 CI 0.44 to 1.54). Haloperidol may be better than antidepressants for symptoms of hostility and psychotism. There were few differences between MAOIs and placebo except that people given MAOIs were less hostile (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD -9.19 CI -16.12 to -2.26). Although some ratings were statistically significant the comparison of MAOIs with antipsychotics did not show convincing differences. Antipsychotics may effect some mental state symptoms more effectively than placebo but results are difficult to interpret clinically and there is little evidence of advantage of one antipsychotic over another. Finally mood stabilisers such as divalporex may help mental state (n = 16, 1 RCT, RR no improvement in mental state 0.58 CI 0.36 to 0.94, NNT 3 CI 2 to 17) but data are far from conclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

Pharmacological treatment of people with BPD is not based on good evidence from trials and it is arguable that future use of medication should be from within randomised trials. Current trials suggest that the positive effect of antidepressants, in particular, could be considerable. Well designed, conducted and reported clinically meaningful trials are possible and needed with, perhaps, the question of antidepressant versus placebo being addressed first.

### The effects of intermittent escitalopram treatment on impulsivity and inattention in women with premenstrual irritability and anger [^112URbCK]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Women diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) report significant symptom relief when treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but few studies have addressed the possibility of capturing this effect in behavioral, laboratory-based tests. This study examined the effects of intermittent treatment with escitalopram (vs. placebo) on a behavioral measure of impulsivity and inattentiveness in women reporting high levels of premenstrual irritability and anger.

Methods

Participants (N = 27) rated cardinal PMDD mood symptoms over three menstrual cycles using Visual Analogue Scales. In Cycles 2 and 3, participants displaying cyclicity with respect to the irritability/anger item received escitalopram (20 mg) or placebo in a randomized, single-blind, crossover design. The participants completed the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT 3) in the luteal phase of the intervention cycles. Additionally, they filled out the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, once in the luteal phase and once in the follicular phase of the placebo cycle.

Results

In line with previous reports, escitalopram caused a significant reduction in self-rated irritability and anger in the luteal phase. When on escitalopram, the participants demonstrated a lower frequency of anticipatory responses and greater consistency in response speed in the CPT 3. With respect to self-reported impulsivity, participants reported higher levels of urgency and lower levels of sensation seeking in the luteal placebo phase versus the follicular phase.

Conclusions

The finding that escitalopram impacted the outcome of the CPT 3 test in women with premenstrual irritability highlights the possible role of impulsivity in this condition.

In Europe, escitalopram is currently approved for use in major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to approval of escitalopram in 2002 for the treatment of MDD in the USA, the FDA conducted an extensive review of its clinical efficacy and tolerability data and concluded that escitalopram did not have notable efficacy or tolerability advantages over other marketed antidepressants. However, there have been many studies conducted since that time. This qualitative review of the literature sought to examine the more recent clinical literature and assess whether there is evidence of a clinical advantage for escitalopram over either citalopram or other frequently used antidepressants.

### Comprehensive review and meta-analysis of psychological and pharmacological treatment for intermittent explosive disorder: insights from both case studies and randomized controlled trials [^115PDeoM]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is characterized by sudden, disproportionate outbursts of anger that can severely impact individuals' quality of life, causing difficulties in maintaining relationships, issues at work or school and potential legal troubles. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for IED, drawing insights from both case studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A total of 12 RCTs and 14 case studies were included in this comprehensive analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that psychological treatments, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), showed significant effectiveness in reducing aggression and achieving full remission compared to pharmacological treatments. However, the latter, notably fluoxetine, demonstrated notable efficacy in managing irritability and achieving treatment response. Subgroup analysis identified follow-up time and intervention type as significant moderators of treatment outcomes. The systematic review of case studies highlighted the successful application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and various off-label medications, including SSRIs and mood stabilizers, in managing IED symptoms. Despite these insights, the study emphasizes the need for more robust evidence-based treatment protocols and further research into the underlying mechanisms of IED to develop targeted treatments.

### The physician's unique role in preventing violence: a neglected opportunity? [^112FSbn9]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Episodes of explosive rage and violence comprise a symptom complex which can have a devastating effect on a person's life. In the community this behavior is seen as workplace violence, domestic abuse and road rage, while in the clinical setting, this behavior is rarely mentioned by patients, despite evidence that it can signify an important biological disorder that may afflict more than three percent of the population.

Discussion

Patients are often reluctant to seek help for episodic attacks of rage, especially attacks which are accompanied by physical violence. Although, in the past, clinicians have had few treatment options to offer, recent neuroscience advances have created new possibilities to understand and help patients with this neglected problem. No formal medical guidelines for treating violence exist; however, many patients can be helped by diagnosis, referral and treatment. Treatment can include pharmaceuticals and nutrients, as well as referral for anger management or behavioral therapy.

Summary

The astute clinician has an opportunity to positively impact an important problem through the diagnosis and treatment of patients with symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder.

The recommended dosage for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment is 10 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

The recommended dosage for escitalopram tablets in adults with a creatinine clearance less than 20 mL/minute has not been determined. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Participants

Participants were recruited using advertisements in social media and a local newspaper seeking women with premenstrual dysphoria. Interested individuals were directed to a phone screening with a research nurse. Those who reported having regular menstrual cycles and symptoms of irritability and anger during the luteal phase, without ongoing medical or hormonal treatment, were directed to a screening visit with a medical doctor.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: psychiatric illness within < 1 year (excl. PMDD), moderate or high risk of suicide, ongoing psychotropic medication (including anxiolytics and sleeping pills), ongoing structured psychotherapy, ongoing medical treatment with hormonal contraceptives, previous negative experience with SSRI treatment, ongoing breastfeeding, ongoing pregnancy or risk of becoming pregnant during the study period, and difficulty understanding the purpose of their participation in the study (e.g. due to language barriers).

Participants who did not meet any exclusion criteria were asked to complete daily symptom ratings for one full menstrual cycle, beginning on the first day of the menstrual period and ending on the first day of the subsequent menstrual period. For inclusion in the study, participants were required to (a) show at least a 50% increase in irritability/anger symptoms from the follicular phase (average of days 6–10) to the luteal phase (average of days −5 to −1) as measured by means of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 1–100 mm) and (b) have a mean rating of irritability/anger ≥ 30 mm over the last 5 days of the menstrual cycle. Participants who did not exhibit sufficient symptoms during the first menstrual cycle were asked to complete daily symptom ratings for an additional menstrual cycle. If they met the inclusion criteria during the subsequent cycle, they were included in the study. All included participants were requested to maintain daily ratings of symptom severity using the same VAS instrument throughout the remaining three menstrual cycles of the study period.

Assessment of premenstrual mood symptoms

Using an online questionnaire hosted on the Qualtrics online survey platform, participants reported on a daily basis to what extent they had experienced each of the cardinal mood symptoms of PMDD: irritability/anger, depressed mood, mood swings, and tension/anxiety using VAS scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (maximal). Participants gained access to the questionnaire through a personal QR code assigned to them during the screening visit. If a participant failed to submit their responses for more than 3 consecutive days, they received a text message reminder.
