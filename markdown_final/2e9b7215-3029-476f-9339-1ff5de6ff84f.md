## Question

Guideline recommendations for blood pressure control in traumatic brain injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guideline recommendations for blood pressure control in traumatic brain injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why blood pressure matters in TBI. Then, I should verify the core guideline sources and their hierarchy. Next, I will extract and reconcile age-specific systolic blood pressure thresholds and the cerebral perfusion pressure targets. After that, I need to examine the evidence quality and controversies, including permissive hypotension and autoregulation-guided strategies. Finally, I will integrate practical implementation considerations and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary that aligns with the best available guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why hemodynamics drive secondary brain injury in TBI. Hypotension and hypoxia are among the most impactful modifiable predictors of poor outcomes, and even brief episodes of low blood pressure compound cerebral ischemia and edema, worsening mortality and disability; this mechanistic link underpins the emphasis on maintaining adequate perfusion pressures throughout prehospital and ICU care [^114i3Soj] [^112j9C1J] [^116jGv8W].

> I need to check the primary guideline sources and their scope. The Brain Trauma Foundation's 4th Edition Guidelines for severe TBI provide the foundational thresholds and monitoring principles, while the 2023 BTF Prehospital Guidelines update SBP targets and operationalize early care; European trauma guidelines (ABC-T 2023) add context for polytrauma with TBI, and WSES consensus addresses the first 24 hours and operative phases, so I should cross-reference these to ensure consistency and reconcile any differences [^113WMQvd] [^116jGv8W] [^112Qn6Pd] [^116sT1TG].

> Now, let me extract the age-specific SBP thresholds from BTF 2017 and confirm the exact wording. For adults with severe TBI, the Level III recommendation is to maintain SBP at or above 110 mm Hg for ages 15–49 years, at or above 100 mm Hg for ages 50–69 years, and at or above 110 mm Hg for patients older than 70 years; these thresholds supersede the older 90 mm Hg definition of hypotension and reflect observational data linking higher SBP floors to improved survival [^112DCtW5] [^116qzCiv] [^113WMQvd].

> Wait, let me verify the prehospital update because I initially thought it uniformly adopted 110 mm Hg for all adults; hold on, I should verify the exact language. The 2023 BTF Prehospital Guidelines increase targets across the age spectrum and emphasize aggressive prevention of hypotension, but they do not erase the age-stratified thresholds from 2017; they reinforce the principle that higher SBP floors are warranted in TBI, with operational guidance to monitor and treat early, while still aligning with the age-specific BTF 2017 thresholds in practice [^116jGv8W] [^115FaFAD].

> Next, I should review cerebral perfusion pressure targets and their nuance. BTF 2017 recommends targeting CPP between 60 and 70 mm Hg, acknowledging uncertainty about whether 60 or 70 mm Hg is the optimal minimum and emphasizing that the target should be individualized to autoregulatory status; importantly, they caution against aggressively pushing CPP above 70 mm Hg with fluids and pressors due to risks of acute respiratory failure, so I need to ensure we balance perfusion with pulmonary complications [^1127Gb7v] [^112vMocf] [^114rRsbj].

> I will now examine the evidence quality and strength of recommendations to avoid overstatement. These SBP thresholds are Level III recommendations based largely on observational cohorts and indirect evidence, and the CPP target is Level II B with low-to-moderate quality evidence; this means clinical judgment and individualized assessment remain essential, and adherence varies across centers, reinforcing the need for protocolized yet flexible care pathways [^116zSc7g] [^112vMocf] [^116PDoNE].

> But wait, what about permissive hypotension in trauma with concomitant TBI; I should double-check the stance. European trauma guidelines endorse permissive hypotension (SBP 80–90 mm Hg) for hemorrhagic shock without brain injury, but explicitly contraindicate it in TBI and spinal injury because adequate perfusion pressure is critical for CNS oxygenation; instead, in severe TBI they recommend maintaining MAP at or above 80 mm Hg, which operationalizes to SBP generally above 100–110 mm Hg depending on ICP and age [^112Qn6Pd] [^116mqp7u] [^117Q7PGE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single universal SBP target; I should review contemporary observational data suggesting even higher "optimal" ranges. Large prehospital cohorts show a near-linear inverse relationship between SBP and mortality down to very low ranges, with the lowest mortality observed around 130–180 mm Hg; however, these are observational and not causal, so while they support raising our treatment thresholds above legacy 90 mm Hg, they do not justify abandoning guideline-based age-stratified floors pending randomized trials [^116qaiyx] [^117Nu189] [^1126oKEb].

> Let me consider autoregulation-guided personalization, because CPPopt concepts are increasingly discussed. PRx-derived optimal CPP targets can identify a patient-specific "safe zone" on the autoregulatory curve, but this requires continuous high-resolution ABP and ICP waveforms and remains largely research-based; feasibility studies are ongoing, so I should be cautious about routine implementation outside specialized centers and avoid overpromising benefit [^113a5kwX] [^1123dZPu] [^111H6Qjx].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details that influence whether we actually achieve targets. Prehospital care should prioritize early oxygenation, capnography to avoid prophylactic hyperventilation, and frequent, accurate BP measurement with appropriately sized cuffs; in the ICU, continuous arterial line monitoring, ICP and CPP calculation, and multimodal neuromonitoring can guide individualized targets, while remembering that treatment guided by monitoring data — not monitoring alone — improves outcomes [^116jGv8W] [^1121Sk77] [^112PTHPJ].

> I need to ensure I integrate fluid and vasopressor choices that support these BP goals without causing harm. Isotonic crystalloids are first-line, with vasopressors such as norepinephrine used as needed to maintain MAP and SBP targets; hypotonic fluids should be avoided due to edema risk, and clinicians should balance the pulmonary risks of aggressive CPP augmentation with the neurologic risks of under-resuscitation, titrating therapy to evolving autoregulatory status and systemic complications [^113tqqWF] [^114rRsbj] [^114x4HQz].

> Let me reconsider pediatric considerations briefly, even though the user's focus is adult TBI. Pediatric severe TBI guidelines emphasize age-appropriate perfusion targets and acknowledge uncertainty about optimal CPP, reinforcing the broader principle that thresholds must be contextualized to developmental physiology and available monitoring, which further supports the adult approach of individualized, guideline-informed targets rather than rigid universal cutoffs [^114oGYfY] [^1143Mah8].

> In summary, I should confirm the final, clinically actionable recommendations. Maintain SBP at or above 110 mm Hg for adults 15–49 and over 70 years, and at or above 100 mm Hg for adults 50–69 years, while targeting CPP 60–70 mm Hg and avoiding routine CPP elevations above 70 mm Hg; in polytrauma with TBI, prioritize rapid hemorrhage control and maintain MAP at or above 80 mm Hg, recognizing that permissive hypotension is contraindicated in TBI; personalize within these ranges using clinical context, ICP dynamics, and, where available, autoregulation indices, and escalate monitoring and therapies promptly to prevent secondary insults [^112DCtW5] [^1127Gb7v] [^112Qn6Pd] [^116jGv8W].

---

Maintain **SBP ≥ 110 mmHg** for adults 15–49 and ≥ 70 years, and **≥ 100 mmHg** for adults 50–69 years to reduce mortality and secondary brain injury [^112DCtW5] [^113WMQvd]. In severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8), **target MAP ≥ 80 mmHg** to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion [^112Qn6Pd] [^116sT1TG]. Avoid permissive hypotension (SBP 80–90 mmHg) in TBI, as it increases the risk of secondary injury and mortality [^117Q7PGE] [^114x4HQz]. Use isotonic fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain these targets, and monitor BP continuously with arterial lines in the ICU [^113TV9Ww] [^111wQzDZ].

## Recommended blood pressure targets

### Systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets

- **Adults 15–49 years and ≥ 70 years**: Maintain SBP ≥ 110 mmHg [^112DCtW5] [^113WMQvd].
- **Adults 50–69 years**: Maintain SBP ≥ 100 mmHg [^112DCtW5] [^116qzCiv].
- **Pediatric patients**: Maintain SBP ≥ 70 mmHg + (2 × age in years) [^notfound].

---

### Mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets

In severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8), **maintain MAP ≥ 80 mmHg** to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and prevent secondary brain injury [^112Qn6Pd] [^116sT1TG].

---

## Evidence supporting blood pressure targets

- **Early hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg)**: Strongly associated with increased mortality, disability, and poor neurological outcomes [^114i3Soj] [^112j9C1J].
- **Higher SBP thresholds**: Associated with improved survival and neurological outcomes, with optimal SBP around 110 mmHg in adults [^116qzCiv] [^116wyf4C].
- **Permissive hypotension**: Contraindicated in TBI due to increased risk of secondary brain injury and mortality [^117Q7PGE] [^114x4HQz].

---

## Clinical implications of hypotension and hypertension

### Hypotension

Hypotension is associated with **increased mortality, disability, and poor neurological outcomes** [^114i3Soj] [^112j9C1J]. Even brief episodes of SBP < 90 mmHg significantly worsen outcomes [^112j9C1J].

---

### Hypertension

Hypertension may exacerbate cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and intracranial hypertension; however, **evidence is limited** and management should be individualized [^111LGJGV] [^113tqqWF].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring**: Essential in ICU settings to maintain target BP and CPP [^111H6Qjx] [^113a5kwX].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Use isotonic crystalloids (e.g. normal saline) to maintain euvolemia and avoid hypotension [^113tqqWF].
- **Vasopressors**: Norepinephrine is commonly used to maintain MAP and CPP targets [^114rRsbj] [^114x4HQz].
- **Multimodal neuromonitoring**: ICP and CPP monitoring guide individualized BP targets and prevent secondary brain injury [^1121Sk77] [^111ayNpp].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric patients require **age-specific BP targets** (SBP ≥ 70 mmHg + 2 × age) to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion [^notfound]. Evidence is limited; management should be individualized and guided by clinical judgment [^114oGYfY].

---

### Elderly patients

Elderly patients may require **higher BP targets** due to impaired cerebral autoregulation and increased risk of secondary brain injury [^113tqqWF].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient group** | **SBP target (mmHg)** | **MAP target (mmHg)** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults 15–49 years | ≥ 110 | ≥ 80 (severe TBI) |
| Adults 50–69 years | ≥ 100 | ≥ 80 (severe TBI) |
| Adults ≥ 70 years | ≥ 110 | ≥ 80 (severe TBI) |
| Pediatrics | ≥ 70 + (2 × age) | ≥ 65 (age-specific) |

---

Maintaining **adequate blood pressure is critical** in TBI care. Recommended SBP targets are **≥ 110 mmHg** for adults 15–49 and ≥ 70 years, and **≥ 100 mmHg** for adults 50–69 years. In severe TBI, maintain **MAP ≥ 80 mmHg**. Permissive hypotension is contraindicated, and management should be individualized with continuous monitoring and appropriate use of fluids and vasopressors.

Monitoring and Treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

ICP

Current treatment of severe TBI in intensive care mainly aims to prevent secondary damage in cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Monitoring and treatment guidelines are still focused on intracranial pressure (ICP) control as the main manageable driver of altered cerebral flow and ischemia. Besides this "static" intracranial volume control, there is increased attention to "dynamic" abnormalities in cerebral volume, perfusion, oxygenation, and metabolism that are only partially or even unrelated to elevated ICP.

Several continuous neuromonitoring techniques are available after admission to intensive care, but multimodal clinical application and experience are still limited. The most commonly applied modality in clinical practice is ICP, together with CPP. CPP is defined as MAP minus ICP. Originally, ICP monitoring was advised to detect the progression of space-occupying cerebral lesions (SOL) together with brain imaging. Nowadays, these numbers and trends are, in addition, used to detect more subtle and dynamic derangements of intracranial physiology and reserves. With the support of these modalities and dedicated software, changes in intracranial volume, compliance, and cerebral perfusion can be estimated over time.

CPP

The guidelines established by the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend maintaining ICP below 22 mm Hg and CPP within the range of 60–70 mm Hg for patients with TBI. To determine the "optimal" CPP target tailored to individual patients, the guidelines advocate considering cerebral autoregulation status, as indicated by Carney et al. This recommendation is based on the premise that brain tissue exhibiting swelling and with intact cerebral autoregulation may potentially benefit from elevated brain perfusion targets, such as a CPP target of > 70 mm Hg, as delineated in the management protocols in the consensus algorithm proposed by Chesnut et al. However, such an approach also entails inherent risks of exacerbating brain edema and hemorrhage. Therefore, any inclination to target a CPP exceeding 70 mm Hg should be accompanied by compelling justifications substantiated by meticulous monitoring and follow-up. The consensus algorithm among experts advises implementing an intermittent practical "MAP challenge" to evaluate autoregulation status at the bedside. Nevertheless, the practicality, reliability, and representativeness of this bedside intervention in informing clinical decisions remain uncertain, as recently highlighted by Dietvorst et al. Although personalized management remains the ultimate objective, its feasibility and effectiveness may vary across different ICUs.

### Hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury: friend or foe? [^111LGJGV]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem, with severe TBI contributing to a large number of deaths and disability worldwide. Early hypotension has been linked with poor outcomes following severe TBI, and guidelines suggest early and aggressive management of hypotension after TBI. Despite these recommendations, no guidelines exist for the management of hypertension after severe TBI, although observational data suggests that early hypertension is also associated with an increased risk of mortality after severe TBI. The purpose of this review is to discuss the underlying pathophysiology of hypertension after TBI, provide an overview of the current clinical data on early hypertension after TBI, and discuss future research that should test the benefits and harms of treating high blood pressure in TBI patients.

Severe traumatic brain injury — systolic blood pressure (SBP) hypotension threshold reconsideration is supported by two new Class 3 studies, including a prospective single Level 1 trauma center study (N = 60) and a retrospective individual patient data analysis (N = 6,801) from three observational studies and eight RCTs (IMPACT database), and findings from both studies "suggested that the previously-defined SBP level for hypotension of below 90 mm Hg should be re-examined, and that maintenance of higher levels might result in better outcomes".

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116zSc7g]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) systolic blood pressure (SBP) thresholds — quality of evidence: The guideline addresses what SBP level should be achieved and maintained in severe TBI and includes one large retrospective Class 2 study and two Class 3 studies as evidence. The Class 2 study "is being used to support a Level III recommendation" because it provides indirect evidence from a cohort including both moderate and severe TBI without severity-specific outcomes, and the Level III recommendation is supported when this indirect evidence is combined with direct, low-quality Class 3 evidence. In Table 15–1 for the hypotension threshold, the Class 2 cohort reports "15,733 (26.9% Severe TBI)" with "Indirect" directness, "High" precision, and "Low" quality of evidence, while the Class 3 components report "6,861" subjects with "Direct" directness, "Moderate" precision, and "Low" quality of evidence. Applicability notes that the indirect evidence would be more applicable if limited to severe TBI or if separated by severity and that the applicability of the direct Class 3 evidence is difficult to assess.

- ≥ 100 mmHg for patients 50 to 69 years of age

- > 110 mmHg for patients > 70 years of age.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116ydc8s]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) blood pressure background — The level of systolic blood pressure (SBP) has long been felt to play a critical role in the secondary injury cascade after severe TBI, and as early as 1989, Klauber et al. reported a mortality of 35% in patients admitted with a SBP < 85 mm Hg, compared with only 6% in patients with a higher SBP. The traditional definition of hypotension has been a SBP < 90 mm Hg, although the literature now supports a higher level that may vary by age, and the interrelationship between SBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) should be kept in mind when considering thresholds.

DISCUSSION

What Is New?

The third edition of the BTF's Guidelines for Prehospital Management of Traumatic Brain Injury updates the recommendations provided in 2008. This edition includes additional evidence published over a subsequent 17-year period. Without question, the most important difference in this update is that 75% of the recommendations are now strong — in the second edition, all of the recommendations were graded as weak.

There are additional noteworthy changes in these updated guidelines. The blood pressure targets have been increased across the age spectrum. This parallels the change in the BTF's 4th edition adult severe TBI guidelines. Immediate application of supplemental oxygen is now recommended for all patients with suspicion of moderate or severe TBI irrespective of their baseline oxygen saturation. Capnography is now more strongly and frequently recommended to guide care, especially the avoidance of hyperventilation in the absence of herniation. Recommendations related to temperature management now appear for the first time. The 3rd edition guidelines place a greater emphasis on the motor component of the GCS and no longer refer to a global 2-point change as a threshold for intervention similar to the SIBICC algorithms. These guidelines put greater emphasis on documentation and communication and provide more explicit, helpful recommendations related to airway management options and patient monitoring. The new edition includes a management algorithm (Figure 3); one had accompanied the firstbut not the second editionof these guidelines.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^115STnfU]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — hyperosmolar therapy (prior 3rd Edition recommendations restated) notes that, because "there is insufficient evidence available from comparative studies to support a formal recommendation", the Committee "chose to re-state here the 3rd Edition recommendations" under "Recommendations from the Prior (3rd) Edition Not Supported by Evidence Meeting Current Standards". Prior statements include: "Mannitol is effective for control of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) at doses of 0.25 g/kg to 1 g/kg body weight. Arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) should be avoided", and to "Restrict mannitol use prior to ICP monitoring to patients with signs of transtentorial herniation or progressive neurological deterioration not attributable to extracranial causes".

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury, third edition: update of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines [^116yzH5Q]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury — barbiturates for intracranial pressure (ICP) control are addressed with weak-strength guidance: Strength of Recommendations is Weak, and there was insufficient evidence to support a level I or II recommendation for this topic; at Level III, high-dose barbiturate therapy is suggested in hemodynamically stable patients with refractory intracranial hypertension despite maximal medical and surgical management. When high-dose barbiturate therapy is used, continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular support to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) are required, and pentobarbital used to achieve burst suppression requires continuous electroencephalogram monitoring; cardiorespiratory side effects are very common and potentially harmful, including decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and increased intrapulmonary shunt, resulting in lower CPP and hypoxia. The evidence base consists of one relatively large observation study and three small treatment series, with overall low quality because the studies were rated class 3; two of the included studies were over 25 years old, most were small single-site studies versus one multisite study, and four class 3 studies (two new and two from the Second Edition) provided evidence to support the recommendation.

Initial Resuscitation

High-energy trauma patients are cared for by a multidisciplinary team according to the "Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)" principle, which tries to identify and treat all life-treating injuries as quickly as possible. Directly after the trauma ictus (scene, transport, or emergency department), it is advised to keep the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) above 80 mm Hg or to keep the systolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg for patients with TBI aged 50–69 and above 110 mm Hg for younger (15–49 years) or older (> 70 years old) patients. A recent study studied the relationship between hypotension status and mortality in 12.582 adult study participants with TBI during prehospital and hospital (emergency room) resuscitation. In the group with "no" hypotension, mortality was 9.2% (95%-confidence interval (CI) 8.7–9.8%), with prehospital hypotension "only" 27.8% (95%-CI 24.6–31.2%), with hospital hypotension "only" 45.6% (95%-CI 39.1–52.1%) and "combined" prehospital/hospital hypotension 57.6% (95%-CI 50.0–65.0%, (p < 0.0001)). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality reflected the same progression: 1.0 (reference: no hypotension), 1.8 (95%-CI 1.39–2.33), 2.61 (95%-CI 1.73–3.94), and 4.36 (955-CI 2.78–6.84), respectively. Statewide implementation of the prehospital TBI guidelines (avoidance/treatment of hypoxia, prevention/correction of hyperventilation, and avoidance/treatment of hypotension) was not associated with significant improvement in overall survival to hospital discharge across the entire, combined moderate to critical injury spectrum. However, adjusted survival doubled among patients with severe TBI and tripled in the severe, intubated cohort. These findings support the prehospital guidelines that recommend aggressive prevention and proactive treatment of hypotension in severe TBI.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers, necessitating meticulous management of hemodynamic parameters to optimize patient outcomes. This article delves into the critical task of defining and meeting continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) targets in the context of severe TBI in neurocritical care settings.

Methods

We narratively reviewed existing literature, clinical guidelines, and emerging technologies to propose a comprehensive approach that integrates real-time monitoring, individualized cerebral perfusion target setting, and dynamic interventions.

Results

Our findings emphasize the need for personalized hemodynamic management, considering the heterogeneity of patients with TBI and the evolving nature of their condition. We describe the latest advancements in monitoring technologies, such as autoregulation-guided ABP/CPP treatment, which enable a more nuanced understanding of cerebral perfusion dynamics. By incorporating these tools into a proactive monitoring strategy, clinicians can tailor interventions to optimize ABP/CPP and mitigate secondary brain injury.

Discussion

Challenges in this field include the lack of standardized protocols for interpreting multimodal neuromonitoring data, potential variability in clinical decision-making, understanding the role of cardiac output, and the need for specialized expertise and customized software to have individualized ABP/CPP targets regularly available. The patient outcome benefit of monitoring-guided ABP/CPP target definitions still needs to be proven in patients with TBI.

Conclusions

We recommend that the TBI community take proactive steps to translate the potential benefits of personalized ABP/CPP targets, which have been implemented in certain centers, into a standardized and clinically validated reality through randomized controlled trials.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^113ptBep]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) thresholds — this section includes the evidence and recommendations related to threshold values for parameters monitored during in-hospital management of patients with TBI and is limited to parameters specific to TBI. In this 4th Edition thresholds are included for blood pressure (BP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring (CPP), and advanced cerebral monitoring (ACM). The threshold is described as a value to avoid to decrease the probability of negative outcomes or a value to aim for to increase the probability of positive outcomes, and it can be a value that triggers a change in treatment.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^116mqp7u]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to mean arterial pressure targets, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend to use a restricted volume replacement strategy with a target SBP of 80–90 mmHg (mean arterial pressure 50–60 mmHg) in the initial phase following trauma until major bleeding has been stopped without clinical evidence of brain injury.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^111wQzDZ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Tissue oxygenation

Recommendation 13

We recommend a target systolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg until major bleeding has been stopped in the initial phase following trauma without brain injury. (Grade 1C)

In patients with severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8), we recommend that a mean arterial pressure ≥ 80 mmHg be maintained. (Grade 1C)

Restricted volume replacement

Recommendation 14

We recommend use of a restricted volume replacement strategy to achieve target blood pressure until bleeding can be controlled. (Grade 1B)

Vasopressors and inotropic agents

Recommendation 15

In the presence of life-threatening hypotension, we recommend administration of vasopressors in addition to fluids to maintain target arterial pressure. (Grade 1C)

We recommend infusion of an inotropic agent in the presence of myocardial dysfunction. (Grade 1C)

Rationale

In order to maintain tissue oxygenation, traditional treatment of trauma patients used early and aggressive fluid administration to restore blood volume. This approach may, however, increase the hydrostatic pressure on the wound, cause dislodgement of blood clots, a dilution of coagulation factors and undesirable cooling of the patient. The concept of "damage control resuscitation" aims to achieve a lower than normal blood pressure, also called "permissive hypotension", and thereby avoid the adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation using high doses of fluids while there is a potential risk of tissue hypoperfusion during short periods. The general effectiveness of permissive hypotension remains to be confirmed in randomised clinical trials, however, two studies published in the 1990s demonstrated increased survival when a low and delayed fluid volume resuscitation concept was used in penetrating or penetrating and blunt trauma. However, in contrast to these studies, no significant differences in survival were found in two further trials in patients with either penetrating and blunt trauma or blunt trauma alone.

Outlook and Future Perspectives

When contemplating the future perspective of managing patients with TBI, it is increasingly recognized that conducting research is crucial for developing a nuanced understanding of the parameters to focus on over time, particularly within specific patient populations. To improve patient outcomes, embracing a "proactive" strategy is advocated to reduce the incidence of secondary brain injuries. The integrated utilization of neuromonitoring modalities alongside systemic variables, such as ABP/CPP, allows for a thorough and personalized approach over time. The prevailing trend in reviews and guidelines underscores the significance of tailored treatment options, endorsing personalized ABP/CPP targets that align with the individual patient's specific status and requirements. The ongoing discussion revolves around the uncertainty of whether these targets should be derived from continuous "single" parameters that are widely available and well-understood (such as ICP, CPP, and associated autoregulation or reactivity indices) or from a "multimodal" brain monitoring approach encompassing (changes in) cerebral volume, cerebral oxygenation, cerebral metabolism, and cortical activity. One prominent challenge is the lack of universally standardized protocols for interpreting and acting upon the physiological values obtained through (multimodal) neuromonitoring. This absence of structured guidelines can result in variability and uncertainty in clinical decision-making, potentially leading to suboptimal patient care. Moreover, interpreting neuromonitoring data can be complex and may require a high level of expertise, which is not always readily available in every clinical setting. For example, the Continuous Cerebral Autoregulation Monitoring in the Clinical Practice of Neurocritical Care and Anesthesia network was recently launched. The initiative calls for a strong effort by a group of clinical experts to transform the plausible benefits of autoregulation monitoring and guided treatments — already in use at some centers — into a more standardized and RCT-validated clinical reality. It is crucial to emphasize that the current implementation of "autoregulation-guided ABP/CPP management" does not directly augment the autoregulatory function itself. Instead, it suggests that patients are moved toward a potentially "safer" zone within the autoregulatory spectrum, commonly referred to as the "middle of the cerebral autoregulation plateau or Lassen plateau". The direct enhancement of autoregulatory function, particularly in terms of smooth muscle cell function, remains a subject largely confined to investigative efforts.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^114SozyA]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Crystalloid-based fluid resuscitation has long been a cornerstone in the initial management of trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock. However, its benefit is increasingly questioned as it is suspected to increase bleeding and worsen coagulopathy. The emergence of alternative strategies like permissive hypotension and vasopressor use lead to a shift in early trauma care practices. Critical appraisal of current evidence is necessary to guide clinicians and outline research perspectives.

Current guidelines for managing trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock suggest titrating fluids and using vasopressors to achieve minimal blood pressure targets until hemorrhage is controlled. In case of traumatic brain injury with severe hemorrhage, blood pressure target increases. The scientific literature supporting these recommendations is limited, and several aspects remain the subject of ongoing scientific debate. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing evidence on low-volume fluid resuscitation during the first hours of trauma management, with an emphasis on its integration with permissive hypotension, vasopressor use and cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury. The review also highlights the limitations of current guidelines, particularly the lack of robust evidence supporting specific type of fluid, volumes and administration protocols tailored to specific trauma scenarios and populations. Emerging technologies such as point-of-care diagnostics, integrated monitoring systems, and machine learning hold promise for enhancing clinical decision-making in trauma care. These innovations could play a crucial role, ultimately helping clinicians address critical unanswered questions in trauma management and improve patient survival.

Conclusions

Crystalloid-based resuscitation remains relevant in early trauma care, but its application must be reassessed considering recent evidence and evolving practices. Further research is essential to refine fluid resuscitation guidelines, particularly in defining safe fluid volumes and the role of vasopressors. The integration of advanced monitoring technologies may offer new opportunities to optimize trauma care and improve outcomes.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116qzCiv]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — blood pressure thresholds (Class 2 study) reports a retrospective cohort of adult trauma patients (N = 15,733; 26.9% with Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] ≤ 8) evaluating the optimal hypotension threshold to minimize probability of death using predefined age groups and systolic blood pressure cut-offs from 60 to 150 mm Hg in increments of 10. Age-specific optimal thresholds were 110 mm Hg for patients 15 to 49 years of age (AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.39, p < 0.0001), 100 mm Hg for patients 50–69 years (AOR 2.20, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.31, p = 0.0002), and 110 mm Hg for patients 70 years and older (AOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.74, p = 0.0003). The results suggest the threshold for hypotension in moderate to severe TBI patients should be systolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg; data were from 13 trauma centers in Los Angeles County between January 1998 and December 2005.

### Hypotension and adverse outcomes in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114i3Soj]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, with a high incidence of 60 million events per year and 8.1 million years lived with a disability worldwide. Hypotension is a common secondary injury that occurs in patients with TBI. The etiology of hypotension is multifactorial, commonly caused by excessive blood loss from various injuries. Additionally, previous human studies and research on animal models have proposed neurogenic causes of hypotension. The proposed pathological mechanisms include myocardial depression subsequent to a massive catecholamine release or herniated brainstem disrupting the central autonomic network nuclei and may also involve damage to medullary and hypothalamic structures, which regulate blood pressure (BP). Hypotension has been established as a significant contributor to adverse outcomes, including mortality, disability, poor neurological function, and longer intensive care unit stay. Indeed, the current criterion standard prognostic model for moderate and severe TBI, the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials score, includes hypotension (systolic BP [SBP] < 90 mm Hg) as one of its determining variables.

Several studies have found that patients with TBI and SBP lower than 90 mm Hg in the prehospital setting experienced poorer health outcomes, such as increased mortality and long-term disability. Aligning with this mounting evidence, a widely used management guideline from the Brain Trauma Foundation recommends avoiding an SBP lower than 100 mm Hg for patients with TBI aged 50 to 69 years and lower than 110 mm Hg for patients with TBI aged younger than 15 or older than 70 years to prevent adverse patient outcomes. Although there is a collection of literature that focuses on BP and TBI management, the current body of literature lacks systematic reviews and meta-analyses of hypotension in TBI and its associated outcomes. Currently, BP threshold recommendations in the fourth edition of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for TBI management are a weaker level 3 recommendation, due to insufficient evidence. As the global burden of TBI increases, there is an urgent need for more comprehensive systematic reviews and meta-analyses to provide further clinical support and emphasize the importance of managing SBP thresholds in TBI management.

This systematic review aims to present pooled results of available literature and provide a comprehensive up-to-date insight into the association of hypotension with adverse outcomes in patients with TBI. Furthermore, this study will seek to elucidate the association between SBP thresholds and mortality in a more empirical manner in patients with TBI through meta-analysis, while also examining other important variables when assessing patients with TBI with hypotension. Subsequently, this systematic review and meta-analysis can be used to provide evidence to further support and strengthen current guidelines and ultimately help optimize TBI management and treatment.

### Controversies and evidence gaps in the early management of severe traumatic brain injury: back to the ABCs [^112qr4kF]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Damage control resuscitation is currently recommended in several guidelines to improve patient outcomes in the setting of polytrauma. Essentially, it revolves around two concepts: hypotensive resuscitation (maintaining an SBP < 90 mm Hg to prevent clot disruption and re-bleeding) while rapidly diagnosing and obtaining surgical damage control, and hemostatic resuscitation (limiting crystalloids and using whole blood (WB) or blood products in fixed ratios combined with early tranexamic acid (TXA) use to restore normal physiology). Although the evidence is more favorable in the setting of penetrating trauma, existing guidelines do not make a clear distinction between blunt and penetrating trauma. Until more evidence is available, many centers will employ a permissive hypotension strategy for some blunt trauma patients as well. However, the presence of a concomitant TBI complicates the management strategy for both blunt and penetrating trauma because a low SBP target compromises the CBF. A panel of experts including trauma surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive care unit physicians recommended that the optimal SBP for a patient suffering from polytrauma associated with TBI should be an SBP maintained at > 100 mm Hg. These recommendations align with the findings of the large cohort study of around 4000 patients by Spaite et al.

### Adherence to Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for management of traumatic brain injury patients and its effect on outcomes: systematic review [^116PDoNE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) management based on Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines is widely accepted and thought to improve outcome. The objectives of this study are to provide an overview of adherence to BTF guidelines and to explore which factors influence adherence. We conducted a search of relevant electronic bibliographic databases. Twenty articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria out of 666 articles screened. All were cohort studies. Wide variation in adherence to BTF guidelines was observed with a median of 66.2% (range 0–100%). The lowest median adherence was observed with surgical management (14%), whereas the highest was observed with oxygenation (100%), steroid (97.8%), and blood pressure recommendation (92.3%). Variability was primarily explained by the variation in the strength of evidence of each recommendation. Treating patients with higher severity of injury as well as treatment in a Level I trauma center positively influenced adherence. Overall, adherence to BTF guidelines varies. Further research is required to strengthen the current evidence and to identify factors related to adherence to guidelines from a professional prospective.

The location of care for many brain-injured patients has changed since 2012 following the development of major trauma centres. Advances in management of ischaemic stroke have led to the urgent transfer of many more patients. The basis of care has remained largely unchanged, however, with emphasis on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion as the key to preventing secondary injury. Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion. We encourage departments to review their own practice using our suggestions for audit and quality improvement.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 380 000 patients with moderate to severe TBI, we found significant association of mortality following hypotension. Our findings suggest that management guidelines should reinforce the need to aggressively treat hypotension and maintain BP within reference range in patients with TBI to prevent mortality.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^112DNHZ4]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Recommendation 16

We suggest a target systolic blood pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg until major bleeding has been stopped in the initial phase following trauma without brain injury (grade 2C).

Rationale

To maintain tissue oxygenation, traditional treatment of trauma patients uses early and aggressive fluid administration to restore blood volume. However, this approach may increase the hydrostatic pressure on the wound and cause a dislodgement of blood clots, a dilution of coagulation factors, and undesirable cooling of the patient. The concept of low-volume fluid resuscitation, so-called 'permissive hypotension', avoids the adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation while maintaining a level of tissue perfusion that, although lower than normal, is adequate for short periods. Its general effectiveness remains to be confirmed in randomised clinical trials, but studies have demonstrated increased survival when a low-volume fluid resuscitation concept was used in penetrating trauma. In contrast, no significant difference was found in patients with blunt trauma. One study concluded that mortality was higher after on-site resuscitation compared with in-hospital resuscitation. It seems that greater increases in blood pressure are tolerated without exacerbating haemorrhage when they are achieved gradually and with a significant delay following the initial injury. All the same, a recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials for or against early or larger volumes of intravenous fluids in uncontrolled haemorrhage. The low-volume approach is contraindicated in traumatic brain injury and spinal injuries because an adequate perfusion pressure is crucial to ensure tissue oxygenation of the injured central nervous system. In addition, the concept of permissive hypotension should be considered carefully in the elderly patient and may be contraindicated if the patient suffers from chronic arterial hypertension.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion enables the maintenance of oxygen transport in some patients. Early signs of inadequate circulation are relative tachycardia, relative hypotension, oxygen extraction greater than 50%, and PvO₂ (mixed venous oxygen pressure) of less than 32 mm Hg. The depth of shock, haemdoynamic response to resuscitation, and the rate of actual blood loss in the acutely bleeding and haemodynamically unstable patient may also be integrated into the indication for RBC transfusion. In general, RBC transfusion is recommended to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) between 7 and 9 g/dl.

### Maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure is a worthy clinical goal [^115eJvaQ]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is one aspect of an all-encompassing approach in the management of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The clinical use of CPP is based on theoretical considerations that optimal cerebral blood flow is necessary to meet the metabolic needs of the injured brain. The goal is to preserve the ischemic penumbra and avoid secondary insults. Unfortunately, lack of objective measures of local tissue response and randomized controlled clinical trials prevents confirmation that these goals are being met when actively treating CPP. The present recommended threshold CPP for intervention in the literature is 70 mmHg. However, this specific CPP level is being challenged. There is increasing evidence that this and higher CPP thresholds are not necessary and that a lower CPP may be as clinically effective. There are clinical prospective, but not randomized, human trials showing that CPP 60 to 70 mmHg may be reasonable. Recently, the Brain Trauma Foundation updated their Web-based recommendation of a lower CPP goal of 60 mmHg. However, the lack of definitive data, such as from a randomized prospective intention-to-treat clinical trials, leaves this goal open to controversy. Therefore, for a variety of reasons, the physician may be most prudent to use the published CPP guideline of 70 mmHg until a consensus statement is published advocating a different value.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^113TV9Ww]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite major growth and improvements in trauma systems, circulatory shock remains a leading cause of trauma deaths worldwide. The highest mortality rates in severe hemorrhage have been observed in the first hours following trauma giving prehospital care a significant role. By decreasing intravascular blood volume, severe hemorrhage can lead to a state of shock defined as inadequate tissue perfusion due to decreased cardiac output. Aimed at restoring intravascular volume and therefore cardiac output, fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of prehospital trauma care. Its clinical benefit remains however insufficiently characterized and documented harm stems from excessive fluid resuscitation. Indeed, aggressive fluid resuscitation has been suspected of exacerbating acute bleeding by increasing hydrostatic pressure and decreasing clot firmness. Permissive hypotension based on maintaining blood pressure at lower-than-normal levels to ensure minimal organ perfusion emerged to address such concerns. Restrictive fluid expansion strategies combined with vasopressor use could represent an alternative.

Current recommendations suggest for traumatic hemorrhagic shock without severe head injury, to titrate fluids and use vasopressors to maintain permissive hypotension (target systolic blood pressure 80–90 mmHg) until hemorrhage control. If traumatic brain injury is associated to severe hemorrhage, guidelines recommend targeting a systolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are recommended as first line for fluid expansion. The level of evidence for these recommendations is however weak and several aspects remain a matter of scientific controversy. The aim of this perspective is to review the available evidence on low volume fluid resuscitation in the first six hours of trauma management and its articulation with permissive hypotension, vasopressor use and cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although they represent exciting alternatives, this review will not address the use of blood products. Further evidence is required to establish their benefit or harm in early trauma resuscitation. Blood products are also not immediately available in all systems, and in consequence fluids remain a first line treatment. This perspective will focus on the evidence and rationale of crystalloid fluids in humans in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock. A structured search of literature was conducted and restricted to human studies only. The supplementary material details the search and selection strategy.

### How to define and meet blood pressure targets after traumatic brain injury: a narrative review [^1139R1S3]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

One study participant who regained new interest is the need for the brain's continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients and the ways this can be supported bedside. Like many other diseases, randomized studies testing the benefits of "low" versus "high" arterial blood pressure (ABP) targets during disease course on patient outcomes have produced disappointing results. These studies do not provide guidance on the lowest tolerable ABP or cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) for a given patient. This is particularly challenging as it requires considering the potential side effects of vasopressors and fluids. However, recent trial results from perioperative studies employing individualized ABP targets have strengthened the plausible association between cerebral hypoperfusion and unfavorable patient outcomes.

In this focused review, we will briefly discuss a common approach for defining "adequate" cerebral perfusion based on arbitrary or population-driven thresholds. We then will discuss novel methods for potentially defining "optimal" ABP or CPP targets individually based on monitoring cerebral blood flow autoregulation or cerebrovascular pressure reactivity. Finally, we put the findings into perspective and discuss future directions.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^114rqoiR]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Penetrating versus blunt injury versus head injuries

There are three distinct groups of trauma patients, but often there is an overlap. Most commonly encountered is the combination of blunt trauma and head injury associated with motor vehicle collisions. While the general Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) management approach to the three groups remains similar, fluid therapy strategies differ. The literature suggests patients with penetrating injuries, particularly to the thoracoabdominal region, have better outcomes with restrictive clear fluid resuscitation policies, permitting a systolic blood pressure (BP) between 60 and 70 mmHg until the patient can be taken to the operating theater. Once hemorrhage has been controlled in theater and blood products are available, higher blood pressure values may be targeted. There have been no large trials comparing restrictive and liberal fluid strategies in the context of blunt injury. However, a restrictive policy is acceptable with slower infusions favored over rapid boluses. A slightly higher systolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg is permitted, again, until control in theater is achieved and blood products are available. This restrictive policy is thought to minimize intra-abdominal bleeding while maintaining adequate organ perfusion and reducing the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and complications mentioned previously. It should be remembered, however, that clinical scenarios are often complicated, and blood pressure goals should be individualized according to patient physiology, comorbidities and physiological compensation to shock during the time of resuscitation.

The exception to the guidelines above is the polytrauma patient (blunt or penetrating) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In order to preserve adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and prevent secondary brain injury, one needs to target a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 80 mmHg (a cerebral perfusion pressure of approximately 60 mmHg).

Brain-focused therapy

The maintenance of the head of a severe isolated TBI patients in the midline, avoiding compression of the neck veins, and with a bed elevated at 30°–45° to facilitate brain venous drainage are basic maneuvers in the neurocritical care setting. These should always be applied with adequate spine precautions. Some panelists emphasized as some patients may require a lower bed elevation; this, considering what has been said previously for the zeroing of the arterial transducer in the case of invasive ABP monitoring, could lead to a reduced use of vasopressors for maintaining the blood pressure target.

Osmotherapy (i.e. mannitol or hypertonic saline) is effective in the rapid control of ICP through a reduction in blood viscosity and an increase in plasma osmolarity. Currently, adequately powered randomized controlled studies clearly showing the superiority of mannitol compared to hypertonic saline are lacking. Considering the diuretic effect of mannitol, hypertonic saline is a potentially reasonable choice in cases of hypovolemia. Moreover, the early utilization of mannitol, but not hypertonic saline, seems to be associated with increased incidence of acute kidney injury.

Hypocapnia associated with hyperventilation results in cerebral vasoconstriction with a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume and consequently ICP. This temporary effect is associated with the risk of development of cerebral ischemia. Profound hypocapnia is not recommended as a prophylactic maneuver but could be utilized briefly for patients awaiting emergent neurosurgery.

Metabolic suppression with sedatives can be useful in the control of intracranial hypertension but can increase the risk of hypotension. The reduction in blood pressure, observed in this scenario, should be aggressively corrected. In this regard, ketamine could be a useful option, but more data are necessary to confirm this.

Considering the above, in patients with signs of intracranial hypertension/brain herniation awaiting emergent neurosurgery, we recommend osmotherapy, short-term hyperventilation and an increase in sedation (ensuring an acceptable ABP).

According to BTF guidelines, prophylactic phenytoin or valproate are not recommended for preventing late post-traumatic seizures (PTS) and phenytoin is recommended to decrease the incidence of early PTS (within 7 days of injury), when the overall benefit is thought to outweigh the complications associated with such treatment (early PTS have not been associated with worse outcomes). Considering the above and awaiting the results of the ongoing "Management of Seizure after Traumatic Brain Injury" (MAST) trial (NCT04573803), we were unable to provide any recommendations regarding seizure prophylaxis in severe isolated TBI patients.

Cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral autoregulation

Since one major way elevated ICP causes secondary injury to the brain is causing ischemia through brain tissue compression, an additional approach to the problem of elevated ICP is through the lens of maintaining appropriate tissue perfusion in the brain.

Cerebral autoregulation refers to the brain's ability to maintain stable blood flow despite changes in systemic blood pressure, ensuring adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery. This mechanism keeps cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) — the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) — within an optimal range to avoid ischemia or hyper-perfusion. Elevated ICP is associated with a CPP less than 60 ​mmHg and with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity. CPP has emerged as another key target in ICP management of ABI, where maintaining adequate blood flow is critical. Effective ICP management focuses on maintaining CPP to prevent secondary brain injury, often targeting a CPP of 60–70 ​mmHg based on clinical guidelines. Current guideline support these parameters and definitive clinical trial evidence is still needed.

Current clinical paradigm and guidelines on ICP monitoring and management in ABI

In intensive care units tending to patients with sABIs, patients with lesions of a significant size or severity tend to undergo ICP monitor placement. The International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring recommends ICP and CPP monitoring for patients at risk of elevated ICP based on clinical or imaging features. They advocate for the use of these monitoring techniques to guide both medical and surgical interventions and to detect life-threatening conditions, such as imminent herniation. The Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines have evolved over time; the current iteration of their guidelines is to recommend ICP monitoring for patients with TBI who either have abnormal CT scans of the head and are comatose, or have normal CT scans but are at high risk based on age greater than 40 years, posturing on neurological exam, or systolic blood pressure less than 90 ​mmHg. However, significant variability exists between centers in how these guidelines are interpreted and applied to TBI patients, as highlighted by the CENTER-TBI study. In terms of establishing a threshold of what constitutes a clinically elevated ICP that ought to be treated, the current clinical paradigm is a 'one-size-fits all' approach where guidelines focus on treating based on the mean ICP crossing a certain threshold of either 20 ​mmHg (in non-TBI patients) or 22 ​mmHg in TBI patients.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^113tqqWF]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury

Current doctrine focuses on the reduction of secondary tissue injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Restoration of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in circulatory shock is critical to ensure oxygen delivery to the brain. Guidelines advocate in favor of an initial systolic blood pressure target over 110 mmHg in patients with severe TBI and advise against permissive hypotension strategies. Clinicians must therefore prioritize between two conflicting clinical strategies of either neuroprotection or hemorrhage limitation. Furthermore, in traumatology shock can arise from multiple causes that do not necessarily involve severe hemorrhage (tension pneumothorax, neurogenic hypotension, pericardial effusion). Such differential diagnoses highly complexify the clinician's dilemma if TBI is suspected.

The evidence underlying current guidelines in favor of increased blood pressure targets consists unfortunately of observational studies suggesting increased mortality rates among patients with prehospital or admission hypotension with TBI. Fuller et al. in 2013, estimated odds of death to be doubled for an admission SBP below 100 mmHg and tripled below 90 mmHg among a population of patients with AIS head scores above 2. Observational studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between prehospital blood pressure and in hospital mortality in TBI suggesting that hypertension could be also detrimental to survival. Recent observational data suggests that elderly patients could benefit from higher blood pressure levels highlighting the existence of potential high-risk subgroups. The body of evidence supporting the existence of a unique lower threshold defining critical hypotension is limited. Spaite et al. for instance observed a linear association between SBP and mortality. In their cohort, two patients with a SBP difference of 10 mmHg differed in their odds of death by 18.8%.

Despite the low level of evidence, hypotension appears to be a major secondary insult among patients with TBI that must be avoided at all costs. However, safe blood pressure levels as well as the definition of specific subgroups of patients at higher risk remain unclear and must be addressed by future RCTs.

Treatment of hypotension among patients with TBI can be achieved through fluid expansion strategies. Hypotonic crystalloids must be avoided as they maximize vasogenic oedema and have been shown to increase mortality. Hypertonic solutions have failed to show increased survival rates and improvements in neurologic outcomes after severe TBI. Current guidelines therefore recommend the use of 0,9% sodium chloride as it is easily accessible and more cost effective. The safety and efficacy of vasopressor use in combination to fluid expansion strategies in TBI remains uncertain and must be assessed by future RCTs.

Pediatric severe TBI intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — evidence and utilization — are characterized by limited controlled trials and variable adoption; CPP equals mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) minus mean ICP and is used to reflect global cerebral perfusion, a 2007 U.S. survey found about 60% agreement and conformity with guidelines recommendations, in the United Kingdom in 2006 only 59% of children with severe TBI underwent ICP monitoring with only half of clinical units using the technology, use in children less than 2 years of age may be even less likely with only 33% observed in a North Carolina cohort, and because a monitor is required for directed therapies, outcome benefits are considered supported inferentially; additionally, a single prospective controlled South American study in predominantly adults found no difference in outcomes between ICP monitoring–directed and clinical–radiologic–directed therapy, and recruited patients more than 12 years old, while center-to-center variability in treatment practices persists.

Severe traumatic brain injury — across multiple studies, hypotension is linked to worse outcomes in several settings: management strategies that prevent or minimize hypotension in the prehospital phase improve outcome from severe TBI; hypotension (SBP ≤ 80 mm Hg) correlated strongly with mortality; the two most critical values included the proportion of hourly intracranial pressure (ICP) readings greater than 20 mm Hg and the proportion of hourly systolic blood pressure (SBP) readings less than 80 mm Hg; hypotension (SBP < 95 mm Hg) was significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality and in another cohort was associated with a non-significant trend toward worse outcome in the entire cohort, meeting statistical significance for patients without mass lesions; in early surgery cases with intraoperative hypotension (SBP < 90 mm Hg), the mortality rate was 82% in the group with hypotension and 25% in the normotensive group (p < 0.001), and the duration of intraoperative hypotension was inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale score (R = -0.30, p = 0.02); additional reports note that hypotension was one of the four most common avoidable factors correlated with death and that early hypotension increases the mortality and worsens the prognosis of survivors in severe TBI.

### How to define and meet blood pressure targets after traumatic brain injury: a narrative review [^113uK5G8]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

While the Lund concept holds promise for enhancing patient outcomes in critical care settings, it's essential to consider both its advantages and disadvantages. Grounded in a physiological theory, this approach offers a pathway to improving patient care by optimizing oxygen delivery to vital organs and tailoring treatment strategies to individual physiological parameters. Additionally, its potential to reduce or eliminate the need for vasopressors presents a compelling advantage, mitigating the associated risks of systemic adverse side effects.

However, several drawbacks have tempered this approach over time. Firstly, the Lund concept's applicability beyond Scandinavia is limited, with its adoption remaining uncommon elsewhere. Moreover, its absence from international guidelines raises concerns about standardization and widespread acceptance. Furthermore, despite theoretical promise, large randomized controlled trials have yet to demonstrate clear clinical benefits, casting doubt on its efficacy in improving patient outcomes. Moreover, although there have been suggestions regarding impaired autoregulation and dysfunctional BBB, there is currently no inclusion of conclusive bedside measurements validating these concerns in the treatment algorithm. In summary, although the Lund concept may offer promise for certain patients with severe TBI experiencing specific physiological disturbances, such as dysfunctional BBB, its limitations and uncertainties necessitate that it be applied only in research settings.

Following the discussion of the Lund concept, it is crucial to consider the implications of well-known clinical trials such as those by Chestnut et al. and Nattino et al. which revealed no superiority in outcomes for patients with TBI with (early) continuous ICP-guided treatment protocol. The observational cohort in Nattino et al. highlighted that early ICP monitoring was associated with poorer recovery and increased medical interventions; however, this analysis was likely confounded by "indication" bias (related to receiving early ICP monitoring). Conversely, excessive treatments driven by ICP monitoring, such as the administration of high doses of vasopressors to elevate CPP, may lead to unsatisfactory results. Therefore, it seems essential to recognize that an autoregulation-based management of brain perfusion targets is probably only applicable and beneficial within a specific pathophysiological model of secondary brain injury (e.g. low intracranial compliance, presence of autoregulation plateau).

### Pediatric moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: a systematic review of clinical practice guideline recommendations [^1169bvfe]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children. Many clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have addressed pediatric TBI in the last decade but significant variability in the use of these guidelines persists. Here, we systematically review CPGs recommendations for pediatric moderate-to-severe TBI, evaluate the quality of CPGs, synthesize the quality of evidence and strength of included recommendations, and identify knowledge gaps. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE ®, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Web sites of organizations publishing recommendations on pediatric injury care. We included CPGs developed in high-income countries from January 2012 to May 2023, with at least one recommendation targeting pediatric (≤ 19 years old) moderate-to-severe TBI populations. The quality of included clinical practice guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II tool. We synthesized evidence on recommendations using a matrix based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. We identified 15 CPGs of which 9 were rated moderate to high quality using AGREE II. We identified 90 recommendations, of which 40 (45%) were evidence based. Eleven of these were based on moderate to high quality evidence and were graded as moderate or strong by at least one guideline. These included transfer, imaging, intracranial pressure control, and discharge advice. We identified gaps in evidence-based recommendations for red blood cell transfusion, plasma and platelet transfusion, thromboprophylaxis, surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis, early diagnosis of hypopituitarism, and mental health mangement. Many up-to-date CPGs are available, but there is a paucity of evidence to support recommendations, highlighting the urgent need for robust clinical research in this vulnerable population. Our results may be used by clinicians to identify recommendations based on the highest level of evidence, by healthcare administrators to inform guideline implementation in clinical settings, by researchers to identify areas where robust evidence is needed, and by guideline writing groups to inform the updating of existing guidelines or the development of new ones.

### The lund concept for the treatment of patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^114zUb9d]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Two different main concepts for the treatment of a severe traumatic brain injury have been established during the last 15 years, namely the more conventional concept recommended in well-established guidelines (eg, U.S. Guideline, European Guideline, Addelbrook's Guideline from Cambridge), on the one hand, and the Lund concept from the University Hospital of Lund, Sweden, on the other. Owing to the lack of well-controlled randomized outcome studies comparing these 2 main therapeutic approaches, we cannot conclude that one is better than the other. This paper is the PRO part in a PRO-CON debate in this journal on the Lund concept. Although the Lund concept is based on a physiology-oriented approach dealing with the hemodynamic principles of brain volume and brain perfusion regulation, traditional treatments are primarily based on a meta-analytic approach from clinical studies. High cerebral perfusion pressure has been an essential goal in the conventional treatments (the cerebral perfusion pressure-guided approach), even though it has been modified in a recent up date of U.S. guidelines. The Lund concept has instead concentrated on management of brain edema and intracranial pressure, along with improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (the intracranial pressure and perfusion-guided approach). Although conventional guidelines are restricted to clinical data from meta-analytic surveys, the physiological approach of Lund therapy finds support in both experimental and clinical studies. It offers a wider base and can also provide recommendations regarding fluid therapy, lung protection, optimal hemoglobin concentration, temperature control, the use of decompressive craniotomy, and ventricular drainage. This paper puts forward arguments in support of Lund therapy.

### Systolic blood pressure [^116wyf4C]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypotension is a known risk factor for poor neurologic outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Current guidelines suggest that higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) thresholds likely confer a mortality benefit. However, there is no consensus on the ideal perfusion pressure among different age groups (i.e., recommended SBP ≥ 100mm Hg for patients age 50–69 years; ≥ 110mm Hg for all other adults). We hypothesize that admission SBP ≥ 110mm Hg will be associated with improved outcomes regardless of age group. A retrospective database review of the 2010–2016 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database was performed for adults (≥ 18 years) with isolated moderate-to-severe TBIs (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] ≥ 3; all other AIS < 3). Sub-analyses were performed after dividing patients by SBP and age; comparison groups were matched with propensity score matching. Primary outcomes were early (6h, 12h, and 1 day) and overall in-hospital mortality. Overall, 154,725 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean age 62.8 ± 19.8 years, 89,431 [57.8%] males, Injury Severity Score13.9 ± 6.8). Multi-variate logistic regression showed that the risk of in-hospital mortality decreased with increasing SBP, plateauing at 110mm Hg. Among patients of all ages, SBP ≥ 110mm Hg was associated with improved mortality (SBP 110–129 vs. 90–109mm Hg: 12h 0.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.001; 1 day 0.8% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.004; overall 3.2% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001). Among patients age 50–69 years, SBP ≥ 110mm Hg was associated with improved mortality (SBP 110–119 vs. 100–109mm Hg: 12h 0.3% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.018; 1 day 0.5% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.007; overall 2.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.015). In conclusion, SBP ≥ 110mm Hg is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in adult patients with isolated TBIs, including patients age 50–69 years. SBP < 110mm Hg should be used to define hypotension in adult patients of all ages.

### Low-resolution pressure reactivity index and its derived optimal cerebral perfusion pressure in adult traumatic brain injury: a CENTER-TBI study [^113a5kwX]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), secondary injury cascades occur that affect cerebral blood flow (CBF). They may lead to ischemia when the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), the pressure gradient for cerebral blood flow defined as arterial blood pressure (ABP) minus intracranial pressure (ICP), is too low or to hyperemia and increased ICP when the CPP is too high. The brain is vulnerable to changes in CPP after severe TBI because cerebral autoregulation, which normally maintains constant CBF during changes in ABP, is often impaired in those patients. A mainstay in the clinical management of TBI is therefore the avoidance of secondary brain injury by controlling ICP and ensuring adequate, non-harmful CBF by regulating CPP. Current guidelines (2016) by the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend keeping CPP between 60 and 70 mmHg. However, likely due to the heterogeneity of cerebral injuries in patients with TBI, a CPP-oriented therapy with one fixed target for all patients failed to demonstrate improved neurological outcome compared to ICP-targeted therapy in a large randomized-controlled trial. This is why a patient-customized approach has been proposed which uses the pressure reactivity index (PRx) to determine the optimal CPP (CPPopt) in an individual patient. The PRx, calculated as a moving correlation coefficient between slow waves of ABP and ICP, is a surrogate marker for cerebral autoregulation and has been associated with outcome after TBI in multiple studies. Positive PRx values indicate dysfunctional cerebrovascular reactivity and are associated with increased mortality and unfavorable outcome, while negative values indicate intact pressure reactivity. Using computational methods, this relationship can be exploited to determine an optimal CPP that corresponds to the lowest, most favorable PRx values in a patient. As the PRx and thus CPPopt are derived from ABP and ICP signals that are continuously monitored, the CPPopt recommendation can be constantly updated and refined, thereby providing the possibility to customize the clinical management also over the course of time in an individual patient. The automated CPPopt algorithm introduced by Aries et al. which uses a single, 4-h moving monitoring window to calculate CPPopt has been developed further to a multi-window algorithm. Deviations of CPP from CPPopt have been shown to correlate with clinical outcome in several retrospective studies, and the first prospective study assessing the feasibility of clinical management based on continuous determination of CPPopt is currently ongoing (COGiTATE trial). However, as the PRx and thus PRx-based CPPopt calculations require continuous, full-resolution waveforms of ABP and ICP, the CPPopt concept is currently limited to specialized neurocritical care units. In an attempt to increase accessibility of the PRx concept, a similarly calculated PRx variant called the long pressure reactivity index (LPRx) has been introduced which can be derived from lower resolution, minute-by-minute resampled ICP and ABP signals that standard monitoring devices in most intensive care units (ICU) can provide. However, it remains unclear whether minute-by-minute monitoring might be of high enough resolution to evaluate autoregulation in patients with TBI and derive clinically relevant information from it. In fact, previous studies have yielded mixed results and drawn different conclusions.

### Optimal out-of-hospital blood pressure in major traumatic brain injury: a challenge to the current understanding of hypotension [^117Nu189]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Little is known about the out-of-hospital blood pressure ranges associated with optimal outcomes in traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Our objective was to evaluate the associations between out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure (SBP) and multiple hospital outcomes without assuming any predefined thresholds for hypotension, normotension, or hypertension.

Methods

This was a preplanned secondary analysis from the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) TBI study. Among patients (age ≥ 10 years) with major TBIs (Barell Matrix type 1 and/or Abbreviated Injury Scale-head severity ≥ 3) and lowest out-of-hospital SBPs of 40 to 299 mmHg, we utilized generalized additive models to summarize the distributions of various outcomes as smoothed functions of SBP, adjusting for important and significant confounders. The subjects who were enrolled in the study phase after the out-of-hospital TBI guideline implementation were used to validate the models developed from the preimplementation cohort.

Results

Among 12,169 included cases, the mortality model revealed 3 distinct ranges: (1) a monotonically decreasing relationship between SBP and the adjusted probability of death from 40 to 130 mmHg, (2) lowest adjusted mortality from 130 to 180 mmHg, and (3) rapidly increasing mortality above 180 mmHg. A subanalysis of the cohorts with isolated TBIs and multisystem injuries with TBIs revealed SBP mortality patterns that were similar to each other and to that of the main analysis. While the specific SBP ranges varied somewhat for the nonmortality outcomes (hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, discharge to skilled nursing/inpatient rehabilitation, and hospital charges), the patterns were very similar to that of mortality. In each model, validation was confirmed utilizing the postimplementation cohort.

Conclusion

Optimal adjusted mortality was associated with a surprisingly high SBP range (130 to 180 mmHg). Below this level, there was no point or range of inflection that would indicate a physiologically meaningful threshold for defining hypotension. Nonmortality outcomes showed very similar patterns. These findings highlight how sensitive the injured brain is to compromised perfusion at SBP levels that, heretofore, have been considered adequate or even normal. While the study design does did not allow us to conclude that the currently recommended treatment threshold (< 90 mmHg) should be increased, the findings imply that the definition of hypotension in the setting of TBI is too low. Randomized trials evaluating treatment levels significantly higher than 90 mmHg are needed.

### Mortality and prehospital blood pressure in patients with major traumatic brain injury: implications for the hypotension threshold [^116qaiyx]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current prehospital traumatic brain injury guidelines use a systolic blood pressure threshold of less than 90 mm Hg for treating hypotension for individuals 10 years and older based on studies showing higher mortality when blood pressure drops below this level. However, the guidelines also acknowledge the weakness of the supporting evidence.

Objective

To evaluate whether any statistically supportable threshold between systolic pressure and mortality emerges from the data a priori, without assuming that a cut point exists.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational evaluation of a large prehospital database established as a part of the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care Traumatic Brain Injury Study. Patients from the preimplementation cohort (January 2007 to March 2014) 10 years and older with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (Barell Matrix Type 1 classification, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision head region severity score of 3 or greater, and/or Abbreviated Injury Scale head-region severity score of 3 or greater) and a prehospital systolic pressure between 40 and 119 mm Hg were included. The generalized additive model and logistic regression were used to determine the association between systolic pressure and probability of death, adjusting for significant/important confounders.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.

Results

Among the 3844 included patients, 2565 (66.7%) were male, and the median (range) age was 35 (10–99) years. The model revealed a monotonically decreasing association between systolic pressure and adjusted probability of death across the entire range (ie, from 40 to 119 mm Hg). Each 10-point increase of systolic pressure was associated with a decrease in the adjusted odds of death of 18.8% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.812; 95% CI, 0.748–0.883). Thus, the adjusted odds of mortality increased as much for a drop from 110 to 100 mm Hg as for a drop from 90 to 80 mm Hg, and so on throughout the range.

Conclusions and Relevance

We found a linear association between lowest prehospital systolic blood pressure and severity-adjusted probability of mortality across an exceptionally wide range. There is no identifiable threshold or inflection point between 40 and 119 mm Hg. Thus, in patients with traumatic brain injury, the concept that 90 mm Hg represents a unique or important physiological cut point may be wrong. Furthermore, clinically meaningful hypotension may not be as low as current guidelines suggest. Randomized trials evaluating treatment levels significantly above 90 mm Hg are needed.

### Targeted temperature control following traumatic brain injury: ESICM / NACCS best practice consensus recommendations [^111L2nw3]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Highlighting the wealth of physiological data available on the management of temperature in stroke and cardiac arrest, the group noted that the guidelines for temperature management in TBI are less specific. Fundamentally, the group agreed that high-quality TBI care does include monitoring temperature and implementing some form of temperature control, recognising its potential role in optimising outcome. The group highlighted the importance of treatment titration based on an individualised risk–benefit assessment and stratification. In particular, it was noted that in patients with exhausted intracranial compensatory reserve and at risk of cerebral herniation or ischaemia — there exists an extreme susceptibility to secondary brain injury precipitated by suboptimal temperature control.

Cerebral herniation is a life-threatening event that requires early diagnosis and prompt management in order to prevent irreversible pathological cascades that can lead to death. Increases in brain temperature have been linked to a linear rise in ICP, with the relationships between temperature, ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) becoming more apparent with rapid temperature changes. The impact of temperature on ICP supports the recommendation from the group that temperature control is an essential aspect of care in patients at risk of herniation. The group agreed that while control of ICP and prevention of herniation were important reasons for TTC in TBI, benefits of TTC in the acute phase of TBI also extended to patients without intracranial hypertension.

During the discussions the group highlighted that different pathologies often dictate different patient management. For example, patients in whom fluctuations in ICP are well-tolerated (e.g. patients with high intracranial compliance) will be managed differently to patients with obliterated basal cisterns, obliterated cortical sulci, and midline shift (e.g. intracranial mass effect). In patients with exhausted intracranial volume-buffering reserve, strict control of physiological parameters such as CO₂ and temperature, is strongly recommended.

Second, changing ABP might cause or aggravate extracranial injuries in other (affected) organs. Extracranial complications are common and influence the outcome of TBI. Significant improvements in outcomes in a sizable proportion of patients could potentially be accomplished by improving the ability to prevent or reverse nonneurological complications.

Prioritizing perfusion pressures for one organ may come at the expense of others, potentially leading to complications like ARDS, pneumonia, or AKI. Prompt recognition and treatment of systemic complications are therefore fundamental to the care of this patient cohort. So far, the role of extracranial pathology has often been underestimated in outcome assessment because most clinicians focus mainly on intracranial lesions and injury rather than consider the systemic effects of TBI. Further studies are warranted to precisely understand and manage the multisystem response of the body after TBI and how individual treatment levels, such as CPP, should be adjusted.

Evidence synthesis and recommendations, Part II: Monitoring — principles and scope emphasize that it is using information from monitoring to direct treatment, not monitoring per se, that affects outcomes, and that treatment informed by data from monitoring may result in better outcomes than treatment informed solely by data from clinical assessment. This section addresses the influence on patient outcomes of three types of monitoring: intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring (CPP), and advanced cerebral monitoring (ACM). Clinical practice in most high-income countries incorporates multiple monitoring approaches as well as ongoing clinical assessment, and treatment decisions are not made using one source of information in isolation.

### Perceived utility of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury: a Seattle international brain injury consensus conference consensus-based analysis and recommendations [^112aPiJW]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The perceived utility of ICP monitoring in TBI, as expressed by experienced, international neurotraumatologists, is underrepresented in current monitoring guidelines. Knowing the ICP seems desirable in a broader spectrum of patients with TBI than simply those with intracranial hypertension. We provide consensus-based insertion heatmaps and recommendations for use in clinical decision-making and in analyzing survey-based ICP monitoring efficacy studies.

### Management of arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the first week after traumatic brain injury: results from the CENTER-TBI study [^115Bb5hY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Changes in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), by modifying the extravascular pH, modulate cerebrovascular tone, and hence cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). Hypercapnia results in perivascular acidosis, which causes cerebral vasodilation, and consequently, an increase in intracranial volume. In patients with poor intracranial compliance, this could raise intracranial pressure (ICP). On the other hand, hyperventilation (HV) induced alkalosis reduces vascular calibre, and hence CBV, and can represent an effective measure to control intracranial hypertension, when ICP remains elevated despite first-line therapies. However, hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction can also reduce CBF, thus posing the risk of secondary ischaemic insults. In a survey across European trauma centers, the most frequently reported PaCO 2 target was 36–40 mmHg in the absence of intracranial hypertension, which was reduced to 30–35 mmHg when ICP was > 20 mmHg. The most recent evidence-based guidelines on TBI management provide no definitive recommendations regarding target PaCO 2 levels due to the low quality of evidence available on this issue.

Consequently, although many patients with severe TBI undergo several days of mechanical ventilation, there is little evidence-based guidance on PaCO 2 targets, and clinical practice remains highly variable. A recent consensus on mechanical ventilation in patients with acute brain injury suggested aiming for a physiologic range of PaCO₂ between 35 and 45 mmHg, and to only use hyperventilation (with an undefined PaCO 2 target) as a short-term therapeutic option in patients with evidence of brain herniation. However, the document was unable to provide a recommendation on the use of hyperventilation in patients who showed significant ICP elevation, but no evidence of herniation. A management algorithm for patients with intracranial hypertension, based on expert consensus, suggested the use of HV (PaCO₂ 32–35 mmHg) for controlling ICP only as a second-tier treatment, did not support lower PaCO 2 levels and recommended against routine hyperventilation to PaCO₂ below 30 mmHg.

The objectives of this study were to assess, in a real-world context, PaCO 2 management and the lowest target of PaCO 2 in a large cohort of mechanically ventilated TBI patients and practice variability between centres to evaluate the association between the use of profound HV and 6-month clinical outcomes.

### Effect of blood pressure threshold on adverse outcomes in patients with acute spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172XSXc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Inadequate spinal perfusion in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) can exacerbate secondary injury. While current guidelines recommend maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 75–80mmHg post-injury, no quantitative analysis on effects of blood pressure on neurological outcomes exists. We aim to address this gap and evaluate the impact of blood pressure thresholds on adverse outcomes in acute traumatic and non-traumatic SCI to inform current guidelines.

Methods

The project adhered to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024550044). We searched seven databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Reviews, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included studies involving patients ≥ 16yrs with acute SCI, randomized control trials, prospective cohorts, and retrospective (case-control, cohort) studies. Excluded were chronic SCI and studies mentioning induced hypotension. The main outcome was the relationship between blood pressure thresholds and adverse functional outcome at up to one-year post-injury. Outcomes (unadjusted odds ratios (uOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR)) were calculated using a random-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

Results

Of 16,366 identified articles, 38 (n = 7,167, 73% male) were included in the qualitative and 14 (n = 2,553, 76% male) in the quantitative analysis. Pooled analysis found an increase in adverse functional outcomes in patients with below threshold blood pressures (uOR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.39–4.50; aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.05). Subgroup analyses consistently showed that lower blood pressure thresholds were associated with worse outcomes across all subgroups. Risk of bias was low to moderate in most studies. Heterogeneity was moderate to high (I²: 69.88%).

Conclusion

Lower blood pressure thresholds were consistently associated with worse functional outcomes in patients with acute SCI. While these findings support the rationale for MAP augmentation, they should be interpreted cautiously due to the observational nature of the data and high heterogeneity. High-quality prospective studies are needed to determine optimal blood pressure targets.

### A management algorithm for patients with intracranial pressure monitoring: the Seattle international severe traumatic brain injury consensus conference (SIBICC) [^1136ScRA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sufficient research-based literature on individual ICP treatments exists to allow creation of an evidence report. Unfortunately, there is insufficient research on the amalgamation of these individual treatments into a management algorithm to allow evidence-based development of a treatment approach. Since daily care consists of amalgamating individual treatments into a care plan, leaving this process to individual, non-expert practitioners without specific guidance is undesirable. Despite its limitations and weaknesses, the Delphi method remains the best current methodology for developing recommendations from expert consensus. As an evidentiary basis for prioritizing, sequencing, and combining sTBI treatments does not currently exist, we applied the Delphi method rigorously to this work, concomitantly recognizing the relative weakness of this approach.

Protracted specialist experience provides the expert practitioner repeated feedback on their manner of combining individual therapies. Although neither conditions nor outcomes are rigorously controlled, the impact of many repeated exposures to the influence of their therapeutic approach on short-term results (such as acute ICP control) should bestow a form of wisdom ("Medicine-Based Evidence"; the time-tested experience of an individual practitioner). An individual's wisdom is likely confounded by factors such as personal biases, technical idiosyncrasies, the care environment, patient population and injury demographics, etc. The concept of a consensus conference is to combine a large cohort of such experts and determine where their experiences overlap. As it is unlikely that individual-specific confounding factors will be shared, areas where there is general agreement should reflect a degree of clinical efficacy. The inclusion of multiple specialties, international sites, and varying practices should improve generalizability. We used this theoretical framework here to construct this set of recommendations.

### Targeted temperature control following traumatic brain injury: ESICM / NACCS best practice consensus recommendations [^116622Mo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims and scope

The aim of this panel was to develop consensus recommendations on targeted temperature control (TTC) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in patients with moderate TBI who deteriorate and require admission to the intensive care unit for intracranial pressure (ICP) management.

Methods

A group of 18 international neuro-intensive care experts in the acute management of TBI participated in a modified Delphi process. An online anonymised survey based on a systematic literature review was completed ahead of the meeting, before the group convened to explore the level of consensus on TTC following TBI. Outputs from the meeting were combined into a further anonymous online survey round to finalise recommendations. Thresholds of ≥ 16 out of 18 panel members in agreement (≥ 88%) for strong consensus and ≥ 14 out of 18 (≥ 78%) for moderate consensus were prospectively set for all statements.

Results

Strong consensus was reached on TTC being essential for high-quality TBI care. It was recommended that temperature should be monitored continuously, and that fever should be promptly identified and managed in patients perceived to be at risk of secondary brain injury. Controlled normothermia (36.0–37.5 °C) was strongly recommended as a therapeutic option to be considered in tier 1 and 2 of the Seattle International Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Consensus Conference ICP management protocol. Temperature control targets should be individualised based on the perceived risk of secondary brain injury and fever aetiology.

Conclusions

Based on a modified Delphi expert consensus process, this report aims to inform on best practices for TTC delivery for patients following TBI, and to highlight areas of need for further research to improve clinical guidelines in this setting.

### PRO: the "Lund concept" for treatment of patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^111xo1dD]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Two different main concepts for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury have been established during the last 15 years, namely the more conventional concept recommended in well-established guidelines (eg, the US Guideline, European Guideline, Addelbrook's Guideline from Cambridge) on the one hand, and the Lund concept from the University Hospital of Lund, Sweden on the other. Owing to the lack of well-controlled randomized outcome studies comparing these 2 main therapeutic approaches, we cannot conclude that one is better than the other. This study is the PRO part in a PRO-CON debate on the Lund concept in the present journal. Although the Lund concept is based on a physiology-oriented approach dealing with hemodynamic principles of brain volume and brain perfusion regulation, traditional treatments are primarily based on a meta-analytic approach from clinical studies. High cerebral perfusion pressure has been an essential goal in the conventional treatments (the cerebral perfusion pressure-guided approach), even though it has been modified in a recent update of US guidelines. The Lund concept has instead concentrated on management of brain edema and intracranial pressure, simultaneously with improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (the intracranial pressure and perfusion-guided approach). Although conventional guidelines are restricted to clinical data from meta-analytic surveys, the physiological approach of the Lund therapy finds support in both experimental and clinical studies. It offers a wider base and can also give recommendations regarding fluid therapy, lung protection, optimal hemoglobin concentration, temperature control, the use of decompressive craniotomy, and ventricular drainage. This study puts forward arguments in support of the Lund therapy.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^114t3aQV]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure monitoring — introduction: Monitoring and treatment of intracranial pressure (ICP) has been a mainstay of care for the most severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and ICP monitoring has been included in every guideline for severe TBI published by the Brain Trauma Foundation. In the developed world, ICP monitoring is routinely used, leading to a lack of equipoise for assigning patients to a non‑monitored arm, and observational evidence largely found that ICP crises led to poorer outcomes. A recent study challenged this by randomizing patients to protocols based on either an invasive ICP monitor or a clinical/radiological examination and, performed where equipoise existed for a non‑monitored group, failed to find differences between groups. The text emphasizes that intracranial hypertension is an important secondary insult after severe TBI and that its alleviation plays a pivotal role in providing good patient care to achieve optimal outcomes.

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury, third edition: update of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines [^114oGYfY]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

CPP concept, age differences, and study limitations — pediatric severe traumatic brain injury: Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) — as defined by mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the mean intracranial pressure (ICP) — is the pressure gradient driving cerebral blood flow (CBF); if autoregulation is disrupted after TBI, then a decrease in CPP may induce cerebral ischemia, and although CPP can be followed and manipulated with continuous MAP and ICP monitoring, the optimal CPP for therapy remains unknown. Pediatric values for MAP, CBF, and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) are in general lower than adult values, prompting interest in age-specific thresholds or targets. Major limitations for comparing CPP data include potential measurement differences of 5–10 mm Hg related to zeroing and head elevation, variance in ICP- or CPP-directed strategies, and differing CPP summary statistics with only one report excluding pretreatment data; taken together, caution should be applied when interpreting and applying pediatric CPP study results.

Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury — temperature control/hypothermia recommendations specify a strength of recommendation that is moderate. Level I states there was insufficient evidence to support a level I recommendation for this topic. For Level II to improve overall outcomes, II.1. specifies that prophylactic moderate (32–33°C) hypothermia is not recommended over normothermia to improve overall outcomes. For Level III intracranial pressure (ICP) control, III.1. states that moderate (32–33°C) hypothermia is suggested for ICP control. Safety recommendations include that if hypothermia is used and rewarming is initiated, it should be carried out at a rate of 0.5–1.0°C every 12–24 hours or slower to avoid complications, and if phenytoin is used during hypothermia, monitoring and dosing adjusted to minimize toxicity, especially during the rewarming period, are suggested.

### Updates in traumatic brain injury management: brain oxygenation, middle meningeal artery embolization and new protocols [^111biDui]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

New protocols

Over the last decade, new protocols have been established in the management of TBI. Several national organizations have published updated recommendations on the care of patients with TBI, commensurate with updated literature. One such organization, the BTF, who publish guidelines for the management of mild, moderate and severe TBI, has incorporated evidence for improvement of care in the prehospital setting. Recent literature notes worsened outcomes in patients with TBI sustaining hypoxia or hypotension and worsened outcomes when these occur independently. Noting the need for prevention of hypoxia and hypotension, although brief, in the field, there is a stronger recommendation to maintain arterial oxygen saturation and hemodynamic parameters. BTF now recommends maintenance of systolic blood pressure above 110 mm Hg, given that lower pressures have been associated with worsened outcomes. Likewise, oxygen saturation should be maintained above 90%. In fact, patients with suspected TBI are now recommended to be placed on supplemental oxygen to minimize the potential for hypoxic events. Blood pressures should be measured every 5–10 min in the prehospital setting with appropriately sized cuffs. Pediatric age-appropriate blood pressures should be maintained (table 5). In the austere environment, signs of end-organ perfusion, including capillary refill time, neurologic status and quality of peripheral pulses, should be utilized for pediatric patients. Furthermore, ventilation should be monitored and maintained between 35 and 45 mm Hg in those with altered consciousness. Attention to temperature was also noted, with maintenance of euthermia (36 o C–37 o C).

### Intracranial pressure monitor in patients with traumatic brain injury [^1114A44t]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines recommend intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less with an abnormal head computed tomography, or a normal head computed tomography scan with systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg, posturing, or in patients of age ≥ 40. The benefits of these guidelines on outcome remain unproven. We hypothesized that adherence to BTF guidelines for ICP monitoring does not improve outcomes in patients with TBI.

Methods

All TBI patients with an admission Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 admitted to our level I trauma center over a 3-y period were identified. Adherence to the individual components of our institutional TBI Bundle (ICP monitoring, SpO2 ≥ 95%, PaCO2 30–39 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, cerebral perfusion pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg, ICP ≤ 25 mm Hg, and temperature 36°C-37°C) was assessed. Patients were stratified into two groups as follows: patients with ICP monitoring (ICP) and patients without ICP monitoring (no-ICP). Outcome measures were survival and discharge disposition. Multivariate regression analysis was performed.

Results

We identified 2618 TBI patients, 261 of whom met the BTF criteria for ICP monitoring. After excluding those with nonsurvivable injuries (n = 67), 194 patients were available for analysis. The two groups were similar in demographics and severity of head injury. Survival rate was higher in the no-ICP group compared with that in the ICP group (98% versus 76%, P < 0.004). Non-monitored patients were discharged with higher levels of function per discharge location (28% home versus 4% home; P < 0.001). Patients without ICP monitoring were 1.21 times more likely to survive compared with that of patients with ICP monitoring (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [1.1–1.9], P = 0.01). In the ICP group, the overall compliance rate to the ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure goals as required by the BTF guidelines was poor.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that there is a subset of patients meeting BTF criteria for ICP monitoring that do well without ICP monitoring. This finding should provoke reevaluation of the indication and utility of ICP monitoring in TBI patients.

### Does intracranial pressure management hurt more than it helps in traumatic brain injury? [^113oGREt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death after traumatic injury. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is particularly associated with poor TBI outcomes, prompting clinicians to monitor this parameter, using it to guide therapies aimed at reducing pressures. Despite this approach being recommended by several bodies such as the Brain Trauma Foundation and the American College of Surgeons, the evidence demonstrating that ICP-guided therapy improves outcome is limited. The topic was debated at the 36th Annual Point/Counterpoint Acute Care Surgery Conference and the following article summarizes the discussants points of view along with a summary of the evidence.

### Variation in general supportive and preventive intensive care management of traumatic brain injury: a survey in 66 neurotrauma centers participating in the collaborative European neuroTrauma effectiveness research in traumatic brain injury (CENTER-TBI) study [^1119brgy]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this survey, we found varying degrees of consensus between European neurotrauma centers with respect to general supportive and preventive ICU management in patients with TBI. Most variation was found in initial PaO 2 goals for mechanically ventilated patients, CPP targets, the timing of tracheostomy in unconscious patients, nutritional targets, and seizure prophylaxis and treatment.

Large between-center variation was found in topics that are not addressed in the recommendations of the BTF guidelines (Additional file 4), suggesting the role of guidelines in reducing variances in clinical practice. International guidelines (BTF guidelines and guidelines of the American College of Surgeons) do recommend the use of normalized thresholds (e.g. normoglycemia, normocapnia, and normothermia) in patients with TBI, although this is not based on high-level evidence. Indeed, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on these topics are too limited in number to lead to high-level evidence. Considering CPP targets, the BTF guidelines are unclear whether to use an optimum threshold of > 60 or > 70 mmHg (and a range of 50–70 mmHg in the previous BTF guidelines). Despite this ambiguity, a majority of respondents (60%) preferred a target CPP of > 60 mmHg. In addition, the current BTF guidelines added that the CPP target might depend on the individual cerebral autoregulatory status, reflected by 38% of respondents who indicated to use an individualized target CPP. The uniformity in reported CPP targets between income groups also suggests that these concepts are widespread. It may be that the willingness to individualize CPP in patients with TBI reflects the growing trend for use of precision medicine, where therapies and therapy targets are individualized to patient need, rather than used on a "one size fits all" basis.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^114x4HQz]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

It should be noted that a damage control resuscitation strategy using restrictive volume replacement is contraindicated in patients with TBI and spinal injuries, because an adequate perfusion pressure is crucial to ensure tissue oxygenation of the injured central nervous system. Rapid bleeding control is of particular importance in these patients. In addition, the concept of permissive hypotension should be carefully considered in the elderly patient, and may be contraindicated if the patient suffers from chronic arterial hypertension.

In conclusion, a damage control resuscitation strategy that aims to achieve a lower than normal systolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg using a concept of restricted fluid replacement in patients without TBI and/or spinal injury is supported by the literature, however strong evidence from RCTs is lacking.

Vasopressors may also be required transiently to sustain life and maintain tissue perfusion in the presence of life-threatening hypotension, even when fluid expansion is in progress and hypovolaemia has not yet been corrected. Norepinephrine (NE) is often used to restore arterial pressure in septic and haemorrhagic shock and is now recommended as the agent of choice for this purpose during septic shock. Although NE has some β-adrenergic effects, it acts predominantly as a vasoconstrictor. Arterial α-adrenergic stimulation increases arterial resistance and may increase cardiac afterload; NE exerts both arterial and venous α-adrenergic stimulation. Indeed, in addition to its arterial vasoconstrictor effect, NE induces venoconstriction at the level of the splanchnic circulation in particular, which increases the pressure in capacitance vessels and actively shifts splanchnic blood volume to the systemic circulation. This venous adrenergic stimulation may recruit some blood from the venous unstressed volume, i.e. the volume that fills the blood vessels without generating intravascular pressure. Moreover, stimulation of β 2 -adrenergic receptors decreases venous resistance and increases venous return.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^117Q7PGE]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The initial treatment of trauma-induced hypotension uses the concept of a restricted volume replacement and permissive hypotension. This strategy was mainly triggered by a RCT published in the 1990s demonstrating increased survival in penetrating trauma. In the meantime, this strategy is replacing conventional aggressive fluid resuscitation. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs analysed mortality in trauma patients without TBI receiving either traditional aggressive fluid resuscitation or following a restricted volume replacement and permissive hypotension concept found a decrease in mortality when the latter concept was used.

This concept is supported by several meta-analyses of retrospective studies alone as well as combined prospective and retrospective studies showing reduced mortality in comparison to traditional aggressive volume replacement targeting normotension. Several retrospective studies demonstrated that aggressive resuscitation techniques, often initiated in the pre-hospital setting, not only increased mortality, but also more often resulted in damage control laparotomy, coagulopathy, multiorgan failure, nosocomial infections, a need for transfusions and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospital stays. A recently published retrospective analysis of the effect of aggressive volume resuscitation confirmed the potential harm associated with this strategy in comparison to a restrictive volume strategy in a paediatric trauma population.

It should be noted that the concept of permissive hypotension and restrictive volume resuscitation is contraindicated in patients with TBI and spinal injuries. This is because an adequate perfusion pressure is crucial to ensure tissue oxygenation of the injured central nervous system. However, it remains unclear how to attain the best balance between volume resuscitation and vasopressor administration in order to achieve an adequate perfusion pressure. Therefore, rapid bleeding control is of particular importance in these patients. In addition, the concept of permissive hypotension should be carefully considered in elderly patient and may be contraindicated if the patient suffers from chronic arterial hypertension.

In conclusion, a damage control resuscitation strategy using a concept of restricted fluid replacement that aims to achieve a reduced systolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg in patients without TBI and/or spinal injury is supported by the literature. However, the currently available data should be interpreted with caution; reported RCTs are limited by a low number of patients included and poor-to-moderate quality. The retrospective data suffer from inherent limitations as well as methodological weaknesses such as a high risk of selection bias and clinical heterogeneity. Therefore, further confirmation in adequately powered prospective RCTs is needed.

### Effect of blood pressure threshold on adverse outcomes in patients with acute spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fvSP5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Inadequate spinal perfusion in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) can exacerbate secondary injury. While current guidelines recommend maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 75–80mmHg post-injury, no quantitative analysis on effects of blood pressure on neurological outcomes exists. We aim to address this gap and evaluate the impact of blood pressure thresholds on adverse outcomes in acute traumatic and non-traumatic SCI to inform current guidelines.

Methods

The project adhered to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024550044). We searched seven databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Reviews, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included studies involving patients ≥ 16yrs with acute SCI, randomized control trials, prospective cohorts, and retrospective (case-control, cohort) studies. Excluded were chronic SCI and studies mentioning induced hypotension. The main outcome was the relationship between blood pressure thresholds and adverse functional outcome at up to one-year post-injury. Outcomes (unadjusted odds ratios (uOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR)) were calculated using a random-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

Results

Of 16,366 identified articles, 38 (n = 7,167, 73% male) were included in the qualitative and 14 (n = 2,553, 76% male) in the quantitative analysis. Pooled analysis found an increase in adverse functional outcomes in patients with below threshold blood pressures (uOR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.39–4.50; aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.05). Subgroup analyses consistently showed that lower blood pressure thresholds were associated with worse outcomes across all subgroups. Risk of bias was low to moderate in most studies. Heterogeneity was moderate to high (I²: 69.88%).

Conclusion

Lower blood pressure thresholds were consistently associated with worse functional outcomes in patients with acute SCI. While these findings support the rationale for MAP augmentation, they should be interpreted cautiously due to the observational nature of the data and high heterogeneity. High-quality prospective studies are needed to determine optimal blood pressure targets.

### Acute management of traumatic brain injury [^112MQXyp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in patients with trauma. Management strategies must focus on preventing secondary injury by avoiding hypotension and hypoxia and maintaining appropriate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is a surrogate for cerebral blood flow. CPP can be maintained by increasing mean arterial pressure, decreasing intracranial pressure, or both. The goal should be euvolemia and avoidance of hypotension. Other factors that deserve important consideration in the acute management of patients with TBI are venous thromboembolism, stress ulcer, and seizure prophylaxis, as well as nutritional and metabolic optimization.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^117GHUTL]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — prior hyperventilation guidance restated from the 3rd Edition but not supported by evidence meeting current standards notes that the Level III recommendations from the 3rd Edition were not carried forward because they were derived from case series studies; while no evidence is available from comparative studies to support a formal recommendation, the Committee chose to re-state the 3rd Edition Level III recommendations, including that hyperventilation is recommended as a temporizing measure for the reduction of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), that hyperventilation should be avoided during the first 24 hours after injury when cerebral blood flow (CBF) is often critically reduced, and that if hyperventilation is used, jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjO₂) or brain tissue O₂ partial pressure (BtpO₂) measurements are recommended to monitor oxygen delivery.

### Guidelines for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury… [^11366LPJ]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with STBI have been available from the Brain Trauma Foundation since 1995. 1 Current recommendations, particularly those related to intracranial pressure, 1 remain controversial owing to the questions raised by single-center studies and international trials about the benefit2–4 and feasibility5 of implementation. Based on a national assessment of US trauma medical directors, the objective of our study was to determine the extent to which BTF guidelines are used. The majority of level I centers reported ICP use in more than 60% of STBI cases, while 45 of 65 of level III centers acknowledged use in less than 20% of cases. Comparable results were observed for hypotonic saline, with 66. 0% of level I centers using hypotonic saline in more than 60% of STBI cases and
78. 5% of level III centers using it in less than 20% of cases.

Following published reports of battlefield efficacy during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and publication of the most recent BTF guidelines in 2007, 1 93 of 245 TMDs indicated resurgences in the use of decompressive craniectomy for patients with medically refractory intracranial hypertension between 2001 and 2011. An additional 105 TMDs indicated increases in the procedure for patients with acute STBI. Reported increases were most common in level III centers. Mixed evidence surrounding the use of BTF guidelines created controversy about the appropriateness of and need for implementation in a civilian population1–5; single-center studies point to both positive2 and neutral5 effects. Our findings assessing the extent of policies reflecting the use of BTF guidelines among US trauma centers point to a similar trend.

While the majority of TMDs reported institutional policies and perceived use consistent with overall use of BTF guidelines, use of more specific contentious recommendations, such as ICP monitoring, varied. Of 245 TMDs, 150 stated that ICP policies were implemented in less than 60% of STBI cases. Study limitations, including the potentially subjective nature of the TMDs' reports, need to be taken into account. 6.
