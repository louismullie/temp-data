## Question

For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I kissed my niece at the magic show. Scenario 2 | I put the matches up high where my son couldn't reach them.

Answer Choices:
A. Wrong, Wrong
B. Wrong, Not wrong
C. Not wrong, Wrong
D. Not wrong, Not wrong

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary U.S. moral standards as of 2020, and to choose among A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; or D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the moral implications of kissing a niece in a public setting. Then, I should verify whether placing matches out of a child's reach constitutes neglect or harm. Next, I will consider context, intent, and foreseeable consequences to apply a responsibility framework. Finally, I will align the conclusion with common moral intuitions and select the matching option.

> Let me first confirm the first scenario: kissing a niece at a magic show. Wait, let me verify the relational context and cultural norms. A niece is typically the daughter of one's sibling, so this is an uncle–niece or aunt–niece relationship, and a kiss in a familial, public setting is generally understood as affectionate rather than sexual or inappropriate, absent additional context suggesting otherwise. I should double-check that I'm not importing a different cultural frame; in ordinary U.S. contexts, a quick kiss on the cheek or forehead from an aunt or uncle is not considered morally wrong, and there is no indication here of coercion, secrecy, or sexual intent. Hold on, I should verify the moral responsibility conditions: foreseeability and freedom. A reasonable person would not foresee harm from a familial kiss in public, and the act is freely chosen without compulsion, so neither condition for moral wrongdoing is met in this case.

> Now, the second scenario: putting matches up high where a son cannot reach them. I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with neglect. Initially, I wondered if this could be framed as failing to secure a hazard, but wait, that would be backward; placing matches out of reach is a safety measure, not a failure. Let me reconsider: storing matches high and inaccessible reduces the risk of accidental ignition, burns, or house fires, which is precisely what ordinary moral standards and parenting norms endorse for child safety. I should confirm that this aligns with a responsibility framework: the parent is acting to prevent foreseeable harm, which is morally praiseworthy rather than wrong. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong; it is responsible caregiving.

> Next, I should review the answer choices against this analysis. Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not morally wrong, so the correct mapping is D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not missing a nuance in Scenario 1; if the kiss were described as prolonged, on the lips, secretive, or coerced, that would change the moral calculus, but none of that is present here. Similarly, if Scenario 2 had said "I left matches on the floor", that would be negligent, but it says the opposite. Given the facts as stated, D is the best fit with ordinary U.S. moral judgments.

---

The correct answer is **D. Not wrong, Not wrong**. Kissing a niece at a magic show is a normal, affectionate family gesture and is not morally wrong by ordinary U.S. standards. Likewise, putting matches out of a child's reach is a responsible safety action, not wrong. Neither scenario involves harm, coercion, or inappropriate behavior, so neither is morally wrong.

---

## Analysis of scenario 1: kissing niece at magic show

### Cultural and social context

In U.S. culture, **affectionate kisses** between family members — such as an uncle or aunt kissing a niece on the cheek or forehead — are common and socially acceptable, especially in public, family-oriented settings like a magic show. Such gestures are typically viewed as expressions of familial love and affection, not as inappropriate or morally objectionable behavior.

---

### Moral considerations

- **Consent and appropriateness**: The scenario does not indicate any lack of consent or discomfort from the niece, nor does it suggest any inappropriate intent or behavior. The kiss is described as occurring at a public magic show, implying a casual, affectionate gesture rather than anything inappropriate.

- **Harm principle**: There is no indication of harm, emotional distress, or negative consequences resulting from the kiss. By ordinary moral standards, an affectionate kiss between family members in a public setting does not constitute harm.

- **Social norms**: Ordinary moral standards in the U.S. do not consider a familial kiss in a public setting to be morally wrong. It is a common and accepted practice within families.

---

### Conclusion for scenario 1

Kissing a niece at a magic show is **not morally wrong** according to ordinary U.S. moral standards. It is a normal, affectionate family gesture that does not involve harm, coercion, or inappropriate behavior.

---

## Analysis of scenario 2: putting matches up high where son couldn't reach them

### Safety and responsibility

Putting matches out of a child's reach is a **responsible safety measure** that prevents accidental fires, burns, or other injuries. This action demonstrates foresight and care for the child's well-being, aligning with ordinary moral standards of parental responsibility and child safety.

---

### Moral considerations

- **Preventing harm**: The action directly prevents potential harm to the child, which is morally commendable. Ordinary moral standards emphasize the importance of protecting children from preventable dangers.

- **Parental responsibility**: Parents and guardians are expected to take reasonable precautions to ensure child safety. Storing matches out of reach is a standard safety practice that fulfills this responsibility.

- **Consequences**: There are no negative consequences or harm resulting from this action. Instead, it likely prevents harm, which is morally positive.

---

### Conclusion for scenario 2

Putting matches up high where a son cannot reach them is **not morally wrong**; it is a responsible, safety-conscious action that aligns with ordinary moral standards of parental care and child protection.

---

## Comparison and final answer

| **Scenario** | **Moral judgment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Kissing niece at magic show | Not wrong | - Normal familial affection <br/> - No harm or inappropriate intent |
| Putting matches out of reach | Not wrong | - Responsible safety measure <br/> - Prevents harm |

---

Both scenarios involve actions that are **morally acceptable** by ordinary U.S. standards. Neither action causes harm, violates consent, or breaches social norms. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Not wrong, Not wrong**.

### Development of a model-inference system for estimating epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [^1166qNUg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To support COVID-19 pandemic planning, we develop a model-inference system to estimate epidemiological properties of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using case and mortality data while accounting for under-ascertainment, disease seasonality, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and mass-vaccination. Applying this system to study three variants of concern, we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6% (95% CI: 32.3–54.6%) transmissibility increase but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4% (95% CI: 14.6–48.0%) transmissibility increase and 61.3% (95% CI: 42.6–85.8%) immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3% (95% CI: 30.3–65.3%) transmissibility increase and 52.5% (95% CI: 0–75.8%) immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could outcompete B.1.1.7 and lead to increased infections. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread of variants of concern, via continued preventive measures, prompt mass-vaccination, continued vaccine efficacy monitoring, and possible updating of vaccine formulations to ensure high efficacy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

Colors at the edges of the legend range can reflect values outside the range, either more ambitious than a 1.5 °C allocation or less ambitious than a 4 °C allocation. NDCs should only be considered aligned with the present allocations if earlier emissions also match the discontinuous allocation, which implies immediate support and cooperative approaches.

The effect on the countries' near-term tradeable emissions of adding a transition phase to ensure the continuity of an emissions allocation schematized in Fig. 1. As highlighted in previous studies, adding a transition period greatly influences near-term allocation through a grandfathering influence. Here we show an additional effect of continuous allocation where their updates reward inaction by closing the ambition gap between the updated equity-based allocations and an insufficient NDC (exemplified in Fig. 1).

Looking at the geography of reduction rates, Fig. 2 shows the date when allocations are half of 2020 levels based on a 1.5 °C trajectory with no or limited overshoot (C1 scenarios, excluding bunkers and LULUCF emissions; see "Methods"). Under both approaches 1 and 2, the allocations of most countries reach half of 2020-levels by 2030. The allocations of some sub-Saharan and South Asian countries remain positive over the century.

### Protecting children from tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke [^116ch7ea]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for public policy to protect children from tobacco use initiation — depictions in movies and media: Depictions of tobacco products in movies and other media that can be viewed by youth should be restricted (Evidence quality: B; Recommendation strength: strong recommendation). Depictions of smoking in the movies have been repeatedly shown to increase rates of smoking initiation among adolescents, and the 2012 Report of the Surgeon General concluded that "The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between depictions of smoking in the movies and the initiation of smoking among young people". Quantitative findings include a prospective US study reporting adjusted hazard ratios for smoking initiation of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.47–2.45), 1.91 (95% CI: 1.49–2.44), and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.52–2.67) by character valence; a European cohort of 9987 children (mean ± SD age: 13.5 ± 1.10 years) showing an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.08–1.17) for each additional 1000 occurrences of movie smoking exposure; and an Indian cross-sectional survey of 4943 adolescents reporting adjusted odds of 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3–3.9) for ever tobacco use with high versus low exposure to smoking in movies.

### Evaluating intervention strategies in controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in care homes: an agent-based model [^1142up1r]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Spread of COVID-19

In all scenarios, the mean prevalence of infected residents peaked ~30 days after the first infection in the care home, decreased, then stabilized after around ~90 days (Fig. 2 A). The distribution of prevalence at peak (mean, 34; standard deviation [SD], 4.9; range, 19–47) in the no intervention scenario is illustrated in Figure 2 B. Relatively large variations in prevalence values are due to stochastic uncertainty of interactions within the care home and disease progression.

Fig. 2.
Time series of COVID-19 prevalence among residents in care home with capacity of 80 residents across all scenarios using the base case parameters (means of 300 simulations for each scenario) (A) and distribution of the prevalence at peak for no intervention scenario (Inter0) using the base case parameters for 300 simulations (B). (Inter0: No intervention; Inter1: Reference intervention (isolation of symptomatic/confirmed residents, testing of new admissions, closed to visitors, social distancing); Inter2: Inter 1 + isolation upon admission; Inter3: Inter1 + adaptive testing strategy; Inter4: Inter3 + isolation upon admission; Inter5: Inter1 + Weekly testing for residents; Inter6: Inter1 + weekly testing for staff; Inter7: Inter1 + weekly testing for staff and residents; Inter8: Inter6 + isolation upon admission; Inter9: Inter7 + isolation upon admission).

In the absence of any control measures and spontaneous changes in the behaviors of individuals, the introduction of a single infected resident resulted in an outbreak (ie, at least 2 residents are infected) in 99.7% of simulations (299 of 300); in 1 simulation, transmission died out quickly. By the time that any infected residents manifested COVID-19 symptoms, an average of 6 residents (SD, 4.2; range, 1–23) had acquired the infection but may not (yet) have shown symptoms. Infected cases that did not (yet) display symptoms made up approximately half of all infections among residents (Fig. 3), which aligns with reported data. Additionally, the proportion of asymptomatic cases among infected residents in our study (7%; range, 4%–10%) shows a good approximation of observed data for long-term aged care (8%; range, 3%–18%). -

1At Week 52
2At Week 26
*The change from baseline to end of treatment visit in HbA1cwas analyzed using ANOVA with treatment, region, sex, and anti-diabetic treatment at screening as fixed effects, and age and baseline HbA1cas covariates.
In Study A, there were 14.8% of subjects in the TRESIBA and 11.5% Insulin glargine arms for whom data was missing at the time of the HbA1cmeasurement.
In Study B, there were 6.3% of subjects in the TRESIBA and 9.8% Insulin detemir arms for whom data was missing at the time of the HbA1cmeasurement.

Study C: TRESIBA Administered at the Same Time Each Day or at Any Time Each Day in Combination with a Rapid-Acting Insulin Analog at Mealtimes in Adult Patients

The efficacy of TRESIBA was evaluated in a 26-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in 493 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized to TRESIBA injected once-daily at the same time each day (with the main evening meal), to TRESIBA injected once daily at any time each day or to insulin glargine U-100 injected once-daily according to the approved labeling. The any time each day TRESIBA arm was designed to simulate a worst-case scenario injection schedule of alternating short and long, once daily, dosing intervals (i.e., alternating intervals of 8 to 40 hours between doses). TRESIBA in this arm was dosed in the morning on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and in the evening on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Insulin aspart was administered before each meal in all treatment arms.

### Assessing the influence of climate on wintertime SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks [^1151YuWi]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In Fig. 1 a (lower plots) we show the proportion infected over time using the climate-driven and constant R₀ values. We also vary the reporting rate of observed cases relative to modeled cases; while this accounts for under-reporting it also allows us to vary the proportion susceptible over a feasible range (see "Methods"). In the middle figure, the reporting rate is 10% (estimates for US reporting rates are < 10%), which implies a relatively small reduction in susceptibility based on case data pre-July. In this case, a small boost to transmission, driven by low specific humidity in the winter months, results in a relatively large secondary outbreak in the climate scenario. In the constant scenario, R₀ stays below 1 and there is no outbreak in the winter months. We also consider a scenario where the reporting rate is 3% (Fig. 1 a, lower plot). In this case the lower reporting rate means more cases (relative to the observed case counts) and a greater reduction in susceptibility. This results in a smaller wintertime outbreak in the climate scenario.

In Fig. 1 b we consider a scenario where NPI measures are relaxed further such that R₀ is reduced 15% below non-control values as of the last week in July. In this case R₀ > 1 for both the climate and constant scenario and case numbers begin to grow exponentially. With a 10% reporting rate a large secondary outbreak is observed in both the constant and climate scenarios (Fig. 1 b, middle plot). With a 3% reporting rate, meaning a larger depletion of susceptibles, the secondary outbreak appears much larger in the climate scenario: this supports the hypothesis that the disease will become more sensitive to climate as the susceptible proportion declines, much like the seasonal endemic diseases.

In Fig. 1 c–h we simulate model outcomes across a broad range of parameter space varying the proportion susceptible (in July) and the reduction in R₀ due to NPIs. The proportion susceptible is varied by initializing the epidemic with different sizes of the infected population (initializing with a large number results in a relatively larger outbreak and initializing with a small number results in a smaller outbreak). We vary this starting number over a feasible range given the case data, i.e. such that observed cases never exceed modeled cases or that the reporting rate never drops below 1%. Over this range, the model plausibly tracks the observed case data.

### National and subnational short-term forecasting of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland during early 2021 [^114ABLgy]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a strong interest in forecasts of the short-term development of epidemiological indicators to inform decision makers. In this study we evaluate probabilistic real-time predictions of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland for the period from January through April 2021.

Methods

We evaluate probabilistic real-time predictions of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland. These were issued by 15 different forecasting models, run by independent research teams. Moreover, we study the performance of combined ensemble forecasts. Evaluation of probabilistic forecasts is based on proper scoring rules, along with interval coverage proportions to assess calibration. The presented work is part of a pre-registered evaluation study.

Results

We find that many, though not all, models outperform a simple baseline model up to four weeks ahead for the considered targets. Ensemble methods show very good relative performance. The addressed time period is characterized by rather stable non-pharmaceutical interventions in both countries, making short-term predictions more straightforward than in previous periods. However, major trend changes in reported cases, like the rebound in cases due to the rise of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant in March 2021, prove challenging to predict.

Conclusions

Multi-model approaches can help to improve the performance of epidemiological forecasts. However, while death numbers can be predicted with some success based on current case and hospitalization data, predictability of case numbers remains low beyond quite short time horizons. Additional data sources including sequencing and mobility data, which were not extensively used in the present study, may help to improve performance.

### Development of the reproduction number from coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 case data in Germany and implications for political measures [^115ebkpQ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 6
Starting from the last state of the model in Fig. 3 a for Germany, the duration needed to achieve as few as 300 a new reported cases per day and b new infectious cases per day (outflow from exposed compartment, see Fig. 1) in whole Germany was estimated in a prospective analysis with different imposed fixed values of reproduction number R. For each setting, the results were shown for μ = 1 (black) and μ = 0.2 (red) to assess the impact of detection ratio ((1− α) μ) of the infected cases. α = 0.22 and latest hospitalization rate was used. Box plots show the 75 and 25 percentile as well as the minimum and maximum values corresponding to 100 simulations for literature-informed parameter variation (see Table 1)

### Modeling of future COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, by vaccination rates and nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios-United States, April-September 2021 [^116cX8JY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE
COVID-19 projection scenarios * — United States, March 27 – September 25, 2021

Abbreviations: M = million; NPI = nonpharmaceutical interventions; VE = vaccine effectiveness.

* **Scenarios were defined to control for uncertainty in two specific factors**: vaccination and adherence to NPIs with high/moderate and low levels for each. All scenarios included the B.1.1.7 variant and assumed that it was 50% more transmissible than previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. All other transmission and outcome assumptions were decided by the six modeling teams.

† VE is defined as vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease 2 weeks after administration, based on clinical trials. For 2-dose vaccines, the first VE represents protection 2 weeks after the 1st dose. Assumptions about effectiveness and affects on other outcomes (e.g. infection, hospitalization, and death) were left to the discretion of individual teams. Five teams assumed that VE against infection was the same as VE against symptomatic disease, and one team assumed lower VE against infection; details on model structure and assumptions are available at MIDAS Network COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. Accessed April 19, 2021.

§ Vaccine doses reflect published manufacturing capacity estimates in the high vaccination scenarios and a continuation of the pace of vaccination observed at the end of March 2021 in the low vaccination scenarios.

¶ If the maximum level of vaccination specified (e.g. 75% or 90%) was reached in a population group during the projection period, models assume that no more vaccination occurs in that group. Past reported vaccine coverage up to March 27, 2021, can exceed these levels.

In all four scenarios, COVID-19 cases were projected to increase through May 2021 at the national level because of increased prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant and decreased NPI mandates and compliance (Figure 1). A sharp decline in cases was projected by July 2021, with a faster decline in the high-vaccination scenarios. Increases in hospitalizations and deaths (Figure 1), although more moderate, were also projected. A peak of 7,000–11,100 weekly deaths nationwide was projected in May (range = 5,382–15,677, which includes the central 50% of the projected distributions for all scenarios in the ensemble). The larger increases in cases relative to hospitalizations and deaths were attributable to higher vaccination coverage among groups with higher risk for severe COVID-19.

Whole-exome sequencing data analysis strategy.

a F2 Family pedigree and segregation of the UBLCP1 variant g.158,710,261CAAAG > C: open circles and squares represent unaffected females and males, respectively; closed square represents affected male homozygous for the variant; half-filled circles and squares denote unaffected heterozygous carriers. b WES data analysis and filtering strategy used to prioritize identified variants in family F2. The workflow diagram illustrates the number of variants identified at each step (gradient) of the filtering process, assuming a homozygous recessive model of inheritance. A brief description of each step of the filtering process (steps 1–6) is shown at the left of the diagram. Briefly, after alignment and post-alignment processing and the removal of variants with missing genotype data or multiple alleles, a total number of variants was identified across sequenced exomes. Step 1 involved mining for variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤ 1% using data from the 1000 Genomes project (1000 G), Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), and Greater Middle East Variome Project (GME). Step 2 involved excluding all synonymous and UTR variants. Step 3 excluded polymorphic variants found in dbSNP. Step 4 involved selecting variants with global mean allele frequency ≤ 1% in ExAc and Iranome databases. Step 5 involved confirming by Sanger sequencing the genotypes in all family members, and keeping variants with proper segregation within the family. Step 6 relied on genotyping of candidate variants in a local database consisting of 100 Lebanese controls and keeping variants with an MAF ≤ 1%. Steps 1–6 led to prioritization of the variant in the candidate gene UBLCP1.

Behavioral results — PE directly determines the degree of learning from feedback and adoption of false memories. a Subsequent accuracy in the recall study. For incorrectly answered Test1 questions (green), the greater the PE elicited by feedback, the more likely it was for that information to be incorporated into memory, as shown by average Test2 accuracy (left). Similarly, for correct Test1 answers (blue), false-feedback information was more likely to supplant an accurate memory recalled with medium confidence (medium PE) relative to one recalled with low confidence (low PE), as shown by the average percentage of false-feedback answers subsequently supplied in Test2 (right). b Subsequent confidence of updated memories in the recall study. PE also determined the confidence expressed in correct Test2 recollections, for questions initially answered erroneously in Test1. Thus, when successfully learning from feedback, incorrect Test1 answers stated with high confidence (high PE feedback) were associated with high-confidence correct answers in Test2 and vice versa (average Test2 confidence for incorrect-to-correct answers on the left). Similarly, for the subset of questions answered correctly and supplanted with false feedback, average Test2 confidence in the false memory was greater when initial confidence in the correct answer was higher (medium vs. low PE, on the right). c Summary of behavioral results in the recognition fMRI study. A strong positive relationship was observed between the degree of overall memory updating and PE arising from feedback, for questions answered incorrectly in Test1. This measure of learning combines both subsequent accuracy and confidence (see Supplementary Figure 3 for separate measures). Error bars represent SEM

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment in five randomized controlled STEP trials [^117DuL5T]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Treatment intensity changes from randomization to end of treatment in the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1, 3, 6, and 8 and STEP 2 and 6 pools in participants treated with (A, B) antihypertensives and (C, D) lipid‐lowering medications at randomization.

In both the STEP 1, 3, 6, and 8 and STEP 2 and 6 pools, treatment intensity was monitored from randomization to end of treatment in participants treated with lipid‐lowering medications at randomization (Figure 1C, D). A majority of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo groups continued lipid‐lowering treatment from randomization to week 68 (STEP 1, 3, 6, and 8: 89.9% and 95.5%, respectively; STEP 2 and 6: 89.5% and 94.6%, respectively). The semaglutide 2.4 mg group had a higher proportion of participants who discontinued all lipid‐lowering medications compared with the placebo groups (STEP 1, 3, 6, and 8: 10.1% and 4.5%, respectively; STEP 2 and 6: 10.1% and 5.4%, respectively). In the STEP 1, 3, 6, and 8 pool, a similar proportion of participants underwent a treatment intensity reduction (4.0% and 3.9% for semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, respectively), and a smaller proportion of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group underwent a lipid‐lowering treatment intensification compared with the placebo groups (2.1% and 9.7%, respectively). In the STEP 2 and 6 pool, a larger proportion of participants continuing lipid‐lowering medications had a treatment intensity reduction in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group versus the placebo groups (4.6% and 0.9%, respectively); however, treatment intensification was similar between both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo groups (2.9% and 4.5%, respectively) by week 68. Most participants continuing lipid‐lowering treatment at week 68 had no change in treatment intensity.

### Potential impact of 5 years of ivermectin mass drug administration on malaria outcomes in high burden countries [^114McHWU]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Economic impact and CER

Figure 2B shows the cumulative averted financial costs due to iMDA under three uptake levels. Since the treatment cost of a severe episode is about 10 times higher than that of an uncomplicated episode, the averted costs not only depend on the efficacy of ivermectin but also on the proportion of severe cases. Under the 'Conservative' uptake level, the cumulative averted treatment costs can range from US$108 million at 2020 (in 'Innovative' scenario, efficacy 20% and severity 1%) to US$556 million (in 'Sustain' scenario, efficacy 40% and severity 3%) across all nine countries. The figure shows that the simulated averted costs are most sensitive to the assumption of efficacy but quite robust to different severity proportions.

Following a similar pattern, the cumulative averted costs under 'Rapid' uptake range from US$241 million to US$1.27 billion, which are more than twice of the averted costs in the 'Conservative' uptake scenario. Under 'National', the averted costs are slightly higher compared with the costs under the 'Rapid' uptake, that is, from US$255 million up to US$1.38 billion.

Table 2 shows the overall gross and net costs of implementing the iMDA in these nine countries for the period from 2023 to 2027, as well as CERs calculated based on averted cases and deaths. Although there are a total of 60 scenarios in the full-factorial design (online supplemental file S1), only 18 selected scenarios are presented in this table. According to a geospatial modelling estimated by WHO, the current COVID-19 pandemic is a top evolving risk to increase malaria cases and deaths for the year 2020 because of potential delaying or interrupting treatments and intervention programmes. Therefore, the selected scenarios of 'Sustain', 'No change' and 'Accelerate 1' are more likely to reflect the possible current paths than the scenarios of 'Accelerate 2' and 'Innovate'. As results do not change significantly with severity proportions, we use 3% severity for the main set of results. Similar results based on 1% severity can be found in online supplemental tables A-C in S1 file.

### Does egg donation for mitochondrial replacement techniques generate parental responsibilities? [^116kFoZz]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Candidate parenthood

Giuliana Fuscaldo has proposed an amended causal account of parenthood that she calls 'candidate parenthood'. According to her, 'an account of how moral responsibility for children is generated should be consistent with at least the standard views about causation, consequences and moral responsibility'. Such an account seems reasonable as it is true that we are not morally responsible for everything we are causally connected to.

There are two commonly accepted conditions for establishing moral responsibility: foreseeability and freedom. Freedom: 'we are not responsible for actions that are unavoidable, or in situations where we are not free to do otherwise'. Foreseeability: we can be held accountable for the consequences of our actions 'if a reasonable person would have reason to expect that they might occur'. But, what does 'free' mean and who is a 'reasonable person'? Fuscaldo asserts that for an action to be free either an agent could have done otherwise or, if no alternative was possible, she reflectively sanctioned or appropriated her actions. Defining who is a reasonable person, on the other hand, is more complicated and would divert us from the present discussion. Nonetheless, we can confidently assert that all reasonable people understand a) that the creation of a child might be a consequence of us providing gametes for a reproductive endeavour and that b) a child might be created by an heterosexual couple having unprotected vaginal sex. At this point, we can assert that: ' we are morally accountable for the intended and unintended reasonably foreseeable consequences of our free actions '. When we apply these two conditions of moral responsibility to reproductive scenarios, we have what Fuscaldo calls candidate parenthood: 'any (free) action that reasonably foreseeably results in the birth of a child generates responsibilities for that child'. On this account, 'standard' gamete donation, where there is informed consent, generates parental responsibilities. It does so in that the creation of a child is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the donation of sperm or eggs.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113DKC3A]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Balance recovery stepping responses during walking were not affected by a concurrent cognitive task among older adults [^111gEwti]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 347 perturbation trials were performed in this study. One hundred and fifty-nine trials in the PwST condition and 188 in the PwDT condition. During PwDT trials, participants achieved significantly higher perturbation magnitudes (p = 0.036, Fig. 1 A); in our Bayesian hypothesis testing analysis however, we found only weak evidence (BF 10 = 2.846, see Table 1). In addition, no significant differences were found in single-step or multiple-step thresholds between PwST and PwDT conditions (Fig. 1 A; p = 0.56, BF 10 = 0.305; and p = 0.78, BF 10 = 0.265; respectively, see Table 1 for BF description). We also compared the number of foot-collisions and multiple-step events between the PwST and PwDT conditions; here too, there were no significant differences (Fig. 1 B; p = 0.56, BF 10 = 0.283; and p = 0.26, BF 10 = 0.441; respectively, see Table 1 for BF description). Of note, there was no difference in overall incidence of stepping responses (single and multiple steps responses) between PwST and PwDT conditions as well (χ² [df = 1] = 0.757, p = 0.384; BF 10 = 0.114 see Table 1 for BF description).

### Step-by-step state-selective tracking of fragmentation dynamics of water dications by momentum imaging [^1154NawF]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The double photoionization of a molecule by one photon ejects two electrons and typically creates an unstable dication. Observing the subsequent fragmentation products in coincidence can reveal a surprisingly detailed picture of the dynamics. Determining the time evolution and quantum mechanical states involved leads to deeper understanding of molecular dynamics. Here in a combined experimental and theoretical study, we unambiguously separate the sequential breakup via D⁺ + OD⁺ intermediates, from other processes leading to the same D⁺ + D⁺ + O final products of double ionization of water by a single photon. Moreover, we experimentally identify, separate, and follow step by step, two pathways involving the b ¹Σ⁺ and a ¹Δ electronic states of the intermediate OD⁺ ion. Our classical trajectory calculations on the relevant potential energy surfaces reproduce well the measured data and, combined with the experiment, enable the determination of the internal energy and angular momentum distribution of the OD⁺ intermediate.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^112ZrCUP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Puzzle of Missing Values

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples are made by subjects who may inadvertently skip over some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects would prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong than missing answers. Sometimes, some items are reserved to some respondents, for example, those who attempted in the past a given activity or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers are found, the easiest and most practiced solution would be to transform scores into the percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and totals seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's "total score" is 87.5% (7/8). Note that this procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" procedure, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the (strong and unlikely) assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it seems that subject A's missing response should be given a higher score estimate, given that the subject passed five more difficult items. In contrast, subject B failed three items easier than the missed one. It is doubtful that subject C deserves a lower score than subject B: he/she passed four items more difficult than the missed items.

TABLE 2
Estimation of missing values, based on average scores across answered items

Presumably, subjects A and C were careless in their answers or had not enough time to complete the test.

This example is intentionally simplistic. The treatment of missing data is a complex research field, faced by the whole field of statistics. As far as psychometric statistics is concerned, RA provides a satisfactory answer to this problem.

### Relative importance of step count, intensity, and duration on physical activity's impact on vascular structure and function in previously sedentary older adults [^117H5SqT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in Endothelial Function Based on (1) 10 000 Steps/Day Threshold and (2) 30 Min/Day MPA Average

Twenty‐nine subjects reached ≥ 10 000 steps/day by the end of the study protocol. As shown in Figure 3 A¸ step count increased to a significantly greater extent in the group that achieved a ≥ 10 000 steps/day average compared with those who did not meet this goal (4803 ± 1531 to 5741 ± 2111 steps versus 6069 ± 1371 to 12486 ± 1947 steps, P < 0.001 overall, P < 0.001 time×group interaction, P < 0.001 between groups at week 12). Similarly, the 46 subjects who achieved ≥ 30 min/day of MPA by week 12 also significantly increased their step count over the study period while those who did not achieve this goal did not reach 10 000 steps (4825 ± 1604 to 5327 ± 2671 steps versus 5570 ± 1517 to 10196 ± 3149, P < 0.001 overall, P < 0.001 time×group interaction, P < 0.001 between groups at week 12, Figure 3 B). There was no interaction between FMD% changes over time and achieving either ≥ 10 000 steps/day or ≥ 30 min/day of MPA (P = 0.40 and 0.93 for time×group interaction terms for ≥ 10 000 steps/day and ≥ 30 min/day, respectively Figures 3 C and 3 D).

### Evaluation of the US COVID-19 scenario modeling hub for informing pandemic response under uncertainty [^1162z5Zq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In each round, 4–9 modeling teams provided 12 to 52 weeks (depending on the round's goals) of probabilistic projections for each scenario for weekly cases, hospitalizations, and deaths at the state and national level. Projections were aggregated using the linear opinion pool method, which preserves variation between model projections. Open calls for projections have yielded participation from thirteen teams overall, with some teams providing projections only for certain rounds or states.

To assess the performance and added value of this large effort we compared SMH projections to real world epidemic trajectories. Whether scenario projections accurately matched those trajectories depends on both how well scenario definitions matched reality, and the calibration of the projections made conditional on those scenarios. Here we attempt to evaluate SMH performance on both criteria (Fig. 2), while acknowledging that there may be complementary evaluations more specific to the many ways SMH projections were used, ranging from informing national vaccine recommendations, to planning for future COVID-19 surges. We present performance results summarized across all SMH rounds, then synthesize these results to discuss performance of SMH projections across different phases of the pandemic.

Fig. 2
COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) process.

(top) Prospective SMH process: The SMH coordination team takes input from public health partners on key questions to design scenarios. Scenarios have a 2 × 2 structure (with the exception of Round 1), where two levels are specified along each of two axes of uncertainty or interventions, and all four combinations of these possibilities are considered (scenarios A-D). Scenarios are refined in discussion with modeling teams, after which teams each fit their model and make projections independently. Then, after quality checks, individual model projections are aggregated using linear opinion pool (i.e. probability averaging), and in discussion with the teams, key messages are determined. A report is shared with public health partners and projections are released on the public SMH website. (bottom) Retrospective evaluation: Evaluating the SMH effort involves comparing SMH scenario assumptions to reality, and comparing SMH projections to observations. Comparing scenarios to reality is used to identify the most plausible scenario-weeks, namely the set of "plausible" scenarios in projection weeks where scenario specifications about variants did not diverge from actual variant prevalence. Horizontal dotted lines represent emergence of an unanticipated variant.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^114QL1eK]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hourly step counts

The three peaks in the mean step count on weekdays were associated with these time periods: (i) 7–9 a.m.: 1230 steps (SD = 1420), (ii) 12–2 p.m.: 1300 steps (SD = 1260), and (iii) 6–8 p.m.: 1610 steps (SD = 1730) (Fig. 1b). The mean step count during these three periods was 4140 steps (SD = 2800). The two peaks in the mean step count on weekends were associated with these time periods: (i) 9–11 a.m.: 1320 steps (SD = 1790) and 5–7 p.m.: 1310 steps (SD = 1650). The mean step count during these two periods was 2620 steps (SD = 2460). For weekdays and weekends, the proportion of zero step counts peaked from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. and was the lowest from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. (Fig. 1c). A higher proportion of zero step counts was associated with the weekends (51.2%) compared to weekdays (45.1%). For participants aged between 30 and 59, the three peaks in the mean step count on weekdays were associated with going to work (7–9 a.m.), lunch (12–2 p.m.) and returning from work (6–8 p.m.) (Fig. 1e). On weekdays, participants aged 60 and above were associated with a slightly later peak in the morning (8–10 a.m.) and a smaller peak over lunch (12–2 p.m.) and late evening (6–8 p.m.). Overall, on weekdays, participants aged 60 and above were associated with higher hourly mean step counts compared to participants aged 30–59 from the start of the day till 6 p.m. after which the latter group was associated with higher hourly mean step counts from leaving work. Participants aged 60 and above were associated with a lower hourly proportion of zero step counts compared to participants aged 30–59 from the start of the day till the evening (Fig. 1f). Overall, the cumulative hourly step counts trajectory exhibited high variability; on weekends, there were later starts and fewer mean step counts after 7 p.m. (Supplementary Fig. S3).

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^117QKA1h]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Scenario 3 — moderate to severe features consistent with COVID-19 and high pre-test probability in resource-constrained settings — directs management based on rapid test availability. When a rapid COVID-19 test is available and positive, imaging is indicated with the note "Imaging Indicated * (CXR may be preferred)"; if the rapid test is negative, clinicians should "Monitor for worsening respiratory status", proceeding to "Imaging Indicated" when present and "Continued monitoring" when absent. If a rapid test is not available, "Imaging Indicated" with subsequent pathways including "Per Existing Guidelines" or, when "Alt Dx not suggested or features of COVID-19", proceeding to "Medical Triage" for "Decisions on disposition (monitoring environment), infection control, and management (positioning, ventilator)". The figure clarifies that moderate-to-severe features are "evidence of significant pulmonary dysfunction or damage", that high pretest probability reflects "high background prevalence of disease associated with community transmission", that the rapid test is "a point-of-care test with a turnaround time of less than 1 hour", and that the starred imaging step is "Lower priority if severely resource constrained, relative to question 10 or 11".

### Effectiveness of four dynamic treatment strategies in patients with anticitrullinated protein antibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis: a randomised trial [^111N5UzL]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

The second treatment step was taken in 46/84 patients: switching to (in strategy arm 1) or adding (in strategy arm 2) SSA. In 9/46 patients (20%), a DAS ≤ 2.4 was achieved by this step (figure 2 B). Failure on SSA therapy occurred in 33/46 patients because of a DAS > 2.4, and in 4/46 patients because of an AE (skin/mucous, infection, nausea and malaise).

In total, 35/84 patients continued to the third treatment step during 2 years of follow-up: switching to leflunomide monotherapy (in strategy arm 1) or adding hydroxychloroquine to MTX and SSA (in strategy arm 2). In 9/35 patients (26%), a DAS ≤ 2.4 was achieved (figure 2 C). During 2 years of follow-up, 21/35 patients (60%) continued to the next treatment step due to a DAS > 2.4. Five patients failed due to an AE (3 times gastrointestinal, malaise and skin/mucous). DAS-components that contributed to failure due to DAS > 2.4 per treatment step are shown in online supplementary table S4.

After 1 year, 7/40 patients (18%) in strategy arm 1 continued to combination therapy (MTX and infliximab). During year 2, two additional patients continued to combination therapy. In strategy arm 2, 24/45 patients (53%) used combination therapy (MTX and SSA, step 3 in the study protocol) at the end of year 1. During year 2, only one more patient failed on monotherapy and continued to combination therapy. The difference in percentages of patients in combination therapy between strategy arms 1 and 2 can be explained by the design of the protocol: in strategy arm 1, the first option to receive combination therapy was the 3rd step after initial MTX treatment, while it was already the 2nd step in strategy arm 2.

### Recommendations for measuring pulmonary nodules at CT: a statement from the Fleischner society [^116khpDi]. Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fleischner Society recommendations — measurement of the size of pulmonary nodules at computed tomography (CT) emphasize that accurate measurement is crucial to determine the risk for malignancy at baseline CT, to correctly allocate patients with nodules to available management algorithms, and to detect any change in size on follow-up CT images, and will mainly focus on manual diameter measurements, which are the most widely used technique. Size and growth can be determined by measuring diameter or volume; measurement of the nodule diameter with electronic calipers is currently the most widely used routine clinical approach, whereas volumetric nodule determination typically requires specialized software and is currently not widely used in routine clinical practice. The recommendations are organized around specific questions that are often raised in clinical practice and are presented together with corresponding answers, and they describe technical factors — such as section thickness, reconstruction algorithms, and display window settings — that affect measurements, along with observer-related factors and the variability introduced when serial follow-up examinations are performed with different CT units, different radiologists, and different technical acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The evidence grades for the recommendations are based on those developed by the American College of Chest Physicians.

Colonoscopy surveillance risks after baseline neoplasia — Table 6 findings — report relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), and follow-up rates of advanced adenoma (AA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) across studies. A meta-analysis shows baseline RR increases for ≥ 3 vs 1–2 adenomas, 2.52; villous vs tubular adenoma (TA), 1.26; adenoma > 10 mm vs ≤ 10 mm, 1.39; and high-grade dysplasia vs low-grade dysplasia, 1.84. Cohorts report AA at 5 years of 6.1% for 1–2 TA ≤ 10 mm and 15.9% for ≥ 3 adenomas, while pooled data note baseline ORs including size > 10 mm, 1.56 and ≥ 3 adenomas, 1.32. Additional cohorts show AA rates at follow-up such as LRA 5 y (n = 77), 5.2% versus HRA 5 y (n = 23), 26.1%, and LRA (n = 671), 2.4% versus HRA (n = 539), 12.2%.

### Recommendations for tumor mutational burden assay validation and reporting: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, college of American pathologists, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer [^1172GEwS]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Tumor mutational burden (TMB) — definition, clinical associations, and need for standardization — is defined as the total number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase (Mb) of coding DNA sequenced and has been associated with a higher rate of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment response and longer survival in multiple cancer types. Currently, there exists variation in how TMB is calculated, reported, and interpreted, and there is no established standard for interpreting TMB values, including what values should be considered high or actionable and whether cutoffs should depend on tumor type, therapy, or assay. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with TMB ≥ 10 mutations/Mb in 2020, standardization of TMB is expected to benefit clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories and should facilitate its implementation into routine clinical use; to date, PD-L1 protein expression, microsatellite instability/defective mismatch repair, and TMB have been approved as predictive biomarkers for ICIs in patients with cancer.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^112YGUax]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

### Number unnecessarily treated in relation to harm: a concept physicians and patients need to understand [^111WWC62]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Physicians are legally and ethically compelled to present their patients with available evidence on the potentially beneficial and harmful effects of a proposed medical or surgical treatment. This, however, is only half the story. It does not offer the patient a clear view of the pros and cons of one treatment option versus another, or even versus no treatment at all. Explicitly stating the number of patients who will not benefit from the proposed treatment, in combination with the risk of a complication, may better inform patients and help them determine and express their treatment preference. This may also help standardize the informed consent procedure.

Study risk of bias assessment

Item 11. Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and, if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process

Explanation: Users of reviews need to know the risk of bias in the included studies to appropriately interpret the evidence. Numerous tools have been developed to assess study limitations for various designs. However, many tools have been criticised because of their content (which may extend beyond assessing study limitations that have the potential to bias findings) and the way in which the items are combined (such as scales where items are combined to yield a numerical score) (see box 4). Reporting details of the selected tool enables readers to assess whether the tool focuses solely on items that have the potential to bias findings. Reporting details of how studies were assessed (such as by one or two authors) allows readers to assess the potential for errors in the assessments. Reporting how risk of bias assessments were incorporated into the analysis is addressed in Items #13e and #13f.

Box 4
Assessment of risk of bias in studies and bias due to missing results

Essential elements

Specify the tool(s) (and version) used to assess risk of bias in the included studies.
Specify the methodological domains/components/items of the risk of bias tool(s) used.
Report whether an overall risk of bias judgment that summarised across domains/components/items was made, and if so, what rules were used to reach an overall judgment.
If any adaptations to an existing tool to assess risk of bias in studies were made (such as omitting or modifying items), specify the adaptations.
If a new risk of bias tool was developed for use in the review, describe the content of the tool and make it publicly accessible.
Report how many reviewers assessed risk of bias in each study, whether multiple reviewers worked independently (such as assessments performed by one reviewer and checked by another), and any processes used to resolve disagreements between assessors.
Report any processes used to obtain or confirm relevant information from study investigators.
If an automation tool was used to assess risk of bias in studies, report how the automation tool was used (such as machine learning models to extract sentences from articles relevant to risk of bias), how the tool was trained, and details on the tool's performance and internal validation.

Results

Study participant characteristics

A total of 3,171 male and female participants were included in the STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials; please refer to the published papers for full details. Of these, 1,956 participants (STEP 1, n = 1,311; STEP 2, n = 645) consented to aptamer-based proteomic analyses using SomaScan® assay v4.1 (SomaLogic) (Fig. 1). This assay uses 7,289 aptamers to measure the relative abundance of ~6,400 unique human proteins. After filtering for sample availability at both timepoints, individuals not on treatment at study end in both arms and vendor quality control, 1,728 participants (STEP 1, n = 1,133; STEP 2, n = 595) remained. For the majority of the analyses, only the placebo and semaglutide 2.4 mg arms from the STEP 2 trial were analyzed (n = 395). Baseline characteristics of consenting participants are shown in Table 1 and were similar to those of the overall study populations of the STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials. Similarly, a post hoc analysis of changes in weight, waist circumference and HbA 1c for this subset of participants is shown in Supplementary Table 1.

### A plant-by-plant strategy for high-ambition coal power phaseout in China [^117F8a2o]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For the new "Beyond 2010" vintage, we exogenously specify the 2015 vintage to the historical values, and 2020 vintages to those currently under construction. We assume the 2015 generation values to hold true for 2020 for power plants that were operating between 2011 and 2015. We calculate projected generation from power plants that started operation (or were expected to do so in the case of dates beyond 2018) between 2016 and 2020. We add the two values to obtain an expected "Beyond 2010" vintage 2020 generation value for each province.

For 2020, total coal power generation is matched with 2018 data. Since the model runs at a five-year interval, we use 2018 generation data to approximate the trend between 2015 and 2020. Starting in the next model period of 2025, the model finds the most cost-effective pathways to achieve the 1.5 °C or 2 °C climate targets through a global carbon price. When converting to the coal plants retirement pathways (GW), our baseline value is based on the plant-level data up to May 2019, and we used a linear interpolation between the 2019 data and the first model period in 2025, and between all model periods thereafter, to calculate the annual retirement pathways.

Our scenario shows that both global and China's net CO₂ emissions peak around 2020, and then China reaches net-zero emissions by 2055 under 1.5 °C and by 2070 under 2 °C, while the world reaches net-zero carbon five years earlier under each target (Fig. 5a, b). This is associated with global and China conventional coal power generation also peaking in 2020, and being phased out around 2040 and 2050, under 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively (Fig. 5c, d). China's total power generation will increase to about 12,500 TWh under 2 °C and to about 14,500 TWh under 1.5 °C by 2050, mainly supplied by solar and other renewable energies (Fig. 5c).

### Assessment of chatGPT's performance on neurology written board examination questions [^117MhycG]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Figure 1
Neurology question stems. (A) Example of a question input followed by a correct answer response from the ChatGPT. (B) Example of a question input followed by an incorrect answer response from the AI (the correct answer is B). AI, artificial intelligence.

As question stems are multiple choice and accompanied by lettered options (eg, answer A, B, C, etc), if ChatGPT provided a written answer without referencing a specific alphabetic answer choice, the answer was read in full to determine if it was reflective of any of the multiple-choice options and scored accordingly. As these are multiple-choice questions, ChatGPT was asked to provide a single best answer.

Image-based questions from the question bank were deemed ineligible and not included in the assessment as ChatGPT only accepts text input.

The percentage of questions correctly answered was compiled and compared with an expected percentage of correct answers. For each question, BV provides a summary of the percentage of learners who answered that specific question correctly. The expected percentage was the average of the percentage of learners (neurology residents) who correctly answered each question averaged over all eligible questions. The expected number of correct answers by learners was calculated by multiplying the expected percentage of correct answers by the number of eligible questions. BV does not report the experience level of the neurology residents answering that specific question (ie, Post Graduate Year).

The overall performance percentile of ChatGPT's first attempt was calculated by the question bank, as compared with other BV learners, and recorded. The percentages of questions correctly answered by ChatGPT on the first attempt and over three attempts were compared with the performance quartiles as provided by BV. Percentages correct were also compiled by subject matter (ie, neuro-oncology, critical care, etc). This analysis aimed to provide an alternate way to compare ChatGPT's performance in relation to other learners using the question bank.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^112J6Lfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

### Improvement of both fasting and postprandial glycemic control by the two-step addition of miglitol and mitiglinide to basal insulin therapy: a pilot study [^112tTggk]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

At STEP 0, the 7-point glucose monitoring values exhibited sustained levels of post-breakfast hyperglycemia. With the administration of miglitol, the 7-point glucose monitoring values from after breakfast until after dinner were suppressed, but the values before sleep and before breakfast did not decrease significantly (Figure 3 A). When the glycemic profiles were examined more precisely using CGM, the 24-h AUC and each of the 4-h postprandial AUC values were significantly decreased. The AUC from 0:00 AM to 8:00 AM (from evening until before breakfast) remained unchanged at the STEP1 evaluation after the addition of miglitol, compared with the values at STEP0 (Figure 3 B).

Normal BP (< 120/80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 1 y, while elevated BP (120–129/ < 80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 3–6 mo. Stage 1 Hypertension (130–139/80–89 mm Hg) begins with lifestyle therapy and reassess in 3–6 mo, then proceeds to the decision nodes "Stage 1 Hypertension? (130–139/80–89 mm Hg)" and "DM, CKD or increased short-term risk of CVD (10-year PREVENT risk ≥ 7.5%)?"; if yes, the pathway specifies BP-lowering medication AND reassess in 1 mo, followed by "BP goal met?" with "YES" leading to reassess in 3–6 mo and "NO" prompting to consider intensification of therapy while optimizing adherence. Stage 2 Hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) is displayed with lifestyle therapy, a left-hand directive states "Promote Lifestyle Therapy at All Thresholds", and the legend lists recommendation categories COR 1, COR 2a, COR 2b, COR 3: No Benefit, and COR 3: Harm; the figure notes it is "Based on the PREVENT calculator".

### Rationale and design of the phase 3a development programme (ONWARDS 1–6 trials) investigating once-weekly insulin icodec in diabetes [^1122vnRB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Trials in insulin‐naive people with

For ONWARDS 1, 3 and 5, only individuals who are insulin‐naive are eligible for inclusion (Table 1). These trials represent individuals with T2D who have inadequate glycaemic control with their current non‐insulin glucose‐lowering agents (including glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists) and are therefore eligible to begin insulin.

2.2.1 ONWARDS 1

ONWARDS 1 (NCT04460885) is a treat‐to‐target trial, in which participants are randomized to treatment with once‐weekly icodec or once‐daily glargine U100, both in combination with non‐insulin glucose‐lowering drugs. Participants may continue such pretrial non‐insulin background drugs, except for sulphonylureas and glinides, which are discontinued at randomization (Table 1).

With 78 weeks of randomized treatment, ONWARDS 1 will have the longest randomized treatment period of all the ONWARDS trials. The effect of icodec will be evaluated after a 52‐week main phase followed by a 26‐week extension phase to evaluate efficacy and long‐term safety (Figure 1A).

2.2.2 ONWARDS 3

In the ONWARDS 3 (NCT04795531) double‐blinded, double‐dummy, treat‐to‐target trial, participants are randomized to receive once‐weekly icodec or once‐daily insulin degludec (degludec), both in combination with non‐insulin glucose‐lowering agents (with appropriate placebos administered in both treatment arms) for 26 weeks. Participants can continue treatment with these pretrial medications; however, sulphonylureas or glinides will be administered at a reduced (50%) dose at the discretion of the investigator (Table 1; Figure 1B).

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^111jTy5V]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^112nawWS]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

### Updated preparedness and response framework for influenza pandemics [^113zG7Am]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

CDC intervals for a novel influenza A virus pandemic — state/local and federal indicators, decisions, and actions are presented as example-driven guidance across response intervals; specific decisions and actions might be triggered as jurisdictions move between intervals, and actions begun during one interval should be continued and enhanced during subsequent intervals. The tables are not meant to be prescriptive or comprehensive but provide examples of priority issues for each interval, and planning for many actions should be part of ongoing pandemic preparedness programs at the federal, state, and local levels. Existing pandemic plans should be reviewed, updated, and adapted to fit the emerging threat, assumptions and actions should be continuously reassessed as the pandemic progresses, and the circumstances of each situation dictate the timing of decisions and actions.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112uwgAT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Global land and carbon consequences of mass timber products [^116PqhFw]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Supply of sawtimber for mass timber products

Figure 2 shows the global sawtimber supply for CLT in the three scenarios. The annual global wood supply for CLT in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 reaches about 300 million m 3 (around 9% of total wood supply for traditional wood products, see Supplementary Table 1) by 2100, whereas the high demand scenario reaches 634 million m 3 (19% of total wood supply for traditional wood products, see Supplementary Table 1). Because CLT likely will come from softwoods, GTM predicts CLT will likely be made from wood that comes from three regions: Western Europe, the United States, and Brazil (Fig. 2). These regions together produce more than 60% of the traditional global wood supply in the baseline scenario. It is cost-effective for these regions to switch a portion of their production from traditional wood products to CLT. The United States and Brazil are also predicted to plant trees for CLT. When there is a rapid, immediate increase in demand, the early wood supply for CLT comes from existing trees in Western Europe and the Rest of the World. For example, in Scenario 3 with high CLT demand and fast adoption, Western Europe supplies 43.0%–66.2% of wood for CLT from 2020 to 2100. But in Scenario 2, the wood supply for CLT from Western Europe decreases from 54.0% in 2060 to 11.6% in 2100.

Step 1A adds noninsulin options ("GLP-1 RA, SGLT2 inhibitor, or DPP-4 inhibitor") with the caveat "If glucose goals remain unmet, add prandial insulin". Step 1B uses prandial insulin, with "Prandial insulin analogs preferred over (NPH + regular insulin) or premixed insulin", and an initial "TDD 0.3 to 0.5 units/kg (50% basal; 50% prandial)". Step 2 advises, "Titrate insulin every 2–3 days", using a fixed regimen to "Increase TDD by 2 units/d", or an adjustable regimen: "Elevated fasting BG Increase HS basal doses", "Elevated midday meal BG Increase breakfast prandial insulin doses", "Elevated pre-evening meal BG Increase midday prandial insulin dose", and "Elevated bedtime BG Increase dinner prandial insulin dose", with "Increase dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of BG elevation"; for premixed insulin, "FBG/premeal BG > 180 mg/dL Increase AM or PM dose depending on times of BG elevation" and "Increase dose by 10% to 20%". Step 3 (hypoglycemia) adjusts down: "Low fasting BG Reduce HS basal dose" with "Decrease dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of hypoglycemia", plus "Low midday meal BG Reduce breakfast prandial dose", "Low pre-evening meal BG Reduce midday prandial dose", and "Low bedtime BG Reduce evening prandial dose"; for premixed insulin, "Low BGs in AM or PM Reduce AM or PM dose" with "Reduce dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of BG reduction". For most persons with T2D taking insulin, glycemic targets are stated as "A1C < 7% and fasting and premeal blood glucose < 110 mg/dL, in the absence of hypoglycemia".

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".
