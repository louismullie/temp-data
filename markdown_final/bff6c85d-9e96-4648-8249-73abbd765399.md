## Question

Why are there differences in HTN treatment for black people versus non-black people? What is the difference physiologically?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why hypertension treatment differs for Black versus non-Black patients and what physiological differences explain these treatment differences. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence that drives guideline recommendations. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed to explain differential drug responses. Next, I will examine the magnitude and clinical significance of observed differences. After that, I need to check the limitations and controversies, including overlap within groups and the role of social determinants. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations and note important exceptions where ACE inhibitors or ARBs are still indicated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical evidence base that shaped recommendations. Multiple meta-analyses show that Black adults have a smaller average blood pressure reduction with ACE inhibitor monotherapy than White adults, on the order of roughly 4–5 mm Hg less systolic and about 2–3 mm Hg less diastolic, which is clinically meaningful at the population level [^111vxmje] [^1131p2ZY]. Hold on, I should verify whether this translates into outcomes; in ALLHAT, stroke risk was higher with lisinopril versus chlorthalidone in Black participants, whereas amlodipine performed comparably to chlorthalidone, supporting the preference for thiazide-type diuretics or calcium channel blockers as initial therapy in Black adults without compelling indications for RAS blockade [^113g8vUN]. I also need to check guideline alignment; JNC 8 explicitly recommends a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB as initial therapy in Black patients, including those with diabetes, absent other compelling indications, and the 2017 ACC/AHA/KDIGO commentary reiterates this approach while emphasizing combination therapy to reach targets [^115CjvEw] [^115grVaK]. The 2024 ESC guidance similarly suggests considering initial combination therapy including a CCB in Black patients from Sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting the same pathophysiologic signal [^1115n7eo].

> Now, I will examine the proposed physiological differences. Wait, let me verify the low-renin phenotype. Yes, Black individuals more often exhibit low plasma renin activity, consistent with a volume-expanded, salt-sensitive hypertension that responds less to RAS blockade and beta-blockers, which depend on renin-angiotensin modulation for full efficacy [^1175BynX] [^115NXkST]. I should double-check salt sensitivity. Controlled studies show greater blood pressure rises with sodium loading and larger falls with sodium restriction in Black participants, supporting a salt-sensitive physiology that aligns with better responses to diuretics and calcium channel blockers [^116wnc72] [^115yqXT1]. But wait, what if other pathways are involved? Emerging data suggest lower natriuretic peptide concentrations in Black individuals, which could impair natriuresis and vasodilation, and mechanistic hypotheses implicate reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and higher creatine kinase activity, both plausibly diminishing responses to ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers while preserving responses to diuretics and calcium channel blockers [^112DCQKu] [^117TbLMK].

> Next, I should review the magnitude and clinical significance of these differences. A 4–5 mm Hg difference in systolic response with ACE inhibitor monotherapy corresponds to an approximately 8–20% difference in cardiovascular risk reduction at the population level, which is why guidelines historically deprioritized ACE inhibitor monotherapy in uncomplicated Black hypertensive patients without other compelling indications [^111vxmje] [^1131p2ZY]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure we distinguish monotherapy from combination therapy, because when ACE inhibitors are combined with thiazides or calcium channel blockers, the attenuated monotherapy response is overcome and outcomes improve, which is why modern guidance emphasizes early combination therapy, especially in Black patients who often require multiple agents to reach targets [^115grVaK] [^116sCT5N].

> I will now examine limitations and controversies. Hmm, wait a minute, the distributions of blood pressure response overlap substantially between racial groups, with most individuals of any race showing similar responses; only a minority deviates in the direction of the group average, so race alone is an imprecise proxy for individual drug response [^113kECtj]. I should confirm whether renin status reliably predicts response; pre-treatment renin activity correlates poorly with blood pressure response, and adjusting for individual characteristics attenuates apparent racial differences, underscoring that within-group variation is large and that race is a social construct with imperfect biological mapping [^1175BynX] [^116L327H]. Let me reconsider the role of social determinants; disparities in control persist despite similar treatment rates, driven by therapeutic inertia, missed visits, and structural barriers, which means that race-based algorithms can obscure modifiable system-level causes of poor control [^113NGcZN] [^1154p6uG] [^111s53eZ].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant clinical recommendations. For Black adults with hypertension and no compelling indications, initiate a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker, and use combination therapy early to achieve blood pressure targets, typically adding a RAS blocker when indicated by comorbidity or to reach goal blood pressure [^115CjvEw] [^115grVaK]. I need to ensure I state the important exceptions; ACE inhibitors or ARBs remain first-line in the presence of chronic kidney disease with albuminuria, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or post–myocardial infarction indications, because their organ-protective benefits extend beyond blood pressure lowering and are supported by outcome data even in Black patients when used appropriately [^115grVaK] [^111mQSTC]. Hold on, I should verify safety nuances; there is a higher relative risk of ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema in Black patients, albeit with low absolute risk, which may further support choosing an ARB when a RAS blocker is indicated and an ACE inhibitor is not essential [^116VeHmj].

> Let me synthesize the pathophysiology-to-treatment link. Low-renin, volume-expanded, salt-sensitive physiology with impaired natriuretic capacity and possibly reduced NO bioavailability plausibly diminishes the efficacy of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers as monotherapy, while preserving robust responses to thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers that target sodium balance and vascular tone more directly, which is why guidelines prioritize these classes initially in Black patients absent other indications [^1175BynX] [^116wnc72] [^112DCQKu] [^115CjvEw]. I should double-check that this framework aligns with contemporary guidance; yes, both US and European recommendations emphasize early combination therapy and comorbidity-driven RAS blockade rather than race-exclusive algorithms, reflecting both the pathophysiology and the overlap in individual responses [^115grVaK] [^1115n7eo].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaway is clear. The observed average differences justify population-level guidance favoring thiazides or CCBs as initial therapy in Black patients, but individualization is essential because response distributions overlap and social determinants strongly influence control. Therefore, use combination therapy proactively, treat compelling indications with RAS blockade when present, and address access, adherence, and therapeutic inertia to close the control gap [^113kECtj] [^115grVaK] [^113NGcZN] [^1154p6uG].

Hypertension treatment differs between Black and non-Black patients because Black patients more often have **low-renin, salt-sensitive hypertension** [^1175BynX] [^116wnc72], which reduces the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers [^112KaRBk] but enhances responses to thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers [^112KaRBk]. This physiology drives guideline preferences for thiazides or CCBs as first-line therapy in Black patients [^115CjvEw] [^115grVaK], with ACE inhibitors or ARBs reserved for compelling indications such as CKD or diabetes [^113yrpr4]. Individual variation exists [^113kECtj], so therapy should be **personalized** and combined with aggressive lifestyle and social determinant interventions to close control gaps [^1161NWso] [^113NGcZN].

## Physiological differences influencing hypertension treatment

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity

Low-renin phenotype: Black patients more often have **low plasma renin activity (PRA)** [^1175BynX], reflecting suppressed RAAS activity and reduced responsiveness to ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers [^112KaRBk]. Mechanistically, lower PRA likely reflects **increased sodium retention** and expanded plasma volume, diminishing the efficacy of RAAS blockade [^117R6bb2].

---

### Salt sensitivity

Increased salt sensitivity: Black patients exhibit greater **salt sensitivity** [^116wnc72], with higher BP responses to sodium loading and greater BP reductions with sodium restriction [^116wnc72] [^1175BynX]. Mechanistically, **genetic and epigenetic factors** — including ENaC variants and aldosterone sensitivity — contribute to sodium retention and volume expansion [^114f3C6q] [^116wnc72].

---

### Natriuretic peptide levels

Lower natriuretic peptide concentrations: Black individuals have **lower circulating natriuretic peptide levels** [^112DCQKu], reducing natriuresis and vasodilation and promoting salt-sensitive hypertension [^notfound]. Mechanistically, **reduced NP activity** may worsen sodium retention and vascular tone, increasing salt sensitivity and BP [^notfound].

---

### Vascular function and oxidative stress

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Black patients have higher oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, increasing vascular resistance and BP [^116wnc72].

- **Increased vascular contractility**: Greater vascular responsiveness to pressor stimuli contributes to hypertension severity and resistance [^116C9s4e].

## Clinical implications for antihypertensive drug selection

| **Drug class** | **Response in black patients** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | Greater BP reduction due to salt sensitivity and volume expansion | First-line therapy [^115CjvEw] [^113g8vUN] |
| Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) | Effective due to reduced reliance on RAAS and vasodilation | First-line therapy [^115CjvEw] [^115grVaK] |
| ACE inhibitors | Attenuated BP response due to low-renin phenotype | Not preferred as monotherapy; use with thiazide or CCB if indicated [^111vxmje] [^115wLCZt] |
| Beta-blockers | Reduced efficacy due to low-renin phenotype | Not preferred as initial therapy [^115grVaK] [^115CjvEw] |
| ARBs | Attenuated BP response similar to ACE inhibitors | Use with thiazide or CCB if indicated [^112Vs4ER] [^115wLCZt] |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **JNC 8 (2014)**: Recommends thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs as initial therapy in Black patients, including those with diabetes [^115CjvEw] [^111DCbKx].

- **ACC/AHA 2017**: Emphasizes thiazides or CCBs as initial therapy in Black patients, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs for compelling indications (e.g. CKD, diabetes) [^115grVaK].

- **ESC/ESH 2018**: Recognizes higher prevalence and severity of hypertension in Black patients, supporting tailored therapy [^113tTCTh].

- **ESC 2024**: Recommends initial combination therapy (CCB + thiazide or RAS blocker) in Black patients from Sub-Saharan Africa [^1115n7eo].

---

## Controversies and limitations

- **Individual variability**: Significant overlap exists between racial groups, and race is a social construct; individual response prediction based on race alone is imprecise [^113kECtj] [^116YAMms].

- **Social determinants**: Disparities in access, adherence, and care quality contribute to differences in BP control and outcomes [^113NGcZN] [^1154p6uG].

- **Need for personalized medicine**: Advances in pharmacogenomics and biomarkers may enable more individualized therapy beyond race-based algorithms [^115nDsGZ] [^112G4LYX].

---

## Conclusion

Treatment differences between Black and non-Black patients reflect **physiological differences**, including low-renin, salt-sensitive hypertension and lower natriuretic peptide levels, which reduce the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers while enhancing responses to thiazides and CCBs [^1175BynX] [^116wnc72] [^112DCQKu]. Guidelines accordingly recommend thiazides or CCBs as first-line therapy in Black patients, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs reserved for compelling indications [^115CjvEw] [^115grVaK]. Individual variation and social determinants necessitate **personalized, equity-focused care** to optimize control and outcomes [^1161NWso] [^113NGcZN].

### WITHDRAWN: effect of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure in blacks [^116YyP1F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Black people have a greater prevalence of elevated blood pressure leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To systematically review the effects of different antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure black adults with elevated blood pressure.

Search Strategy

Medline, Embase, LILACS, African Index Medicus, the Cochrane Library November 2003; Pubmed September 2003 to March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data unblinded. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Authors were contacted twice to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Full reports or abstracts from more than 2900 references of papers yielded 30 trials considering 53 interventions with 8 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 20,006 black patients from Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States of America, aged 18 to > 80 years. In one large trial the main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between initial treatment drug classes when drugs were added to reach goal blood pressures. However, the comparison ACE Inhibitors vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for stroke 1.40 [1.17 to 1.68]; combined CHD 1.15 [1.02 to 1.30] and combined CVD 1.19 [1.09 to 1.30] and the comparison alpha blocker vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for combined CVD 1.40 [1.25 to 1.57]. In addition, all comparisons for heart failure favoured diuretic (1.47 [1.24 to 1.74] vs calcium blocker; 1.32 [1.11 to 1.58] vs ACE Inhibitor; and 2.18 [1.73 to 2.74] vs alpha blocker. The results also showed a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics. No significant differences were detected between placebo and beta adrenergic blockers in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [95% CI], -3.52 [-7.50 to 0.46] mm Hg). In addition, ACE inhibitors did not significantly differ from placebo in achievement of goal diastolic blood pressure (risk difference [95% CI], 5% [-10% to 21%]). Calcium blockers, diuretics, centrally acting agents, alpha adrenergic blockers and angiotensin II antagonists were all more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in the pooled analyses. Only calcium blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including baseline diastolic blood pressure > 109 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

When first-line drugs from different classes are compared in the treatment of black people, there is no evidence of differential effects on most mortality and morbidity outcomes. Those morbidity differences that were found favoured diuretics. Drugs differ in their ability to reduce blood pressure in black people. Calcium blockers were the only drug class that reduced blood pressure in all subgroups of black people including those with severe hypertension. Beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, alpha blockers and ACE Inhibitors were least good at reducing blood pressure in black adults.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^111ZK52c]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than one in four adults globally and is a major modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Internationally, guideline based approaches to pharmacotherapy for hypertension have been adopted to simplify clinical practice and improve blood pressure control. Although some evidence suggests that the effectiveness of drug treatment for hypertension does not differ across the general population, guideline recommendations hinge on the understanding that the effect of these drugs differs among specific subpopulations.

In the United Kingdom (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) as first line treatment for hypertension in people younger than 55, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for people without diabetes aged 55 and older, replacing CCB with thiazides for those with drug intolerance. The presence of an age based recommendation is unique among major international guidelines for hypertension treatment, and is based on differences in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with age. Since this threshold was introduced in the first iteration of NICE hypertension guidance in 2004, the evidence base for hypertension treatment in older age, including the use and safety of ACEI/ARB drugs in older populations has evolved.

Furthermore, in NICE guidelines, use of CCB or thiazides is recommended as first line treatment for black people of African or Caribbean ethnic origin (referred to in this article as black people to reflect diversity). The same drugs are recommended, after consideration of comorbidities, in international guidelines. The pathophysiology of hypertension in this population has been thought to differ importantly from people of white heritage; lower levels of renin result in a reduced response to hypertension drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system such as ACEI/ARB. However, treatment recommendations based on historical categorisations of ethnicity have recently been criticised, because ethnicity can be considered a social construct rather than a biological one, and the proportion of people with mixed ethnic heritage has increased.

Contemporary routine care is characterised by an increasingly older, more ethnically diverse and multi-morbid population. For people initiating hypertension drugs, it is not known whether current age and ethnicity based treatment recommendations translate to greater blood pressure reductions in these settings.

### Management of high blood pressure in blacks: an update of the international society on hypertension in blacks consensus statement [^112Vs4ER]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on the "Management of High Blood Pressure in African American" in 2003, data from additional clinical trials have become available. We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently < 135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is ≤ 10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is > 15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is ≥ 115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111nw7Sx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence of hypertension in the United States (2017–2020) was 46.7% among adults, with variation by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and hypertension was defined as BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg or receiving antihypertensive therapy. In Table 5, overall prevalence by sex was Men 49.5% (50.9 million) and Women 43.9% (56.3 million). By age group, Men vs Women were 18–29 years 20.3% vs 9.0% and 75–80 years 83.7% vs 84.8%. Among racial and ethnic groups (age-adjusted), NH Black Men vs Women were 56.8% vs 56.7%; values were derived from NHANES.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^116sCT5N]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

These findings must also be taken in the context of other clinical trials that have demonstrated the benefit of ACEI therapy among blacks with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus despite lesser reduction in blood pressure. Also, use of ACEIs as part of a combination for treatment of hypertension has proven to be effective among black adults. In fact, according to one meta-analysis, combination therapy including ACEIs may actually result in a greater blood pressure reduction in black adults than white adults. Since black adults are disproportionately affected by heart and kidney disease and many will require at least 2 hypertensive agents for blood pressure control, the use of a combination therapy including an ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may be particularly beneficial in this population.

This meta-analysis has several important limitations. First, all of the studies included in this meta-analysis except one were done in the USA and therefore may not be applicable to black adults living in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Although this is a limitation, we also believe that this meta-analysis is important in providing context for the much-anticipated results of the first large, randomized, controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs among hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, this meta-analysis was performed on pooled study results and not individual level data. The consistency of the difference in mean blood pressure reduction, however, does point to a real difference in reduction by race. Finally, as with any meta-analysis, this study is limited by the variables that were studied and reported in the component trials. Since hypertension is multifactorial, some important confounders such as nutrition, salt intake and handling, nephron number or hormone levels may have been missed.

### Potential impact of 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: a cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^115JWPEB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Failure to achieve BP targets has been a common issue based on prior BP goals; however, with the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, BP control was lower. About 60% of patients on antihypertensive therapy did not achieve their BP goal per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Lack of BP control was most pronounced in women, Black and Hispanic individuals, and those with higher CVD risk. Previous studies have shown that women have consistently lower BPs compared with men of the same age group. In this analysis, women were less likely to achieve their BP goal. The difference in awareness and behavior of both patients and cliniciansmay explain this sex disparity. Women are less likely to recognize CVD and CVD risk factors as a health problem, with Hispanic women demonstrating lower hypertension awareness than their Black or White counterparts. Clinicians are also less likely to identify and diagnose CVD and CVD risk factors in women, and women with CVD or CVD risk factors are less likely to receive guideline‐recommended preventive therapies because of therapeutic inertia.,

We also observed significant differences in hypertension management based on race and ethnicity, with a lower proportion of Black and Hispanic patients achieving their BP goal. A previous study from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey also highlighted similar differences, with lower BP control rates in non‐Hispanic Black, non‐Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic adults compared with non‐Hispanic White adults. Causes of racial and ethnic disparities are multifactorial and, in part, relate to insurance coverage and access to health care, socioeconomic status, patient‐provider communication, and medication adherence. In addition, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends the use of the PCE to estimate 10‐year cardiovascular risk. Because the PCE calculation attributes higher risk to Black than White individuals in its calculation, more Black individuals will have higher 10‐year cardiovascular risk scores and with a BP of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg will be in need of pharmacotherapy. On the other hand, the PCE may underestimate risk for certain races and ethnicities, including some Asian Americans (eg, South Asian ancestry), American Indians/Alaska Natives, and some Hispanics (eg, Puerto Ricans), potentially resulting in underuse of antihypertensive therapy in these populations. Taken together, the clinically important differences in BP treatment and control among different sexes and races and ethnicities highlighted in our study may in fact be markers of true health disparities that could have important downstream effects, including a higher risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and renal failure in these specific population groups.

### Racial differences in cardiovascular biomarkers in the general population [^115nDsGZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence and clinical manifestations of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) differ substantially between blacks and whites. While blacks in the United States experience higher overall rates of CVD compared with whites, 1 these differences vary substantially based on specific subtypes of CVD. Black men and women have higher rates of heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease than whites. 2, 3, 4 Blacks have increased incidence and mortality of coronary artery disease compared with whites, despite a lower burden of coronary atherosclerosis. 5 Conversely, whites experience higher rates of atrial fibrillation. 6

Factors that contribute to these racial differences in CVD include a higher burden of risk factors among blacks, including increased prevalence and worse control of hypertension, 7 excess rates of smoking and diabetes mellitus, and among black women, substantially higher rates of obesity. 8 The interplay between socioeconomic status, risk factors and risk factor control, and racial disparities in CVD has been studied extensively. 5 In contrast, there has been relatively little focus on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these racial disparities, beyond known differences in traditional risk factors. Comprehensive assessment of biomarkers that reflect important pathophysiological pathways may provide a window to allow deeper understanding of racial differences in CVD and may facilitate investigation into development of novel precision medicine approaches to CVD prevention and treatment. Thus, we performed an analysis investigating the associations between race and a panel of potentially informative cardiac and metabolic biomarkers, after accounting for traditional risk factors, racial differences in body composition and cardiac structure, and socioeconomic factors.

### Racial disparity in hypertension control: tallying the death toll [^1176W5bR]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Black Americans with hypertension have poorer blood pressure control than their white counterparts, but the impact of this disparity on mortality among black adults is not known. We assessed differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) control among white and black adults with a diagnosis of hypertension, and measured the impact of that difference on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality among blacks.

Methods

Using SBP measurements from white and black adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002, we modeled changes in mortality rates resulting from a reduction of mean SBP among blacks to that of whites. Our data source for mortality estimates of blacks with hypertension was a meta-analysis of observational studies of SBP; our data source for reduction in mortality rates was a meta-analysis of SBP treatment trials.

Results

The final sample of participants for whom SBP measurements were available included 1,545 black adults and 1,335 white adults. The mean SBP among blacks with hypertension was approximately 6 mm Hg higher than that for the total adult black population and 7 mm Hg higher than that for whites with hypertension. Within the hypertensive population, a reduction in mean SBP among blacks to that of whites would reduce the annual number of deaths among blacks from heart disease by 5,480 and from stroke by 2,190.

Conclusions

Eliminating racial disparity in blood pressure control among adults with hypertension would substantially reduce the number of deaths among blacks from both heart disease and stroke. Primary care clinicians should be particularly diligent when managing hypertension in black patients.

### Racial and gender discrimination when tailoring medical management to hypertension treatment in Latin America [^116Hf6kp]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Position 2:

Treatment algorithms structured by race are based on inaccurate historical beliefs, positing that people of African descent are physiologically different according to their ethnicity. This criterion should be modified by algorithms adjusted by the socioeconomic and cultural conditions in which the patient lives and which are conditioned by their ethnic classification, without justifying lower quality management.

Race, as a word, has its roots in the Latin generatio (a begetting). Racism is a social construct that emphasizes the racial phenotype as an indicator of the quality of the person and innate inferiority that is the reason for macroaggressions. Ethnic discrimination in health care is a widespread problem affecting the quality of care received by minority populations. In medicine, ethnicity generates microaggression-related discrimination, often unconscious, which justifies a different treatment, often of inferior quality, and justified by apparent biological differences conditioned by race.

Although race or ethnicity are factors associated with higher rates of illness, access to health care, and morbidity and mortality, they are not valid biological determinants of genetic factors of hypertension since racial definitions are primarily social in origin rather than genetic causes of disease. As documented by Williams et al.ethnicity is a marker of different socioeconomic situations, which can be due, at least in part, to different availability and access to healthcare modalities. Barriers to accessing high-quality antihypertensive treatment have significant implications for health outcomes among ethnic minorities. These populations are disproportionately affected by increased risk of uncontrolled hypertension, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Treatment disparities also contribute to the overall health inequalities found in these communities. Traditional algorithms, adjusted for phenotypes based on t gender, race, or ethnicity, are manifestations of structural discrimination and must be replaced by algorithms based on actual biological and socioeconomic differences. These considerations do not negate the existence of phenotype differences in salt sensitivity and blunted blood pressure response to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in blacks. The CREOLE studyshowed a better blood pressure response to the combination of a diuretic and calcium channel blocker in African women compared with African men. Racial differences in salt sensitivity may be a corollary of lower potassium intake.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^111ZDU8g]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

It is possible that people initiating hypertension drugs other than first line options suggested by current guidance were prescribed them for other indications. Despite good balance on baseline comorbidities in matched cohorts, residual confounding caused by unrecorded heart failure and kidney disease could have attenuated the blood pressure response to treatment. However, we endeavoured to reduce confounding by indication by including only people with hypertension; undertaking our analyses only in people who did not have diabetes; and matching by propensity score on multiple factors, inclusive of heart failure. This last approach achieved highly balanced cohorts for each drug comparison within each group. Furthermore, we used multiple strategies to help detect bias in our matched cohorts; our negative outcome analysis demonstrated no increased risk of herpes zoster in any drug group. Additionally, our positive outcome analyses showed that our data and methods were sensitive to drug effects anticipated to be causally associated with specific hypertension drugs.

Our results related to ethnicity have wide margins of uncertainty, which could have occurred for several reasons. Firstly, we compared changes in blood pressure between black and non-black people, consistent with current UK guidance. Much of the original clinical research that informs this guidance compared people with an African or Caribbean ethnic origin versus people classified as white. If people of non-black and non-white ethnicity in our study had intermediate responses to the hypertension drug classes, their inclusion in the non-black group could have contributed to the overlapping confidence intervals observed for non-black and black people. Secondly, we had small numbers of black people initiating ACEI/ARB as a first line treatment for hypertension, suggesting that current NICE guidance is closely adhered to. Thirdly, the uncertainty we observed could have reflected the wide variation in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system across all ethnic groups.

Our outcomes relied on measurements of blood pressure at clinics because these measurements are recommended by NICE to monitor hypertension in primary care and to guide treatment decisions, except for patients suspected of white coat hypertension or resistant hypertension, in whom ambulatory or home monitoring is recommended. Therefore, the blood pressure measurements used in this study reflect the provision of care as it occurs routinely. Furthermore, we do not expect that any one method of blood pressure measurement was more or less concentrated in any one drug group, thus removing the risk of measurement bias. Our study did not look at the issue of adherence to hypertension drugs, although our as-treated analysis did censor individuals if they discontinued their index drug.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

UK primary care, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017.

Participants

New users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazides.

Main outcome measures

Change in systolic blood pressure in new users of ACEI/ARB versus CCB, stratified by age (< v ≥ 55) and ethnicity (black v non-black), from baseline to 12, 26, and 52 week follow-up. Secondary analyses included comparisons of new users of CCB with those of thiazides. A negative outcome (herpes zoster) was used to detect residual confounding and a series of positive outcomes (expected drug effects) was used to determine whether the study design could identify expected associations.

Results

During one year of follow-up, 87 440 new users of ACEI/ARB, 67 274 new users of CCB, and 22 040 new users of thiazides were included (median 4 (interquartile range 2–6) blood pressure measurements per user). For non-black people who did not have diabetes and who were younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval −2.52 to −0.86) relative to ACEI/ARB use at 12 weeks, and a reduction of 0.40 mm Hg (−0.98 to 0.18) in those aged 55 and older. In subgroup analyses using six finer age categories of non-black people who did not have diabetes, CCB use versus ACEI/ARB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure only in people aged 75 and older. Among people who did not have diabetes, systolic blood pressure decreased more with CCB use than with ACEI/ARB use in black people (reduction difference 2.15 mm Hg (−6.17 to 1.87)); the corresponding reduction difference was 0.98 mm Hg (−1.49 to −0.47) in non-black people.

Conclusions

Similar reductions in blood pressure were found to be associated with new use of CCB as with new use of ACEI/ARB in non-black people who did not have diabetes, both in those who were aged younger than 55 and those aged 55 and older. For black people without diabetes, CCB new use was associated with numerically greater reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB compared with non-black people without diabetes, but the confidence intervals were overlapping for the two groups. These results suggest that the current UK algorithmic approach to first line antihypertensive treatment might not lead to greater reductions in blood pressure. Specific indications could be considered in treatment recommendations.

### Maternal ethnicity and its impact on the haemodynamic and blood pressure response to labetalol for the treatment of antenatal hypertension [^115NXkST]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of hypertension in black populations

β-Blockers exert their action through three mechanisms, including a vasodilatory action, a central cardiac negative chronotropic and inotropic effect and via inhibition of renin release from the kidney's juxtaglomerular cells, resulting in an attenuation of the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The latter mechanism appears to be the cardinal pathway of BP control with β-blockers, and hence testing for renin levels has been proposed as a sensitive screening tool to anticipate the efficacy of these drugs in hypertension. There is evidence that hypertensives with high or normal renin activity respond well to β-blockers and ACE inhibitors, while those with low renin activity respond poorly. Hypertension in black and elderly, compared with younger and white populations, is characterised by low renin.

This distinct pathophysiology of hypertension in black patients has formed the basis of NICE clinical guidance which recommends antihypertensive therapy on the basis of age and ethnicity, as a proxy for renin activity. According to this guidance, older and black hypertensive patients, who are likely to have lower renin activity, should not be prescribed β-blockers or ACE inhibitors as first-line therapy.

Other distinct pathophysiological pathways for hypertension in black populations have been proposed, associating low renin levels with sodium retention. Sowers et al have shown that hypertensive compared with normotensive black patients have lower levels of dopamine, a natriuretic substance, and Luft et al have demonstrated that black, compared with white patients, are more susceptible to the hypertensive effects of sodium and demonstrate impaired excretion of a salt load. Despite the low circulating renin levels in black hypertensive populations, a 2006 study by Stewart et al found that this group have paradoxically high aldosterone levels. It could be this is owing to genetic polymorphisms which may have a role in altering the sensitivity of aldosterone release in response to angiotensin II. Prima facie, this mechanism may explain some of the reduced efficacy of β-blockade in lowering BP among black populations, since aldosterone levels, even on a background of suppressed renin, would likely remain elevated given these differing polymorphisms.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^115WtAgD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and Etiology of Hypertension

Twenty-three (62%) of the guidelines referred to race categories when describing the prevalence or incidence of hypertension. These included instances when race categories were used as static descriptors alongside epidemiological data. For example, Bozkurt et al. noted, "Hispanics had the highest prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (78.8%) followed by whites (69.5%) and blacks (60.9%)". In the KDOQI guidelines, authors indicated that "African-American males with hypertension are particularly at risk because they often receive less treatment and, when they do, are less likely to adhere to the treatment regimen". In a third of the guidelines. authors used white as the reference group against which other groups were compared when discussing disease distribution and outcomes.

Eight guidelines (22%) used genetics to explain race differences in hypertension disease. In these cases, authors distinguished racial groups using allele polymorphisms or variations in genetic frequencies. Elijovich et al. concluded that "substantial evidence from different racial and ethnic groups supports a genetic basis for the variation in the BP response to salt". Aronow et al. noted: "Japanese appear to have a higher frequency of salt sensitivity than whites, possibly influenced by more prevalent polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen, alpha-adducting, and aldosterone synthase genes". Whelton et al. described that "the excess risk of CKD outcomes in at least some blacks with hypertension may be due to the presence of high-risk APOL1 (apolipoprotein L1) genetic variants".

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^117ML5Cw]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry generally respond better to diuretics and calcium blockers and less well to ACE and β-adrenergic blockade? Many clinicians use the self-defined ancestry of a patient as a clinical guide to select antihypertensive drugs, but considerable overlap in response is known to occur between ancestry groups. Therefore, many health care workers and patients object to using ancestry as a proxy for drug response, and it is advocated that reduction of blood pressure and related mortality should be achieved through individual treatment options. However, to reach this end, ethno-cultural and biological differences in drug response behind the surrogate measures of 'ancestry' or 'ethnicity' need to be identified.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on environmental, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors that may contribute to the differential clinical response to different types of drugs observed in patients of African ancestry. In this paper, we also addressed genetic variation thought to affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, of which phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism and receptor function have been most extensively studied.

### Trends in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control rates in United States adults between 1988–1994 and 1999–2004 [^112eU8oG]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

This study assesses trends in hypertension prevalence, blood pressure distributions and mean levels, and hypertension awareness, treatment, and control among US adults, age ≥ 18 years, between the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) and the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a period of approximately 10 years. The age-standardized prevalence rate increased from 24.4% to 28.9% (P < 0.001), with the largest increases among non-Hispanic women. Depending on gender and race/ethnicity, from one fifth to four fifths of the increase could be accounted for by increasing body mass index. Among hypertensive persons, there were modest increases in awareness (P = 0.04), from 68.5% to 71.8%. The rate for men increased from 61.6% to 69.3% (P = 0.001), whereas the rate for women did not change significantly. Rates remained higher for women than for men, although the difference narrowed considerably. Improvements in treatment and control rates were larger: 53.1% to 61.4% and 26.1% to 35.1%, respectively (both P < 0.001). The greatest increases occurred among non-Hispanic white men and non-Hispanic black persons, especially men. Mexican American persons showed improvement in treatment and control rates, but these rates remained the lowest among race/ethnic subgroups (47.4% and 24.3%, respectively). Among all of the race/ethnic groups, women continued to have somewhat better awareness, treatment, and control, except for control rates among non-Hispanic white persons, which became higher in men. Differences between non-Hispanic black and white persons in awareness, treatment, and control were small. These divergent trends may translate into disparate trends in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in black people: the need to sort out ancestry versus epigenetic versus social determinants of its causation [^115yqXT1]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Race is a social construct, but self-identified Black people are known to have higher prevalence and worse outcomes of hypertension than White people. This may be partly due to the disproportionate incidence of salt sensitivity of blood pressure in Black people, a cardiovascular risk factor that is independent of blood pressure and has no proven therapy. We review the multiple physiological systems involved in regulation of blood pressure, discuss what, if anything is known about the differences between Black and White people in these systems and how they affect salt sensitivity of blood pressure. The contributions of genetics, epigenetics, environment, and social determinants of health are briefly touched on, with the hope of stimulating further work in the field.

### Exercise and hypertension: uncovering the mechanisms of vascular control [^1133m8R9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) has recently been determined to be the number one overall risk factor of disease. With direct and indirect costs amounting to $46.4 billion in 2011 and projections of six-fold increases by 2030, the importance of low-cost nonpharmacological interventions can be appreciated. Vascular structural changes, endothelial dysfunction, and sympathetic overstimulation are major contributing factors to the pathophysiology of HTN. Exercise training (ET) for blood pressure (BP) control has been shown to be an effective and integral component of nonpharmacological interventions for BP control. Different ET modalities (aerobic, resistance, and concurrent training) have contributed differently to BP reduction and control, driving scientific discourse regarding the optimum ET prescription (modality, volume, and intensity) for such effects; ET results in a multitude of physiological effects, with vascular and autonomic adaptations providing major contributions to BP control. Despite widespread acceptance of the role and importance of ET for BP reduction, only 15% of US adults have been found to meet ET/physical activity recommendations. The purpose of this review is to explore BP lowering effects of aerobic and resistance ET and the underlying physiological mechanisms that result in such effects. Further research is required to enhance our understanding of the proper ET prescription for BP control across different age groups and racial ethnicities. Furthermore, research into methods of improving awareness and adherence to ET recommendations proves to be equally important.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^1131p2ZY]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among African-Americans adults, arterial hypertension is both more prevalent and associated with more complications than among white adults. Hypertension is also epidemic among black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The treatment of hypertension among black adults may be complicated by lesser response to certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents.

Methods

We systematically searched literature for clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors among hypertensive adults comparing blood pressure response between whites and blacks. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response. Further analysis including meta-regressions, funnel plots, and one-study-removed analyses were performed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity or bias.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 13 trials providing 17 different patient groups for evaluation, black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic (mean difference: 4.6 mmHg (95% CI 3.5–5.7)) and diastolic (mean difference: 2.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.2–3.5)) blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors, with little heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed only ACE-inhibitor dosage as a significant source of heterogeneity. There was little evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

Black race is consistently associated with a clinically significant lesser reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to ACE-inhibitor therapy in clinical trials in the USA and Europe. In black adults requiring monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension, drugs other than ACE-inhibitors may be preferred, though the proven benefits of ACE-inhibitors in some sub-groups and the large overlap of response between blacks and whites must be remembered. These data are particularly important for interpretation of clinical drug trials for hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa and for the development of treatment recommendations in this population.

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^111df3yT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Evolving the role of black race in hypertension therapeutics [^1161NWso]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Black race has been used to guide antihypertensive drug selection for Black patients based on predominant between race (same drug) and intra-race (different drugs) blood pressure (BP) response patterns. Accordingly, thiazide diuretics and calcium antagonists have been recommended over renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and beta blockers for Black patients. Current antihypertensive drug prescribing reflects historical guidance as calcium antagonists and thiazide diuretics are prescribed more and RAS blockers less in Black than White patients. Hypertension control rates in Blacks, lag those for Whites despite their greater use of combination drug therapy and lesser use of monotherapy. This is also true across drug regimens containing any of the 4 recommended classes for initial therapy as well as for evidence-based combination drug therapy (calcium antagonist or thiazide diuretic+RAS blocker) regimens for which there is no known racial disparity in BP response. Current recommendations acknowledge the need for combination drug therapy in most, especially in Black patients. One exemplary comprehensive hypertension control program achieved > 80% control rates in Black and White patients with minimal racial disparity while utilizing a race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm. Black patients manifest robust, if not outsized, BP responses to diet/lifestyle modifications. Importantly, race neither appears to be a necessary nor sufficient consideration for the selection of effective drug therapy. Accordingly, we urge the initiation of adequately intense race-agnostic drug therapy coupled with greater emphasis on diet/lifestyle modifications for Black patients as the cornerstone of a race-informed approach to hypertension therapeutics.

### Association of differences in treatment intensification, missed visits, and scheduled follow-up interval with racial or ethnic disparities in blood pressure control [^1154p6uG]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Black patients with hypertension often have the lowest rates of blood pressure (BP) control in clinical settings. It is unknown to what extent variation in health care processes explains this disparity.

Objective

To assess whether and to what extent treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits are associated with racial and ethnic disparities in BP control.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cohort study, nested logistic regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of BP control (defined as a systolic BP [SBP] level < 140 mm Hg) by race and ethnicity, and a structural equation model was used to assess the association of treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits with racial and ethnic disparities in BP control. The study included 16 114 adults aged 20 years or older with hypertension and elevated BP (defined as an SBP level ≥ 140 mm Hg) during at least 1 clinic visit between January 1, 2015, and November 15, 2017. A total of 11 safety-net clinics within the San Francisco Health Network participated in the study. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to October 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Blood pressure control was assessed using the patient's most recent BP measurement as of November 15, 2017. Treatment intensification was calculated using the standard-based method, scored on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0, with -1.0 being the least amount of intensification and 1.0 being the most. Scheduled follow-up interval was defined as the mean number of days to the next scheduled visit after an elevated BP measurement. Missed visits measured the number of patients who did not show up for visits during the 4 weeks after an elevated BP measurement.

Results

Among 16 114 adults with hypertension, the mean (SD) age was 58.6 (12.1) years, and 8098 patients (50.3%) were female. A total of 4658 patients (28.9%) were Asian, 3743 (23.2%) were Black, 3694 (22.9%) were Latinx, 2906 (18.0%) were White, and 1113 (6.9%) were of other races or ethnicities (including American Indian or Alaska Native [77 patients (0.4%)], Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander [217 patients (1.3%)], and unknown [819 patients (5.1%)]). Compared with patients from all racial and ethnic groups, Black patients had lower treatment intensification scores (mean [SD], -0.33 [0.26] vs -0.29 [0.25]; β = -0.03, P < .001) and missed more visits (mean [SD], 0.8 [1.5] visits vs 0.4 [1.1] visits; β = 0.35; P < .001). In contrast, Asian patients had higher treatment intensification scores (mean [SD], -0.26 [0.23]; β = 0.02; P < .001) and fewer missed visits (mean [SD], 0.2 [0.7] visits; β = -0.20; P < .001). Black patients were less likely (odds ratio [OR],0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.89; P < .001) and Asian patients were more likely (OR,1.13; 95% CI, 1.02–1.25; P < .001) to achieve BP control than patients from all racial or ethnic groups. Treatment intensification and missed visits accounted for 21% and 14%, respectively, of the total difference in BP control among Black patients and 26% and 13% of the difference among Asian patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study's findings suggest that racial and ethnic inequities in treatment intensification may be associated with more than 20% of observed racial or ethnic disparities in BP control, and racial and ethnic differences in visit attendance may also play a role. Ensuring more equitable provision of treatment intensification could be a beneficial health care strategy to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in BP control.

### Hypertension in black people: pathophysiology and therapeutic aspects [^1125wTe8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Salt sensitivity is regarded as an important contributor to the higher risk of hypertension in black people as compared with whites. This finding is in agreement with a better response to diuretics than to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in black subjects. It is important to remember that the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitor is augmented in patients on a thiazide diuretic. Moreover, the antihypertensive response to a specific drug varies among black patients. Thus, ACE inhibitors should also be viewed as important options to treat hypertensive black subjects. Results from clinical trials support an emphasis on lifestyle modification and a more intensive blood pressure lowering by pharmacological interventions to reduce the large black-white gap in cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) attributed to hypertension.

### Clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of hispanic hypertensive patients [^116QPnsE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hispanics are the largest and fastest-growing minority population in the United States, currently comprising about 16.3% (52 million) of the total population. With an increased prevalence of metabolic risk factors in this population, the rate of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in Hispanics significantly exceeds the rates observed among non-Hispanic blacks and whites. Unfortunately, data on HTN in Hispanics remains limited due to the under-representation of Hispanics in clinical trials; with most of the data primarily restricted to observational and retrospective subgroup analyses. This article aims to review the available data on prevalence, awareness and control of HTN, risk factors and some of the challenges unique to the Hispanics population. We also discuss treatment strategies derived from large HTN trials that included Hispanics.

### Racial and ethnic subgroup disparities in hypertension prevalence, New York city health and nutrition examination survey, 2013–2014… [^115bvTzD]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion Racial/ethnic minority subgroups vary in hypertension prevalence, suggesting the need for targeted interventions. A greater proportion of white adults than adults in other major racial/ethnic groups had private health insurance coverage. Black and Hispanic adults had a greater prevalence of obesity than did white or Asian adults. The prevalence of smoking did not significantly differ across major racial/ethnic groups. In multivariate logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, education, and BMI, black and Asian adults had significantly greater odds of hypertension than whites, but adjusted odds for Hispanic and white adults were similar. A significant interaction between race and BMI indicated a potential differential effect of BMI on hypertension across racial/ethnic groups. After stratifying analyses by BMI group, we found that prevalence of hypertension increased monotonically as BMI increased among white, black, and Hispanic adults but not among Asian adults. In the normal/underweight category, hypertension prevalence among black, Hispanic, and Asian adults differed significantly from prevalence among white adults. Among normal/underweight people, non-Hispanic black and Asian adults had approximately 6 times greater odds of hypertension than white adults, whereas Hispanics had 3. 5 times greater odds of hypertension than white adults. Discussion We estimated hypertension prevalence for racial/ethnic groups using a population-based sample of adults in an ethnically/racially diverse urban setting.

In addition to confirming a greater prevalence of hypertension among black adults, we found substantial differences among racial/ethnic groups, even after adjusting for BMI, age, and sociodemographic characteristics.

Higher Salt Sensitivity and Salt Retention in Black Patients With Hypertension

Salt sensitivity plays a crucial role in the development of hypertension, especially among Black patients, in whom it is more pronounced compared with White individuals. Studies consistently show that Black individuals exhibit higher rates of salt sensitivity. For example, a crossover trial comparing ethnic differences in salt sensitivity found that hypertensive Black women experienced a greater increase in mean arterial pressure (12.6 versus 8.2 mm Hg) following high-salt intake, indicating a heightened sensitivity to sodium-induced blood pressure elevation. In addition, a study in Nigeria demonstrated that pressure responses to acute salt loading were significantly higher in hypertensive (60.7%) compared with normotensive individuals (52.0%). Several factors including genetic, epigenetic, environmental/social determinants, and diet have been implicated in renal, neural, and vascular mechanisms leading to salt-sensitive hypertension in Black patients. A leading hypothesis for the increased salt sensitivity is through mutations in the ENaC (epithelial sodium channel), which regulates sodium reabsorption in renal tubules. Furthermore, Black individuals, particularly women, exhibit increased oxidative stress and inflammation, which can impair endothelial function and exacerbate blood pressure elevation in response to salt intake.

### Editorial commentary: racial and ethnic disparities in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in the United States, 2013 to 2018 [^113pFLKM]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The explanation remains unclear on how adverse social determinants drive disparities between Black and White adults in prevalent hypertension and treatment effectiveness, while awareness and treatment are not different. A more granular understanding of specific social factors driving disparities in hypertension prevalence and treatment effectiveness between Black and White adults could inform targeted interventions for greater health equity.

Hypertension control among treated adults in 2015 to 2018 was significantly lower among Black, Hispanic, and Asian than White Americans after adjusting for age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Racial and ethnic differences in hypertension control among treated adults, that is, treatment effectiveness, remained significant for Black and Asian but not Hispanic Americans when education, income, type of health care insurance, having a usual source of health care and a health care visit in the past year were included in multivariable adjustment. Similarly, the disparity in hypertension control between Hispanic and Black relative to White Americans in 2015 to 2018 appeared to be attenuated more after adjustment for education, obesity, and access to care in Hispanic (unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios 0.74 versus 0.98, respectively) than in Black Americans (0.79 versus 0.84, respectively). These reports are consistent with the authors' viewpoint that social and structural factors affecting the control cascade vary across the different race-ethnicity subgroups and highlight the importance of more granular understanding to inform effective targeted interventions.

### Public reporting of black participation in anti-hypertensive drug clinical trials [^114ws1cE]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-Hispanic Black people in the United States have the highest prevalence of essential hypertension. Unfortunately, clinical trials often underrepresent Black patients. We aim to understand whether trial sponsorship type is associated with representation of Black participants in anti-hypertensive drug clinical trials. Then, we contextualize our findings amongst current efforts to improve diversity in clinical research populations.

Methods

We searched ClinicalTrials.gov in May 2022 for antihypertensive drug trials. Of n = 408 trials in our initial search, n = 97 (23.77%) met inclusion criteria and were stratified by sponsorship type (industry vs non-industry). Standardized tests of difference were employed to compare characteristics of these trials, and linear regression was used to model change over time.

Results

Of 97 trials reporting results from 2010 to 2020, there were minimal differences in the percent of Black patients enrolled in anti-hypertensive clinical trials by sponsorship type. Both industry and non-industry sponsored studies had high rates of non-reporting, with slightly more non-reporting for industry (73.2%) vs non-industry (66.67%) studies. Industry funded studies reported results to ClinicalTrials.gov within 23.3 ± 15.0 months from completing studies, while non-industry funded trials reported within 18.9 ± 10.8 months.

Conclusions

Despite Black Americans carrying the highest burden of disease for essential hypertension, they are underrepresented in anti-hypertension clinical trials and their overall participation has decreased between 2010 and 2020. In addition, there is major underreporting of trial participant race. We implore researchers and funders to establish clear, meaningful targets for anti-hypertensive drug trial diversity, and improve transparency in reporting of study characteristics.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116FTHSg]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines, favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program that included a patient population that was 65% Black utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%. This demonstrated that high blood pressure control rates and reduced racial disparities can be achieved without race-specific prescribing, particularly when combined with intensive, guideline-aligned care and efforts to avoid therapeutic inertia.

### Ethnicity in pulmonary arterial hypertension: possibilities for novel phenotypes in the age of personalized medicine [^11752H5Q]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

In the past decade and a half, the introduction of new therapeutic agents has revolutionized the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). These new treatment options have improved the quality of life and survival in PAH. With an armamentarium of options available, the identification of unique phenotypes can help practitioners choose tailored treatment regimens. Experts in other cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure and hypertension, have recommended race-specific treatments in their fields based on data highlighting variations in response to therapies. With this perspective, we review evidence supporting the hypothesis that ethnicity or race plays an important role in the management of PAH. Preliminary research suggests that races/ethnicities have differences in the presentation and outcome of PAH and could respond to PAH-specific medications with varying efficacy. Genetic, physiological, and anatomic differences exist between races, particularly regarding the structure and function of the right ventricle. Unfortunately, clinical trials have not adequately included minorities, and registry data often omit inclusion of this demographic information. Further studies are needed to characterize the role that ethnicity plays in the prevalence, presentation, outcomes, and optimal treatment of PAH.

### Differences in natriuretic peptide response in self-identified white and black individuals: a physiological clinical trial [^115kt6q7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Considering that NPs are physiologically active hormones, low NP concentrations have been shown to increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Sustained augmentation of NPs may be beneficial in reducing the burden of cardiometabolic diseases. While the transient and sustained effects of beta-blockade on NPs have been examined among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, similar studies are needed in healthy individuals to understand the physiological impact of metoprolol-induced NP augmentation. Future studies should also focus on assessing the timing of NP response to capture the differences in various circulating NP isoforms.

This study has several limitations. Considering the strict protocol followed in the study, the generalizability of the results may be limited. The study protocol required strict adherence to a 3-day standardized, mandatory fasting the night before the protocol and strict adherence to a daily dose of metoprolol. However, these measures provide an advantage in reducing inherent variation that is present in larger studies where NP concentrations are measured on a random salt background. Second, the study findings need to be replicated in populations of different ethnicities, such as Asian and Hispanic individuals and individuals from different age groups. Third, although the study was appropriately powered to detect a small-moderate effect size, the limited sample size constrained its ability to identify a very small effect size. Fourth, race is largely considered a social construct with some biological underpinnings. The current study recruited individuals based on self-reported race. However, previous studies in the Birmingham area have shown that self-identified Black individuals have ~90% African ancestry. Fifth, NPs are known to have a diurnal rhythm. The current study did not account for this diurnal variation to allow participants to schedule visits as per their convenience. Sixth, the study's non-randomized design could be a limitation, given that randomizing participants by race is not achievable. Seventh, due to the restriction of the study sample to young, healthy individuals, additional cardiac imaging was not obtained during the study. Last, the current study may also be limited by the reversible binding of metoprolol succinate to the beta-adrenergic receptor.

This physiologically rigorous clinical trial in healthy normotensive Black and white individuals accounting for factors affecting NP concentrations showed that the NP concentrations increased with exercise and metoprolol. Physiological interventions such as exercise may lead to higher augmentation of plasma NP concentrations in white individuals than in Black individuals.

### Race, ethnicity, hypertension, and heart Disease: JACC focus seminar 1 / 9 [^116qQht3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally. In the United States, the prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mm Hg) among adults is approximately 45%. Racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension prevalence are well documented, especially among Black adults who are disproportionately affected and have one of the highest rates of hypertension globally. Hypertension control remains a persistent public health crisis. Recently published data indicate suboptimal hypertension control rates, particularly for racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States. This requires urgent action because of the significant health care burden from cardiovascular- and stroke-related morbidity and mortality. This clinical review delineates racial/ethnic disparities in the epidemiology of hypertension, and the impact of social determinants of health on the quality of cardiovascular care and outcomes. Clinical practice guideline recommendations and various national programs targeted toward hypertension control and proposed solutions to eliminate these disparities are discussed.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to black patients, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating combination therapy including a CCB combined with either a thiazide diuretic or a renin-angiotensin system blocker in black patients from Sub-Saharan Africa requiring BP-lowering treatment.

### Clinical outcomes by race and ethnicity in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT): a randomized clinical trial [^1138NLU6]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

More recently, random assignment to a SBP target < 120 mm Hg compared to < 140 mm Hg among people at high CVD risk (without diabetes or history of stroke) resulted in a 25% reduction in the primary outcome (a CVD composite) and a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Of the 9,361 SPRINT participants, 30% were NHBs and 11% were Hispanic. Exploration of the trial results in non-Black compared to Black participants was a prespecified analysis. Thus, SPRINT provides a large database for the study of BP treatment targets in these diverse populations. This report describes the major outcomes in SPRINT by race and Hispanic ethnicity.

### Racial differences in sensitivity of blood pressure to aldosterone [^114f3C6q]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Blacks in comparison with whites are at risk for a more serious form of hypertension with high rates of complications. Greater sodium retention is thought to underlie the blood pressure (BP)-determining physiology of blacks, but specific mechanisms have not been identified. In a prospective observational study of BP, 226 black children and 314 white children (mean age, 10.6 years) were enrolled initially. Assessments were repeated in 85 blacks and 136 whites after reaching adulthood (mean age, 31 years). The relationship of BP to plasma aldosterone concentration in the context of the prevailing level of plasma renin activity was studied in blacks and whites. In a secondary interventional study, 9-α fludrocortisone was administered for 2 weeks to healthy adult blacks and whites to simulate hyperaldosteronism. BP responses in the 2 race groups were then compared. Although black children had lower levels of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, their BP was positively associated with the plasma aldosterone concentration, an effect that increased as plasma renin activity decreased (P = 0.004). Data from black adults yielded similar results. No similar relationship was observed in whites. In the interventional study, 9-α fludrocortisone increased BP in blacks but not in whites. In conclusion, aldosterone sensitivity is a significant determinant of BP in young blacks. Although its role in establishing the risk of hypertension is not known, it could be as relevant as the actual level of aldosterone.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^111vxmje]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of 13 unique clinical trials of ACEI therapy for hypertensive adults providing race-stratified systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure results, black race was associated with a consistently lesser response in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after ACEI therapy (4.6 and 2.8 mmHg respectively). The observed differences in blood pressure response are not only statistically significant but also clinically important since a reduction of 4–5 mmHg in SBP and 2–3 mmHg in DBP has been associated with a 8–20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This difference in BP response is also similar to the hypotensive effect of some classes of anti-hypertensive agents such as beta-blockers. These results provide evidence for recent recommendations that ACEI should not preferred for monotherapy in black adults with uncomplicated hypertension, and that calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics may be a better choice. These data have particularly important public health implications for black adults with hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa where hypertension is epidemic and guidelines for the treatment of hypertension must consider cost, availability and population-level, average blood pressure responses.

The difference in blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy between blacks and whites observed in this meta-analysis appears to be related to race and is not entirely explainable by other factors. One-study-removed analysis and funnel plots showed no evidence of overinfluence by a single study or of publication bias. We also performed careful metaregression to estimate the impact of possible confounders such as age, baseline blood pressure, duration of treatment, study quality and ACEI dose. Of these factors, only ACEI dose had some mitigating effect on the difference in blood pressure response. Higher doses of ACEI may be beneficial among black adults who require ACEI therapy for hypertension although higher doses may be associated with more adverse effects. One additional, possible confounder in the relationship between race and ACE-inhibitor response is salt intake. Three of the studies included in this meta-analysis investigated the impact of salt intake on the relationship race and ACE-inhibitor with mixed results. The most rigorous of these studies demonstrated that salt-sensitive black adults had a consistently lesser blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors whether the subjects were consuming a high or low salt diet. It also showed that a low salt diet was associated with less response to ACEIs among all races.

### Hypertension in blacks: insights from Africa [^111BPY1A]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Although the consequences of hypertension are universal, blacks (African-Americans or indigenous Africans) have been the subject of a differential approach to causation, outcome, and treatment. Blacks have a greater propensity to salt sensitivity and suppressed plasma renin suggesting a predisposition to sodium retention. Target organ damage is more frequent and blood pressure is more difficult to control. We explore potential underlying causes, both genetic and environmental, particularly in the South African population, and propose a more physiological approach to the treatment of resistant hypertension in blacks.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^114c9WA2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients of African ancestry tend to suffer from more severe hypertension, characterized by enhanced vascular contractility and salt retaining capacity, therapy resistance, and higher morbidity and mortality of the condition and its complications. Because of the need for individual treatment options, as well as the increasing objections to the use of ancestry as a surrogate marker for therapeutic responses, we systematically gathered evidence on biomarkers that may predict the response of individual persons of African ancestry to different types of antihypertensive drugs. However, pharmacogenomics yield heterogeneous, insufficient evidence, and the low renin levels found with greater frequency in patients of African ancestry do not, or do not adequately, predict responses to antihypertensive drugs. Finally, there are no convincing clinical data yet of the emerging paradigm that low NO bioavailability and associated high cellular ATP buffer capacity predict the response to specific antihypertensive drugs. Currently, self-identified ethno-geographic ancestry remains the best available predictor of blood pressure lowering responses to antihypertensive drugs.

### Implications of ethnicity for the treatment of hypertensive kidney disease, with an emphasis on African Americans [^111mQSTC]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

The recognition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an important public health issue has fostered an increasing number of strategies to increase CKD awareness and to reduce both the prevalence and the complications of CKD. Despite these advances, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular events remain the major complications of CKD. Although the ESRD epidemic is attributed in greater part to the increasing rate of diabetes, hypertension remains the second most common reported cause of ESRD and is present in approximately 90% of cases of diabetes-related ESRD. The disproportionately high prevalence of hypertension in ethnic minorities, as well as the difficulty of achieving adequate blood-pressure control in these populations, contributes substantially to the high rate of CKD progression and complications in these groups. Although the role of hypertension as a primary cause of CKD is debated, hypertension is commonly recognized as the most important CKD progression factor. Important differences have been reported in the degree and likelihood of blood-pressure response to antihypertensive medications between ethnic groups, but ethnicity seems to be less important as a determinant of clinical outcomes. In this Review we examine key ethnic variations in hypertensive CKD in terms of pathophysiology, response to antihypertensive therapy, clinical outcomes, and evidence-based recommendations for blood-pressure control, with an emphasis on African Americans.

### Blood pressure demographics: nature or nurture… genes or environment? [^116C9s4e]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Can this 'wrong genotype in the wrong environment' hypothesis be applied to hypertension in black African-Americans? Efforts have already been made to understand the reasons behind the higher prevalence of hypertension in African Americans, with the underlying assumption that there may a genetically determined predisposition as compared to their white counterparts; however, no convincing data are available. This may be because multiple genes determine human hypertension, at least in the vast majority of cases, and genetic factors have not been able to fully account for the differences in blood pressure prevalence between ethnic groups. Furthermore, elsewhere, black populations migrating to countries like UK have been shown to have similar blood pressures compared to the white UK population.

Numerous potential explanations for the higher prevalence of hypertension in blacks have been proposed. Genetic mechanisms have been used to explain familial aggregation of hypertension in Jamaican blacks and the intra-class correlation of systolic blood pressures amongst black twins. Low renin levels noted in the USA black population have been hypothesised to be the result of a genetic 'maladaptation' which though benefited their earlier black ancestors to survive the torment of a transatlantic voyage under slavery, later turned out to be detrimental to survival due to the resultant avid salt retention. Indeed, increased sodium sensitivity, abnormalities in sodium transport, increased vascular responsiveness to pressor stimuli, association between stresses of low socio-economic status and hypertension, and insulin resistance have also been suggested. Furthermore, ethnic differences in response to anti-hypertensive therapy are also well documented, with a potent effects of diuretics and calcium antagonists in black patients, compared to a relatively poor response to beta blockers and drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system (such as the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers).

### Abstract… [^117R6bb2]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The recently published guidelines from the sixth Joint National Committee 1 addressed management of hypertension in many special populations, including racial/ethnic minorities and older persons. This article focuses on management of hypertension in two subgroups, providing a rationale for the treatment recommendations as well as summarizing relevant data published in the year since the JNC report was published. Hypertension in Black Patients The prevalence of hypertension in adult black patients in the United States is 32. 4 percent, compared with
23. 3 percent in white patients. 2 This increased prevalence is accompanied by an 80 percent higher rate of mortality associated with stroke, a 50 percent higher rate of mortality associated with heart disease and a striking, sixfold greater rate of hypertension-related end-stage renal disease. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The pathophysiology of hypertension differs in black adults.

For example, hypertension in this population is commonly of the low-renin type and, often, sensitivity of blood pressure to salt intake is increased, and the ability to excrete ingested salt is impaired. 3 This leads to an overall expansion of intravascular volume. Obesity is especially prevalent in black women and is associated with an increase in total body sodium content. 4 Intake of dietary potassium is generally lower in blacks than in whites. Black patients may also have relatively higher levels of intracellular calcium. 5 All of these factors are associated with an increased incidence of hypertension. 10 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers are less effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with a low renin profile. For example, with beta-blocker therapy, the average reduction in blood pressure of about 7/7 mm Hg in black patients compared with an average reduction of about 15/11 mm Hg in white patients.

In the absence of contraindications, special efforts should be made to ensure that black patients with hypertension who have had a myocardial infarction are receiving a beta blocker and that hypertensive black patients with systolic heart failure or diabetic nephropathy are receiving an ACE inhibitor. In these cases, the protective effect of the drugs is due to more than just reduction of blood pressure. In black hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, evidence now shows that non–dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists can slow the chronic progression of renal disease.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension epidemiology and control in US adults — Figure 1 reports rates of awareness, treatment, and control among adults aged 18 to 80 years in 2017 to 2020, noting that NH indicates non-Hispanic and that some subgroup estimates are uncertain due to small samples. Among middle-aged individuals, the remaining lifetime risks for incident hypertension are as high as 80% to 90%, with earlier onset among men compared with women and for Black and Hispanic compared with White and Chinese Americans. Current rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension remain far below target levels for all groups and demonstrate important age- and race-based disparities. From 2017 to 2020, 16.6% of adults with hypertension were current smokers, 72.6% were overweight or obese, 12.3% had diabetes, and 13.4% had diagnosed CKD. Blood pressure is associated with fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in a graded, log-linear fashion, with an approximate doubling of risk for each 20-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 10-mm Hg higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and relative cardiovascular disease event rates increase among individuals without major risk factors starting at SBP levels as low as 90 mm Hg.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^113mcEqn]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

We sought to identify all published or unpublished studies that considered potential explanations for the differential clinical efficacy of different classes of antihypertensive drugs, used as single drug or single drug-based treatment in non-pregnant adults of sub-Saharan African descent with uncomplicated hypertension, defined as the absence of reported clinical heart failure, current stroke or end stage renal disease.

We first identified potential causes for differences in specific drug responses based on ethno-geographic origin (Table 2). As we sought to explain differential blood pressure lowering responses to different types of antihypertensive drugs, we excluded general factors such as access to care and differences in socio-economic status. To answer the clinical question, why there was a difference in response between people of African vs European ancestry, we considered pharmacokinetic variations including polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 family of enzymes involved in phase I drug metabolism, and polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in phase II drug metabolism. Furthermore, we considered genetic polymorphisms that may influence pharmacodynamics including alpha-adducin (ADD1), subunits of G-proteins (GNB3 and GNAS1), the β-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, angiotensinogen (AGT), renin (REN), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), the angiotensin II receptor type I (AGTR1 or AT1R), and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). Finally, hypertension in persons of African ancestry is characterized by high vascular contractility, greater salt sensitivity and, in general, low plasma renin activity, and the molecular basis of these changes has been related to low nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, to the activity of Ca 2+ ATPase, myosin ATPase, Na + K + ATPase, and to the central regulatory enzyme of energy metabolism, creatine kinase (CK), which rapidly regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from phosphocreatine near these ATPases.

### Ethnic differences in antihypertensive medication use in the elderly [^1155bkZX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Determining the optimal treatment for hypertension in very old patients requires better understanding of interethnic differences in patterns and predictors of antihypertensive drug use in this population.

Objective

To investigate interethnic variations in antihypertensive drug use in a tri-ethnic sample of community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 77 years.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study of non-Hispanic white, black, and Hispanic adults ≥ 77 years old residing in Galveston County, TX. In-home interviews in 1997 and 1998 assessed blood pressures and antihypertensive medication use in 281 subjects who reported having hypertension or who had a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg.

Results

Of the population evaluated, 62.9% of non-Hispanic whites, 60.2% of blacks, and 45.2% of Hispanics with hypertension were on antihypertensive medications (p < 0.027 across the ethnic groups). After adjusting for age, gender, years of education, household income, Medicaid insurance, number of physician visits, and cognitive function, Hispanic ethnicity, unlike black ethnicity, continued to be significantly associated with lower use of antihypertensive drugs compared with non-Hispanic whites (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.90). Characteristics associated with the lower use of antihypertensive drugs included older age and low income in whites, poor cognition and infrequent physician visits in blacks, and lack of Medicaid insurance in Hispanics.

Conclusions

In the elderly, Hispanic ethnicity, unlike black ethnicity, is significantly associated with lower use of antihypertensive drug therapy compared with non-Hispanic white ethnicity, adjusting for relevant sociodemographic and health factors.

### Digital health interventions for hypertension management in US populations experiencing health disparities: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133MEwX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The findings of our study can be evaluated in the context of the growing body of evidence linking health disparities with hypertension management and CVD. While this systematic review and meta-analysis focused on populations experiencing health disparities and assessed digital health interventions for culturally tailored components, we found that 17 studies were specifically focused on enrolling a large proportion of Black and Hispanic individuals. However, subgroup analysis based on whether studies were limited to specific racial or ethnic groups had little effect on statistical heterogeneity. Black and Hispanic adults and individuals with low income and lower level of completed education experience a disproportionately higher burden of hypertension and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality associated with CVD. Moreover, individuals without insurance have been shown to have worse CVD outcomes. These inequities may be driven by individual-, relational-, and system-level inequities. For example, lifestyle behaviors (ie, physical activity, diet, and sleep quality), interpersonal and structural racism and implicit bias, and differences in access to high-quality care can impact BP control rates. Black and Hispanic individuals face an increased level of discrimination, which has been associated with hypertension. In recent years, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals in the US have shown a stagnation and even a decline in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control, with widening gaps in BP control.

### Maternal ethnicity and its impact on the haemodynamic and blood pressure response to labetalol for the treatment of antenatal hypertension [^1129HCKB]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects at least one-quarter of the UK adult population. It is the largest single contributor to the worldwide burden of death and disease, and is responsible for 9.4 million deaths annually.

Black populations in the UK are disproportionately affected by hypertension. Mortality among Caribbean-born UK residents from hypertension-related conditions is 3.5 times the national rate.

Treatment of hypertension dramatically reduces adverse events such as stroke and coronary artery disease. Even modest reductions in blood pressure (BP) markedly lower the risk of mortality from heart disease and stroke.

Outside of pregnancy, the rationale for the treatment of hypertension has been based on considerations of age and ethnicity. For example, the 2011 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, on the treatment of hypertension, states that younger hypertensive patients should be started on an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, while in older patients or those of African or Afro-Caribbean origin, initial therapy should be with a calcium channel blocker.

This NICE clinical algorithm reflects evidence showing ethnic differences in the mechanisms underlying hypertension. Brownhas suggested hypertension may be broadly divided into two categories, a low renin, volume expanded and high-total sodium state, and another, with a high renin, vasoconstricted state.

There are ethnic variations in the expression of renin, with black populations tending to have lower renin than white populations.

Since β-blockers exert their effect primarily by lowering the production of renin by the kidney, it is unsurprising that their effectiveness has been shown to be reduced in black populations. The ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) showed that black people demonstrate less of a fall in BP compared with white people following atenolol treatmentand they respond better to calcium channel blockers and diuretics.

In contrast to the NICE guidance on the management of hypertension outside pregnancy, guidance for treatment in pregnancy recommends all women should be offered labetalol, a non-selective β-blocker which also has α-blocking properties, as first-line therapy. Data regarding its efficacy within pregnancy in different ethnic groups are lacking.

In this study, we examined if there was a difference in the BP and haemodynamic responses between black and white pregnant women who had been started on labetalol treatment. We wanted to assess if the ethnic differences reported in response to β-blockade outside of pregnancy are mirrored in pregnancy, or if gestational cardiovascular changes neutralise these ethnic variations.

### Re-thinking the inclusion of race in British hypertension guidance [^116YAMms]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

What do we know about blood pressure and ethnicity?

First, there is a minimal difference in blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors when comparing Black and White people. A 2013 meta-analysis using results from 13 trials found that there was 4.6 mmHg lower blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors for 2505 Black people compared to 10427 White people. Twelve trials were based in the USA with the remaining trial based in the Netherlands. Whilst there was low risk of publication bias, we wonder whether this data could reliably apply to UK populations. None of the trials considered known confounders such as socioeconomic inequalities or perceived discrimination. A 2020 UK cohort study, using data from 2007 and 2017, found that 4010 Black people had 5.6 mmHg lower anti-hypertensive effect to ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared to 150704 non-Black (including people with Asian heritage) at 12 weeks. This effect persisted one year later without controlling for confounders. Despite this, the overlapping confidence intervals in changes in blood pressure indicates that Black people had a non-significant blood pressure lowering effect to ACE inhibitors and ARBs compared to non-Black people in the UK context. This is more representative of the UK population, compared to the 2013 meta-analysis using populations from the USA and the Netherlands.

Second, the inclusion of race within the hypertension guidelines assumes a distinct biological and genetic homogeneity amongst all Black and White people which contradicts contemporary thought. The blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors is thought to be smaller in Black people as outlined above. Some report that this is due to inherent biological differences between Black and non-Black people such as a lower renin response. Despite this, renin activity varies independently of blood pressure casting doubt on this theory. Genetic differences between members of different races are much smaller than differences between members of the same race. Furthermore, race is a social construct, not a biological one. The classification of Black African or Caribbean lineage is self-ascribed and does not account for people with mixed heritage or people with distant Black ancestry such as grandparents or great-grandparents. People who describe themselves as white may very well have distant Black ancestry. Consequently, it becomes much more difficult for clinicians to base treatment decisions on race and who is judged to be black, especially given immigration from Asia and Africa to the UK over the last 70 years.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^113yrpr4]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study confirms and quantifies the hypothesis that adult black hypertensive patients do generally have a lesser mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy when compared to whites. This meta-analysis provides evidence for current guidelines that recommend that drugs other than ACEI should be preferred for uncomplicated, mild-moderate hypertension in blacks, guidelines that have particular import in sub-Saharan Africa. These results, though, must be taken in the context of other research that provides strong evidence for the benefits of ACEIs in some subgroups of hypertensive black adults, particularly those with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and those requiring multi-drug therapy for their hypertension. For hypertensive black adults in whom ACEI monotherapy is indicated, higher doses may be necessary to obtain the desired reduction in blood pressure.

### Coronary heart disease in moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive black and non-black patients randomized to pravastatin versus usual care: the antihypertensive and lipid lowering to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT-LLT) [^115b2s2H]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In previous analyses in ALLHAT, blacks had a significantly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the pravastatin group compared to the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit from pravastatin. No previous statin trial has reported results separately in blacks.

Objectives

The study aimed to determine if apparent racial differences in CHD in ALLHAT are explained by differences in baseline characteristics, adherence during the trial, or achieved blood pressure and lipid lowering.

Methods

This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Hypertensive, moderately hypercholesterolemic participants were assigned to open-label pravastatin (40 mg/d) or usual care. The outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. We performed intention-to-treat survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, aspirin use, history of CHD and diabetes, and baseline hypertension treatment) and time-varying levels of blood pressure and total cholesterol.

Results

After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there remained a significant interaction between race and treatment group (P = 0.02). In stratified models, blacks in the pravastatin group had a 29% lower risk of CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.57–0.90, P = 0.005) compared to those in the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85–1.19, P = 0.95). With further adjustment for achieved blood pressure and total cholesterol, the HR in blacks was 0.65 (95% CI 0.45–0.96, P = 0.03) and in non-blacks was 1.07 (95% CI 0.81–1.41, P = 0.65).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that pravastatin is effective in preventing CHD in blacks.

### An international comparative study of blood pressure in populations of European vs. African descent [^111cW7X1]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

If the North American-European contrasts are occurring in genetically homogeneous populations, large environmental influences must be at work that are not apparent on the surface. A similar process could be taking place across the social environments into which persons of African origin are assorted within societies such as the US and the UK. The debate over inherent susceptibility cannot be resolved with these data since neither the genetic nor the environmental influences can be held constant, allowing a test of the relative influence of the other factor. In fact, the question of inherent susceptibility is probably non-testable under any circumstances. While the assumption is often made that contrasting environmental influences between blacks and whites can be adjusted by using proxy measures such as education, that assumption does not hold up under close examination. Perhaps more to the point, however, these data demonstrate that the consistent emphasis given to the genetic elements of the racial contrasts may be a distraction from the more relevant issue of defining and intervening on the preventable causes of hypertension, which are likely to have a similar impact regardless of ethnic and racial background. Once the problem of ethnic/racial contrasts is characterized more closely as a special instance of environmental influences at the population level, it could become more tractable in both the realms of research and practice.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease events and deaths among black adults via systolic blood pressure equity [^116osCxs]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

There are disparities in blood pressure (BP) levels by race in the US.

Objective

To estimate the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and deaths that could be prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults by achieving the same mean systolic BP (SBP) as non-Hispanic White adults 45 years or older.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this modeling study, the difference in mean SBP between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White US adults was calculated from the 2015–2020 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The 10-year cumulative incidence of CVD, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure, and CVD mortality for non-Hispanic Black adults were calculated using data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. The relative risk reduction for CVD events and mortality with initiation and intensification of antihypertensive medication treatment was applied from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration (BPLTTC), calibrated to reflect the SBP reduction for non-Hispanic Black adults to have the same SBP as non-Hispanic White adults. Data were analyzed from June 22, 2022, to August 13, 2025.

Exposure

Systolic blood pressure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of CVD events and deaths. Using data from NHANES, REGARDS, and BPLTCC, the cumulative incidence of CVD events and deaths expected over the next 10 years with current SBP levels and with SBP equity was estimated.

Results

Among 82.3 million US adults included in the study, 37.2 million (45.3%) were men, 45.0 million (54.7%) were women, 10.1 million (12.2%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 72.2 million (87.8%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age was 60.8 (0.3) years. The mean SBP was 130.7 (95% CI, 129.0–132.5) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 124.2 (95% CI, 123.1–125.3) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those not taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.5–8.5] mm Hg), and 137.8 (95% CI, 135.8–139.8) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 131.2 (95% CI, 129.7–132.7) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.0–9.1] mm Hg). Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD events during 10 years by 50 434 (95% CI, 33 985–71 137) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 122 881 (95% CI, 83 220–176 826) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD deaths during 10 years by 21 703 (95% CI, 7313–40 278) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 55 055 (95% CI, 19 823–99 693) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. The largest proportion of CVD events and deaths prevented were among those aged 45 to 64 years. For example, more than half of CVD events prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults not taking antihypertensive medication (55%) were in that age group.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this modeling study suggest that achieving SBP equity between non-Hispanic Black and White adults could substantially reduce the number of CVD events and deaths experienced by non-Hispanic Black US adults. Initiatives to maintain normal BP and achieve BP control for individuals with hypertension could have a substantial impact on health equity in the US.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^112PFQqL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.6 Race

In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, Black patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol had a lower risk of stroke, the primary composite endpoint, as compared with Black patients treated with losartan (both cotreated with hydrochlorothiazide in the majority of patients). In the subgroup of Black patients (n = 533, 6% of the LIFE study patients), there were 29 primary endpoints among 263 patients on atenolol (11%, 26 per 1000 patient-years) and 46 primary endpoints among 270 patients (17%, 42 per 1000 patient-years) on losartan. This finding could not be explained on the basis of differences in the populations other than race or on any imbalances between treatment groups. In addition, blood pressure reductions in both treatment groups were consistent between Black and non-Black patients. Given the difficulty in interpreting subset differences in large trials, it cannot be known whether the observed difference is the result of chance. However, the LIFE study provides no evidence that the benefits of losartan on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy apply to Black patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Initiation of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate starting dose of losartan, 25 mg, is not available.

8.8 Renal Impairment

Changes in renal function have been reported in susceptible individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Safety and effectiveness of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) have not been established.

### An international comparative study of blood pressure in populations of European vs. African descent [^111eQ2Nb]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The consistent finding of higher prevalence of hypertension in US blacks compared to whites has led to speculation that African-origin populations are particularly susceptible to this condition. Large surveys now provide new information on this issue.

Methods

Using a standardized analysis strategy we examined prevalence estimates for 8 white and 3 black populations (N = 85,000 participants).

Results

The range in hypertension prevalence was from 27 to 55% for whites and 14 to 44% for blacks.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that not only is there a wide variation in hypertension prevalence among both racial groups, the rates among blacks are not unusually high when viewed internationally. These data suggest that the impact of environmental factors among both populations may have been under-appreciated.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^117TbLMK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

However, the magnitude of the effects of variation in single candidate genes on antihypertensive drug responses appears to be very modest, accounting for only a small percentage of total variation in response when reported (< 5%). Also, we found considerable heterogeneity in the direction of the effect across sex and ancestry groups. Studies of polymorphisms may reflect inheritance of a locus in linkage disequilibrium with the gene variation. Because linkage disequilibrium is affected by the population's history, true associations due to linkage disequilibrium may yield conflicting results in two separate populations. No unique mutation was by itself predictive of the therapeutic response to these drugs, and even the combined effects of polymorphisms did not account for enough variation in response to be clinically useful.

Differences in pharmacodynamics were most consistent, mainly related to the pathophysiology and clinical characteristic of hypertension in patients of African ancestry. In this regard, new views have developed that expand the classical pathophysiology of patients of African ancestry to have low renin hypertension. Low renin in itself does not explain the greater occurrence of hypertension or the enhanced vascular contractility reported in this group, and in the presented data, profiling based on age and ancestry was equal or superior to renin in predicting drug responses. Recent data point to a central role for the balance between NO bioavailability and creatine kinase activity. The NO and CK systems share a common precursor in L-Arginine, and display antagonizing effects with mutual inhibition (Figure 2). NO inhibits CK, lowers blood pressure and promotes cardiovascular health. High CK activity is thought to promote salt retention and vascular contractility, with low renin as an epiphenomenon. Cytoplasmic CK is tightly bound near ATPases, such as Na + K + ATPase and myosin ATPase, to rapidly transfer a phosphoryl group from creatine phosphate to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in situ, and generate ATP near these ATPases, thereby facilitating ion transport and muscle contractility. The high creatine synthesis associated with high creatine kinase activity demands L-Arginine, which is thought to lower NO bioavailability. In line with this, CK is the main predictor of blood pressure in the general population, and of failure of antihypertensive therapy. Patients of African ancestry are reported to have low NO bioavailability, high CK activity, and low L-arginine, with restored NO bioavailability upon L-Arginine supplementation. However, although it is plausible that inter-individual differences in blood pressure lowering efficacy of drugs could be related to the balance between NO and CK activity, with lower efficacy of drugs that require NO synthesis (such as ACE inhibitors), or promote CK-dependent vasoconstriction (β-adrenergic blockers), and higher efficacy of drugs that counteract CK (diuretics and calcium blockers), there are no further clinical data yet to substantiate this. Hitherto, self-defined ancestry remains the best predictor of responses to antihypertensive drugs, and is shown superior to renin status.

### Blood pressure demographics: nature or nurture… genes or environment? [^112a8mLY]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Nonetheless, what is more intriguing and perhaps still not fully explained, is why some populations seem to have a much higher population prevalence of hypertension as compared to others. For instance, the prevalence and incidence of hypertension differs between the non-westernised and westernised populations. Even within the western world, the Afro-Caribbean or African-American black population has a higher prevalence of hypertension and target organ damage related to it, as compared to white Europeans or Americans. Differences also exist within the same region, for example, with people of Eastern European origins having a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to elsewhere in Europe. Understanding the reason(s) behind these geographical and ethnic differences would help devise effective measures in primary prevention.

Cooper et al, writing in BMC Medicine, address the issue of whether there is a truly genetic predisposition or perhaps an environmental influence is to blame for higher rates of prevalence of hypertension seen in some of these ethnic populations. In a well-designed pooled analysis, incorporating eight studies involving 8 white and 3 black populations from the North American, European and African populations – a dataset of nearly 85,000 patients – Cooper et al examined patterns of blood pressure distribution in the different ethnic groups across three continents. They found a wide variation in hypertension prevalence among white and black racial groups, and the rates among blacks were not unusually high when viewed internationally. They therefore suggest that the impact of environmental factors among black and white populations may have been under-appreciated. Specifically, and perhaps contrary to expectations, the prevalence of hypertension was lower amongst the white peoples in Northern America and Canada, as compared to Europe.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^115hCmFc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To study whether treatment recommendations based on age and ethnicity according to United Kingdom (UK) clinical guidelines for hypertension translate to blood pressure reductions in current routine clinical care.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

UK primary care, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017.

Participants

New users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazides.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in systolic blood pressure in new users of ACEI/ARB versus CCB, stratified by age (< v ≥ 55) and ethnicity (black v non-black), from baseline to 12, 26, and 52 week follow-up. Secondary analyses included comparisons of new users of CCB with those of thiazides. A negative outcome (herpes zoster) was used to detect residual confounding and a series of positive outcomes (expected drug effects) was used to determine whether the study design could identify expected associations.

Results

During one year of follow-up, 87440 new users of ACEI/ARB, 67274 new users of CCB, and 22040 new users of thiazides were included (median 4 (interquartile range 2–6) blood pressure measurements per user). For non-black people who did not have diabetes and who were younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval -2.52 to -0.86) relative to ACEI/ARB use at 12 weeks, and a reduction of 0.40 mm Hg (-0.98 to 0.18) in those aged 55 and older. In subgroup analyses using six finer age categories of non-black people who did not have diabetes, CCB use versus ACEI/ARB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure only in people aged 75 and older. Among people who did not have diabetes, systolic blood pressure decreased more with CCB use than with ACEI/ARB use in black people (reduction difference 2.15 mm Hg (-6.17 to 1.87)); the corresponding reduction difference was 0.98 mm Hg (-1.49 to -0.47) in non-black people.

Conclusions

Similar reductions in blood pressure were found to be associated with new use of CCB as with new use of ACEI/ARB in non-black people who did not have diabetes, both in those who were aged younger than 55 and those aged 55 and older. For black people without diabetes, CCB new use was associated with numerically greater reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB compared with non-black people without diabetes, but the confidence intervals were overlapping for the two groups. These results suggest that the current UK algorithmic approach to first line antihypertensive treatment might not lead to greater reductions in blood pressure. Specific indications could be considered in treatment recommendations.

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^113N5ELT]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Although data relating to Asians in the North American literature are limited — and where it is available, "Asian" frequently equates to "Far Eastern" (Chinese, Japanese, etc), — results from several large US studies provide some evidence of ethnic variation in response to antihypertensive drugs. In broad terms, greater falls in BP are achieved with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics in black subjects with hypertension when compared to their white peers; conversely, ACEi are less effective in this cohort. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, patients on chlorthalidone achieved better BP control than those receiving lisinopril or amlodipine. Those using lisinopril had a greater risk for stroke (risk ratio [RR]: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17–1.68), combined cardiovascular disease (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09–1.30), and heart failure (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.10–1.54) compared with those receiving chlorthalidone, treatment differences which were far more pronounced in African Americans when compared with whites. Furthermore, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial researchers reported a higher risk of stroke in African American hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril as opposed to amlodipine (RR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.22–1.86), an association which was not observed in non–African Americans (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.89–1.28). Subsequent meta-analyses reiterate these findings, demonstrating no evident benefit from ACEi in achieving diastolic blood pressure (DBP) goals for African American hypertensive patients. Conversely, ACEi may offer substantial benefits for African Americans with hypertensive renal disease; in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, ramipril slowed renal disease progression in African Americans irrespective of whether proteinuria was present, more so than amlodipine or metoprolol. However, demographic differences with the United Kingdom (eg, a large South Asian population, population "admixture", first/second-generation immigrants as opposed to a population resident for 2–3 centuries), along with variations in vascular risk, diet, and weight, restrict the utility of US data.

### Racial / ethnic disparities in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension-United States, 2003–2010 [^112cqLRm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

The results presented in this report indicate that during 2003–2010, racial/ethnic disparities existed among U.S. adults with hypertension and within hypertension stages for age, awareness, treatment, and health-care coverage. Mexican-Americans and blacks with hypertension were significantly younger than whites. This might reflect earlier onset of hypertension among these racial/ethnic groups. Awareness and treatment was highest among blacks. This association is consistent with previous studies and might be a result of efforts to reduce the persistent high prevalence of hypertension among blacks. Although no significant difference was observed in hypertension treatment by race/ethnicity among those with stage 2 hypertension, treatment was low overall (50%–58%) in this high-risk group, for whom clinical guidelines recommend a two-drug combination. Data on the number or type of medication used by participants, including two-drug combinations, were not examined in this report. A greater proportion of blood pressure control among those treated for hypertension has been observed among Mexican-Americans (74%) and whites (75%) compared with blacks (62%). To improve treatment and achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of blood pressure control in 61.2% of persons with hypertension across all race/ethnic groups, targeted implementation of demonstrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies is necessary.

### Blood pressure control among non-hispanic black adults is lower than non-hispanic white adults despite similar treatment with antihypertensive medication: NHANES 2013–2018 [^114Ps9to]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Controlled blood pressure can prevent or reduce adverse health outcomes. Social and structural determinants may contribute to the disparity that despite equivalent proportions on antihypertensive medication, non-Hispanic Black (Black) adults have lower blood pressure control and more cardiovascular events than non-Hispanic White (White) adults.

Methods

Data from 2013 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were pooled to assess control among Black and White adults by antihypertensive medication use and selected characteristics using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Blood Pressure Guideline definition (systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg) among 4,739 adults.

Results

Among those treated with antihypertensive medication, an estimated 34.9% of Black and 45.0% of White adults had controlled blood pressure. Control was lower for Black and White adults among most subgroups of age, sex, education, insurance status, usual source of care, and poverty-income ratio. Black adults had higher use of diuretics (28.5%-Black adults vs. 23.5%-White adults) and calcium channel blockers (24.2%-Black adults vs. 14.7%-White adults) compared with White adults. Control among Black adults was lower than White adults across all medication classes including diuretics (36.1%-Black adults vs. 47.3%-White adults), calcium channel blockers (30.2%-Black adults vs. 40.1%-White adults), and number of medication classes used.

Conclusions

Suboptimal blood pressure control rates and disparities warrant increased efforts to improve control, which could include addressing social and structural determinants along with emphasizing implementation of the 2017 ACC/AHA Blood Pressure Guideline into clinical practice.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^112KaRBk]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a great need for individual treatment options in hypertensive patients of African ethno-geographical ancestry. Compared with hypertension in other population subgroups, the disorder in these patients is often more severe, more resistant to treatment, and leads to earlier end organ damage and premature death. Thus, hypertension seems to be a more aggressive disease in patients of African ancestry. This has important implications for the choice of an antihypertensive agent.

Antihypertensive drugs were the first cardiovascular therapy for which there was wide recognition of differences in clinical efficacy related to ethno-geographical ancestry. Patients of African ancestry as a group respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics, while the response to β-adrenergic blockade and inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme is attenuated (Table 1). However, there is considerable interindividual variation in this response.

Table 1
Differences in clinical efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in ancestry groups

Legend: Data depicted are pooled estimates (95% confidence intervals) from systematic reviews. ACE-i, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. *Mean blood pressure reduction (mm Hg). † The depicted difference is the weighted pooled difference in response between ancestry groups, with positive values indicating a greater response in patients of African ancestry and negative values indicating a greater response in patients of European ancestry.

Greater knowledge about the potential causes for these differences might lead to more individualized treatment regimens, but to our knowledge, no previous study has systematically addressed why patients of African ancestry may have this specific pattern of responses. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of the factors associated with the differential drug response of patients of African ancestry to antihypertensive drug therapy.

### Update on hypertension in African-Americans [^117AUxJ9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in the U.S. is particularly prevalent and devastating among black individuals, who disproportionately suffer the consequences of this condition to a greater extent compared with persons in other racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore, African Americans are often underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials, limiting the ability to reliably apply the results from many outcome studies in this specific population. In this review, we summarize and analyze the currently available evidence, specifically related to the risk factors, manifestations, complications and management of HTN in this often difficult-to-treat population. The aim of the review is to improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and identify the optimal approach to deliver the best care for African American patients.

### Fallacies and dangers of practicing race-based medicine | AAFP… [^112FiR6u]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The guidelines from the Joint National Committee on the management of high blood pressure recommend against using monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of Black patients with hypertension. 4 This recommendation was heavily influenced by the findings of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, which showed worse cardiovascular outcomes for Black patients treated with lisinopril. 5 This is sometimes translated into the idea that ACE inhibitors are ineffective in Black people, despite the fact that these questionable findings have not been shown in Black patients treated with combination therapy. 6, 7. Even taken at face value, a racial difference in the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor monotherapy is explained by social factors, not genetic causes.

More than a decade ago, the American Heart Association published a report from the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks that linked poor blood pressure control in Black patients to nonphysiologic factors, such as high stress levels, less physical activity, higher rates of obesity, and low-potassium diets. 8 Racial differences in renin-angiotensin activity resolve when Black patients decrease sodium intake, and there is more variation in renin-angiotensin activity within the Black race than there is when comparing Black and White people. 8 Treating Black patients as a monolithic group stereotypes them without considering that they are not all obese and that many follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet and exercise regularly. Despite Black patients having worse outcomes for chronic kidney disease, race-based equations assign a higher GFR to Black patients with the same creatinine value as people of other races.

This is based on questionable racial differences in muscle mass, bone density, and nutritional status. 9–11 As is the case with hypertension, these racial differences are often presented without considering nonbiologic causes or the significant variation within individual races. As one expert asserted, the use of race-based GFR equations will "systematically miss a high-risk group of blacks at a time in the disease course when interventions are crucial. " 12 Inflating GFR in Black patients leads to underdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease in this population and makes it less likely that they will be referred to a nephrologist or become eligible for kidney transplantation. Additionally, the erroneous beliefs about lower effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in Black patients mentioned earlier can prevent those with chronic kidney disease from receiving one of the key medications that can stop disease progression.

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^116BcR8j]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of hypertension also appears to vary between ethnic groups. In the UK South Asian population, elevated sympathetic activity, arising from an increased prevalence of central obesity and insulin resistance, is believed to be causally related to BP, whereas "low-renin" hypertension is commonly described among black adults, with the resulting salt and water retention a significant determinant of BP status. In contrast, salt-sensitive hypertension is relatively infrequent in white adults. Black patients are also reported to express variants of several genes, most frequently a threonine to methionine substitution, T594 M, affecting the renal tubular absorption of sodium and water. Phenotypically akin to Liddle syndrome, this pathophysiological mechanism is primarily mediated via the renal tubular epithelial sodium channel.

Treatment on the basis of these observations has resulted in the use of diuretics in hypertensive adults with low plasma renin activity and antagonists of the renin-angiotensin axis (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs], or β-blockers) in individuals with higher plasma renin activity. In addition to this, the parallels to Liddle syndrome have led a number of authors to advocate the use of amiloride among cohorts of black patients, both in the UK and elsewhere, whereas the elevated sympathetic activity observed among South Asians has been used to justify ACEi, ARB, and β-blocker use in this group.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^111s53eZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While much has changed over the review period pertaining to the management of hypertension, little evolution was seen in the use and meaning of race (Fig. 3 and Appendix D). Hypertension guidelines based on expert analysis of the most current evidence have largely carried forward historical and flawed understandings of race as a biological construct and provided a conduit for translation into clinical practice. While discussions around the causes of inequity in hypertension outcomes have gradually shifted to include social risk, race rather than racism remains centered as an operative factor.

Figure 3
Temporal trend of themes in hypertension guidelines.

Although race is a social construct, the way in which it is used in hypertension guidelines promotes a biological and fixed interpretation at the level of clinical practice and research. Since race categories were not clearly defined, definitions must be assumed or inferred based on normative, yet unscientific, standards that imbed imprecision into guideline frameworks. These factors lead to uncertainties in practice around applications of guideline algorithms when a patient's race is unknown or identified as multiracial. For example, while a signal may be found in research indicating that some individuals who identify as Black respond better to a particular treatment protocol, the heterogeneous nature of race means that this protocol may not be best for all individuals who share a Black identity. This monolithic regard for race that situates disparity in biological difference is not only flawed but distracts from important mediators of racism such as access to healthy foods, environments, and healthcare. Thus, we believe that the continued use of race in this way potentiates harm, primarily by implicating race rather than racism as the explanatory (causal) factor of racial disparities in hypertension. Guidelines not only have missed opportunities to use race to better understand the ill effects of racism on health, but also highlight racism as a root cause and describe best practices for eliminating racial disparities in hypertension by targeting racism specifically.

### A review of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in black patients with hypertension [^115wLCZt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines and recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in black hypertensive patients.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating race-specific outcomes in hypertension were gathered using a MEDLINE search with keywords black, African American, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin system, and hypertension. Studies published from 2000 through April 2018 were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Six guidelines, 8 monotherapy publications, and 5 combination therapy publications included race-specific results and were included in the review. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

Numerous monotherapy trials indicate that black patients may have a reduced blood pressure (BP) response with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with white patients. Conversely, additional studies propose that race may not be the primary predictor of BP response. Reduced efficacy is not observed in trials involving combination therapy. Some studies suggest increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in black patients; however, data are conflicting. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article clarifies vague guideline statements and informs clinicians on the appropriate use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension treatment in black patients through an in-depth look into the evidence.

Conclusions

Potentially reduced efficacy and limited outcomes data indicate that ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not routinely be initiated as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. Use in combination with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic is efficacious in black patients, and there are no data showing that this increases or decreases cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes.

### The impact of sex on blood pressure [^114nyv4u]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide and the leading cause of mortality in both men and women. Despite well documented sex differences in prevalence, risk factors, and treatment responses, current guidelines still fail to take these specificities into account. A more tailored approach, accounting for sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors, is essential.

Recent Findings

Studies show that hypertension is more prevalent in men than in women until menopause. After menopause, the prevalence increases in women, likely due to hormonal changes. Additionally, genetic, metabolic, and social risk factors differ between the sexes, as do cardiovascular risks and associated comorbidities. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variations also impact antihypertensive treatment efficacy and side effects, highlighting the need for a more individualized therapeutic strategy. This review explores the pathophysiology of hypertension by sex, global risk factors with a focus on female-specific aspects, and sex-related cardiovascular risks. We also discuss antihypertensive treatments and their effectiveness based on gender-specific characteristics.

Summary

Incorporating sex differences into hypertension management could enhance treatment efficacy and reduce cardiovascular mortality. Further research is needed to refine guidelines and develop personalized therapeutic strategies, optimizing hypertension care and improving patient outcomes.

### Racial differences in diurnal blood pressure and heart rate patterns… [^112FSkLT]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Results Office BP was similar in blacks and nonblacks, as were 24-hour and daytime BP and HR. However, blacks demonstrated a statistically significant, blunted nocturnal decline in BP and HR. Blacks were significantly more likely than nonblacks to have systolic nondipping, diastolic nondipping, and HR nondipping. On average, blacks have higher rates of hypertension and cardiovascular-renal complications than other racial or ethnic populations in the United States. 1 Abnormal diurnal blood pressure patterns may contribute to the racial disparity in cardiovascular-renal disease. In a meta-analysis of 18 studies of diurnal BP patterns, Profant and Dimsdale2 reported that blacks were significantly more likely to have a blunted nocturnal decline in BP as compared with nonblacks.

A total of 333 ambulatory BP records were available for the present study, including 187 from black participants and 146 from nonblack participants. Baseline demographic characteristics by race are shown in Table 1. In a diverse population of individuals with prehypertension and hypertension who were fed a common diet that is typical of what many Americans eat, blacks had a higher nighttime BP level than nonblacks despite similar levels of daytime BP, 24-hour BP, and baseline office BP. These differences persisted after the effects of lifestyle factors that influence BP were controlled for. In parallel analyses, blacks had a higher HR at nighttime than nonblacks. Racial differences in autonomic regulation have been documented in adults28, 29 and children, 30 and an unhealthy autonomic balance has also been linked to low socioeconomic status.

31 Our observation that nondipping BP and HR are more common in blacks than in nonblacks is consistent with the notion that unhealthy sympathovagal balance may be more prevalent among blacks than nonblacks. In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that blacks and nonblacks have significantly different diurnal BP and HR patterns. These racial differences in diurnal BP patterns are not explained by racial differences in dietary patterns. Correspondence: Megan L.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^115e3S7a]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This propensity score matched cohort study included more than 150 000 people with hypertension in routine primary care in the UK. We found no evidence to support a difference in the blood pressure reductions observed for CCB versus ACEI/ARB among non-black people who did not have diabetes and who were aged above and below 55. In subgroup analyses, however, we found that CCB were associated with larger reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB in people older than 75. Among people who did not have diabetes, our results suggested a numerically greater reduction in systolic blood pressure for CCB versus ACEI/ARB new use among black people compared with non-black people, but the confidence intervals for the reductions overlapped between the two groups indicating no strong evidence for a difference.

We sought to evaluate antihypertensive drug effectiveness and prescribing patterns among self-identified Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), Non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Non-Hispanic White (White) populations that enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a US longitudinal cohort. We employed a self-controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self-reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First-line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants. Effect sizes suggested that most antihypertensive drugs were less effective in Hispanic and Black, compared with White, participants, and statistical significance was reached in 6 out of 19 drugs. These results indicate that Black and Hispanic populations may benefit from earlier intervention and screening and highlight the potential benefits of personalizing first-line medications.

### Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis, blood pressure goals, and pharmacotherapy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115R5oq6]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) remain one of the major causes of pregnancy-related maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Affected women are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life, independently of traditional cardiovascular disease risks. Despite the immediate and long-term cardiovascular disease risks, recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of HDP in the United States have changed little, if at all, over past decades, unlike hypertension guidelines for the general population. The reasons for this approach include the question of benefit from normalization of blood pressure treatment for pregnant women, coupled with theoretical concerns for fetal well-being from a reduction in utero-placental perfusion and in utero exposure to antihypertensive medication. This report is based on a review of current literature and includes normal physiological changes in pregnancy that may affect clinical presentation of HDP; HDP epidemiology and the immediate and long-term sequelae of HDP; the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, an HDP commonly associated with proteinuria and increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes and likely distinct pathological mechanisms; a critical overview of current national and international HDP guidelines; emerging evidence that reducing blood pressure treatment goals in pregnancy may reduce maternal severe hypertension without increasing the risk of pregnancy loss, high-level neonatal care, or overall maternal complications; and the increasingly recognized morbidity associated with postpartum hypertension/preeclampsia. Finally, we discuss the future of research in the field and the pressing need to study socioeconomic and biological factors that may contribute to racial and ethnic maternal health care disparities.

### Analysis of therapeutic inertia and race and ethnicity in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113NGcZN]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension remains a leading modifiable cause of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although blood pressure (BP) control rates improved from 1999 to 2010, they recently declined, especially among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adults with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication. Despite similar treatment rates and increased availability of safe, effective, and affordable antihypertensive medications, BP control rates among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults remain significantly lower than for non-Hispanic White adults among US adults who report taking antihypertensive medication (53.2%, 58.2%, vs 68.2%, respectively). Additionally, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults have a greater prevalence of comorbid diseases associated with pharmacologic treatment resistance, such as chronic kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes. Overall, 51.1% of non-Hispanic White individuals with hypertension in the US have a controlled BP (ie, systolic/diastolic BP of < 140/90 mm Hg), compared with only 42.7% of Black and 42.4% of Hispanic individuals.

The root causes of disparities in BP control are multifactorial and can be attributed to patient-related, clinician-related, and health care system–related barriers. Therapeutic inertia, the phenomenon of clinicians not initiating or up-titrating clinically indicated therapy in the setting of unmet treatment goals, is a clinician-related barrier to controlled BP. The prevalence of therapeutic inertia in hypertension in clinical practice remains high. However, data on racial and ethnic differences in therapeutic inertia in hypertension are limited, and the available data are conflicting. Some studies suggest that therapeutic inertia may be higher, while others show similar or lower prevalence, in Black vs White adults with hypertension. By studying racial and ethnic differences in hypertension-related therapeutic inertia in a clinical trial in which BP care was standardized and protocolized, targeted interventions could be developed and prioritized to improve BP management in all racial and ethnic groups, potentially leading to reduced disparities in BP control and hypertension-related CVD.

### Racial / ethnic disparities in prevalence, treatment, and control of hypertension – United States, 1999–2002 [^113GjbNm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (HBP) is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, end-stage renal disease, and peripheral vascular disease and is a chief contributor to adult disability. Approximately one in four adults in the United States has hypertension. Although effective therapy has been available for more than 50 years, most persons with hypertension do not have their blood pressure (BP) under control. National health objectives for 2010 include reducing the proportion of adults with HBP to 16% (baseline: 28%), increasing the proportion of adults with hypertension who are taking action to control it to 95% (baseline: 82%), and increasing the proportion of adults with controlled BP to 50% (baseline: 18%). During 1990–2000, the prevalence of hypertension, the percentage of those with hypertension who were aware of their condition, and treatment and control of hypertension increased among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 1999–2002. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that racial/ethnic disparities in awareness of, treatment for, and control of hypertension persist. If national health objectives are to be met, public health efforts must continue to focus on the prevention of HBP and must improve awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension among minority populations.

### Losartan potassium (Cozaar) [^116LKJ1g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.6	Race

In the LIFE study, Black patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite endpoint compared with Black patients treated with COZAAR (both cotreated with hydrochlorothiazide in the majority of patients). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death, analyzed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. In the subgroup of Black patients (n = 533, 6% of the LIFE study patients), there were 29 primary endpoints among 263 patients on atenolol (11%, 26 per 1000 patient-years) and 46 primary endpoints among 270 patients (17%, 42 per 1000 patient-years) on COZAAR. This finding could not be explained on the basis of differences in the populations other than race or on any imbalances between treatment groups. In addition, blood pressure reductions in both treatment groups were consistent between Black and non-Black patients. Given the difficulty in interpreting subset differences in large trials, it cannot be known whether the observed difference is the result of chance. However, the LIFE study provides no evidence that the benefits of COZAAR on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy apply to Black patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.7	Renal Impairment

Patients with renal insufficiency have elevated plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite compared to subjects with normal renal function. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment unless a patient with renal impairment is also volume depleted [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8	Hepatic Impairment

The recommended starting dose of COZAAR is 25 mg in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Following oral administration in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5 times and 1.7 times those seen in healthy volunteers. COZAAR has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Overlap between whites and blacks in response to antihypertensive drugs [^113kECtj]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

On average, whites and blacks differ in their response to specific antihypertensive drugs. These differences are often highlighted in reviews and practice guidelines. However, there is wide variation in drug-associated changes in blood pressure within each race. The goal of this meta-analysis is to quantitate how often whites and blacks have similar responses to specific antihypertensive drugs. Computerized searches of MEDLINE (1983 to March 2003) and manual searches of references listed in identified articles were performed. Studies were included if they provided race-specific changes in blood pressure. Fifteen studies with a total of 9307 white subjects and 2902 black subjects were analyzed. For drug-associated changes in diastolic blood pressure, the mean difference between whites and blacks ranged from 0.6 to 3.0 mm Hg while the standard deviation within each race ranged from 5.0 to 10.1 mm Hg. The percentage of whites and blacks with similar drug-associated changes in diastolic blood pressure was 90% (95% confidence interval: 81 to 99) for diuretics, 90% (95% CI: 83 to 97) for beta-blockers, 95% (95% CI: 92 to 98) for calcium channel blockers, and 81% (95% CI: 76 to 86) for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The percentage of whites and blacks with similar drug-associated changes in systolic blood pressure ranged from 83% to 93%. In conclusion, the majority of whites and blacks have similar responses to commonly used antihypertensive drugs. Clinical decisions to use a specific drug should be based on other considerations such as efficacy in individual patients, compelling indications, and cost.

### Why is plasma renin activity lower in populations of African origin? [^1175BynX]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Plasma renin activity is significantly lower in black people compared with whites independent of age and blood pressure status. The lower PRA appears to be due to a reduction in the rate of secretion of renin but the exact mechanistic events underlying such differences in renin release between blacks and whites are still not fully understood. Nevertheless, given the paramount importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of sodium balance, a most likely explanation is that the lower renin is a consequence of differences in renal sodium handling between blacks and whites. The lower PRA does not reflect differences in dietary sodium intake but the evidence available suggests that the low PRA could be part of the corrective mechanisms designed to maintain sodium balance in the presence of an increased tendency for sodium retention in black people. While it is possible that several factors may contribute to the reduced PRA, more recent investigation at the molecular level suggests that the lower PRA may arise from gene variation in the renal epithelial sodium channel. The functional significance of the lower PRA in relation to the different pattern of cardiovascular and renal disease between blacks and whites remains unclear. Moreover, direct investigations of pre-treatment renin status in hypertensive blacks in relation to blood pressure response have demonstrated that the pre-treatment PRA is not a good index of subsequent blood pressure response to pharmacological treatment. Nevertheless, the blood pressure reduction to short term sodium restriction is greater in blacks compared with whites and, in the black subjects, the greater reduction in blood pressure to sodium restriction appears to be related, at least in part, to the decreased responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system.

### Ethnic differences in genetic predisposition to hypertension [^114SRVM2]. Hypertension Research (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified a number of loci significantly associated with systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP). Most of the GWA studies reported to date were conducted in populations of European descent. Given the appreciable ethnic differences in clinical presentation of hypertension, studies in non-European populations allow us to assess the relevance of the findings in Europeans to other ethnic groups and to potentially discover novel variants. Before the GWA scan era, the presence of racial or ethnic differences has been widely recognized for response to antihypertensive therapies, salt sensitivity and impact of obesity on developing hypertension. Despite a limited number of genetic loci that have been proven to show substantial ethnic differences, we can assume four possible genetic mechanisms — (1) absence of target variants in other ethnic groups; (2) presence of allelic heterogeneity; (3) difference in linkage disequilibrium structure; and (4) gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Considering such a number of potential sources of heterogeneity, we should be cautious about claiming the presence of genuine ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility to BP-related traits or hypertension. Approximately a quarter of BP-associated loci that have been reported in four meta-analyses of GWA studies (i.e., 8 out of 34 loci) appear to be common across three ethnic groups — Europeans, east Asians and south Asians. 'Transethnic' BP meta-analysis will be useful not only for revealing novel susceptibility loci and pathophysiological pathways but also for facilitating the fine mapping of common causal variants.

### Ethnic and racial disparities in hypertension management among women [^115vwFnT]. Seminars in Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease for all ethnic and racial groups. Compared with other lifestyle and metabolic risk factors, hypertension is the leading cause of death in women. Women with preeclampsia are three times more likely to develop chronic hypertension and have an elevated risk of future cardiovascular disease. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the factors related to racial and ethnic disparities in blood pressure control. This is followed by a summary of contemporary clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, through lifestyle behavioral modification, and treatment of hypertension with pharmacotherapy.

### Hypertension treatment in blacks: discussion of the U.S. clinical practice guidelines [^116PzcJx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Blacks are especially susceptible to hypertension (HTN) and its associated organ damage leading to adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, HTN is particularly significant in contributing to the black-white racial differences in health outcomes in the US. As such, in order to address these health disparities, practical clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on how to treat HTN, specifically in blacks, are needed. This review article is a timely addition to the literature because the most recent U.S. CPG more explicitly emphasizes race into the algorithmic management of HTN. However, recent clinical research cautions that use of race as a proxy to determine therapeutic response to pharmaceutical agents may be erroneous. This review will address the implications of the use of race in the hypertension CPGs. We will review the rationale behind the introduction of race into the U.S. CPG and the level of evidence that was available to justify this introduction. Finally, we will conclude with practical considerations in the treatment of HTN in blacks.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Determinants of blood pressure response to quinapril in black and white hypertensive patients: the quinapril titration interval management evaluation trial [^116L327H]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Race has been considered an important factor in determining blood pressure response to treatment and selection of antihypertensive drug therapy. Data collected during a clinical trial that evaluated rapidity of medication up-titration with blood pressure response to monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril were used to characterize response in 533 black and 2046 white participants. Our objectives were to examine the influence of race and other factors on blood pressure response and to assess the degree to which nonrace factors account for apparent racial differences in response. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses (baseline minus follow-up) to treatment were assessed with treatment groups combined. Crude systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses averaged 4.7 and 2.4 mm Hg less, respectively, in black compared with white participants; however, the response distributions largely overlapped. In multivariate linear regression models adjusted for study design variables and measured participant characteristics, the racial difference in systolic response was reduced by 51% to 2.3 mm Hg, and diastolic response by 21% to 1.9 mm Hg. In these models, participant characteristics, including age, gender, body size, and pretreatment blood pressure severity, significantly predicted either attenuated or enhanced blood pressure response to treatment. Our findings demonstrate that a large source of variability of blood pressure response to treatment is within, not between, racial groups, and that factors that vary at the level of the individual contribute to apparent racial differences in response to treatment.

### Deconstructing the melting pot in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116TpBof]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease that is typically fatal within 5–7 years of diagnosis for most subjects and occurs in all ancestral populations. Since the initial discovery of BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2) mutation as a cause of PAH, countless publications have further expanded the genetics of PAH, including discoveries of other causative genes and the role of common gene variant associations. Yet, few studies have comprehensively explored how ancestry, race, or ethnicity plays a role in PAH development and response to therapy. The lack of such studies is striking given the intense focus on providing personalized care to patients with PAH. Of course, studies of discrete populations, such as minority groups, are challenging to perform in rare diseases given the small numbers of subjects.

Nearly a decade ago, Gabler and colleagues conducted a pooled analysis of data from placebo-controlled trials of the use of endothelin receptor antagonists in > 1,000 participants with PAH, and uncovered variations in response to endothelin receptor antagonists related to sex and self-reported race. Race-based comparisons focused on black versus white individuals showed a difference in placebo-adjusted beneficial treatment response, favoring white individuals by considerable effect sizes. However, this difference did not meet statistical significance. Although other racial groups were not explored, the study was an important reminder that variations in treatment response may occur among individuals of different racial and ethnic groups. A few subsequent studies reported the impact of self-reported African ancestry; overall, there appears to be a higher degree of severity and perhaps a reduced treatment response among those who self-report as black.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^117CQ5wu]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The main strength of this study is that this is the first systemic review, designed to assess potential causes for the different responses of patients of African ancestry to antihypertensive drugs, including all published papers without language restriction, and considering salt intake, recent development in pathophysiology and pharmacogenomics, as well as resulting differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Our systematic approach reduces over-interpretation of study data, and increases the transparency and reproducibility of the synthesis.

Using this rigid methodology, the data on potential predictors of blood pressure response in patients of African ancestry are far less conclusive than in previously published, non-systematic overviews, with self-defined ancestry remaining the best predictor of responses to antihypertensive drugs. Although there is considerable heterogeneity among persons of sub-Saharan African descent, because of observed group differences in risk for hypertension, the field of hypertension continues to treat this group as a distinct biological entity. We included environmental as well as biological factors, but we are aware that in a real world setting, differences in access to care, clinical management and adherence to treatment may have more impact on morbidity and mortality of patients of African ancestry than the differential response to antihypertensive drugs. Still, in our focus on the effect of drug therapy on blood pressure, we address the most practical aspect of treatment. Lowering blood pressure is the most cost-effective way to reduce the morbidity and mortality of hypertension, and choosing highly effective drugs early in the treatment procedure helps achieve early adequate blood pressure lowering and leads to greater adherence. We also note that for many patients, this would mean using initial combination therapy, but there are insufficient data available to address differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of combination therapy based on ancestry.

### Impact of antihypertensive medication changes after renal denervation among different patient groups: SPYRAL HTN-ON MED [^113222bB]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this analysis. The collection of demographic data on patient race was not reported outside the United States, thus further analysis based on race was not possible within this subgroup. Within the United States, self-identified race is a social contract and is not considered a biologic or genetically defined category. Importantly, there were sizeable differences in detected medication classes at baseline and 6 months between Black Americans, non-Black Americans, and patients outside the United States, which in part reflect differences in treatment per guideline recommendations. Therefore, observed differences between groups likely reflect behavioral and cultural factors, as well as possible differences in health care access and different guidelines between subgroups, rather than genetic differences mediating different physiological responses to the procedure. In addition, baseline 24-hour ambulatory BP patterns were different between patients who enrolled before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with patterns observed in other trials across the United States during the pandemic. – Likewise, over 60% of 6-month follow-up data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 80% of patients in the Expansion cohort enrolled during the pandemic. Moreover, this analysis is limited since the primary end point (between-group difference in mean 24-hour systolic BP at 6 months) was not achieved.

Conclusions

In summary, the cohort of patients enrolled outside the United States, including Europe, Japan, and Australia, showed significant treatment benefit in the RDN group compared with the sham control group for 24-hour ambulatory and office systolic BP, reflective of minimal and balanced medication changes between treatment groups. Increases in hypertensive medication burden and adherence observed in the US sham group, especially among Black Americans, were associated with unexpected BP reductions from baseline that may have diluted the beneficial treatment effect in the overall cohort. Therefore, medication adherence is important to advocate for with better patient education and monitoring in all stages of antihypertensive management. RDN should be considered as an adjunctive therapy to antihypertensive medications but may also be considered in patients who are nonadherent to their medications in the uncontrolled hypertension population.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^111C9nXE]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a growing problem among black adults worldwide. Black adults have the highest age-adjusted rates of hypertension among all racial groups in the United States of America (USA) and Europe. Among black adults in the USA, for example, 44.4% of men and 43.9% of women have hypertension compared to 33.3% in the general population. Black adults also suffer from increased adverse consequences of hypertension due to: 1) more severe hypertension (> 180/110 mmHg), 2) less adequate blood pressure control over the long term, and 3) more comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.

In sub-Saharan Africa, hypertension is epidemic among black adults. Although previously considered rare, the prevalence of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa is rising rapidly due to the effects of urbanization and industrialization on diet, exercise and obesity. In a recent large community-based study in Tanzania, for example, 21% of black adults between the ages of 35–44 years had hypertension; of these, only 18% were aware of their diagnosis, only 14% were on treatment, and only 5% were controlled. Several studies among black adults in Nigeria and South Africa have consistently reported that 15–20% of all hospital admissions in Africa are due to hypertension-related diagnoses. Autopsy and death certificate studies show that a large proportion of in-hospital deaths are hypertension-related even among younger adults.

One frequently cited challenge of treating hypertension among black adults is the lesser blood pressure response to certain medications such as ACE-inhibitors (ACEI). The objectives of this meta-analysis were to combine all currently available evidence from clinical trials of ACEIs to identify the following: 1) if a significant difference in blood pressure response to ACEIs exists between black and non-black populations, 2) the magnitude of this potential difference and 3) whether this potential difference may be explainable by factors other than race.

8.6 Race

In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, Black patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol had a lower risk of stroke, the primary composite endpoint, as compared with Black patients treated with losartan (both cotreated with hydrochlorothiazide in the majority of patients). In the subgroup of Black patients (n = 533, 6% of the LIFE study patients), there were 29 primary endpoints among 263 patients on atenolol (11%, 26 per 1000 patient-years) and 46 primary endpoints among 270 patients (17%, 42 per 1000 patient-years) on losartan. This finding could not be explained on the basis of differences in the populations other than race or on any imbalances between treatment groups. In addition, blood pressure reductions in both treatment groups were consistent between Black and non-Black patients. Given the difficulty in interpreting subset differences in large trials, it cannot be known whether the observed difference is the result of chance. However, the LIFE study provides no evidence that the benefits of losartan on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy apply to Black patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Initiation of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate starting dose of losartan, 25 mg, is not available.

8.8 Renal Impairment

Changes in renal function have been reported in susceptible individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Safety and effectiveness of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) have not been established.

### Racial / ethnic disparities in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension-United States, 2003–2010 [^116GYr7M]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and affects nearly one third of U.S. adults. Because the risk for cardiovascular disease mortality increases as blood pressure increases, clinical recommendations for persons with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 100 mmHg) include a more extensive treatment and follow-up regime than for those with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 140–159 mmHg or DBP 90–99 mmHg). Although racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of hypertension have been well documented; ethnic disparities in the awareness, treatment, and control within blood pressure stages have not. To examine racial/ethnic disparities in awareness, treatment, and control of high blood pressure by hypertension stages, CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the period 2003–2010. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the proportion of Mexican-Americans and blacks with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension was greater than for whites.* Among those with stage 1 hypertension, treatment with medication was significantly lower for Mexican-Americans compared with their non-Hispanic counterparts. Although treatment among persons with stage 2 hypertension did not differ by race/ethnicity, less than 60% of those with stage 2 hypertension were treated with medication. More efforts are needed to reduce barriers to accessing health care and low-cost medication, as well as increasing clinicians' hypertension treatment knowledge and adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Differences in natriuretic peptide response in self-identified white and black individuals: a physiological clinical trial [^112DCQKu]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are a group of cardiometabolic hormones secreted by the heart. In healthy individuals, NPs regulate a range of physiological functions such as vasodilation, natriuresis, glucose utilization, and lipid metabolism. The concentrations of these bioactive peptides are influenced by factors such as body mass index, sex, and race –. NP concentrations have been shown to be lower in Black individuals than their white counterparts. Population-level data has supported that these racial differences in NP concentrations begin in childhood and persist across the age range. Furthermore, circulating NP concentrations decrease with increasing proportion of African ancestry among Black individuals.

Low concentrations of NPs have also been associated with cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The role of low NP concentrations in the development of cardiometabolic diseases has been delineated through multiple lines of evidence, including epidemiological, animal, and genetic studies –. However, the NP system has been shown to be responsive to perturbations. Physiological stimuli such as exercise – and pharmacological interventions such as beta-blockers – have been shown to increase NP concentrations. The prior studies were limited by their assessment of NP response to metoprolol in patients with cardiovascular disease –. Furthermore, the examination of the NP response to the abovementioned perturbations did not take racial differences in the NP system into consideration. Black individuals have lower NP concentrations, which have been attributed to differences in the processing and degradation of NPs by race –. Additionally, the hemodynamic response to exercise and recovery post-exercise also vary by race. Hence, it could be postulated that the responsiveness of the NP system to perturbations may also vary by race. However, data on the NP response to perturbation in Black individuals and their comparison with white individuals is lacking.

12. 3%, P <. 001), combined CHD, and combined CVD. Black participants had significantly higher rates of stroke and ESRD and higher overall mortality. These differences are unadjusted for. the numerous baseline differences between blacks and nonblacks. The treatment comparisons by racial subgroup for the prespecified clinical outcomes are shown in Table 5, Table 6, and Figure 2. As previously reported, no difference was noted between treatment groups in the primary outcome of MI and fatal CHD in either racial subgroup. 11 For amlodipine compared with chlorthalidone, a higher. reported overall RR is the best estimate for both racial subgroups. 11 The relative differences in HF event rates between treatment groups in both racial categories occurred early and decreased over time. For example, in. on preventing cardiovascular outcomes. The findings by race mostly parallel those in the whole cohort and in nonblacks, who comprised two thirds of the participants. The major exception was the outcome for stroke; effects on SBP also differed in blacks and nonblacks. In both racial subgroups as in the whole cohort, neither the ACE inhibitor nor the CCB was. was greater in blacks. The diuretic also was more effective in lowering and controlling BP in blacks, and the difference in effect on stroke in blacks and nonblacks is likely explained in part by the BP differences.

In considering the race-specific differences between treatment groups, BP correlated less with HF than with stroke, a finding confirmed by the recent prospective meta-analysis.

### Re-thinking the inclusion of race in British hypertension guidance [^116VeHmj]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Third, the NICE UK hypertension guidelines are inconsistent, given that initial treatment is assigned on race, but subsequent second line management is not. If race is a criterion for treatment, why would it become irrelevant once initial treatment is ineffective?.

Fourthly, there is no mention of race-based guidance for the use of ACE inhibitors in British NICE guidance such as in heart failure or post-myocardial infarction possibly as the cardio-protective rather than anti-hypertensive effect of prescribed medications is desired.

A factor that we must highlight is the reported increased risk of ACE inhibitor angioedema within Black people that is described in the NICE guidance evidence reviews. A 2006 systematic review compared the risk of ACE-inhibitor angioedema between 55252 Black and 133964 non-Black patients. The data was from 4 US cohort and randomised control trials and 1 multinational trial using US, European, Israeli, Russian and Australian populations. The incidence of ACE-inhibitor angioedema for Black people was 0.43% compared to 0.18% for non-Black people. This would give an almost 3 times higher odds ratio of angioedema for Black people, but the absolute risk is small. A 2005 US trial that was not included in the meta-analysis found a similar odds ratio but higher incidence of angioedema at 1.62% in 1237 Black people compared to 11397 non-Black people. This trial was cited as evidence to use ARBs over ACE inhibitors for Black people as part of recent international hypertension guidance. Interestingly it is not clear how race is defined and whether that was defined by participants or researchers. Both the meta-analysis and trial contain predominantly US data which once again may have limited applicability to British guidelines let alone international guidance. In addition, ACE-inhibitor associated angioedema is apparently not relevant in the treatment of heart failure, reinforcing the view that race as a criterion is unjustified.
