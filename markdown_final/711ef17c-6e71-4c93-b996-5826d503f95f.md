## Question

Is antibiotic prophylaxis required before dental work for patients with a titanium occluder in the heart septum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with a "titanium occluder in the heart septum" (i.e., a transcatheter PFO/ASD closure device) needs antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what device this is and how it heals in the septum. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ESC 2023, ACC/AHA 2021, AHA statements) actually recommend for prophylaxis in congenital heart disease repaired with transcatheter prostheses. Next, I will examine the evidence base regarding dental procedures, everyday bacteremia, and endocarditis risk. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, situation-specific plan with dosing, checking for exceptions such as residual shunt or prior endocarditis [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf] [^112wDTSh] [^1129VkDr] [^117Cpxcv].

> Let me first confirm the device. A "titanium occluder" for the heart septum almost certainly refers to a transcatheter atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale occluder made of nitinol (a nickel–titanium alloy) with fabric, which remains as a permanent intracardiac foreign body and becomes endothelialized over time, typically within months, though the completeness and timing can vary by patient and device [^112qMc5m] [^117Cpxcv].

> Next, I should review the guideline framework before jumping to conclusions. The ESC 2023 infective endocarditis guideline recommends antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for dental procedures in high-risk groups, including patients with prior IE, prosthetic valves or valve repair materials, transcatheter-implanted valve prostheses, and certain congenital heart diseases repaired with prosthesis during the first 6 months after repair provided there are no residual defects; beyond 6 months, AP is generally not advised unless other high-risk features exist [^114BRUvb] [^115bEAhR] [^112HGKiF]. The ACC/AHA 2021 valvular guidelines advise AP for dental procedures in patients with prosthetic valves/materials, prior IE, and in repaired congenital heart disease only if there is a residual shunt or valvular regurgitation adjacent to a prosthetic patch/device; they do not specifically list septal occluders as an independent long-term indication by themselves [^1117ghTf]. The AHA's 2007 and 2021 VGS statements continue the approach of restricting AP to those at highest risk and emphasize oral hygiene to reduce overall risk [^116Tk67d] [^112wDTSh].

> Hold on, let me apply that specifically to a septal occluder. A transcatheter PFO/ASD device is not a valve prosthesis; it's prosthetic material used to repair a congenital interatrial communication. For dental procedures that manipulate gingiva/periapical tissues or perforate oral mucosa, AP is reasonable for the first 6 months after device implantation while endothelialization occurs; after 6 months, AP is generally not recommended if there is no residual shunt and no other high-risk condition such as prior IE or prosthetic valve, which aligns with both ESC 2023 and expert PFO position statements [^114BRUvb] [^1129VkDr] [^117Cpxcv].

> Wait, I should confirm what to do for non-dental procedures. The ACC/AHA guidance advises against AP solely to prevent IE for nondental procedures like TEE or routine GI/GU endoscopy in high-risk valvular disease in the absence of active infection, and by extension a septal occluder alone would not change that recommendation; ESC 2023 suggests considering systemic AP only in high-risk patients undergoing invasive GI/GU procedures, which again would not typically include a well-healed septal occluder without other high-risk features; the AHA 2023 science advisory notes the evidence for nondental procedural links to IE is limited and not based on randomized trials, so routine AP is not supported outside defined high-risk scenarios [^1173L2pL] [^114eTwUw] [^111hVmR5] [^1153dkrk] [^1116PWSo] [^112jVbWy].

> But wait, let's not jump to conclusions about benefits. I need to check the strength of evidence. Systematic reviews, including Cochrane, have not demonstrated that dental AP reduces IE events, largely due to a lack of randomized trials and the rarity of outcomes; large observational and quasi-experimental analyses are mixed, with several showing no population-level increase in VGS-IE after deimplementation of dental AP, while others suggest possible associations or procedure-specific risks; overall, guideline committees continue to restrict AP to those at highest risk while emphasizing oral hygiene and individualized judgment in gray zones [^112j5foy] [^112KK3nW] [^114gsg27] [^1179pm8n] [^117H7Qjf] [^112Wmy9d] [^111Hegjy].

> I will now examine the particular risk of device-related infection. Infective endocarditis on atrial septal occluders is rare but documented even late after implantation, sometimes associated with incomplete endothelialization on one device surface; these are uncommon case reports and do not, by themselves, justify indefinite AP, but they underscore the importance of periprocedural precautions early after implantation and vigilance for symptoms [^114iBNkv] [^113mucC9] [^114GpyFu].

> Let me translate this into a practical plan, and I need to ensure dosing is correct. If the occluder was implanted within the past 6 months, give dental AP for procedures involving gingival manipulation, periapical region, or mucosal perforation, or defer elective dental work until after 6 months if feasible; a standard adult regimen is amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before the procedure, with alternatives for penicillin allergy such as azithromycin or clarithromycin 500 mg orally, or cephalexin 2 g orally if no immediate-type hypersensitivity; if unable to take oral meds, ampicillin 2 g IV/IM or cefazolin/ceftriaxone 1 g IV/IM are options; this aligns with AHA VGS prevention statements and expert PFO summaries, though I should emphasize the indication window is the first 6 months post-implant in the absence of other high-risk conditions [^112wDTSh] [^116Tk67d] [^117Cpxcv] [^114BRUvb] [^1129VkDr].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach after 6 months. Beyond 6 months post-closure, if there is no residual shunt adjacent to the device and the patient has no other qualifying high-risk condition (e.g., prior IE, prosthetic valve), routine dental AP is not recommended; if echocardiography demonstrates a residual shunt or regurgitation adjacent to prosthetic material, ACC/AHA considers that an indication for dental AP, so confirming shunt status at follow-up is clinically useful; in all scenarios, meticulous oral hygiene and regular dental care likely matter more than episodic AP [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^114SYay3] [^117Cpxcv].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting national guidance. The UK NICE position is that routine dental AP should not be offered to any group, which differs from cardiology society guidance; in practice, for a septal occluder patient without other high-risk features, both approaches converge on no long-term AP beyond the initial 6-month healing window, so shared decision-making and local policy alignment are reasonable if concerns persist [^117H7Qjf] [^1141hHsg] [^114BRUvb] [^112wDTSh].

---

No, patients with a titanium heart septal occluder **do not need antibiotic prophylaxis** [^1117ghTf] before dental work if the device was implanted more than 6 months ago [^1129VkDr] and there are no residual defects or other high-risk cardiac conditions [^112wDTSh]. Prophylaxis is recommended **only within the first 6 months after implantation** [^1117ghTf] [^1129VkDr] or if there are residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the device site [^114BRUvb]. After 6 months [^117Cpxcv], if the device is fully endothelialized and there are no residual defects, **prophylaxis is not indicated** [^114BRUvb].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Recent ACC/AHA (2021) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC, 2023) guidelines provide clear recommendations on antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) in patients undergoing dental procedures [^115bEAhR]. The **ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines** [^1117ghTf] recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves, prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repairs, previous IE, or unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects. Similarly, the **ESC 2023 guidelines** [^114BRUvb] recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for dental extractions, oral surgery procedures, and procedures requiring manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of the teeth in patients with prosthetic valves, previous IE, untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease, or ventricular assist devices [^112HGKiF].

---

## Specific recommendations for septal occluder devices

Septal occluder devices, including titanium occluders, are used to close atrial septal defects (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO) [^1129VkDr]. These devices are **typically endothelialized within six months** [^117Cpxcv] after implantation, significantly reducing the risk of infective endocarditis. According to the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, **antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for the first six months after device implantation** or indefinitely if there are residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of the device [^1117ghTf]. After six months, if the device is fully endothelialized and there are no residual defects, **antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer indicated** [^1129VkDr] [^112wDTSh].

---

## Risk of infective endocarditis associated with titanium septal occluder devices

The risk of infective endocarditis associated with titanium septal occluder devices is **generally low** [^112wDTSh], particularly after the initial six-month post-implantation period. Nevertheless, rare cases have been reported [^113mucC9], typically within the first six months after implantation or when residual defects are present [^117Cpxcv] [^114iBNkv]. Additionally, Kitamura et al. (2021) [^114GpyFu] highlighted the need for close monitoring for late complications, including infective endocarditis, after percutaneous atrial septal defect closure. However, the overall incidence of infective endocarditis in patients with fully endothelialized devices **is extremely low** [^1129VkDr] [^112wDTSh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current guidelines

The current guidelines are supported by clinical evidence demonstrating that antibiotic prophylaxis **significantly reduces the risk of infective endocarditis in high-risk patients** undergoing invasive dental procedures, and a nationwide population-based cohort study published in BMJ (2017) found a significant association between invasive dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis in high-risk patients, supporting the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients. The same study found no significant association between invasive dental procedures and infective endocarditis in low-risk patients, suggesting that **antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary in this population**.

---

## Potential risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis **carries potential risks** [^112j5foy], including allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, and adverse drug reactions. Therefore, the decision to administer prophylaxis must balance the potential benefits of preventing infective endocarditis against these risks. In patients with titanium septal occluder devices, the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh the risks **only during the initial six-month period post-implantation** or in the presence of residual defects. After six months, as the risk of infective endocarditis is significantly reduced, the risks associated with prophylaxis generally outweigh the benefits [^116Tk67d].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Antibiotic prophylaxis recommended?** |
|-|-|
| Within 6 months post-implantation | Yes |
| Residual shunt or valvular regurgitation at device site | Yes |
| Fully endothelialized device (> 6 months post-implantation) without residual defects | No |

---

Patients with a titanium occluder in the heart septum **do not need antibiotic prophylaxis before dental work** if the device was implanted more than six months ago and there are no residual defects [^1117ghTf]. Prophylaxis is recommended only within the first six months after implantation or if residual shunts or valvular regurgitation are present at the device site [^114BRUvb].

### Patent foramen ovale closure with the Gore septal occluder: initial UK experience [^112qMc5m]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to report the procedural outcomes and short-term follow-up data for the Gore septal occluder (GSO), a new device for the closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO).

Transcatheter closure of PFO is an established treatment modality; however, no device provides a perfect solution. The GSO has several design features that make it potentially attractive for closing defects in the atrial septum.

Data were collected from nine centers in the United Kingdom that implanted the GSO device, and these data were submitted to an electronic registry for evaluation. A total of 229 patients undergoing PFO closure from June 2011 to October 2012 were included. The indications for closure were: secondary prevention of paradoxical cerebral emboli (83.4%), migraine (2.1%), platypnoea orthodeoxia (3.9%), and other (10.5%).

The median PFO size was 8 mm, and 34% and 39%, respectively, had long tunnel anatomy or atrial septal aneurysms. A GSO was successfully implanted in all cases. A single device was used in 98% of cases, but in four patients, the initial device was removed and a second device was required. Procedural complications occurred in 3%, and later complications (e.g. atrial fibrillation, atrial ectopics, and device thrombus) occurred in 5.7% of cases. All patients underwent clinical and echocardiographic follow-up, and all devices remained in their positions. Early bubble studies (median 0 months) with the Valsalva maneuver in 67.2% of the patients were negative in 89%.

In conclusion, the GSO is an effective occlusion device for the closure of PFOs of all types. Longer-term follow-up, particularly to document later closure rates, is required.

### In adults, risk for infective endocarditis varied for invasive dental procedures and by antibiotic prophylaxis [^116N38xc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This study discusses the varying risk of infective endocarditis in adults undergoing invasive dental procedures, highlighting the role of antibiotic prophylaxis.

- **Background**: Infective endocarditis is a severe heart infection that can occur after invasive dental procedures. It is essential to understand the associated risks to manage patient care effectively.

- **Study design**: The research evaluates data from multiple adult cohorts to assess the risk levels for infective endocarditis. This analysis focuses on comparing different procedures and antibiotic prophylaxis protocols.

- **Findings and implications**: The study found significant variations in infection risk depending on the type of dental procedure conducted and whether antibiotic prophylaxis was used. These findings suggest a need to personalize prophylactic strategies to the patient's specific situation and risk profile. Recommendations include tailoring antibiotic use to optimize patient outcomes and minimize unnecessary exposure to antibiotics.

### Patent foramen ovale closure versus drug therapy in patients over 60 years and a follow-up of 5 years [^113sXVCU]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Post-interventional treatment in group A**: Post-intervention, patients took 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 3 months and 100 mg of aspirin per day for up to 9 months. Endocarditis prophylaxis was performed for 6 months. Every patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) before being discharged from the hospital to ensure correct placement of the device. All patients were screened for post-interventional bleeding, defined as a reduction of hemoglobin count of ≥ 2 mg/dl.

	- All study participants were clinically examined at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Afterwards, patients were contacted for annual follow-up via telephone. The centrally recorded database was subsequently evaluated by nurses and physicians. The telephone interviews with patients or their close relatives included questions relating to the appearance of cardiac death (diagnosed cardiovascular cause or death from unknown reasons, not related to cardiovascular cause) and hospitalization due to recurrent neurological symptoms or thromboembolic events. If hospitalization occurred, the general practitioner responsible was consulted for further details.

	96% of patients remained active in the follow-up program. 4% of patients did not respond to follow-up consultations and were excluded from this study. Follow-up studies took place over a mean time of 5.5 ± 1.5 years.

- **Medical treatment in group B**: All patients were treated with 100 mg of aspirin per day and did not undergo interventional preventive measures with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) occluder.

	- The follow-up program was identical to that of Group A with 94% remaining active in follow-up studies. The remaining 6% were excluded.

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^112KK3nW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart with a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures, antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England as well as Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness, or the incidence of endocarditis.

- **Search methods**: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few if any trials would be available.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112wDTSh]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only four categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcomes. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

- **Methods and results**: A writing group was formed consisting of experts in the prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis, including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were done for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency, morbidity, or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

- **Conclusions**: On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population-based cohort and a case crossover study [^1165vmws]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

In our case crossover analysis, we found a low rate of invasive dental procedures during the three months preceding oral streptococcal infective endocarditis (5.1%, but consistent with the literature), showing that most cases of streptococcal infective endocarditis were not associated with recent dental procedures. Notably, this case crossover analysis was not affected by recall bias, as dental procedures were retrieved from the SNIIRAM database. In a recently published case-control study performed in patients with infective endocarditis admitted to hospital in six French tertiary care hospitals (regardless of predisposing heart conditions), we showed that 16.9% of participants with definite streptococcal infective endocarditis had undergone dental procedures during the preceding three months.

Although the case crossover analysis revealed a statistically significant association between invasive dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among participants with prosthetic heart valves, there is no good evidence to support a different effect between invasive and non-invasive dental procedures, probably as a result of lack of power (P = 0.07). We failed to show the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis, again possibly owing to the lack of power attributable to the small number of participants in the different subgroups included in the antibiotic prophylaxis dental procedures model, in which only discordant pairs contributed.

- **Limitations of this study**: Both the cohort and the case crossover study present several limitations. Firstly, they are subject to the limit…

### Secondary stroke prevention: patent foramen ovale, aortic plaque, and carotid stenosis [^114S4335]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

In the medical management of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in stroke prevention, it is recommended that all patients undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) prior to the intervention. This is crucial for the initial diagnosis of PFO and a detailed delineation of the anatomy, which includes associated conditions such as atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) and Eustachian valve. A critical assessment of right-to-left shunt should also be conducted. The procedure, which may be performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia, generally takes less than 30 minutes. Patients can resume unrestricted physical activity within a few hours post-intervention. Additionally, the use of antibiotics during the procedure is standard, with endocarditis prevention recommended for several months until the closure device is fully covered by tissue.

- **Device implantation success and follow-up treatments**: Failed implantation due to inability to cannulate the PFO is exceedingly rare, with a success rate expected at 90%. Post-procedure, follow-up includes administering acetylsalicylic acid (80–300 mg daily) for 1–6 months, with some centers adding clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for the same duration. Three to six months after percutaneous PFO closure, a contrast TOE should be repeated to assess for residual shunt after endothelial overgrowth and to exclude thrombosis of the device. While transcranial Doppler is an alternative, it cannot definitively rule out thrombus presence on the device. If the PFO is fully closed, all medication may be discontinued unless indicated for another condition, such as associated coronary artery disease.

### Can we really do without antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis [^1129fVBS]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Guidance advises against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis around the time of dental intervention for the prevention of infective endocarditis. The authors report the case of a previously well patient with an asymptomatic isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) who developed evidence of systemic and pulmonary emboli due to infection following dental treatment. A diagnosis of severe endocarditis of a previously normal native mitral valve was made. She subsequently underwent surgical repair of her mitral valve and closure of her VSD. She was deemed fit for discharge on parenteral antibiotics on the thirtieth postoperative day. The authors highlight the need for further re-evaluation of the issues surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis in the context of dental procedures.

### Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among individuals at high risk following dental treatment: A nested case-crossover and case-control study [^114gsg27]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The risk of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis (VGS-IE) in individuals at high risk following bacteraemia due to invasive dental procedures (IDPs) compared to daily bacteraemia remains unclear. If no association exists, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics (AP) in dentistry for the prevention of VGS-IE may not be clinically justified.

Individuals with a history of infective endocarditis (IE), a prosthetic heart valve, or complex congenital heart disease (CHD) are considered high-risk since the incidence rates of IE are higher in these groups compared to the general population. Approximately 25–30% of IE cases are caused by VGS commonly found in the oral cavity, which may be associated with chewing, brushing, or dental procedures. European and American guidelines recommend that individuals at high risk receive AP before IDPs, such as dental extractions, the removal of dental calculus, and oral surgical procedures, to mitigate the risk of VGS-IE. However, expert committees revising these guidelines have acknowledged the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of AP in preventing VGS-IE, suggesting that VGS-IE is more likely due to daily bacteraemia from chewing and brushing rather than occasional dental procedures.

Recent studies using national data from England as well as Sweden, where prophylaxis is not routinely recommended since 2008 and 2012 respectively, reported no increase in VGS-IE incidents following the guideline changes. In England, a 2016 addendum reiterated that routine prophylaxis is not recommended, although amoxicillin prescriptions among dentists have not increased.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^116ZnUDa]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for infective endocarditis, specifically concerning the timing of surgery, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering urgent or emergency surgery. This decision should weigh the likelihood of achieving a meaningful neurological outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and an unstable clinical status due to heart failure (HF), uncontrolled infection, or persistent high embolic risk.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing bacterial endocarditis following dental procedures [^112j5foy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection that occurs in the lining of the heart chambers. While it can be caused by fungi, it is most often attributed to bacterial infection. Many dental procedures can result in bacteraemia, which may lead to bacterial endocarditis in a small proportion of individuals. Although the incidence of bacterial endocarditis is low, the condition has a high mortality rate.

Guidelines in various countries recommend administering antibiotics to individuals who are at high risk of endocarditis before undergoing invasive dental procedures. However, guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England as well as Wales advises against the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures. This is an update of a review initially conducted in 2004 and last updated in 2013.

- **Primary objective**: To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no antibiotic administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis, influences mortality, serious illness, or the incidence of endocarditis.

- **Secondary objectives**: To determine whether the effect of dental antibiotic prophylaxis differs in people with various cardiac conditions that predispose them to an increased risk of endocarditis, as well as in individuals undergoing different high-risk dental procedures.

- **Harms**: We found no evidence from randomized controlled trials or cohort studies on whether prophylactic antibiotics affected mortality or serious illness.

### Commentary: Don't leave patients to their own devices: Consider long-term complications after percutaneous atrial septal defect closure [^114GpyFu]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is an important late complication after ASD device closure.

- **Central message**: Patients undergoing percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects require close monitoring for late complications such as infective endocarditis, cardiac erosion, and valve damage.

Percutaneous device closure of atrial septal defects (ASDs) was introduced in the late 1990s as a feasible alternative to surgical repair. Since then, several studies have shown that short-term outcomes and complication rates after percutaneous ASD closure are noninferior to those after surgery. However, an important consideration with percutaneous ASD closure is the prevalence of late complications that have come to light after its widespread adoption. Some of these, including cardiac erosion, thromboembolism, and infective endocarditis, carry significant morbidity and mortality. Kitamura and colleagues present a case report of a 20-year-old man with atopic dermatitis and a secundum ASD who was treated with Amplatzer device (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill) closure and developed endocarditis with large mobile vegetations 3 years later. The authors concluded that ASD closure devices are associated with risks of thrombotic and infectious complications over the long-term.

### Investigation of the impact of the NICE guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England: an electronic health records study [^112Wmy9d]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is an uncommon but serious infection, for which the evidence for giving antibiotic prophylaxis to people undergoing invasive dental procedures is inconclusive. In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued guidelines recommending that antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures should no longer be routinely offered to people at risk of infective endocarditis in England. This was in contrast to American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines issued around the same time, which continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis in certain high-risk cases, e.g. patients with prosthetic heart valves or who had had infective endocarditis previously.

Although much research on the impact of guideline changes on the incidence of infective endocarditis has been conducted internationally, and in particular a study in England showed an increase in cases following the NICE guideline change, no consensus has been reached. In a 2016 update to their guidelines, NICE reaffirmed their previous position, while clarifying that doctors and dentists should still apply their clinical judgement on a case-by-case basis.

A recent study of ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) diagnosis codes used to represent infective endocarditis cases at two large English hospital trusts concluded that the inclusion criteria for observational studies using electronic health records (EHRs) need to be selected very carefully, as even when specific diagnostic cod-

### Closure versus medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale and a history of cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111CB5mX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

The optimal therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in people with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) has not been clearly defined. The choice between medical therapy (antithrombotic treatment with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants) and transcatheter device closure has been the subject of intense debate over the past several years. Despite the lack of strong scientific evidence, a substantial number of individuals undergo transcatheter device closure (TDC) for secondary stroke prevention.

- **Objectives**: To compare the safety and efficacy of TDC with the best medical therapy alone for preventing recurrent strokes (fatal or non-fatal) or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in people with PFO and a history of cryptogenic stroke or TIA. This includes identifying specific subgroups of people most likely to benefit from closure for secondary prevention and assessing the cost-effectiveness of this strategy, if possible.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (July 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2014), and EMBASE (1980 to July 2014). To identify unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched seven trials registers and checked reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding, publication status, and language, comparing the safety and efficacy of device closure with medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke or TIA in people with PFO and a history of cryptogenic stroke or TIA.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1147QxcG]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

The starting point for this review was the previous 2012 guideline, and we sought evidence that warranted a change from previous recommendations. The Working Party was recruited from the BSAC membership and specialist cardiology societies that might wish to be involved in the preparation of the guideline, with each society nominating a participant following approval from their respective governance structures. Other members were invited to ensure diverse expert and non-expert representation, including infection specialists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pharmacists, laboratory scientists, and a patient and public representative.

The joint Working Party comprised members of the BSAC, the British Cardiovascular Society, the British Heart Valve Society, the British Society of Echocardiography, the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and the British Infection Association. The British Congenital Cardiac Association joined later in the process and contributed to the final guideline.

During a face-to-face meeting, an initial scoping exercise was undertaken by Working Party members to identify key clinical questions concerning the delivery of specialist IE services to patients in the UK NHS. This was followed by a round-table discussion to determine and prioritize principal guideline topics. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken (see online supplemental file for search strategy and methods for screening and selection of papers for inclusion), followed by the development of initial recommendations from the literature review.

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: A national cohort study [^114TxKmu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Individuals with prior infective endocarditis (IE), a prosthetic heart valve, or a cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk of developing IE. The incidence of IE among the overall population has been reported to be 2–7 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Among high-risk groups, however, incidence rates of IE are 100 times higher compared with the general population. In Sweden, with a population of approximately 10 million individuals, there are about 600 cases of IE per year, of which 25%–30% are caused by oral viridans group streptococci (VGS-IE).

American and European guidelines state that high-risk individuals should receive antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures to reduce the risk of post-procedural VGS-IE, despite a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of the prophylaxis. However, the United Kingdom and Sweden are the only countries that have discontinued AP for individuals considered to be at high risk for developing IE.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^115zBmBZ]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

In the absence of high-quality evidence, all new recommendations in this section represent Working Party consensus. Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon and challenging condition, and management by experienced multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) is widely considered to be the standard of care. In our opinion, the primary aim of the IE team is to improve patient outcomes, with a secondary aim to improve efficiency of care. The need for IE teams in all hospitals is axiomatic, since patients with IE or suspected IE can present to any acute hospital. However, this has not been sufficiently emphasized. The functions and composition of an IE team will vary in different settings and may need to be dynamic, allowing individuals to rotate into the role depending on resources and local staffing arrangements.

- **Functions of the multidisciplinary IE team**: We believe that early diagnosis of IE leads to improved outcomes, but this is likely dependent on the early initiation of optimal antibiotic therapy and the optimal timing of surgery. A reduction in time to targeted antibiotic therapy and the first transthoracic echocardiogram was observed in one MDT evaluation. Educational packages to raise awareness of the risk of IE in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia may also help to speed diagnosis. One of the factors likely to positively affect outcomes for many patients is prompt access to cardiac surgery. Since this is best assessed in a heart center, there is a need for clear pathways for consultation and referral between non-surgical and surgical centers and objective criteria to guide referral.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^117H7Qjf]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, and any concurrent change in the incidence of infective endocarditis, following the introduction of a clinical guideline by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008, which recommended the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

The study design was a before and after study.

The setting was in England.

The population included all patients admitted to hospitals in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin, and the monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospital, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

Results indicated that after the introduction of the NICE guideline, there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from a mean of 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2,292 (SD 176). There was no evidence that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis observed before the guideline was significantly altered after its introduction (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the introduction of the guideline. Similarly, an increase in infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospitals was not observed.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1141hHsg]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

There is concern that the period of follow-up was not long enough. However, in over 90% of cases, the incubation period for infective endocarditis is less than six weeks, and other studies have used three months as the cut-off for capturing all cases of infective endocarditis that will develop after exposure to the risk of infection. We believe that if antibiotic prophylaxis was effective in preventing infective endocarditis, the large decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis that occurred after the introduction of the NICE guideline would have resulted in a detectable increase in cases during the 25 months of the study. Any such change should have been particularly noticeable among those cases where the causal organism was of possible oral streptococcal origin. Regardless, we intend to periodically monitor the rate of endocarditis in the English population over time.

The 78.6% decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in the months after the introduction of the guideline was substantial and suggests much better compliance than is often seen after policy changes in medicine. Compliance was particularly good among dentists who, as well as being strongly urged to adopt the new guidelines by the chief dental officer, NICE, and the dental press, were advised by the malpractice insurance organizations that it would be difficult to defend cases where the new guidelines had not been followed. A residual level of prescribing does, however, seem to persist at around 20% of the level before the guideline. There are several possible explanations for this. First…

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^117VUob7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the heart with a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures, antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England as well as Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE influences mortality, serious illness, or endocarditis incidence.

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy from the previous review was expanded and run on MEDLINE (1950 to June 2008) and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers. Additionally, the strategy was applied to the following databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); EMBASE (1980 to June 2008); and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to June 2008).

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotics compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Do the changes make sense? A critical review [^111JqndQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

- **Recent findings**: The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

- **Summary**: While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis, there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Late bacterial endocarditis of an Amplatzer atrial septal defect occluder device [^114iBNkv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old man, with a large secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) that had been repaired percutaneously 30 months previously with an Amplatzer ASD occluder (ASO), presented with fevers and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 1.5 × 1.5 cm mobile mass on the left atrial side of his ASO consistent with a vegetation. When the ASO was explanted, the left atrial side of the device was poorly endothelialized. In conclusion, the present report is the first description of late infective endocarditis in an adult with an ASO.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis incidence following invasive dental procedures: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Hegjy]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis after invasive dental procedures is still unclear. Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis were restricted by guidelines beginning in 2007.

To systematically review and analyze existing evidence on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures, a comprehensive search was conducted. PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, Proquest, Embase, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from inception to May 2023.

Studies included were those examining the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures, as well as time-trend analyses of infective endocarditis incidence before and after the introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. The quality of the studies was evaluated using structured tools, and data were extracted by independent observers. A pooled relative risk (RR) of developing infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures for individuals receiving antibiotic prophylaxis versus those who were not was computed using a random-effects meta-analysis.

The main outcome of interest was the incidence of infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis. Of the 11,217 records identified, 30 studies were included, encompassing 1,152,345 infective endocarditis cases. These studies comprised 8 case-control/crossover or cohort studies, including 12 substudies.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^111f4uyM]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a rare but severe disease with an in-hospital mortality rate of about 20% and a five-year mortality rate of 40%. This disease is also associated with high morbidity and a significant cost burden, as the treatment of infective endocarditis requires a prolonged hospital stay, and one out of two patients undergoes valve surgery during the acute phase of the disease.

Strategies for antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis have been proposed for many years for patients with heart disease who are at risk of infective endocarditis and undergoing invasive procedures responsible for bacteremia, despite the lack of proof of efficacy. Neither randomized clinical trials, which provide the highest level of evidence, nor cohort studies have been conducted to support an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy. Over the past three decades, five case-control studies have been conducted; only two of them established an association between dental procedures and streptococcal infective endocarditis, and none were sufficiently powered to establish the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis.

In addition to the lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy, statistical modeling showed that "everyday low-level bacteremia" occurring after tooth brushing, flossing, or chewing (and not covered by antibiotic prophylaxis) may more frequently trigger oral streptococcal infective endocarditis bacteremia than invasive dental procedures. Based on these hypotheses, the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis have been restricted to two different scenarios.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112DEFQs]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years, antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteremia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in between 18% and 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35–45%.

Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors, therefore, suggest that the focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medico-legal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, particularly in patients with neurological complications, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend performing valve surgery without any delay following a stroke if the patient has heart failure, uncontrolled infection, abscess, or persistent high embolic risk. This recommendation holds as long as the patient is not in a coma and cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by cranial CT or MRI.

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2016–2018 [^1128pnob]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) using medical and prescription claims data of patients from the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤ 2 days' supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. Appropriateness of prophylaxis was defined on the basis of the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression.

- **Results**: Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^1122GqJG]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the relation between invasive dental procedures and infective endocarditis associated with oral streptococci among people with prosthetic heart valves.

- **Design**: Nationwide population-based cohort and a case crossover study.

- **Setting**: French national health insurance administrative data linked with the national hospital discharge database.

- **Participants**: All adults aged more than 18 years, living in France, with medical procedure codes for positioning or replacement of prosthetic heart valves between July 2008 and July 2014.

- **Main outcome measures**: Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis was identified using primary discharge diagnosis codes. In the cohort study, Poisson regression models were performed to estimate the rate of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis during the three-month period after invasive dental procedures compared with non-exposure periods. In the case crossover study, conditional logistic regression models calculated the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals comparing exposure to invasive dental procedures during the three-month period preceding oral streptococcal infective endocarditis (case period) with three earlier control periods.

- **Results**: The cohort included 138,876 adults with prosthetic heart valves (285,034 person-years); 69,303 (49.9%) underwent at least one dental procedure. Among the 396,615 dental procedures performed, 103,463 (26.0%) were invasive and therefore presented an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis, which was performed in 52,280 (50.1%). With a median follow-up of 1.7 years, 267 people developed infective endocarditis.

### Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among individuals at high risk following dental treatment: a nested case-crossover and case-control study [^1179pm8n]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Between July 1, 2008, and January 1, 2018, 240 cases of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis (VGS-IE) occurred among 76,762 individuals at high risk (Fig. 1). During the same period, 98,247 invasive dental procedures (IDPs) were performed in the cohort: 624 occasions of oral surgery, 44,190 tooth extractions, and 53,433 sessions of subgingival scaling (removal of dental calculus).

The case-control study could not confirm that IDPs were more common among cases than controls, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.64–2.3. Eleven (4.6%) cases and 98 (4.1%) controls underwent IDPs during the three months preceding VGS-IE. Four out of the eleven cases temporally associated with IDPs occurred after October 2012, when the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) in Swedish dentistry was recommended (Fig. 3).

- **Figure 3**: Cases of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis temporally associated with invasive dental procedures. Legend: The red dotted line represents the time of the recommended cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry for the prevention of viridans streptococcal infective endocarditis (VGS-IE) in October 2012. Four out of the eleven invasive dental procedures temporally associated with VGS-IE occurred after the change.

The case-crossover study could not confirm that IDPs were more common during the three months prior to VGS-IE than during reference periods, with an OR of 0.86 and a 95% CI of 0.34–2.18 (Table 2). Stratification on procedure did not alter these results. No OR could be calculated for oral surgery because no such procedures were detected during case or reference periods.

### Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Current tendencies, continuing controversies [^114ToEa4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality and typically results from the combination of bacteraemia (sometimes provoked) and a predisposing cardiac condition. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis has been recommended by various countries based on the supposed pathophysiology of the disease; however, no randomised clinical trial has confirmed its efficacy.

We review data presented over the past few decades, challenge the principles underlying prophylaxis recommendations, and analyse the arguments explaining the recent trend to decrease prophylaxis indications. Such arguments include the probable significant role of everyday-life bacteraemia in the occurrence of infective endocarditis, the estimated vast number of prophylaxis doses required to prevent a single case, and the lack of scientific evidence to identify procedures that should necessitate prophylaxis. Recommendations for prophylaxis now primarily focus on patients with high-risk predisposing cardiac conditions prior to dental procedures.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^1146QAvm]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a widely used prevention measure for those at risk of developing infective endocarditis (IE). Following the suggestion that bacteremia secondary to invasive dental procedures might cause IE, the American Heart Association's Committee on Prevention of Rheumatic Fever and Bacterial Endocarditis was the first to recommend that individuals at increased risk of IE should be given AP before invasive dental procedures, some 60 years ago. Over time, the American Heart Association and other international guideline committees have gradually restricted AP use, moving to single-dose AP strategies and restricting the types of patients for whom AP is recommended. In 2008, this culminated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending that the use of AP to prevent IE should cease in the United Kingdom. This recommendation was confirmed in a recent review of the NICE guidelines but is in contrast with European, North American, and other international guidelines that recommend AP for high-risk individuals undergoing invasive dental procedures.

A recent interrupted time series study found that AP prescribing in England fell sharply after the 2008 NICE guidance, with a significant increase in the incidence of IE. By March 2013, it was estimated that there were 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) more cases of IE per month than would have been expected from the previous trend. This increase was statistically significant both for those at high risk (previous history of IE, prosthetic heart valve, valve replacement).

In brief, venous access was gained through the right femoral vein under local anesthesia, and device implantation was guided by fluoroscopy and TEE. The type and size of the device was chosen by the physician performing the implantation according to: (a) the diameter of the defect; (b) presence of an ASA; (c) availability of the device; and (d) appropriate preference. A randomization algorithm was not used.

After implantation, patients continued to receive 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for 3 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for up to 6 months. Before hospital discharge, transthoracic echocardiography was performed to confirm correct device position. Prophylaxis of infectious endocarditis was performed for the first 6 months. Clinical follow-ups were performed after 3 and 6 months by TEE. Additionally, telephone contact based on a centrally recorded database was conducted on an annual basis. All verification of database recordings and interviews was performed by an experienced nurse or physician. During this interview, the patient or a family member was queried for the occurrence of cardiac events, such as (a) cardiovascular death, defined as any death with a demonstrable cardiovascular cause or any death that was not clearly attributable to a non-cardiovascular cause, or (b) hospitalization for neurological or peripheral thromboembolic events.

### Patent foramen ovale closure for stroke prevention and other disorders [^117Cpxcv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

A TTE is done 1 day after the procedure or before discharge. The post-procedure TTE should carefully assess for residual shunts, device instability, evidence of device erosion, deformation of surrounding structures, and evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion. The duration and frequency of follow-up echocardiograms post-PFO closure is unknown. In one study, in addition to TTE evaluation one day after the procedure or before discharge, contrast TTE was repeated at six months to document proper device implantation and assess for residual shunts. Serial echocardiograms thereafter may be done in cases of persistent shunt or larger device implant.

Infection of a PFO device post-implant is exceedingly rare, but several case reports have reported device infection that required either intravenous antibiotics or surgical management. Given the scarcity of data and low infection rate of patients with intracardiac devices, including Amplatzer devices, there is no definitive evidence that post-procedure prophylaxis is warranted in the absence of high-risk features for intracardiac infection. Infective endocarditis prophylaxis, if warranted, should be done for the first six months only for dental procedures, which involve manipulation of the gingival tissue, perforation of the oral mucosa, or manipulation of the periapical region of the teeth. Ideally, elective dental procedures should be deferred until six months post-procedure. If not possible, a single dose of amoxicillin 2 mg should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before dental work.

### Estimated risk of endocarditis in adults with predisposing cardiac conditions undergoing dental procedures with or without antibiotic prophylaxis [^114iz1nw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Although antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) has been recommended for persons with predisposing cardiac conditions (PCCs) for many years, its efficacy, which has not been demonstrated, has been recently challenged. To assess its usefulness, we estimated the risk of developing IE after undergoing a dental procedure for which subjects would be eligible for prophylaxis, both in subjects having (protected procedure) or not having (unprotected procedure) received antibiotic prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: The number of French persons with PCCs, the annual number of dental procedures in which subjects would be eligible for antibiotic prophylaxis, and the number of procedures that were unprotected were estimated based on a survey performed on a sample of 2,805 subjects aged 25–84 years. The annual number of IE cases possibly due to an unprotected procedure was estimated from a 1-year epidemiological study of IE conducted in an area inhabited by 16 million people.

- **Results**: After standardization, extrapolation of results to the age-equivalent general population (39 million subjects) indicated the following: First, 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.6%-4%) of the subjects had PCC, 2.7 million (95% CI, 2.3–3.2 million) of whom had undergone at least one at-risk dental procedure within the survey year, and the procedures were unprotected in 62% of cases. Second, 37 (95% CI, 18–68; 2.7%) of the 1,370 annual IE cases in France were possibly related to unprotected procedures. Thus, the risks of developing IE were estimated to be 1 in 46,000 for unprotected procedures.

### Perspectives on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis [^113B2rJW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published a guideline statement dramatically changing its previous position on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE). This year, these views were incorporated in an update of the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease.

The new recommendations represent a dramatic shift regarding which patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of IE and for which procedures. The shift in recommendations is striking in that the recommendations are based not on new data, but on no data. There are no large, prospective, randomized double-blind trials testing the efficacy of IE prophylaxis. However, available data suggest that there may be no real risk associated with IE prophylaxis. Even if few cases of IE are successfully prevented using antibiotic prophylaxis, those few cases may represent a favorable risk-benefit ratio. On an individual basis, patients with organic heart valve disease who are trying to delay or avoid surgical intervention have something very real to risk if they develop IE, and a very real benefit if they avoid it. Pending data from prospective randomized trials, a strategy of individual decision-making by informed patients may be best.

### Infective endocarditis prevention: Update on 2007 guidelines [^1111m8CU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing infective endocarditis is unproven. The recently issued American Heart Association guidelines for endocarditis prevention call for restricting the use of preprocedure antibiotics. We discuss how these revisions apply to clinical practice in patients undergoing elective medical and dental procedures.

### Prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis: To use or not to use [^114cGiYC]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) published their revised guidelines in 2007, markedly limiting the recommendations for the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE), except for patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. A recent focused update on valvular heart diseases changed the recommendation for antibiotic use in patients with various underlying heart conditions, including mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which were previously considered "low risk" heart defects.

In this article, we argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered until concrete clinical evidence is presented to dispute this strategy, especially for patients with MVP. This approach is cost-efficient and provides an opportunity to prevent a dreadful disease. We have also enlisted two clinical cases to support our argument. These cases highlight that IE can be fatal despite optimal treatment. Patients should have the right to make the final decision and be allowed to participate in choosing for, or against this approach until adequate clinical evidence is available.

### Infectious endocarditis prophylaxis in children [^111d4PpD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Infectious endocarditis (IE) is a rare illness with high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of IE is on the rise in industrialized countries, particularly as individuals with congenital heart defects are living longer and the use of indwelling central catheters increases. With the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines, there has been a shift in recommending antibiotic prophylaxis only to high-risk patient populations. This clinical review highlights the changing epidemiology and etiology of IE, followed by an emphasis on the appropriate indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk populations undergoing specific procedures.

Regarding surgical interventions for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to the timing of surgery, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend performing surgery without any delay following a stroke in the presence of heart failure, uncontrolled infection, abscess, or persistent high embolic risk. This is advised as long as coma is absent and the presence of cerebral hemorrhage has been excluded by cranial CT or MRI.

### Penicillins for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^112hDVQE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it is believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries recommend that, prior to invasive dental procedures, antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of this prophylaxis outweigh the potential benefits.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic penicillin administration, compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE, influences mortality, serious illness, or endocarditis incidence.

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy was developed on MEDLINE and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers (to October 2003), as well as the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), OLDMEDLINE (1966 to June 2002), EMBASE (1980 to June 2002), SIGLE (to June 2002), and the Meta-register of Controlled Trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few, if any, trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-controlled studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of penicillin compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedure.

### Nondental invasive procedures and risk of infective endocarditis: Time for a revisit: A science advisory from the American Heart Association [^112jVbWy]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

There have been no published prospective randomized clinical trials that have: (1) established an association between invasive dental and nondental invasive procedures and the risk of infective endocarditis or (2) defined the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis administered in the setting of invasive procedures in the prevention of infective endocarditis in high-risk patients. Moreover, previous observational studies that examined the association of nondental invasive procedures with the risk of infective endocarditis have been limited by inadequate sample size. They have typically focused on a few potential at-risk surgical and nonsurgical invasive procedures.

However, recent investigations from Sweden and England that used nationwide databases demonstrated an association between nondental invasive procedures and the subsequent development of infective endocarditis, particularly in high-risk patients. These findings prompted the development of the science advisory.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112i6ccw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Based on the variability of the monthly data before the change, we set as the margin a 15% increase over the fitted number for cases and deaths. To carry out the test, we constructed a 95% confidence interval for the monthly mean number of cases or deaths for the 25 months after the guideline change. If the upper limit of the confidence interval corresponded to an increase of less than 15% over the model's estimate for the number of cases or deaths for March 2008 (that is, < 139.8 or < 22.4, respectively), we considered that the number of cases or deaths had not increased significantly.

Prespecified secondary tests of whether cases of infective endocarditis or deaths had increased since the introduction of the guideline were: testing whether there was an increase in the time trend in the Poisson regression models, and noting whether in 17 or more months from April 2008 to April 2010 the number of cases or deaths exceeded the fitted value for March 2008 (121.6 cases or 19.5 deaths). The probability of 25 independent counts of 17 exceeding this level was 0.22 (that is, < 5%), and so we set 17 as the test statistic.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1176wr4N]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Without accurate data on the proportion of cases caused by dental procedures, it is difficult for statistical analysis purposes to predefine a clinically relevant level of change after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis or to determine the sample size needed to detect the change. Using the premise that a high proportion of cases are caused by dental procedures, a large increase in the number of cases would be expected if antibiotic prophylaxis was stopped and was effective, and a comparatively small population would be needed to detect a statistically significant change.

On the other hand, if the number of cases caused by dental procedures was small, it would require an infinitely large population to detect any increase in the number of cases. Indeed, to exclude a 1% increase in the incidence of infective endocarditis above the baseline trend, assuming a similar incidence of infective endocarditis and variability in the numbers of cases on a month-by-month basis, would require a study population of 478.5 million people. For this reason, even with a study covering the entire population of England, the possibility of a small increase in cases after cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be excluded. However, the fact that we identified no significant increase in cases in a population of this size, despite a large decrease in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, suggests that invasive dental procedures are unlikely to account for a high proportion of the cases.

Because of this, and because of the nature of the statistical test we applied, we used the quality of the available data to [The sentence seems to be incomplete and appears cut off].
