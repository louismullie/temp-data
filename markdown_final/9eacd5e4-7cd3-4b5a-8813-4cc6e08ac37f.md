## Question

What is the preferred first line agent for rheumatoid arthritis with moderate to high disease severity?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the preferred first-line agent is for rheumatoid arthritis with moderate to high disease severity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how disease severity is defined and measured in RA. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ACR 2021, EULAR 2022/2023) recommend for initial therapy in moderate to high disease activity. Next, I will examine the comparative evidence for methotrexate versus combination csDMARDs and versus biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs upfront. After that, I need to consider exceptions such as poor prognostic factors, contraindications, and patient preferences. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, treat-to-target plan with monitoring and escalation triggers, and confirm the bottom-line recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the disease severity framework. RA disease activity is typically categorized using validated composite measures such as DAS28, CDAI, or SDAI, where moderate disease activity corresponds roughly to DAS28 3.2–5.1 and high disease activity to DAS28 > 5.1, with treat-to-target strategies aiming for low disease activity or remission within 3–6 months when feasible [^112g8HL5] [^115YvaV3] [^115jkF8m].

> Next, I should review guideline direction for DMARD-naive patients with moderate to high disease activity. The 2021 ACR guideline strongly recommends methotrexate monotherapy as the initial DMARD over other csDMARDs, over bDMARD or tsDMARD monotherapy, and over combination strategies with b/tsDMARDs at baseline, with conditional recommendations favoring MTX over dual/triple csDMARD therapy and over MTX plus TNF inhibitor initially, reflecting cost, safety, and similar long-term outcomes with step-up care [^1175vxE8] [^114fW8EL].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale before concluding. Methotrexate remains the anchor first-line therapy because of robust disease-modifying efficacy, favorable safety at therapeutic doses, low cost, and dosing flexibility; importantly, strategy trials and network meta-analyses show that starting with MTX and escalating based on response achieves outcomes comparable to initial combination therapy or early biologics in many patients, without the added toxicity and cost of upfront advanced therapies [^115jkF8m] [^117SCWGu] [^114fEyRs].

> Hold on, I should double-check the role of glucocorticoids at initiation. ACR 2021 conditionally recommends starting a csDMARD without short-term glucocorticoids and strongly recommends avoiding longer-term glucocorticoids, emphasizing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration if steroids are used, whereas EULAR has historically allowed short-term bridging; in practice, many adopt a cautious, individualized approach to brief bridging given infection and metabolic risks [^116nKvmf] [^113eStFw].

> I need to ensure I address exceptions. If poor prognostic factors are present (e.g., high RF/ACPA titers, high inflammatory markers, early erosions, persistent moderate/high activity despite csDMARD), guidelines support earlier escalation to bDMARD or tsDMARD, with EULAR explicitly recommending adding a bDMARD in the presence of poor prognostic factors after the first csDMARD strategy fails to reach target, and ACR allowing conditional consideration of earlier advanced therapy in selected high-risk scenarios through shared decision-making [^114ppVJn] [^113QrB1C].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers. For subcutaneous nodules, MTX is still conditionally preferred initially, but if nodules progress, switching off MTX is advised; for mild, stable lung disease, MTX may be reasonable with counseling and close monitoring for pneumonitis; for recent serious infection, adding another csDMARD is favored over adding a bDMARD or tsDMARD; and for lymphoproliferative disorders, rituximab may be preferred when indicated, all of which can shift the initial or early escalation choice away from standard MTX monotherapy in shared decision-making [^11786dsq] [^116uPjcn] [^117WzvdP] [^111EFjtV].

> Next, I should review the treat-to-target implementation details. ACR endorses treat-to-target with reassessment about every 3 months, dose optimization of MTX toward 25 mg weekly if tolerated, and escalation if low disease activity or remission is not achieved by 3–6 months; combination csDMARDs or addition of a b/tsDMARD are appropriate next steps, with class switching favored after inadequate response to a b/tsDMARD, and tapering considered only after sustained target attainment for at least 6 months [^112g8HL5] [^115jkF8m] [^116sTEmc] [^113VhoKp].

> But wait, what about emerging evidence suggesting faster control with early biologics or JAK inhibitors in some patients? Trials like NORD-STAR and SELECT-EARLY show that certain biologic combinations or JAK inhibition can achieve higher early remission rates than active conventional therapy in selected populations, yet guidelines still prioritize MTX-first strategies for most patients due to overall risk–benefit and cost considerations, reserving early advanced therapy for those with poor prognostic features or specific preferences after shared decision-making [^114VqrjS] [^1175vxE8].

> I should confirm the practical dosing and monitoring plan for MTX. Start oral MTX around 15 mg weekly with folic acid, escalate by 5 mg every 2–4 weeks toward 25 mg if tolerated, check CBC, liver enzymes, and creatinine every 2–8 weeks during titration, then every 12 weeks once stable, and reassess disease activity at least every 3 months to guide escalation if targets are not met, aligning with ACR's administration and monitoring guidance [^115jkF8m] [^112g8HL5].

> In summary, after verifying disease severity categorization, guideline consensus, and comparative effectiveness, the preferred first-line agent for RA with moderate to high disease severity is methotrexate monotherapy, with systematic treat-to-target monitoring and timely escalation if low disease activity or remission is not achieved within 3–6 months, while individualizing for poor prognostic factors, comorbidities, and patient preferences through shared decision-making [^1175vxE8] [^112g8HL5] [^116MALka].

---

Methotrexate is the **preferred first-line agent** for moderate to high severity rheumatoid arthritis [^1175vxE8], with guidelines strongly recommending it over other csDMARDs, bDMARDs, and tsDMARDs [^1175vxE8]. It is favored for its **proven efficacy**, favorable safety profile, and cost-effectiveness [^115jkF8m]. Combination therapy or biologics/JAK inhibitors are reserved for inadequate responders or those with poor prognostic factors [^114ppVJn]. Glucocorticoids may be used short-term at the lowest effective dose, but long-term use is discouraged [^116nKvmf].

---

## Guideline recommendations

The **ACR 2021 guidelines** strongly recommend methotrexate as the initial DMARD for DMARD-naive patients with moderate to high disease activity [^1175vxE8], favoring it over other csDMARDs, bDMARDs, and tsDMARDs [^1175vxE8]. The **EULAR 2022 guidelines** similarly endorse methotrexate as the cornerstone of initial therapy, with escalation to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs if treatment targets are not achieved [^114Bf9w5] [^114ppVJn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting methotrexate

Methotrexate has **robust evidence** supporting its use as first-line therapy in RA:

- **Efficacy**: Methotrexate effectively reduces disease activity, prevents joint damage, and improves quality of life in patients with moderate to high disease activity [^115jkF8m].

- **Safety**: Methotrexate has a well-characterized safety profile, with manageable adverse effects through regular monitoring and folic acid supplementation [^114bYV52].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Methotrexate is significantly less expensive than biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs, making it a cost-effective initial choice [^112rZbQM].

---

## Alternative first-line agents

While methotrexate is the preferred first-line agent, **alternative csDMARDs** may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

| **Agent** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Leflunomide | Methotrexate intolerance or contraindication | - Similar efficacy to methotrexate <br/> - Different mechanism of action [^notfound] |
| Sulfasalazine | Mild to moderate disease activity or methotrexate intolerance | - Well-tolerated <br/> - Effective in milder disease [^notfound] |
| Hydroxychloroquine | Low disease activity or methotrexate intolerance | - Favorable safety profile <br/> - Suitable for milder disease [^113a5AJc] |

---

Combination therapy with multiple csDMARDs (e.g. triple therapy) may be considered in patients with **poor prognostic factors** or aggressive disease, but it is generally reserved for inadequate responders to methotrexate monotherapy [^113QrB1C].

---

## Role of glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids may be used as **short-term bridging therapy** to control inflammation while DMARDs take effect. The ACR 2021 guidelines conditionally recommend initiating csDMARDs without short-term glucocorticoids, and strongly recommend against long-term glucocorticoid use due to adverse effects [^116nKvmf].

---

## Escalation strategies

If methotrexate monotherapy fails to achieve the treatment target (low disease activity or remission) within 3–6 months, escalation strategies include:

- **Addition of another csDMARD**: Considered in patients without poor prognostic factors [^113QrB1C].

- **Addition of bDMARDs or tsDMARDs**: Recommended in patients with poor prognostic factors or persistent moderate to high disease activity despite methotrexate therapy [^115YvaV3].

- **Switching to a different DMARD**: Considered in cases of methotrexate intolerance or inadequate response [^115YvaV3].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment decisions should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors, including:

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, malignancy, infections, and lung disease may influence DMARD choice and dosing [^117XK42A].

- **Patient preferences**: Route of administration, monitoring requirements, and potential side effects should be considered [^113a5AJc].

- **Socioeconomic factors**: Cost, access to healthcare, and insurance coverage may impact treatment selection [^112rZbQM].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of disease activity and adverse effects is essential in managing RA. The ACR recommends reassessing disease activity **every 3 months** and adjusting therapy accordingly [^notfound].

---

Methotrexate is the **preferred first-line agent** for moderate to high severity RA due to its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Alternative csDMARDs may be considered in cases of intolerance or contraindication, and escalation strategies should be employed if treatment targets are not achieved.

### Identifying patients with rheumatoid arthritis with moderate disease activity at risk of significant radiographic progression despite methotrexate treatment [^114pqPAz]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), high disease activity can lead to radiographic progression, subsequent functional disability and a reduced quality of life. Recent EULAR guidelines recommend clinical remission (mean disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) of < 2.6) or low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 ≤ 3.2) to be the key targets of RA treatment. Patients with RA who do not achieve clinical remission or LDA after 3–6 months are advised to switch or adjust treatment until this target is attained. Despite these recommendations, many patients in Europe have moderate disease activity (≥ 3.2 DAS28 ≤ 5.1) but remain on methotrexate (MTX), the most common first-line treatment, and do not switch to more aggressive treatment strategies.

Previous studies have investigated baseline variables that may be predictive of radiographic progression. However, these studies have largely included patient populations with early and severe RA and parameters that have been of poor prognostic value. Studies investigating the risk of disease progression in patients with established and stable moderate disease activity are very limited. While it is recognised that moderate disease activity is not an adequate target for patients with RA, in real life, those with moderate RA represent a substantial proportion of patients in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to identify factors contributing to the risk of significant radiographic progression (SRP) among patients with moderately active RA despite receiving MTX treatment, to help improve treatment to target in this heterogeneous RA population.

### Clinical characteristics and patient-reported outcomes in patients with inadequately controlled rheumatoid arthritis despite ongoing treatment [^115YvaV3]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting up to 1% of the world population. Progress in the last two decades has resulted in an armamentarium of available treatments, the majority of which are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Current European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines recommend starting therapy with the conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD), methotrexate, in combination with short-term glucocorticoids. If this treatment is not successful or methotrexate is contraindicated, in the absence of poor prognostic factors, other csDMARDS should be considered. The guidelines state that if the treatment target is not reached with the first csDMARD strategy, when poor prognostic factors are present, a biologic DMARD (bDMARD) should be added (current practice). Unlike the 2014 EULAR guidelines, the 2016 EULAR guidelines have expanded this recommendation to include targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), specifically Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, as second-line options (currently tofacitinib and baricitinib). The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines recommend treatment strategies based on disease activity, as well as differentiating between early RA, established RA and high-risk comorbidities. When using disease activity scores for 28 joints (DAS28), ACR defined remission as < 2.6, low disease activity as ≥ 2.6– < 3.2, moderate disease activity as ≥ 3.2– ≤ 5.1 and high disease activity as > 5.1. For moderate to high disease activity, ACR recommendations are similar to the EULAR recommendations but offer the choice of combination csDMARD therapy or adding a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) or non-TNFi biologic or tofacitinib if disease activity remains moderate or high despite csDMARD monotherapy.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic inflammation and is associated with progressive cartilage damage and joint destruction.RA remains without a cure and if left untreated, results in loss of physical function, reduced overall quality of life (QoL), disability and increased mortality. The main treatment goal is to achieve disease remission, or at least maintain a low level of disease activity as an alternative target, therefore, it is important to diagnose early and initiate treatment as early as possible.

Due to the heterogeneity of RA, both in terms of disease course and patient variability, management requires careful treatment consideration, with treatment choices driven by regular disease activity evaluation and consistent patient clinical assessment. In 2019, the EULAR published updated recommendations for the management of RA with respect to positioning of targeted-synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors (IL-6Ris), anti-CD20 inhibitors (CD20is), selective co-stimulation modulators and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis).

A treat-to-target (T2T) approach, based around the principles of shared decision-making between the patient and their rheumatologist, improves the prognosis of patients with RA, and forms part of the treatment recommendations of EULAR and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. There is evidence that a T2T management strategy yields superior medium-term and long-term outcomes (eg, prevention of damage, maintenance of physical function and reduction of comorbidity risks) compared with standard care, both in early and late RA. However, T2T principles are not applied universally. Individual preferences, clinical characteristics and the patient–provider relationships play important roles, as do barriers in healthcare structure and socioeconomic factors. Evidence of a failure, in line with treatment guidelines, to change therapies and modify treatment approaches in patients despite the indication of moderate or high disease activity has been identified, as well as issues with regular disease activity assessments and access to care.

### Modulating the co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation in rheumatoid arthritis: could it be the first step of the treatment? [^116ZFwi4]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Advances in our understanding of the key mediators of chronic inflammation and tissue damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have fostered the development of targeted therapies and greatly expanded the available treatment options. Abatacept, a soluble human fusion protein that selectively modulates the co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation, is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in the United States, Canada, and the European Union. This review summarises the data on efficacy (disease activity, quality of life, prevention of structural damage) and safety from randomised clinical trials of abatacept plus methotrexate in patients with: i) active RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate who are naïve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs; and ii) methotrexate-naïve early RA with poor prognostic factors. Novel imaging outcomes and biological changes induced by abatacept treatment are also briefly reviewed. Optimal use of abatacept as a first-line biological therapy is discussed in light of the current recommendations and guidelines.

### Are poor prognostic factors a realistic basis for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Lessons from the IMPROVED study [^11697zU5]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommend the use of poor prognostic factors (PPFs) in treatment decisions.PPFs are: (1) persistent moderate/high disease activity after conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), (2) high C reactive protein (CRP)/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels at baseline, (3) high swollen joint counts (SJC) at baseline, (4) presence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies (ACPA), especially at high levels, (5) presence of early erosions or (6) failure of two or more csDMARDs.PPFs are associated with an increased risk of radiographic damage over time. It is recommended, if a treatment target is not achieved with the first csDMARD strategy, to treat patients without PPFs with a second csDMARD, but to switch to treatment with a biological DMARD (bDMARD) if PPFs are present. These considerations are based on expert opinion, and an investigation into the association between stratification and treatment outcomes is recommended. We aim to explore the presence of PPFs in early RA and to investigate their relationship with treatment response after failure of the first csDMARD strategy.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^112g8HL5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment — guiding principles in the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline specify that RA requires early evaluation, diagnosis, and management; that treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process and should be reevaluated within a minimum of 3 months based on efficacy and tolerability of the DMARD(s) chosen; that disease activity levels refer to those calculated using RA disease activity measures endorsed by the ACR; that recommendations are intended for the general RA patient population and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the options under consideration; and that recommendations are limited to DMARDs approved by the US FDA for treatment of RA. The principles define serious infection as an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization and state that biosimilars are considered equivalent to FDA-approved originator bDMARDs. Treat-to-target refers to a systematic approach involving frequent monitoring of disease activity using validated instruments and modification of treatment to minimize disease activity with a goal of reaching a predefined target (low disease activity or remission), and targets refer to low disease activity or remission; recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering, with dose reduction defined as lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD and gradual discontinuation defined as gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.

### Treatment guidelines in rheumatoid arthritis [^114bYV52]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune, destructive, inflammatory arthritis in adults. Effective treatments include oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate), injectable biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (oral). Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis; and aim for a treat-to-target strategy with a goal of low disease activity or remission by frequently monitoring disease activity and escalating treatment.

### Approaches to optimising access to NICE-approved biologic anti-TNFs for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with moderately active disease [^111a34KY]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Unlike the UK, the use of biologics and biosimilars for the treatment of RA with moderate disease activity has previously been approved in other territories, including Europe and the United States. For Europe, guidelines from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) advise anti-TNFs to be started if treatment with methotrexate and glucocorticoids leads to no improvement in a patient's RA following 3 months and the target of remission or low disease activity is not achieved within 6 months and if the patient presents with poor prognostic factors. Further guidance on drug switching and cycling for when an anti-TNF has failed is also provided. The guidelines suggest that drugs that are less costly should be preferred over more costly ones as long as they are similarly efficacious and safe. The introduction of biosimilars has resulted in an increase in the number of patients receiving biologic therapy for RA in some countries. In the United States, the American College of Rheumatology include conditional recommendations on the use of anti-TNFs. For example, they advise methotrexate as a monotherapy in treatment-naive patients, owing to the higher cost of anti-TNFs and their risk of toxicity. However, the guidelines acknowledge anti-TNFs are associated with a more rapid onset of action and a greater chance of improvement, so their use may be preferable for some patients with poor prognostic features. Therefore, these considerations may be important to take into account in the future development of biologic and biosimilar guidelines in the UK. Although the focus of this manuscript is on the UK, the challenges associated with identifying patients who may benefit from biologic therapy remain a universal issue.

### What is the best target in a Treat-to-target strategy in rheumatoid arthritis? Results from a systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^112pwovQ]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterised by inflammation of synovial joints, although other organ systems can also be involved. Treatment is aimed at limiting and controlling disease activity, as prolonged high levels of activity increase the risk of progressive joint damage and mortality. In the proactive treat-to-target (T2T) strategy, disease activity is frequently and systematically assessed using a validated measure, which is then compared with a prespecified treatment target. If the target is not reached within a particular time frame, treatment is intensified accordingly.

Targets are commonly based on a composite Disease Activity Score with a cut-off value for remission or low disease activity (LDA). Examples of composite scores include the DAS (counting 28 or 44 joints in the DAS28/DAS44 respectively), the Simplified and the Clinical Disease Activity Indices (SDAI/CDAI). The DAS variants are based on tender and swollen joint counts (TJC/SJC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C reactive protein (CRP), and the patient's global assessment of disease activity (PGA) on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Although the DAS is well established and validated, it has been criticised for allowing a high SJC while fulfilling the definition of remission, due to calculation effects. The SDAI and CDAI weigh the individual components equally and have added the physicians assessment of disease activity. The CDAI does not include any laboratory marker, making it easier to apply in clinical practice, but also less objective.

### Efficacy and safety of filgotinib in methotrexate-naive patients with rheumatoid arthritis with poor prognostic factors: post hoc analysis of FINCH 3 [^112hoxga]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 EULAR guidelines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommend methotrexate (MTX) in combination with short-term glucocorticoids, unless contraindicated, as the first treatment strategy on diagnosis of RA. According to the treat-to-target strategy, treatment should be adjusted for patients who do not achieve 50% improvement after approximately 3 months, as they are unlikely to achieve desired treatment targets of remission or low disease activity within 6 months. The choice of second-line treatment is stratified by the presence of poor prognostic factors (PPFs) associated with rapid disease progression, including elevated acute-phase reactant levels; high swollen joint count; seropositivity — especially with high titres — for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies; presence of early erosions; and persistent moderate or high disease activity. Treatment escalation to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) therapy is recommended for patients who present with any of these PPFs and do not achieve their treatment target; in patients without these factors, another conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) strategy could be considered after first-line treatment failure.

The EULAR guidelines acknowledge evidence supporting this strategy is limited, and the research agenda put forward in this EULAR-endorsed document includes treatment outcomes in patients with and without PPFs. Furthermore, although these PPFs historically predict radiographic progression of joint damage in patients treated with csDMARDs or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, data are relatively sparse regarding their effect on radiographic outcomes and physical function following first-line treatment with non-TNF bDMARDs or tsDMARDs such as Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Data are needed on efficacy of bDMARDs or tsDMARDs versus csDMARDs for clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients with PPFs.

Filgotinib is a once-daily oral, JAK1-preferential inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy and a favourable safety profile in adults with moderately to severely active RA. The phase III, randomised, active-controlled FINCH 3 trial (NCT02886728), which evaluated filgotinib efficacy and safety in MTX-naive patients with RA, included patients with at least one marker or risk factor for rapidly progressive disease. Here, we assessed filgotinib efficacy and safety in the subgroup of patients with all of four PPFs present at baseline.

Rheumatoid arthritis — biologic DMARD (bDMARD) and targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) class switching: Switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD of a different class is conditionally recommended over switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD belonging to the same class for patients taking a bDMARD or tsDMARD who are not at target. The recommendation is based on very low-certainty evidence supporting greater improvement in disease activity and drug survival among patients switching classes. The recommendation is conditional because patient and physician preferences are likely to vary based on prior experiences with specific DMARDs.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^113a5AJc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Low disease activity — DMARD-naive agent selection: Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity. Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs because it is better tolerated and has a more favorable risk profile in patients with RA. Sulfasalazine is recommended over methotrexate because it is less immunosuppressive, and the patient panel felt that many patients with low disease activity would prefer to avoid the side effects associated with methotrexate. The recommendations are conditional because methotrexate may be the preferred initial therapy in patients at the higher end of the low disease activity range and in those with poor prognostic factors (11). Methotrexate is recommended over leflunomide because of its greater dosing flexibility and lower cost.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: common questions about diagnosis and management [^111Gso8L]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 1% worldwide. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Rheumatoid arthritis should be considered if there is at least one joint with definite swelling that is not better explained by another disease. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, elevated C-reactive protein level, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis may impact organs other than the joints, including lungs, skin, and eyes. Rapid diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which is associated with better outcomes. The goal of therapy is to initiate early medical treatment to achieve disease remission or the lowest disease activity possible. Methotrexate is typically the first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Additional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologic agents should be added if disease activity persists. Comorbid conditions, including hepatitis B or C or tuberculosis infections, must be considered when choosing medical treatments. Although rheumatoid arthritis is often a chronic disease, some patients can taper and discontinue medications and remain in long-term remission.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that presents as a symmetrical polyarthritis characterised by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can affect any synovial joint in the body, most commonly starting in the small joints of the hands and feet, with the potential to impact every aspect of daily living. High levels of inflammation are associated with fatigue and impairment of participation in occupational, recreational, and societal roles. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect men, women, and children at any age, but is 2–3 times more likely to occur in women and is more common with increasing age, with onset most often occurring at 60–70 years of age. Without adequate treatment, the disease can lead to progressive joint destruction and deformity, causing long-term disability, chronic pain, and premature death.

Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has improved considerably over time, leading to better health outcomes. However, access to treatment varies globally and substantial inequities exist. The optimal management of rheumatoid arthritis involves early diagnosis within a 3-month window of opportunity and treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), using a treat-to-target management approach in which treatment is intensified according to disease activity measures until a state of low disease activity or disease remission is reached. The addition of, or switch to, biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs can be considered if there is severe disease or ongoing disease activity with first-line therapies. However, biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs are expensive and access to treatment varies globally. Methotrexate is a low-cost conventional synthetic DMARD and, when started early at effective doses, can control disease activity and minimise long-term disability and mortality. When diagnosis and access to specialist care is delayed, people with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to have both short-term and long-term disability.

### Assessments of the unmet need in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis: analyses from the NOR-DMARD registry [^114Dcupd]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The bDMARD groups were generally similar in terms of efficacy outcomes, although there appeared to be a trend in the adjusted data toward numerically better scores in the bDMARDs + MTX vs the bDMARD monotherapy group. At Month 12, 32.5–44.6% of patients from the bDMARD groups achieved remission, whereas 39.2–47.2% had remained on their current treatment and were inadequate-responders. Among patients receiving bDMARDs, rates of stopping therapy over 24 and 60 months were greatest with bDMARD monotherapy and lowest with bDMARDs + MTX.

MTX is the most prescribed first-line DMARD for RA and its widespread use has prompted the development of clinical practice recommendations by the 3E Initiative. However, in line with these data from the NOR-DMARD registry, other studies have shown that not all patients respond to MTX; for example, in a study of tofacitinib vs MTX in MTX-naïve patients, < 20% of MTX-treated patients achieved low disease activity at Month 24. Although the reasons for not changing therapy despite IR were not recorded in the NOR-DMARD registry, a previous analysis in Australian RA patients with moderate-to-high disease activity despite active treatment (75% were receiving MTX) revealed that the most common reasons for not switching treatment included irreversible joint damage (19.7%), patient preference (14.7%) and rheumatologist-driven under-treatment (9.9%). Patients were reluctant to switch if they were comfortable with the level of disease activity or had concerns about potential toxicity of new treatments; patients also tended to prefer oral to injectable medications. Furthermore, patients and rheumatologists may have different perceptions of disease activity, leading to potential disagreements during shared decision-making, and thresholds for switching RA treatments may alter over time. Treat-to-target recommendations published in 2010 recommend that the treatment of RA be based on shared decision-making between the patient and physician, and a previous study reported that NOR-DMARD-registered RA patients with moderate disease activity perceived their state as acceptable; therefore, patients may have remained on the same treatment by choice despite an IR. The publication of these recommendations may have affected the treatment practices for RA during the period covered by this analysis.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^112KQhg8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop updated guidelines for the pharmacologic management of rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

We developed clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions. After conducting a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A voting panel comprising clinicians and patients achieved consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations.

Results

The guideline addresses treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including conventional synthetic DMARDs, biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs, use of glucocorticoids, and use of DMARDs in certain high-risk populations (i.e., those with liver disease, heart failure, lymphoproliferative disorders, previous serious infections, and nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease). The guideline includes 44 recommendations (7 strong and 37 conditional).

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is intended to serve as a tool to support clinician and patient decision-making. Recommendations are not prescriptive, and individual treatment decisions should be made through a shared decision-making process based on patients' values, goals, preferences, and comorbidities.

### Clinical remission in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis [^115MjB6n]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

It is currently recognised that remission can be an achievable target for several rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients by a treat-to-target approach. For RA different remission criteria have been proposed, depending on the disease activity scores used, on the importance given to the inclusion of patients' perspective into the definition of remission, and on their applicability in clinical practice, that generate highly different remission rates. Conversely, for PsA, remission is still insufficiently defined and represents a partially unmet need. For both conditions, several first- and second-line treatment strategies are now available - disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) of synthetic and biologic origin - that make the achievement of remission or at least low/minimal disease activity a realistic goal. This paper is a narrative review of the different criteria of remission, in the light of the available treatment strategies for RA and PsA, and in the attempt to provide rheumatologists an opportunity to improve the outcome to the greatest extent possible in their clinical practice.

### When rheumatologists report that they agree with a guideline, does this mean that they practise the guideline in clinical practice? Results of the international recommendation implementation study (IRIS) [^116aseSf]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

In 65 of the 378 patients (17%), a DMARD was not started within 4 weeks. 55 of them received a DMARD in a later period. The median (IQR) duration until these patients received a DMARD was 15 (5–81) weeks (table 2).

Table 2
Average time from diagnosis (weeks) until first DMARD in patients in whom a DMARD was NOT started within 4 weeks after diagnosis

For 60 of the 378 patients (16%), essential information was missing (in these cases the date of diagnosis or the start date of the first DMARD was missing).

2. 'Start with MTX'

Of the 72 participating rheumatologists, 69 (96%) had reported complying with the recommendation ' MTX is part of the first treatment strategy in patients with active RA'. In 225 of the 378 patients (60%), MTX has indeed been prescribed as (part of) the first treatment.

3. 'Start with alternatives for MTX'

Of the 93 patients (26%) who did not start with MTX,15 (19%) received leflunomide, sulfasalazine or injectable gold as first treatment. However, 78 patients (81%) started with other medications than these three preferred alternatives. Six of these patients started with biologicals (table 3).

### Towards better personalized care in rheumatoid arthritis [^113bnUxz]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The topics discussed by the esteemed authors of this special issue relate to the challenging question of whether we can make a rational choice of targeted therapy in the management of our patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Careful consideration of drug treatment is a key aspect of holistic care which may also involve non-pharmacological intervention. The primary goals of RA treatment are to reduce the signs and symptoms of disease, prevent progression of joint damage and comorbidities associated with systemic inflammation, and improve patients' physical function, thereby enhancing their quality of life. Over the last generation, the introduction of 'targeted therapies' comprising biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) has broadened the therapeutic options for people living with RA and transformed the achievable outcomes for many. Furthermore, with access to this expanded therapeutic armamentarium, it has been demonstrated unequivocally that the best outcomes at a cohort level can be achieved by employing a 'treat-to-target' strategy that aims for an ideal disease activity target of sustained clinical remission, or low disease activity for those individuals for whom remission is not realistically attainable. For adoption of the 'treat-to-target' strategy in clinical practice, EULAR recommends a change of therapeutic regime if the target is not reached by 6 months on a given treatment.

Despite these important advances, making the choice of most appropriate treatment on an individual patient basis has become increasingly complicated! Treatment recommendations highlight that there is a choice of many similarly effective therapeutic agents after an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs although there may be differences between treatments in the spectrum of associated adverse events. Therefore, the potentials for both benefit and risk should be carefully considered when choosing a targeted therapy, and the estimated likelihood for benefit over risk needs to be acceptable to the individual patient in shared decision making. Other factors that might influence patient preference and prescribing choice include the route and frequency of drug administration, as well as the pharmacological properties. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness considerations may also limit the available treatment choices in many countries. In the face of spiralling global healthcare costs, it is likely that payor pressure to prioritize use of the least costly agents will continue as more and more biosimilars of a wide range of originators are approved and generic tsDMARDs become available. In the face of this complexity, and uncertainties about the most appropriate intervention for a given individual, prescribing choices are often made with an emphasis on cost-effectiveness and the prescriber's familiarity with the treatment class.

### Association of patient-and hospital-level predictors with patterns of initial treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: findings from a national cohort study [^114Bf9w5]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that can lead to joint destruction and deformity, and is associated with a considerable disease burden. According to the Global Burden of Diseases study, over 31 million individuals worldwide will be living with RA by 2050. Strong evidence has indicated that early treatment and aggressive treatment using a treat-to-target approach can reduce damage to the joints and improve outcomes. With development of new DMARDs, especially biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs), treatment options for RA have increased substantially in recent years. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that a first-line biologic is no more effective than first-line conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) treatment in newly diagnosed patients. csDMARDs, most commonly MTX, remain the first-line recommended strategy for newly diagnosed RA patients due to their effectiveness, acceptable safety profiles and low cost.

Prior clinical guidelines recommended MTX being part of the first treatment strategy, either as monotherapy or in combination with other csDMARDs; moreover, csDMARD combination therapy was recommended by some national societies as preferred initial therapy. However, as the evidence has evolved and more high-quality studies assessed optimal medication, there has been a recognition that not all patients need a csDMARD combination from the outset. In some previous trial and cohort studies, triple therapy (MTX + SSZ + HCQ) did not demonstrate superiority but rather was associated with more adverse events, leading to low persistence rates. This shift in practice is reflected in more recent guidelines, such as in the UK (NICE 2018), USA (ACR 2015) and Europe (EULAR 2022). The 2018 NICE was updated to support csDMARD monotherapy as a first-line treatment. The 2022 EULAR RA management guideline was updated to encourage prescription of MTX monotherapy as first-line treatment.

Methotrexate administration for initiating therapy — oral methotrexate is conditionally recommended over subcutaneous methotrexate for patients initiating methotrexate, and oral administration is preferred, despite moderate evidence suggesting superior efficacy of subcutaneous injections, due to the ease of oral administration and similar bioavailability at typical starting doses.

### Treat-to-target: not as simple as it appears [^114kip5Z]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treat-to-target as a strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is now widely advocated based on strong evidence. Nonetheless, implementation of treat-to-target raises caveats, as is the case with all clinical care strategies. The target of remission or even low disease activity does not apply to all individual patients, some of whom are affected by concomitant fibromyalgia, other comorbidities, joint damage, and/or who simply prefer to maintain current status and avoid risks of more aggressive therapies. No single universal 'target' measure or index exists for all individual RA patients. An emphasis in most studies on radiographic progression, rather than physical function or mortality, as the most important outcome to document the value of treat-to-target may be inappropriate. Many reports imply that the only limitation to treating all RA patients with biological agents involves costs, ignoring effective results in most patients with methotrexate and other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and adverse events associated with biological agents. Indeed, the best outcomes in reported RA clinical trials result from tight control with DMARDs, rather than from biological agents, as does better overall status of RA patients at this time compared to previous decades. Pharmacoeconomic reports may ignore that RA patients are older, less educated, and have more comorbidities than the general population, as well as critical differences in patient status according to the gross domestic product of different countries. While treating to a target of remission or low disease activity, including with biological agents, is appropriate for many patients, awareness of these concerns could improve implementation of treat-to-target for optimal care of all RA patients.

### Optimal use of non-biologic therapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^114c4QPR]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

With the evolution of therapies for RA, new treatment strategies and goals of therapy have evolved. Recent European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines on the treatment of RA proposed three phases of therapy: phase I comprising first-line synthetic DMARD with or without glucocorticoid; phase II comprising second-line synthetic DMARD with or without glucocorticoid, or combination synthetic DMARD therapy, or (if prognostic factors are poor) first-line biologic DMARD; and phase III comprising alternative biologic DMARDs. In all phases, the key principle is tight control: striving to achieve a predefined goal of remission or low disease activity (treat to target) with frequent dose and medication adjustments tailored to the individual patient, preferably within the window of opportunity during early RA. In all phases, MTX is recognized as an anchor drug; it is characterized by proven efficacy in combination DMARD strategies, relatively low cost, relatively rapid onset of action, proven beneficial impact on radiological progression and mortality and a wide dose range that facilitates dose adjustments. Prednisone and its active metabolite, prednisolone, have similar characteristics, making them ideal anchor drugs too. The EULAR guidelines reserve a place for MTX and glucocorticoids in all phases of treatment. The second CAMERA (Computer Assisted Management in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis) study in early RA has demonstrated that including prednisone from the start in an MTX-based tight control strategy aimed at remission improves disease activity variables, time to remission, functional disability and radiological joint damage compared with the same strategy without prednisone. In conclusion, both MTX and prednisone play key roles in modern RA treatment strategies.

### Combination conventional DMARDs compared to biologicals: what is the evidence? [^114fEyRs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dramatic improvement seen in the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis has been driven by higher expectations, led by newer drugs and more intensive use of the older drugs. Although methotrexate has retained its place as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism. We have tried to critically summarize the findings of some landmark trials that compare these two approaches.

Recent Findings

Treatment of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, The Swedish Pharmacotherapy study and Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies are landmark trials that were designed to compare strategies using biologicals vs. conventional DMARDs. We will review the safety and efficacy data from these three trials here and also briefly the important cost differential.

Conclusion

Methotrexate should be the first-line therapy for most rheumatoid arthritis patients and will produce the desired results in greater than one-third of the patients. When methotrexate is not adequate, triple DMARD therapy should be added which will result in control of approximately another one-third of the patients. Ultimately, and usually before 1 year of disease, the remainder of patients will require biological therapies usually added to conventional DMARDs. There is no evidence that this step-up approach results in any long-term disadvantage and good evidence that it results in substantial cost savings.

### Anti-TNF biologic agents: still the therapy of choice for rheumatoid arthritis [^112Lnb7f]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are expressed at high levels in rheumatoid joint tissue, where they contribute significantly to inflammation and articular destruction. TNF was the first cytokine to be fully validated as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In nearly a decade since anti-TNF agents-such as infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab-were launched as the first biologic therapies to be licensed for RA, much has been learnt about how and when in the disease course this class of drug can be used to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit. Other cytokine targets, such as interleukin (IL)-6 or IL-1, have also been validated and several are in the process of being tested. However, TNF is likely to remain the preferred target of first-line biologic therapy for the foreseeable future as, in populations with active RA despite ongoing, nonbiologic, DMARD therapy, biologic inhibition of either IL-6 or IL-1 demonstrates no obviously superior outcomes to TNF blockade. Furthermore, new approaches to blockade of signaling mediated by bioactive TNF might have the potential to generate higher-magnitude clinical responses than are currently elicited.

### Does triple conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy improve upon methotrexate as the initial treatment of choice for a rheumatoid arthritis patient? [^117SCWGu]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although many treatment options exist for the initial management of rheumatoid arthritis, there has long been discussion about whether initial treatment should be with methotrexate (MTX) as monotherapy or in combination with other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Although studies initially showed additional benefit from combining MTX with other csDMARDs, this benefit disappears when glucocorticoids are added to MTX, a strategy recommended in current guidelines as a short-term bridging approach until MTX therapy exhibits its full efficacy. Also concomitant use of glucocorticoids, with MTX may not be inferior to combination therapy of MTX with TNF-inhibitors.

---

### A multi-biomarker disease activity score and the choice of second-line therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis after methotrexate failure [^114LKbvi]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Several trials have shown that early and aggressive treatment of RA increases the chances of achieving remission or low levels of disease activity. However, the superiority of biologic drugs versus combination cDMARDs was observed only for the first few months of treatment, gradually losing their advantage after further follow‐up 7, 8, 9, 10. Moreover, O'Dell and colleagues 10 showed in the RACAT trial that MTX nonresponders who received triple therapy and failed to respond improved significantly after switching to MTX plus etanercept. Similarly, those who received MTX plus etanercept and did not respond had better clinical outcomes after they were switched to triple therapy.

The results presented herein may, if confirmed, have a major bearing on clinical practice. According to widely accepted guidelines, initial (first‐line) therapy for RA is usually MTX, but if this yields an insufficient response, several second‐line options are available, including the addition of anti‐TNF or escalation to triple therapy 1. While both of these options are superior to placebo, their head‐to‐head efficacy has been a matter of some debate. The data currently available indicate either that the 2 options are equivalent or that anti‐TNF is only marginally better than triple therapy but at a very large cost, and it has therefore been argued that triple therapy should be attempted first. However, as demonstrated in the RACAT trial, where patients failing anti‐TNF therapy could respond to triple therapy and vice versa, the equivalence of the 2 options is only true at the group level; individual patients may show different responses to triple therapy versus anti‐TNF therapy 10.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^115CUTdP]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The management of rheumatoid arthritis has undergone major advances in recent years, both in terms of the drugs armamentarium and therapeutic strategy. Treating disease to target, aiming at remission, through a tight control protocol is regarded as the standard of care. Reaching clinical and radiographic disease remission has therefore become an achievable goal. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that early diagnosis, prompt treatment initiation and early achievement of remission are the major predictors of long-term clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes. Concentrating efforts in controlling disease activity in a very early window of opportunity offers unique sustained benefits. In this short review, we analysed the available evidence supporting the value of treating rheumatoid arthritis early and the impact on disease outcomes, with particular focus on radiographic progression.

### Benefit of anti-TNF therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients with moderate disease activity [^111QxjLS]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Similarly, we observed a cohort of patients that should have been eligible for anti-TNF therapies according to DAS28 who did not receive these therapies. Again, a long wait for treatment in some areas (at times many months) may have resulted in these patients being registered in the control arm of this study, although over the course of the first year, only two patients in the moderate DAS28 group and 11 patients in the high DAS28 group received anti-TNF therapy. Exclusion of these patients from the analysis did not alter the results. There may also have been other unmeasured factors, such as general frailty or other medical contraindications of treatment, which were not recorded by the register which may also have influenced the physician's choice of treatment.

The patients in this study were analysed according to baseline DAS28. However, the DAS28 itself is not without its limitations and the treating physicians may have made treatment decisions independent of DAS28 in certain patients. The DAS28 has a strong weighting towards tender joint count and patient global assessment, two relatively subjective measures of disease activity. Indeed, studies have found that patients without inflammatory arthritis but significant FM can also score high on the DAS28. Therefore, certain patients with high disease activity may not have, in the physician's opinion, had disease activity high enough to warrant anti-TNF therapy. The DAS28 also excludes certain joints, including the hips, ankles and feet, which may have been important factors in deciding on therapy in individual cases. Therefore, the DAS28 may not capture the full degree of disease activity in the patient.

### Active conventional treatment and three different biological treatments in early rheumatoid arthritis: phase IV investigator initiated, randomised, observer blinded clinical trial [^1174Cn22]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease associated with joint destruction, pain, functional impairment, and increased comorbidity and mortality. Early and active treatment is associated with improved outcome. The optimal first line treatment for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis has been debated, especially whether it should include a biological disease modifying drug. Currently, treatment recommendations in Europe and the United States advocate early treatment with conventional slow acting synthetic disease modifying drugs, with methotrexate as the anchor drug. The addition of short term low to moderate dose corticosteroids to methotrexate (termed active conventional treatment) might optimise results. Biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs with different modes of action have been marketed. The most frequently used treatments prescribed early in the disease course are tumour necrosis factor α inhibition, T cell costimulation blocker, and interleukin 6 inhibition. Previous trials have shown superior outcomes in treatment naïve patients who have received biological drugs in combination with methotrexate compared with methotrexate and placebo. Several biological drugs are available whose benefits and harms need to be compared with one another in treatment naïve patients. Studies are needed to determine whether one or more biologicals might be more beneficial or safer, or better tailored to different subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, a consortium of Scandinavian and Dutch academic investigators planned and conducted a randomised trial examining the comparative benefits and safety of biological drugs with different modes of action versus active conventional treatment in treatment naïve patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

In the first part of the NOrdic Rheumatic Diseases Strategy Trials And Registries (NORD-STAR) study our objective was to assess and compare the efficacy and safety after 24 weeks of active conventional treatment (either methotrexate combined with oral corticosteroids or methotrexate combined with intra-articular corticosteroids and other conventional synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs) versus three biological treatments: a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (certolizumab pegol), a T cell costimulation blocker (abatacept), and an interleukin 6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), all given in combination with methotrexate. Our hypothesis was that a higher clinical disease activity index (CDAI) remission rate would be observed for one or several of the biologicals compared with active conventional treatment.

Previous serious infection — addition of csDMARDs is conditionally recommended over addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients with a serious infection within the previous 12 months who have moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD monotherapy. This conditional recommendation is made based on observational data suggesting a lower risk of infection associated with combination csDMARDs (dual or triple therapy) compared to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, and some clinicians may prefer csDMARDs even if the serious infection occurred > 12 months prior to considering a change. Addition of/switching to DMARDs is conditionally recommended over initiation/dose escalation of glucocorticoids for patients with a serious infection within the previous 12 months who have moderate-to-high disease activity, based on observational studies suggesting a strong association between dose and duration of glucocorticoids with the risk of serious infection.

### Treat-to-target in rheumatoid arthritis-are we there yet? [^112HY5Hj]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Treat-to-target has been established as a guiding principle for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and encompasses several distinct elements: choosing a target and a method for measuring it; assessing the target at a pre-specified time point; a commitment to change the therapy if the target is not achieved; and shared decision-making. A treat-to-target approach yields superior outcomes to standard care in RA, and the ACR, EULAR and other professional organizations have endorsed treat-to-target as a fundamental therapeutic strategy for RA. Nevertheless, data on the degree to which treat-to-target is employed in the clinic are scarce; it seems that although some elements of treat-to-target are widely used, full implementation remains uncommon. Outstanding knowledge gaps to be addressed include how to select the right target for each patient, how often to assess whether the target has been achieved and the selection of each subsequent therapy in an evidence-based manner.

The first two criteria are addressed by referring to the evidence profile/summary of findings. To support decisions surrounding the third criterion, a literature search for qualitative studies of patients' values and preferences is conducted. Where no evidence is available, the consumer representatives on the guideline panel provide input to inform the decision based on their own experiences and understanding. The remaining criteria are addressed via panel discussions and supporting evidence where available.

Sensitivity analysis

We will assess the robustness of the treatment effect on both the proportion of participants with remission, and the proportion of participants with flare or relapse, due to potential selection bias and potential detection bias, by performing the following sensitivity analyses.

Selection bias: we will remove the trials that report inadequate or unclear allocation concealment from the meta‐analysis to see if this changes the overall treatment effect.
Detection bias: we will remove the trials that report inadequate or unclear participant blinding from the meta‐analysis to see if this changes the overall treatment effect.

Also, if we have to impute any missing data, we will assess the impact in sensitivity analyses.

### The management of first-line biologic therapy failures in rheumatoid arthritis: current practice and future perspectives [^113TWHUK]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The introduction of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) has dramatically changed the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, in a real-life setting about 30–40% of bDMARD treated patients experience drug discontinuation because of either inefficacy or adverse events. According to international recommendations, to date the best strategy for managing first-line bDMARD failures has not been defined yet and available data (especially on TNF inhibitors [TNFis]) seem to drive toward a personalized approach for the individual patient. Some TNFi partial responders may benefit from optimization of concomitant methotrexate therapy or from switching to a different concomitant sDMARD such as leflunomide. Conversely, apart from infliximab, TNFi dose escalation seems to be poor efficacious and poor cost-effective compared with alternative strategies. Albeit counterintuitive, the use of a second TNFi after the failure of the first-one (cycling strategy) is supported by clear evidences and has become widespread in the 2000s as the result of the limited alternative options till the introduction of bDMARDs with a mechanism of action other than TNF blockade. Nowadays, the use of abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, or JAK inhibitors as second-line agent (swapping strategy) is strongly supported by RCTs and real-life experiences. In the absence of head-to-head trials directly comparing these two strategies, meta-analyses of separated RCTs failed to find significant differences in favor of one or another choice. However, results from most observational studies, including well designed prospective pragmatic randomised analyses, demonstrated the superiority of swapping over cycling approach, whereas only few studies reported a comparable effectiveness. In this review, we aimed to critically analyze all the potential therapeutic options for the treatment of first-line bDMARD failures in order to provide a comprehensive overview of available strategies to be applied in clinical practice.

Rheumatoid arthritis — treat-to-target after inadequate response to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs: A treat-to-target approach is conditionally recommended over usual care for patients who have had an inadequate response to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs. The recommendation is conditional because of the uncertain incremental benefits of treat-to-target over usual care in this patient population, and in this context, usual care refers to commonly employed practice patterns, i.e., adjustment of treatment based on shared decision-making, albeit typically without systematic monitoring of disease activity using validated measures to reach a predefined target.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^115tsEiB]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

RA has a substantial impact on both patients and healthcare systems. Our objective is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the condition's diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists formulated contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations concerning both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were documented, leading to research recommendations.

Results

A fundamental concept governing treatment of RA is minimization of cumulative inflammation, referred to as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core principles of management were identified: (i) detect and refer patients early, even if the diagnosis is uncertain: patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis and rheumatology departments should provide rapid access to a diagnostic and prognostic service; (ii) treat RA immediately: optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires that effective treatment be started early-ideally within 3 months of symptom onset; (iii) tight control of inflammation in RA improves outcome: frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low-disease activity/remission at an agreed target; (iv) consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment to each patient: differing patient, disease and drug characteristics require long-term monitoring of risks and benefits with adaptations of treatments to suit individual circumstances.

Conclusion

These principles focus on effective control of the inflammatory process in RA, but optimal uptake may require changes in service provision to accommodate appropriate care pathways.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis: a review [^115jkF8m]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs in about 5 per 1000 people and can lead to severe joint damage and disability. Significant progress has been made over the past 2 decades regarding understanding of disease pathophysiology, optimal outcome measures, and effective treatment strategies, including the recognition of the importance of diagnosing and treating RA early.

Observations

Early diagnosis and treatment of RA can avert or substantially slow progression of joint damage in up to 90% of patients, thereby preventing irreversible disability. The development of novel instruments to measure disease activity and identify the presence or absence of remission have facilitated new treatment strategies to arrest RA before joints are damaged irreversibly. Outcomes have been improved by recognizing the benefits of early diagnosis and early therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The treatment target is remission or a state of at least low disease activity, which should be attained within 6 months. Methotrexate is first-line therapy and should be prescribed at an optimal dose of 25 mg weekly and in combination with glucocorticoids; 40% to 50% of patients reach remission or at least low disease activity with this regimen. If this treatment fails, sequential application of targeted therapies, such as biologic agents (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) or Janus kinase inhibitors in combination with methotrexate, have allowed up to 75% of these patients to reach the treatment target over time. New therapies have been developed in response to new pathogenetic findings. The costs of some therapies are considerable, but these costs are decreasing with the advent of biosimilar drugs (drugs essentially identical to the original biologic drugs but usually available at lower cost).

Conclusions and Relevance

Scientific advances have improved therapies that prevent progression of irreversible joint damage in up to 90% of patients with RA. Early treatment with methotrexate plus glucocorticoids and subsequently with other DMARDs, such as inhibitors of TNF, IL-6, or Janus kinases, improves outcomes and prevents RA-related disability. A treat-to-target strategy aimed at reducing disease activity by at least 50% within 3 months and achieving remission or low disease activity within 6 months, with sequential drug treatment if needed, can prevent RA-related disability.

### Patient-reported outcomes and radiographic progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in sustained remission versus low disease activity [^115SrJ13]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical outcomes for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have improved dramatically in the recent decades. This is partly a result of treat-to-target (T2T) strategies that aim for inactive disease. Despite these T2T strategies, patients with RA still experience pain and functional limitations and have a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL).RA is also associated with productivity loss, causing a high burden for both affected patients and society as a whole. To lessen the negative impact of the disease, early and targeted treatment is crucial. But what is the best target to aim for?

Current European guidelines recommend sustained remission (sREM) as treatment target in early RA. In contrast, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline, based on the same evidence, conditionally recommends low disease activity (LDA) rather than remission. Yet the ACR also states that remission is a reasonable initial target for patients with early RA. Thus, there is still debate about the most optimal treatment target that is both attainable in daily clinical practice and results in good clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The strict remission target is only attained by 35%–58% of patients with RA and sREM is even less common.LDA is an alternative acceptable target, especially in established RA or when remission cannot be reached.LDA is easier to attain and is achieved in approximately 49%–86% of patients with RA. Of note, there is currently no gold standard measure to assess disease activity, nor a measure to assess sREM or LDA.

### What is the optimal target for Treat-to-target strategies in rheumatoid arthritis? [^114sV9wJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There has been a trend over time to aim for stricter treatment targets in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We reviewed recent literature to attempt to identify the optimal target in treat-to-target strategies in RA.

Recent Findings

Achieving lower disease activity was shown to be beneficial, but few studies directly compared the effect of aiming for different treatment targets. Based on the limited available evidence, aiming for remission seems to result in more patients achieving (drug-free) remission than aiming for low disease activity (LDA), but it does not seem to result in better physical functioning. There are indications that adherence to a remission targeted protocol can be lower. In randomized trials in which LDA or remission were compared with ultrasound remission targets, treatment targeted at ultrasound remission was associated with more intensive treatment, but it did not result in better clinical or imaging outcomes.

Summary

There were no benefits of aiming for ultrasound remission in RA-patients. To decide whether remission or LDA is the best target in the treatment of RA-patients, a randomized clinical trial comparing both targets would be needed. On an individual level, cotargets such as functional ability should be considered.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics

The baseline characteristics and demographic data for the entire SWEFOT cohort (n = 487) and for the 157 MTX‐IR patients included in the present study were similar (Table 1). Characteristics at month 3 between randomized patients who were included in this study (n = 157) and those who were not (n = 101) were also similar, with the patient's global assessment by visual analog scale being the only significantly different variable (lower among the patients in the present study; data available upon request from the corresponding author).

Relationship between the MBDA score, CRP level, ESR, and DAS28 and a subsequent clinical response to triple therapy or anti‐TNF therapy

Overall, there was no significant difference in the proportion of responders at year 1 between the triple therapy (n = 75) and the anti‐TNF therapy (n = 82) groups (47% versus 54%; P = 0.381). At month 3, the MBDA score, ESR, and DAS28 values were significantly lower in subsequent responders versus nonresponders to triple therapy at year 1 (Figures 1 A, C, and D), whereas this was only observed for the DAS28 value in those receiving anti‐TNF therapy (Figure 1 D). When stratified according to established cutoffs for the MBDA score, 12% of patients had low (< 30), 32% had moderate (30–44), and 56% had high (> 44) MBDA scores at treatment escalation.

### Low rates of remission with methotrexate monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis: review of randomised controlled trials could point towards a paradigm shift [^112HqfoE]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has improved substantially during the last decades, mainly due to the development and introduction in everyday practice of new, highly efficacious, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), more optimal usage of them, earlier diagnosis and tighter control of disease activity targeting at remission. Methotrexate is still today the anchor drug and the first-line treatment after diagnosis. However, numerous studies comparing methotrexate and biologic DMARDs, as well as new targeted synthetic DMARDs, both in early as in more established disease, have shown consistently better efficacy of the latter compared with methotrexate, with methotrexate yielding remission to maximum half of patients. This could suggest a new paradigm shift with earlier start of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD, with the possibility of subsequent discontinuation in case of achievement of stable remission. Several strategy trials, however, have shown that there might be a clinical and structural benefit of initial, aggressive therapy, possibly even associated with higher chance of remaining in remission, after cessation of the biologic DMARD and continuing with methotrexate alone, but they have failed to show a clear advantage of such an aggressive treatment strategy. This might become a valuable option for the future treatment algorithm of RA, especially for a subgroup of patients with RA, but further confirmation from future research is needed. The crucial role of glucocorticoid use as part of the combination strategy should be acknowledged, and strategy trials should include this combination as an active comparator.

### Patient preferences for treatment: report from a randomised comparison of treatment strategies in early rheumatoid arthritis (BeSt trial) [^115xGu8K]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine treatment preferences among patients with recent onset rheumatoid arthritis participating in a randomised controlled trial comparing four therapeutic strategies.

Methods

A questionnaire was sent to all 508 participants of the BeSt trial, treated for an average of 2.2 years with either sequential monotherapy (group 1), step-up combination therapy (group 2), initial combination therapy with tapered high-dose prednisone (group 3), or initial combination therapy with infliximab (group 4). Treatment adjustments were made every 3 months to achieve low disease activity (DAS ≤ 2.4). The questionnaire explored patients' preferences or dislikes for the initial therapy.

Results

In total, 440 patients (87%) completed the questionnaire. Despite virtually equal study outcomes at 2 years, more patients in group 4 reported much or very much improvement of general health: 50%, 56%, 46% and 74% in groups 1–4, respectively (overall, P < 0.001). Almost half of the patients expressed no preference or aversion for a particular treatment group, 33% had hoped for assignment to group 4 and 38% had hoped against assignment to group 3. This negative perception was much less prominent in patients actually in group 3. Nevertheless, 50% of patients in group 3 disliked having to take prednisone, while only 8% in group 4 disliked going to the hospital for intravenous treatment.

Conclusions

Within the limitations of our retrospective study, patients clearly preferred initial combination therapy with infliximab and disliked taking prednisone. After actual exposure, this preference remained, but the perception of prednisone improved. Patient perceptions need to be addressed when administering treatment.

### One year in review 2020: novelties in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^114Ruc86]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management is driven by evidence, and new 2019 EULAR recommendations help in refining the relevant place of different disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in treatment schedules. At present, new drugs are in phase of development, mainly Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKis), however, specific treatment strategies seem to count more than individual DMARDs in terms of treatment responses, given the substantial lack of head-to-head comparisons between specific biological (b) and targeted synthetic (ts)DMARDs, and with the general perception of a similar efficacy profile across drugs. In this setting, when reliable biomarkers able to predict treatment responses are lacking, treatment decisions are mainly driven by specific clinical or individual factors, given the recognised role of comorbidities, treatment-specific side effects, patients' preferences, and costs on drug choice. In this narrative review, the authors give their specific point of view on the management of RA, based on a critical revision of the literature published in 2019, focusing on relevant novelties and future research directions.

Discussion

This is the first analysis that presents detailed treatment response and drug survival for RA patients who have received multiple (more than three) lines of b/tsDMARD therapy, including some with up to six or more different courses of therapy. Within this large national register, a relatively small proportion of participants received treatment beyond third line. Treatment response and drug survival were the highest for individuals starting their first b/tsDMARD. Improvements in DAS28 were observed across patients starting lines two to six including changes in class of b/tsDMARD, albeit with a lower overall response rate, suggesting that there may be utility in further lines of therapy for many patients despite failure to control disease activity with earlier lines. Approximately 1 in 5 participants on fifth- or sixth-line b/tsDMARD achieved LDA or good EULAR response, and 1 in 10 achieved remission, which were comparable to response observed for third- and even second-line drugs.

### Choosing first-line biologic treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: what does the evidence say? [^115tBpCk]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

An advanced understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis has led to the development of multiple therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, ustekinumab, interleukin-17 inhibitors, and guselkumab (an interleukin-23 inhibitor recently approved for psoriasis) are commercially available biologic agents for psoriasis. Evidence from clinical trials provides pertinent information regarding the safety and efficacy of biologic agents for psoriasis, which should be integrated into clinical decision making. However, disease presentations, disease severity, and comorbid conditions can complicate the choice of initial treatment, which underscores the importance of providing personalized therapy for patients with psoriasis. Furthermore, each biologic agent offers unique benefits and limitations for the treatment of patients with psoriasis. Here, evidence-based recommendations are presented and discussed regarding first-line biologic therapy options for patients with psoriasis and distinct comorbid conditions or patient-related factors. We discuss the comorbid conditions of psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B, and latent tuberculosis. Moreover, we describe treatment recommendations for distinct patient populations with psoriasis, including pediatric patients with psoriasis and patients with psoriasis of childbearing potential and nursing.

### Influence of disease activity on RA treatment choices in countries with restricted access to expensive, innovative drugs: a discrete choice experiment among rheumatologists [^1132CZSh]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the influence of disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis on treatment choices of rheumatologists in countries with restricted access to expensive, innovative drugs.

Methods

Rheumatologists from Hungary, Romania and UK were invited to complete two consecutive discrete choice experiments with hypothetical drug treatments for two different patient profiles: high and moderate disease activity. Rheumatologists were asked to choose repeatedly between two unlabelled treatment options that differed in five attributes: efficacy (expected improvement and achieved disease activity state), safety (probability of serious adverse events), patient's preference (level of agreement), total medication costs and cost-effectiveness. A heteroscedastic discrete choice model using interaction terms between attribute levels and patient profiles (binary variable) was used to assess the preferences of rheumatologists towards each attribute and the influence of the patient profile.

Results

Overall, 148 rheumatologists completed the survey (46% females, mean age 49 years, 49% academic). For both patient profiles, efficacy dominated the treatment choice over patient's preference, safety and economic aspects. However, for patients with high compared with moderate disease activity, the importance of drug efficacy significantly increased (from 48% for moderate to 57% for high disease activity), whereas the importance of patient's preference significantly decreased (from 15% to 11%). No significant differences were observed for economic and safety considerations.

Conclusion

Rheumatologists were willing to give up some efficacy to account for patient's preference when choosing treatments for patients with moderate compared to high disease activity. Disease activity however did not influence importance of economic aspects in treatment choices.

### Therapeutic advances in rheumatoid arthritis [^116KUTDw]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common immune mediated inflammatory diseases. People with rheumatoid arthritis present with pain, swelling, and stiffness that typically affects symmetrically distributed small and large joints. Without effective treatment, significant joint damage, disability, and work loss develop, owing to chronic inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). Over the past 25 years, the management of this condition has been revolutionized, resulting in substantially higher levels of disease remission and better long term outcomes. This improvement reflects a paradigm shift towards early and aggressive pharmacological intervention coupled with a proliferation in treatment choice, in turn related to enhanced pathobiological understanding and the advent of new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. Following an overview of these developments from a historical perspective, and with a general audience in mind, this review focuses on newer, targeted treatments in an ever evolving landscape. The review highlights ongoing areas of debate and unmet need, including the proportion of patients with persistent, difficult-to-treat disease, despite recent advances. Also discussed are personalized, strategic approaches to individual patients, the role for imaging in clinical decision making, and the goal of sustained, drug free remission and disease prevention in the future.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^112czE38]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

It is also important to maintain monitoring of patients who at some point qualified as being in an (active) D2T-RA state but now have effective disease control. This group remains at risk of reverting to D2T-RA — for example, the patient who has achieved controlled disease on their fourth or fifth b/tsDMARD and would perhaps not be captured in the current definition compared with a patient having just failed a second targeted therapy with moderate or high disease activity. Although it is likely that the former individual would have a poorer quality of life (reflected in criteria 2e and 3), a management approach that is not contingent on a single time point disease activity state and takes a longitudinal view would be useful going forwards. This population is also important to investigate to understand the immunopathogenic basis of reaching a refractory state.

Re-evaluating outcomes of early RA studies

Finally, the treat to target management paradigm and the use of highly effective therapies in a timelier fashion do not appear to have removed the undesirable trajectory to D2T and refractory RA. This raises the question of whether we are failing to treat effectively from the outset. Pragmatic studies with longer-term outcomes to identify patients that reach a D2T/refractory state need to be conducted alongside the conventional short-term early RA intervention studies to evaluate for progression to refractory RA.

Recognising the multifactorial basis for progression to D2T-RA, a multipronged management approach is needed to address the risk of developing D2T-RA and its management. The PtC and algorithm present pharmacotherapy (through immunosuppression) and non-pharmacological interventions as dichotomous management strategies of choice — in reality, a large proportion of patients would benefit from both. Recognising the different components that contribute to a D2T-RA state (figure 5) is essential for tailored care. Testing management strategies that combine pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention would represent a shift in pragmatic clinical trial design that reflects the needs of the real-world population. If shown to be successful, it would provide a stronger basis to lever the necessary multidisciplinary resources for implementation into clinical pathways and services. This approach aligns with a 'dual target' strategy suggested by Ferreira et al in response to the risks of overtreatment with immunosuppression in pursuit of a treatment target that may not be achievable with DMARD alone. The authors recommended a strategy for control of inflammation and another for control of disease impact to deliver more complete benefit to individual patients.

### 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^111apDfJ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a new evidence-based, pharmacologic treatment guideline for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We conducted systematic reviews to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of various treatment options. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the quality of evidence. We employed a group consensus process to grade the strength of recommendations (either strong or conditional). A strong recommendation indicates that clinicians are certain that the benefits of an intervention far outweigh the harms (or vice versa). A conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty over the balance of benefits and harms and/or more significant variability in patient values and preferences.

Results

The guideline covers the use of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, tofacitinib, and glucocorticoids in early (< 6 months) and established (≥ 6 months) RA. In addition, it provides recommendations on using a treat-to-target approach, tapering and discontinuing medications, and the use of biologic agents and DMARDs in patients with hepatitis, congestive heart failure, malignancy, and serious infections. The guideline addresses the use of vaccines in patients starting/receiving DMARDs or biologic agents, screening for tuberculosis in patients starting/receiving biologic agents or tofacitinib, and laboratory monitoring for traditional DMARDs. The guideline includes 74 recommendations: 23% are strong and 77% are conditional.

Conclusion

This RA guideline should serve as a tool for clinicians and patients (our two target audiences) for pharmacologic treatment decisions in commonly encountered clinical situations. These recommendations are not prescriptive, and the treatment decisions should be made by physicians and patients through a shared decision-making process taking into account patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

Analysis

The primary analysis was a comparison between the rate of agreement with each of the four selected recommendations and the rate of actual compliance with them when measured in the METEOR database. The recommendations were operationalised as follows:
EULAR recommendation 1: ' Treatment with synthetic DMARDs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is made'; was operationalised as: The proportion of patients in whom the time interval between the date of diagnosis and the date of start of a DMARD (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug) was ≤ 4 weeks.
EULAR recommendation 2: ' MTX is part of the first treatment strategy in patients with active RA'; was operationalised as: The proportion of RA patients in whom MTX was (part of) the first treatment strategy.
EULAR recommendation 3: ' When MTX contraindications (or intolerance) are present, the following DMARDs should be used: Leflunomide, sulfasalazine or injectable gold'; was operationalised as: The proportion of patients who did not start with MTX in whom leflunomide, sulfasalazine or injectable gold was prescribed as an alternative.
Treat to target recommendation 5: ' Measures of disease activity must be obtained and documented regularly as frequently as monthly for patients with high/moderate disease activity or less frequently (such as every 3–6 months) for patients in sustained low disease activity or remission'. Three categories were formed: (1) 'T2T always' represents the number of patients for whom a composite score (DAS, DAS28, CDAI or SDAI) was reported at least every 2 months if moderate- or high disease activity (DAS > 2.4, DAS28 > 3.6 CDAI > 10, SDAI > 11) was present; and at least every 7 months when low disease activity was measured in 100% of the visits; (2) 'T2T sometimes/never' when 'T2T always' was not met; and (3). 'not reported' when composite scores were missing in all of the visits.

US recommendations

The 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for early and established RA recommend adding GCs to DMARDs during disease flares, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period possible. In contrast to the European recommendations, adding GCs when a csDMARD is initiated depends on disease activity.

Taken together, these international recommendations agree on the use of GCs for disease flare and possibly at the start of a new csDMARD. Specific advice concerning dosage, duration, route of administration and strategies is limited and less consensual, because reliable and detailed evidence is scarce. For US recommendations, a dose < 10 mg/day is considered a low dose, and GCs should be tapered in less than 3 months, whereas for European recommendations, the threshold is 7.5 mg/day, and GCs could be prescribed in combination with csDMARDs for up to 6 months maximum, knowing that this duration is mainly expert-driven. Despite these differences, international guidelines underline the importance of GCs but also advocate the use of GCs at the lowest cumulative dose possible because of the high awareness of potentially associated adverse effects.

In these sets of recommendations as well as in this review, GCs dosages are expressed in prednisone equivalent.

### One year in review 2019: novelties in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^1168Ai1j]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current treatment approach in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) follows a stepwise management, starting from early introduction of conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), moving to biological (b) DMARDs and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. In the last few years, new drugs with different mechanisms of action have demonstrated their efficacy in treating such a disabling condition, and their approval, along with other more "experienced" treatments, has established their effectiveness on disease activity, damage accrual prevention, patients' quality of life improvement, confirming their safety profile. Moreover, new molecular pathways are under investigation as potential targets of new advanced therapies. Clinicians' capability of stratifying treatment strategies and decisions has improved, with several new tools for the optimisation of long-term management of RA; however, a high proportion of patients are refractory to the available drugs. Finally, as RA is a systemic disease, the knowledge in multi-systemic complications of the disease has grown, as well as the possibility in improving extra-articular manifestations of the disease, although certain drugs have potentially relevant non-articular effects, which need to be monitored. This narrative review summarises the most relevant studies published over the last year in the field of treatment of RA, with the major aim to let clinicians and researchers reflect on "what is new", "what is effective" and "what is safe".

### Comparative effectiveness of combining MTX with biologic drug therapy versus either MTX or biologics alone for early rheumatoid arthritis in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1114rsEd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Comparative effectiveness of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments remains uncertain.

Purpose

Compare benefits and harms of biologic drug therapies for adults with early RA within 1 year of diagnosis.

Data Sources

English language articles from the 2012 review to October 2017 identified through MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, gray literature, expert recommendations, reference lists of published literature, and supplemental evidence data requests.

Study Selection

Two persons independently selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data; a second reviewer checked accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned risk of bias ratings.

Data Synthesis

We identified 22 eligible studies with 9934 participants. Combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or non-TNF biologics plus methotrexate (MTX) improved disease control, remission, and functional capacity compared with monotherapy of either MTX or a biologic. Network meta-analyses found higher ACR50 response (50% improvement) for combination therapy of biologic plus MTX than for MTX monotherapy (relative risk range 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04 to 1.38] to 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30 to 1.88]). No significant differences emerged between treatment discontinuation rates because of adverse events or serious adverse events. Subgroup data (disease activity, prior therapy, demographics, serious conditions) were limited.

Limitations

Trials enrolled almost exclusively selected populations with high disease activity. Network meta-analyses were derived from indirect comparisons relative to MTX due to the dearth of head-to-head studies comparing interventions. No eligible data on biosimilars were found.

Conclusions

Qualitative and network meta-analyses suggest that the combination of MTX with TNF or non-TNF biologics reduces disease activity and improves remission when compared with MTX monotherapy. Overall adverse event and discontinuation rates were similar between treatment groups.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^112nf5UE]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment strategy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has undergone major changes in the past decades. The introduction of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and targeted biologic-DMARDs (bDMARDs) has broadened the therapeutic possibilities, making clinical and radiographic remission an achievable goal. The increasing awareness of the prognostic impact of treating disease to target (T2T), adjusting therapy according to disease activity, has further optimised the outcomes. The evidence from trials using early intensive DMARD strategies introduced the concept of 'window of opportunity' and gave rise to early RA (ERA) clinics, supported by the long-term remission, as well as functional, radiographic and prognostic outcomes of starting treatment early.

Rheumatoid arthritis — DMARD tapering after target attainment: Patients in remission for < 6 months should not routinely be considered for dose reduction or withdrawal, and the voting panel considered 6 months to be a reasonable minimal length of time to ensure stable disease control. "Dose reduction" refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD, and "Gradual discontinuation" denotes gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it. Continuation of all DMARDs at their current dose is conditionally recommended over a dose reduction of a DMARD, dose reduction is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of a DMARD, and gradual discontinuation is conditionally recommended over abrupt discontinuation of a DMARD for patients who are at target for at least 6 months.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The primary treatment goals for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), symptom reduction and prevention of joint damage leading to permanent disability, require intervention with disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including first‐line conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Currently, methotrexate (MTX) is the most widely accepted initial therapy for RA, supported by its well‐known long‐term efficacy and safety profile, current guidelines and treatment recommendations from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and few restrictions (i.e. cost) to patient access (1, 2). However, the success of initial therapy with MTX is limited. Remission is achieved in only a minority of patients receiving MTX, and acceptable disease control is achieved in at most 60% of patients (3, 4, 5). For patients who have an insufficient initial response or are intolerant of or lose response to MTX over time (~80%), csDMARDs other than MTX or the addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD to a csDMARD are recommended to rapidly attenuate the potentially irreversible impact of active disease (1, 2, 6). Previous studies in MTX‐naive patients with moderately‐to‐severely active RA and poor prognosis (seropositivity for rheumatoid factor [RF] and anti–citrullinated protein antibodies [ACPAs] and radiographic damage at baseline) have shown that MTX monotherapy was less effective than its combination treatments (7).

### Patterns of comorbidities differentially affect long-term functional evolution and disease activity in patients with' difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis [^114YXgSC]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Setting and patient inclusion

For the present study we analysed patients registered in the University of Crete Rheumatology Clinic Registry (UCRCR), a single centre prospective cohort established in year 2004. Adults ≥ 18 years old with inflammatory arthritis are included in UCRCR at the time of initiation of the first biological or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (b/ts-DMARD) and they are prospectively followed irrespectively of treatment switches for as long as they receive biological/targeted therapy. Only patients fulfilling the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR criteria for an RA diagnosis were included in the analysis.

Study design

As this is an observational cohort study, all treatment decisions (b/ts-DMARD initiation and selection of type/mode of action, co-medication, dosage adjustments/switches) are made by the attending rheumatologists based on clinical assessments, national guidelines and patients' preferences. According to national guidelines, patients are considered candidates for biological treatment if they have active disease (defined as Disease Activity Index 28 (DAS28) > 3.2) and have failed previous treatment with at least one conventional synthetic DMARD (cs-DMARDs), most commonly methotrexate. Although, based on national guidelines for the management of RA, treatment adaptations according to disease activity levels are recommended, a strict treat-to-target approach is not mandatory in clinical practice. Treatment decisions are mostly based on physician's assessment for disease activity, taking into consideration disease activity, comorbidities and patient's preferences.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to management of difficult-to-treat disease, EULAR 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a biological or targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug with a different target after the failure of a second or subsequent biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
and particularly after two TNF-inhibitor failures.

### Novel treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis [^115JT95N]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

New treatment strategies have substantially changed the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients can achieve remission if the disease is recognised early and is treated promptly and continuously; however, some individuals do not respond adequately to treatment. Rapid diagnosis and a treat-to-target approach with tight monitoring and control, can increase the likelihood of remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this Series paper, we describe new insights into the management of rheumatoid arthritis with targeted therapy approaches using classic and novel medications, and outline the potential effects of precision medicine in this challenging disease. Articles are included that investigate the treat-to-target approach, which includes adding or de-escalating treatment. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment is impeded by delayed diagnosis, problematic access to specialists, and difficulties adhering to treat-to-target principles. Clinical management goals in rheumatoid arthritis include enabling rapid access to optimum diagnosis and care and the well informed use of multiple treatments approved for this disease.

### Start RA treatment-biologics or JAK-inhibitors? [^113mH1EW]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) have been approved for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) for several years. They are the first oral advanced treatment with efficacy similar to, if not greater than, biologic agents. Recently, concerns over their safety was raised by the results from Oral Surveillance trial suggesting that tofacitinib, one of the JAKi, was associated with higher cardiovascular adverse events and malignancies than TNF inhibitors (TNFi). Since then, regulatory authorities have added warnings to the labels of JAKi. On this purpose, whether rheumatologists should use JAKi as first line advance treatment has become a controversial topic. Some rheumatologists have argued that biologics should be first line advance treatment since there are extensive effectiveness and safety data. In addition, with the advent of biosimilar drugs, they are the most cost-effective treatment. On the other hand, JAKi are very efficacious and are generally safe apart from older and high-risk patients. When TNFi are contraindicated and in certain RA patients, especially when an oral drug is preferable, JAKi have significant advantage providing patients are involved in the decision-making process.

### Methotrexate in Italian patients wiTh rheumatoid arthritis (MITRA study): an observational study about the use of methotrexate in early RA patients and the adherence to the EULAR 2013 recommendations. A project of the Italian society for rheumatology [^113By3pZ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the delay between the disease onset and the beginning of methotrexate (MTX) treatment in RA patients and to evaluate the Italian rheumatologists' adherence to the EULAR 2013 recommendations.

Methods

MITRA is an Italian multicentre observational study carried out on DMARD-naïve RA patients recruited in an 18-month period starting from 2015. The data related to the patients' characteristics at baseline will be presented.

Results

332 patients from 13 Italian centres were recruited: the median delay between the onset of symptoms and the beginning of MTX was 197 days (102–431); in 20% of patients a treatment with DMARDs was started within the first 90 days from the onset of symptoms. The clinical target selected was DAS28 remission in 64.2% of cases and low disease activity in 35.8%. Among patients in DAS28 high disease activity, 92.6% received a control visit which was rescheduled within the first 3 months, similarly to those in DAS28 moderate disease activity (91.6%). A DMARD monotherapy was prescribed in 319 patients, while a combined therapy of DMARDs was preferred in 13 cases; 282 patients were treated with MTX. Glucocorticoids were prescribed in 229 patients: the median dosage was of 5 mg (IQR 5–7.5) of prednisone equivalent/day.

Conclusions

Diagnostic delay in RA patients continues to be longer than expected. The choice of low disease activity as a target is still very frequent and tight control does not seem to be based on disease activity. This paper offers a realistic and detailed picture of the clinical practice among Italian rheumatologists.

### A multi-biomarker disease activity score and the choice of second-line therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis after methotrexate failure [^114gCvfM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The main strength of this study was that the patient population included in the SWEFOT trial is from standard care with little selection; almost all patients in the areas of the participating centers were referred directly there, and the only inclusion criteria were an age ≥ 18 years, a symptom duration of < 12 months, a DAS28 of > 3.2, and a stable low dosage of prednisolone in those who were taking it. Another strength of this study was a reasonable sample size and comparable numbers of patients in each treatment arm (n = 75 for triple therapy versus n = 82 for anti‐TNF), which allowed us to obtain reliable statistical results. However, of the entire group of MTX‐IR patients randomized to triple therapy or anti‐TNF (n = 258), 40% were not included in the analyses because complete data at 3 and 12 months were lacking. The characteristics at 3 months did not differ between the 2 groups, except for global health assessment in the patients who were not analyzed (n = 101) versus those who were (n = 157) (data available upon request from the corresponding author).

In conclusion, in patients with early RA who had an insufficient clinical response to first‐line therapy with MTX, the MBDA score was significantly and differentially associated with subsequent response to triple therapy or to anti‐TNF therapy. A subset of patients (29% of the study population) had lower MBDA scores and a higher proportion of responders to triple therapy than to anti‐TNF. In contrast, patients with higher MBDA scores (71% of the study population) had greater benefit from anti‐TNF than triple therapy. We believe this is the first identification of a biomarker test that identifies a group of patients in whom conventional therapy is more optimal than biologic therapy.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^113YeHhz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis — treat-to-target in patients without prior bDMARD/tsDMARD exposure: A treat-to-target approach is strongly recommended over usual care for patients who have not been previously treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs. This recommendation applies to dose optimization of methotrexate and to the subsequent addition of DMARDs when required, and the recommendation is strong despite low-certainty evidence because of the recognized importance of systematic monitoring and adjustment of treatment to minimize inflammation to prevent joint damage, as well as other long-term sequelae including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, hydroxychloroquine is recommended for initial treatment in those with low disease activity.
- Methotrexate is recommended for initial treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and moderate or high disease activity.
- Rheumatoid arthritis treatment should be targeted to a standardized disease activity scale. Initial Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis For patients without previous DMARD use, treatment recommendations are stratified by disease activity using patient ratings and inflammation measures. Low Disease Activity With low disease activity, consider, in this order, initial treatment with hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and leflunomide. Hydroxychloroquine is better tolerated and has a better risk profile than the others.

Sulfasalazine is recommended over methotrexate and leflunomide because it causes less immunosuppression. Methotrexate is recommended over leflunomide because of lower cost and better dosing flexibility. Moderate to High Disease Activity With moderate to high disease activity, methotrexate is the best initial treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate has stronger evidence of disease-modifying activity than the other csDMARDs, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. Although some bDMARDs and tsDMARDs have evidence of better outcomes, methotrexate is safe and effective, with convenient dosing and low cost. Combination therapy is not recommended for initial treatment because it is unnecessary for many patients and incurs higher toxicity and cost. Recommendations for methotrexate therapy are summarized in. Coexisting Conditions For patients with subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, methotrexate is recommended as initial therapy unless nodules progress.

Switching to a different DMARD is then recommended. Although preexisting lung disease is a risk factor for methotrexate-related pneumonitis, the risk is uncertain and other therapies can also worsen lung disease. Methotrexate is recommended with careful monitoring. 1 The CADI is easy to access, is the quickest to complete, requires no laboratory measurements, and grades disease activity as remission, low, moderate, and high. The ACR is clear on the initial recommended medications — hydroxychloroquine for low disease activity and methotrexate for moderate or high disease activity.
