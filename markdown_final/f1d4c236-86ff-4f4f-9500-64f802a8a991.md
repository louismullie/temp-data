## Question

Are there any new advancements in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest advancements in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) treatment, including new therapies, optimized use of existing antifibrotics, supportive care, biomarkers, imaging, and early detection strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current standard of care and its limitations. Then, I should verify the most promising emerging therapies with phase 2 signals. Next, I will examine real-world optimization of antifibrotic therapy and supportive care. After that, I need to review biomarker and imaging advances. Finally, I should consider early detection via ILAs and synthesize a practical, forward-looking clinical perspective with appropriate caveats and timelines.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: IPF remains a progressive fibrotic ILD with high mortality and symptom burden, and the cornerstone of therapy remains pirfenidone and nintedanib, which slow FVC decline but do not halt disease progression; median survival remains approximately 2–4 years without treatment, reinforcing the need for disease-modifying innovation beyond these agents [^112ztSXE] [^1142okNh] [^114WdAyE].

> Wait, let me verify the most compelling new therapeutic signal. Taladegib (ENV-101), a hedgehog pathway inhibitor, produced a statistically significant improvement in FVC at 12 weeks versus placebo in a phase 2a trial of treatment-naïve IPF, with favorable safety and supportive HRCT changes; this is the first signal of potential improvement rather than mere slowing of decline, so I should flag this as a major advancement pending phase 2b confirmation [^117DCNMp].

> I will now examine the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 antagonist, admilparant (BMS-986278). In a phase 2 RCT across IPF and PPF, the 60 mg twice-daily dose slowed FVC decline by about 1.4% in IPF and 3.2% in PPF over 26 weeks, with acceptable safety; importantly, the effect was observed with or without background antifibrotics, suggesting complementary benefit and supporting progression to phase 3 trials [^1173a8iN].

> Next, I should review the autotaxin inhibitor BBT-877. A 24-week phase 2 proof-of-concept study is underway with FVC as the primary endpoint and exploratory CT-based imaging biomarkers; the design explicitly addresses limitations of small, short POC studies, so if positive, this could reshape early decision-making and biomarker strategies in IPF development pipelines [^111GgXhy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combination therapy with current antifibrotics. I initially thought the 12-week exploratory trial showed improved efficacy with nintedanib plus pirfenidone, but wait, I should double-check the primary endpoint; it was actually gastrointestinal tolerability, not efficacy, and adverse events were higher with combination therapy, so routine combination is not supported outside trials and current guidelines discourage it, even though pharmacokinetic interaction is minimal [^112RXdRg] [^114YUKqD].

> Let me consider real-world optimization of existing antifibrotics. Comparative cohorts suggest long-term efficacy is similar between nintedanib and pirfenidone, but dose reductions are more frequent with nintedanib; crucially, dose reductions did not worsen outcomes, supporting individualized titration to maintain exposure while preserving quality of life, which is a practical advancement in care delivery [^114UN8WB] [^112sgxks] [^1125w3b9].

> I need to ensure supportive care advances are not overlooked. Inhaled treprostinil is now FDA-approved for WHO Group 3 PH-ILD, including IPF, to improve exercise capacity; this addresses a common and morbid complication and expands the therapeutic armamentarium beyond antifibrotics alone, though careful patient selection and monitoring are essential [^115GNggu].

> Next, I should review biomarker advances that may personalize therapy. Short-term trajectories of MMP-degraded CRP neoepitope (CRPM) after starting nintedanib predict 5-year mortality and transplant-free survival, with effects driven by the nintedanib-treated cohort; mechanistic data suggest endothelial modulation by nintedanib, hinting at a pharmacodynamic biomarker to stratify response and guide treatment decisions [^111YPfXW].

> Let me verify imaging and AI-driven progress. Quantitative CT and machine-learning fibrosis quantification are increasingly linked to lung function decline and survival, and AI-based diagnostic and monitoring tools are being integrated to enable objective risk stratification; endobronchial optical coherence tomography and PET targeted to collagen or fibrin are emerging for microscopic characterization and progression prediction, though standardization and scanner variability remain challenges [^115TnwRe].

> I should confirm early detection strategies. The ATS clinical statement recommends structured follow-up for interstitial lung abnormalities, with repeat HRCT at 2–3 years for most and earlier at 12 months for high-risk features; first-degree relatives of patients with pulmonary fibrosis have a substantial prevalence of ILA/ILD, but screening relatives did not reach consensus due to modest test performance, underscoring the need for better risk stratification before population screening [^115USLia] [^116JMFUX] [^112PDnnu] [^117Q5b82].

> But wait, what about AI-accelerated drug discovery itself as an advancement? Published timelines describe an AI-driven IPF program moving from target discovery to phase 2a in roughly 18 months with unexpected dose-dependent FVC improvements, illustrating how generative AI and aging-hallmark frameworks can compress timelines; however, I should emphasize that these are early, non-peer-reviewed program-level claims and require replication and regulatory validation [^113WjKQ5].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. The most impactful near-term advances are the emergence of mechanism-targeted agents like taladegib and admilparant with phase 2 signals, the maturation of biomarker-guided personalization, and the expansion of supportive therapies for PH-ILD; meanwhile, real-world evidence supports pragmatic dose optimization of antifibrotics, and early detection via ILAs sets the stage for preclinical intervention once effective, well-tolerated therapies are identified [^117DCNMp] [^1173a8iN] [^111YPfXW] [^115GNggu] [^115USLia].

> Finally, I should double-check the limitations and next steps. No new therapy has yet secured regulatory approval beyond pirfenidone and nintedanib, combination antifibrotic therapy remains investigational, and biomarker- or imaging-guided treatment algorithms require prospective validation; nonetheless, the convergence of novel targets, robust phase 2 signals, and digital biomarkers suggests that the next 2–3 years could yield disease-modifying options that move beyond slowing decline toward stabilization or improvement if phase 3 trials confirm efficacy and safety [^115QD8DU] [^117DCNMp] [^1173a8iN].

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a significant symptom burden and dismal prognosis. Patients present with breathlessness, cough and fatigue. IPF impacts quality of life, physically, emotionally, psychologically and socially. Progression varies and we cannot accurately identify the cohorts likely to progress more rapidly.

Registries are important tools to enhance knowledge and learning in long-term conditions such as IPF as they provide 'real world' information about disease behaviour, treatment patterns and a range of other variables and are not restricted to the limiting entry criteria of clinical trials. Furthermore, disease registries can be invaluable in capturing longitudinal data over a much longer period than randomised controlled trials.

The UK IPF Registry was established to increase real-world knowledge of IPF in the UK and to help improve management and service delivery. We present data collected over the first decade from 2013 to 2023.

### Long-term treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a comparative, real-world cohort study [^112sgxks]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our findings provide further supporting evidence of the long-term comparable efficacy the two approved antifibrotic treatments for IPF, nintedanib and pirfenidone. Patients treated with nintedanib appear to be more likely prone to dosage adjustments due to poor tolerability, although antifibrotic dosage reductions do not seem to be associated with worse outcomes. This observation supports the notion that the benefits of antifibrotic therapy must be carefully weighed against anticipated tolerability. Individualized treatment strategies tailored to the specific features and needs of each patient remain crucial to improve clinical outcomes while preserving acceptable quality of life, particularly in light of emerging effective agents poised to complement current therapeutic options in the near future.

Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) — conclusions highlight that tertiary prevention strategies focusing on established pulmonary fibrosis have had limited impact on the morbidity and mortality associated with ILD, and that identifying individuals before clinically evident lung fibrosis (when findings qualify as ILA) provides an opportunity to intervene before the lung is extensively and irreversibly scarred if effective and well-tolerated treatments can be identified; the document presents a comprehensive literature review of ILAs that supports updates to the previous ILA definition made by the Fleischner Society, establishes a working definition of ILD, and provides evidence-based suggestions for the evaluation and management of ILAs; together, these advances will improve clinical care and support future research by standardizing the approach to ILAs; it also highlights unanswered questions and emphasizes the need to identify treatment options for ILA.

### Pathogenesis and current status of the treatment of lung cancer associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113AyHTx]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease with chronic progressive fibrosis of unknown etiology; it is characterized by persistent fibrosis of the lungs accompanied by irreversible lung function decline and high mortality rates. A large body of evidence suggests a significant association between IPF and lung cancer (LC). IPF itself increases the risk of LC development, and LC associated with IPF often originates in areas of honeycomb lesions in IPF. In addition, there are similarities between the two diseases in terms of genetics as well as cellular molecular mechanisms; examples include genetic and epigenetic variants, fibroblast activation and proliferation, epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT), abnormal mechanical forces generated in the lungs, and aberrant signaling pathway activation, which may drive the progression of pathology in both diseases. In this review, we describe in detail the epidemiological and clinical associations of LC in patients with IPF, highlight recent studies on the shared pathogenesis between IPF and LC, and discuss current advances in the treatment of LC associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

First-degree relatives of pulmonary fibrosis — evidence and expected yield: The evidence synthesis identified 11 studies enrolling first-degree relatives of patients with pulmonary fibrosis; 10 studies enrolled first-degree relatives of patients with familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) and four studies enrolled first-degree relatives of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and no other known family members with ILD. When aggregated by meta-analysis, the estimated prevalence of ILAs/ILD was 26% (95% CI, 18–34%) in first-degree relatives of patients with FPF and 24% (95% CI, 13–38%) in first-degree relatives of patients with IPF and no other known family members with ILD. The evidence suggests that, for every 1,000 first-degree relatives of patients with pulmonary fibrosis who undergo chest CT screening, approximately 250 will be found to have ILAs/ILD.

### Treatable traits in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: focus on respiratory tract infections-a systematic review and a meta-analysis [^115WcQPi]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, deadly lung disease with several factors, including respiratory tract infections (RTI), for disease worsening. There's no comprehensive data on RTI incidence in IPF patients across different therapies, including antifibrotic (nintedanib or pirfenidone), investigative or placebo treatments.

Methods

A systematic search of databases Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science and Scopus was conducted on September 30th 2024 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023484213). Only randomized controlled trials of drugs intended for IPF treatment in adults and reporting RTI incidence were included. Pooled risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI), risk of bias, GRADE and CINEMA assessments were conducted along with subgroup analyses for upper and lower RTI and for different antifibrotic doses.

Findings

A total of 27 trials of different drugs aimed for IPF therapy were pooled in a pairwise meta-analysis, 11,542 patients were analyzed with an overall number of 4156 RTI events, representing an average incidence of 38.4 ± 23.5%. Most therapies did not affect RTI risk in IPF, although single trials with everolimus and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole showed a significant decrease compared to placebo. For antifibrotics, RTI incidence was similar with pirfenidone treatment compared to nintedanib (RR: 0.98 CI: [0.71; 1.36]) and compared to placebo (RR: 0.88 CI: [0.69; 1.10]) and nintedanib compared to placebo (RR: 0.89 CI: [0.71; 1.12]).

Interpretation

RTIs are frequently reported adverse events in IPF patients over a one-year period, with different investigated treatments showing no profound impact compared to placebo. Future clinical trials should focus on targeting treatable traits like RTIs.

Funding

None.

### Use of supplemental oxygen therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: an observational real-life study in 16 003 patients [^112ztSXE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology, causing a significant decline in lung function and worsening dyspnoea, leading to poor quality of life. When untreated, the median survival time from diagnosis is 2–4 years. The disease mainly occurs in older adults, with an incidence estimated at 2.8–18 cases per 100 000 people in Europe and North America.

Antifibrotic treatments available since 2012 (pirfenidone) and 2015 (nintedanib) decrease lung function decline in patients with IPFand improve overall survival, although they do not stop disease progression. Both drugs are recommended for the treatment of IPF following a multidisciplinary discussion. In France, antifibrotics are reimbursed to treat patients with forced vital capacity ≥ 50% and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 30%; however, a significant proportion of patients remain untreated, while guidelines for the use of antifibrotics in patients with IPF were published in France in 2013 and updated in 2017 and 2023. National and international guidelines recommend the use of supplemental, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in patients with chronic respiratory failure including IPF at rest and/or on exertion to improve exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. Specifically, French criteria to initiate LTOT in IPF patients are the following: PaO2 ≤ 55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa) measured at rest in a stable state on two occasions; or PaO2 between 56 and 60 mm Hg (7.3–8.0 kPa) in the presence of at least one of the following criteria: polycythaemia (haematocrit > 55%), signs of pulmonary hypertension, documented signs of right heart failure, non-apnoeic nocturnal desaturations. However, studies highlight some practical and social barriers to its use. To date, data regarding the real-life use of LTOT in patients with IPF, and its association with survival, are sparse.

The objective of the study was to assess the real-life use of LTOT in patients with IPF. Specifically, the aims were to describe the proportion of patients who received LTOT, their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the time to initiation and the duration of LTOT, according to whether they were receiving an antifibrotic treatment or not. In an exploratory analysis, the risk of death was also compared between periods during which patients were using LTOT to periods during which they were not using LTOT over the course of the disease, accounting for antifibrotic treatment use.

### Long-term treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a comparative, real-world cohort study [^1125w3b9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given these mixed findings, the question of whether the two antifibrotic therapies have comparable efficacy has not been fully elucidated. Moreover, limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of different dosages of antifibrotic therapy in IPF patients. The most relevant data on dose adjustment come from a subgroup analysis of the INPULSIS trial by Maher et al. which showed that patients receiving either the full or reduced dose of nintedanib exhibited similar efficacy, with no significant differences in absolute FVC decline at 12 months. However, long-term data beyond this period are lacking, whilst evidence on the efficacy of different dosing regimens of pirfenidone is not available.

In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone and nintedanib in a retrospective cohort of IPF patients over a long follow-up period and sought to assess the impact of reduced antifibrotic dosage on a range of clinical outcomes.

### Phase 2 study design and analysis approach for BBT-877: an autotaxin inhibitor targeting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111GgXhy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Proof-of-concept (POC) studies are vital in determining the feasibility of further drug development, primarily by assessing preliminary efficacy signals with credible endpoints. However, traditional POC studies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can suffer from low credibility due to small sample sizes and short durations, leading to non-replicable results in larger phase III trials. To address this, we are conducting a 24-week POC study with 120 patients with IPF, using a statistically supported sample size and incorporating exploratory CT-based imaging biomarkers, to support decision-making in the case of non-significant primary endpoint results. This approach aims to provide data to enable a robust decision-making process for advancing clinical development of BBT-877.

Methods and Analysis

In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, approximately 120 patients with IPF will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or 200mg of BBT-877 two times per day over 24 weeks, with stratification according to background use of an antifibrotic treatment (pirfenidone background therapy, nintedanib background therapy or no background therapy). The primary endpoint is absolute change in forced vital capacity (FVC) (mL) from baseline to week 24. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline to week 24 in %-predicted FVC, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, 6min walk test, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetics and safety, and tolerability. Key exploratory endpoints include eLung-based CT evaluation and biomarker-based assessment of pharmacodynamics.

Ethics and Dissemination

This study is being conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki principles, Good Clinical Practice guidance, applicable local regulations and local ethics committees. An independent data monitoring committee unblinded to individual subject treatment allocation will evaluate safety and efficacy data on a regular basis throughout the study. The results of this study will be presented at scientific conferences and peer-review publications.

### Long-term treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a comparative, real-world cohort study [^114UN8WB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Limited data exists on the long-term comparative efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone and nintedanib, the two approved treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Methods

We retrospectively enrolled IPF patients treated with either pirfenidone or nintedanib at our centre between 2017 and 2023. Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time to death or ≥ 10% decline in % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and continuous FVC decline were compared between groups defined by antifibrotic type or treatment intensity (full or reduced). Time to drug dose reduction was also compared. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier curves with Log-Rank tests, Cox proportional hazards models and linear mixed-effects models.

Results

A total of 292 IPF patients treated with pirfenidone (n = 142) or nintedanib (n = 150) were included with a mean follow-up time of 32.3 months (SD = 14.5). No significant differences in efficacy were observed between groups by antifibrotic type. Dose reduction was more frequent in the nintedanib group (59.3%) than pirfenidone group (16.9%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that patients on nintedanib had a 4-fold higher risk of dose reduction compared to those on pirfenidone (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between patients with dose reduction and those maintaining the full dose, both in the overall population and when stratified by antifibrotic type.

Conclusion

Nintedanib and pirfenidone exhibited similar long-term efficacy. Dose adjustment was more frequent with nintedanib, however it did not have impact on clinical outcomes.

### Taladegib for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ENV-IPF-101): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial [^117DCNMp]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

The hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway promotes fibrosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), an interstitial lung disease with a high mortality rate. Currently, there is no cure for IPF, and available anti-fibrotics only slow the rate of decline in lung function in IPF. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of taladegib (ENV-101), an Hh pathway inhibitor, in IPF in a phase 2a, proof-of-concept clinical trial.

Methods

ENV-IPF-101 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial conducted at 16 clinical sites in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, and South Korea for patients with IPF older than 40 years who were not treated with concurrent IPF therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to taladegib 200 mg or placebo equivalent once daily, orally for 12 weeks, with a 6-week follow-up. The primary outcomes were safety in the intention-to-treat population and change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in the efficacy-evaluable population. Exploratory outcomes were measures of fibrosis on high-resolution CT (HRCT) in the efficacy-evaluable population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04968574.

Findings

Between Aug 12, 2021, and July 28, 2023, 41 patients were randomly assigned to the taladegib group (n = 21; three [14%] female and 18 [86%] male) or the placebo group (n = 20; four [20%] female and 16 [80%] male). All treatment-emergent adverse events possibly or probably related to the study drug were grade 1 or 2, all except one were mild or moderate in severity, and none were serious adverse events. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the taladegib group were dysgeusia (12 [57%] of 21), muscle spasms (12 [57%] of 21), and alopecia (11 [52%] of 21); none of these events were reported in the placebo group, for which the most common adverse events reported were diarrhoea (four [20%] of 20), headache (three [15%] of 20), and dizziness (one [5%] of 20). Patients treated with taladegib had an improvement from baseline in FVC and across multiple HRCT-based measures of disease. Between-group differences in change from baseline to week 12 favoured taladegib for the efficacy measures of percent predicted FVC (3·95% [95% CI 0·31–7·60]; p = 0·035; mean change from baseline of 1·9% in the taladegib group vs -1·3% for placebo), total lung capacity by HRCT (257·0 mL [95% CI 86·8–427·2]; p = 0·0040; mean change from baseline of 206·67 mL in the taladegib group vs -55·58 mL in the placebo group), and percent quantitative interstitial lung disease (p = 0·047; mean change from baseline of -9·4% in the taladegib group vs 1·1% in the placebo group). No deaths occurred during the trial.

Interpretation

The acceptable safety profile and efficacy analyses of taladegib support further investigation in a phase 2b trial in patients with IPF (WHISTLE-PF).

Screening and genetic testing in at-risk relatives — For first-degree relatives of patients with sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the committee voted 54% in favor of screening this population; however, this did not meet the prespecified consensus for approval, and the committee did not suggest testing for the MUC5B promoter variant or telomere length in those who have ILAs or in at-risk relatives as a result of modest test performance characteristics for discriminating ILAs. Future work is needed to further validate these findings in larger and more diverse populations and to determine the impact of expanded screening recommendations on patient outcomes, healthcare costs, and healthcare resources.

### Progress, pitfalls, and impact of AI-driven clinical trials [^113WjKQ5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

LIMITED MODEL AND PROGRAM BENCHMARKING

There are multiple model‐specific benchmarks that provide the ability to compare different generative models, particularly in the chemistry space, as well as summaries of experimental validation studies. For example, a consortium of scientists from Cornell, Cambridge, and EPFL universities recently published a comprehensive overview of molecular generation models with experimental validation. However, no benchmark for real therapeutic programs out of generative AI exists. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not publish the time, cost, and success rates of preclinical and clinical experiments. One recently published example presented the timeline for a therapeutic program targeting Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a complex disease with no clear genetic origin or existing standard of care; the company aimed to discover a novel target and design small molecules using AI. The selected target was highly novel, with no known selective inhibitors or drugs in clinical trials. It was also absolutely novel for the indication and was prioritized using multiple AI methods as well as the hallmarks of aging assessment. The process from program initiation to preclinical candidate nomination took 18 months. The program recently completed a Phase IIa study, demonstrating safety, tolerability, and unexpected dose‐dependent efficacy measured by increases in forced vital capacity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Another published example disclosed 12 months from initiation to completion. Non‐peer‐reviewed time line announcements claimed records of 9 months. Publishing time lines, costs, success stories, and failures is important for the industry to create a set of program‐level benchmarks and increase the transparency of the industry. Regardless of what technology is used in drug discovery and development, the ultimate goal is to make the process faster, cheaper, and increase the probability of success.

### Nintedanib (Ofev) [^116EWYC7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

The clinical efficacy of OFEV has been studied in 1231 patients with IPF in one phase 2 (Study 1 [NCT00514683]) and two phase 3 studies (Study 2 [NCT01335464] and Study 3 [NCT01335477]). These were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies comparing treatment with OFEV 150 mg twice daily to placebo for 52 weeks.

Study 2 and Study 3 were identical in design. Study 1 was very similar in design. Patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio (1:1 for Study 1) to either OFEV 150 mg or placebo twice daily for 52 weeks. Study 1 also included other treatment arms (50 mg daily, 50 mg twice daily, and 100 mg twice daily) that are not further discussed. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Time to first acute IPF exacerbation was a key secondary endpoint in Study 2 and Study 3 and a secondary endpoint in Study 1. Change from baseline in FVC percent predicted and survival were additional secondary endpoints in all studies.

Patients were required to have a diagnosis of IPF (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT criteria) for less than 5 years. Diagnoses were centrally adjudicated based on radiologic and, if applicable, histopathologic confirmation. Patients were required to be greater than or equal to 40 years of age with an FVC greater than or equal to 50% of predicted and a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO, corrected for hemoglobin) 30% to 79% of predicted. Patients with relevant airways obstruction (i.e., pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.7) or, in the opinion of the investigator, likely to receive a lung transplant during the studies were excluded (being listed for lung transplant was acceptable for inclusion). Patients with greater than 1.5 times ULN of ALT, AST, or bilirubin, patients with a known risk or predisposition to bleeding, patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulation treatment, and patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded from the studies. Patients were also excluded if they received other investigational therapy, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine A within 8 weeks of entry into this trial, or n-acetyl cysteine and prednisone (greater than 15 mg/day or equivalent) within 2 weeks. The majority of patients were Caucasian (60%) or Asian (30%) and male (79%). Patients had a mean age of 67 years and a mean FVC percent predicted of 80%.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^115TnwRe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) — role for quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and alternate imaging modalities emphasizes that QCT measures based on density metrics or machine-learning quantification of fibrosis potentially provide a more objective and reproducible metric of disease extent compared with visual assessment; longitudinal increases in QCT metrics have been linked to lung function decline and survival; artificial intelligence–based diagnostic and QCT approaches may improve management by enabling objective detection, risk stratification, and monitoring over time; dependencies among specific QCT metrics and CT scanner type and reconstruction algorithm are unknown; additional modalities such as endobronchial optical coherence tomography and positron emission tomography targeted to collagen or fibrin show promise for screening, microscopic pathologic characterization, and predicting progression in ILAs; and future studies are needed to define where these novel imaging methods add value as a complement to existing modalities like chest CT and PFT.

### Efficacy and safety of admilparant, an LPAAntagonist, in pulmonary fibrosis: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1173a8iN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) have high morbidity and mortality; thus, novel treatments are needed. Objectives: Assess efficacy and safety of admilparant (BMS-986278), an oral lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 antagonist, in patients with IPF and PPF. Methods: This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included parallel cohorts of patients with IPF (n = 278 randomized, n = 276 treated) or PPF (n = 125 randomized, n = 123 treated) who received 30 mg of admilparant, 60 mg of admilparant, or placebo (1:1:1) twice daily for 26 weeks. Background antifibrotics (both cohorts) and immunosuppressants (PPF only) were permitted. Measurements and Main Results: Rates of change in percentage of predicted FVC over 26 weeks for IPF were -2.7% (placebo), -2.8% (30 mg), and -1.2% (60 mg) and for PPF were -4.3% (placebo), -2.9% (30 mg), and -1.1% (60 mg). Treatment differences between 60-mg admilparant and placebo were 1.4% (95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 3.0) for IPF and 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 5.7) for PPF. Treatment effect was observed with or without background antifibrotics in both cohorts. Diarrhea occurred at similar frequencies in admilparant arms versus placebo. Transient Day 1 postdose blood pressure reductions were observed in all arms in both cohorts but were greater with admilparant. Treatment discontinuations because of adverse events were similar across IPF arms and lower with admilparant (2.5% [30 mg]; 0% [60 mg]) versus placebo (17.1%) for PPF. Conclusions: In this first phase 2 study to evaluate antifibrotic treatment in parallel IPF and PPF cohorts, 60-mg admilparant slowed lung function decline and was safe and well tolerated, supporting further evaluation in phase 3 trials. Clinical trial registered with clinicaltrials.gov identifier (NCT04308681).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116rvDvW]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) — The prevalence of ILA ranges from 4% to 9% among older (over 60 years) adults and spans from subclinical findings to clinical disease, and in COPDGene "Among 4,360 COPDGene participants, ILA was present in 8% of individuals, with half meeting criteria for suspected ILD, which was defined as definite fibrosis on CT, FVC less than 80% predicted or DLco less than 70% predicted". Adverse outcomes are reported as "Individuals with suspected ILD had increased respiratory symptoms and mortality", and progression risk as "Fibrotic ILA (i.e., those with traction bronchiectasis, architectural distortion and honeycombing) are more likely to progress and are associated with poor outcomes, especially when combined with emphysema". The section notes, "Given the clinical relevance of ILA, multiple studies support clinical evaluation, risk stratification and follow up monitoring of individuals with these findings".

### Pathogenesis and current status of the treatment of lung cancer associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115QD8DU]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Antifibrotic therapy

Nintedanib and pirfenidone are the only currently approved antifibrotic drugs. Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Although nintedanib was originally developed as an anticancer agent, it is also a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of IPF because of its potent antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities, which can slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib is also used to treat several malignancies, including NSCLC. Currently, the combination of nintedanib and docetaxel is effective in treating patients with advanced NSCLC, especially those with adenocarcinoma who have received prior single-line platinum-based therapy. Kai et al. reported a case of an elderly patient with LC-IPF treated with nintedanib, in which partial remission of LC and no progression of IPF could be observed after seven months of treatment, suggesting that nintedanib monotherapy has the potential to inhibit LC progression in patients with IPF. Nintedanib monotherapy may also be effective in some patients with IPF-NSCLC who cannot tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, more clinical trials are needed to verify whether nintedanib monotherapy represents a rational strategy as a cancer treatment. Pirfenidone is a pyridone compound with anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antioxidant properties; it inhibits the production of growth factors (TGF-β) and cytokines (TNF-α) as well as collagen synthesis and deposition. Pirfenidone also has potent antitumor activity. A retrospective study of IPF revealed that IPF patients treated with pirfenidone had a significantly lower risk of developing LC during the follow-up phase. In addition, pirfenidone has been shown to synergistically kill tumor cells and CAFs in NSCLC cells with cisplatin. In a retrospective study of 345 patients with IPF, Naoi et al. found that the incidence and prevalence of LC in patients with IPF treated with antifibrotic therapy were significantly lower than those in untreated patients and that patients with IPF treated with antifibrotic therapy had significantly lower LC-related mortality. These results suggest that antifibrotic therapy may help reduce the risk of LC in patients with IPF. In addition, a retrospective study of the perioperative treatment of LC-IPF revealed that 108 patients with LC-IPF who received pirfenidone had a significantly reduced risk of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF), a serious complication, and it is hypothesized that pirfenidone may also reduce the risk of adverse events after LC-IPF. Although nintedanib and pirfenidone have achieved better results in the treatment of both IPF and LC, a rational strategy for their treatment of cancer needs to be based on multidisciplinary discussions including oncologists and considering the severity of IPF, TNM stage of the lung cancer, the patient's fitness status, and the patient's preference on a case-by-case basis.

### Computed tomography morphomics and antifibrotic therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115hQPZi]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating and fatal lung disease. Changes in body composition potentially correlate with outcomes in patients with IPF.

Materials and Methods

Patients with IPF on antifibrotic treatment attending a single institution were identified and retrospectively evaluated (n = 84). Three groups were formed based on antifibrotic treatment: pirfenidone group, nintedanib group and pirfenidone-nintedanib switch group. Morphomic analysis of muscle quantity (cross-sectional area in cm 2) and quality (density in Hounsfield Units) on thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed using a web-based morphomic segmentation tool. Bilateral erector spinae and pectoralis muscles were measured at pre-defined vertebral levels.

Results

All three treatment groups showed a statistically significant decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D L CO), pectoral muscle cross sectional area (PMA), and erector spinae muscle cross-sectional area (ESMA). Muscle density did not change significantly. Differences existed in analytic morphomics between treatment groups. Patients with a pretreatment body mass index (BMI) below 30 were found to have a significantly greater loss of PMA when treated with nintedanib instead of pirfenidone. FVC and D L CO did not differ between treatment groups.

Conclusion

There were no direct correlations between pulmonary function and morphomic parameters in our entire group of IPF patients. However, between different treatment groups, the rate of muscle bulk loss differed. This is an important consideration for clinicians when deciding on an antifibrotic agent of choice.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^116JMFUX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial lung abnormalities — progression rates and adjunct follow-up considerations: The evidence suggests that, for every 1,000 patients with ILAs, 460 will experience progression, some to ILD; based on this, the committee suggests an initial follow-up chest CT scan 2–3 years after the initial detection of the ILA, and the committee emphasized that earlier follow-up may be warranted in some situations; the average rate of progression is slow with most studies showing radiological progression over 5 years and median times to progression to UIP as long as 11 years, though some individuals can progress more rapidly; the committee proposed that repeat HRCT at approximately 2–3 years may be appropriate for most, with earlier repeat imaging (12 mo) for high-risk features or sooner if there is clinical or physiologic evidence of progression; the committee did not vote on the frequency of follow-up with PFT and symptom assessment, though most committee members thought follow-up annually with PFT would be appropriate to evaluate for progression to ILD.

### Machine learning-based integration identifies plasma cells-related gene signature ST6GAL1 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112CZfp7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently available drug therapies for IPF still fall short of expectations. Despite pirfenidone and nintedanib, which can be used to prolong disease progression or reduce mortality, a fraction of patients with IPF exhibits a poor response to these drugs. As the immune reaction is a significant pathogenetic feature of IPF, new therapies targeting basic immune mechanisms are emerging. Among them, rituximab, a human anti-CD20 antibody, has been applied in clinical trials for IPF exacerbations, but its ability to improve pulmonary function is limited. Plasma cells are generally not eliminated by rituximab treatment because of the lack expression of CD20 receptor. Consequently, some researchers used bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) to deplete plasma cells in bleomycin (BLM)-treated mice and achieved encouraging results, as the BLM-induced lung fibrosis was remarkably inhibited. However, the toxicity and off-target effects of bortezomib are common, and its clinical feasibility for IPF needs further evaluation. In recent years, the emerging CD19 CAR-T cell treatment not merely triggers the elimination of B cells and plasma cells from patients with severe and refractory systemic lupus erythematosus, but also leads to drug-free remission of this systemic autoimmune disease and reconstruction of B cells. Given the many parallels between autoimmune syndromes and IPF, patients with IPF might benefit by receiving CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. However, the risk of common side effects needs to be assessed, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Additionally, the relationship between the potential residuals of long-lived plasma cells with low expression of CD19 antigen and their pathogenicity requires further investigation. Therefore, by analysing plasma cells-related genes closely linked to IPF prognosis, it is highly meaningful to explore alternative therapies for IPF.

In this study, we initially extracted candidate genes by combining hub genes selected using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with marker genes of plasma cells. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to select eligible features from candidate genes for modeling. Then, a novel computational procedure based on 101 combinations of 10 machine learning algorithms was employed to screen for a concordance prognostic plasma cells-related gene signature (PCRGS). We further screened the core gene ST6GAL1 in PCRGS and verified its expression and cellular localization via spatial transcriptome sequencing (ST-seq) analysis and experiments. Finally, we predicted potential effective targeted drugs for IPF and validated the molecular dynamics simulation for ST6GAL1. These findings may offer novel insights into understanding the immune response of IPF and may contribute to optimizing targeted therapy for IPF.

### Patient characteristics and pharmacologic treatment patterns in antifibrotic-treated patients with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases: real-world results from a claims database [^114YUKqD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with IPF most (approximately three quarters) were prescribed antifibrotics as monotherapy for ILD treatment and as first-line therapy. An Official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Clinical Practice Guideline: Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis conditionally recommended clinical use of pirfenidone and nintedanib for the treatment of IPF in 2015. The Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) 2017 guideline for the treatment of IPF weakly recommended pirfenidone and nintedanib for the treatment of IPF. These international and Japanese guidelines strongly recommend that patients with IPF should not be treated with glucocorticoid monotherapy for IPF treatment or glucocorticoid and immunomodulator combination therapy. Therefore, the large proportion of patients with IPF receiving antifibrotic treatment as monotherapy for ILD treatment and as first-line treatment is expected. The JRS 2017 guideline for the treatment of IPF did not make a conclusion on pirfenidone and nintedanib combination therapy, however, a 2023 update to the guideline recommended against pirfenidone and nintedanib combination therapy. This could be a contributing explanation for the relatively low proportion of patients with IPF treated concomitantly with pirfenidone and nintedanib.

In patients with SSc-ILD the use of other glucocorticoid/immunosuppressant drugs prior to, and concomitantly with, the use of nintedanib was common. In these patients just 34.9% were prescribed nintedanib as monotherapy for ILD treatment, and 38.6% as first-line therapy. The 2020 guide for the diagnosis and treatment of CTD-ILD suggested treatment of SSc-ILD with 1) oral cyclophosphamide (or IV cyclophosphamide may be considered), followed by azathioprine or MMF, 2) MMF, 3) nintedanib, or 4) tocilizumab as choices for first-line treatment. In the SENSCIS trial, prior use, and concomitant use of glucocorticoids, MMF or MTX was permitted. In fact, 68.9%, 48.4%, and 6.6% of the enrolled patients received glucocorticoids, MMF and MTX, respectively, at baseline. Therefore, the greater concomitant use of other drugs with nintedanib, and greater use prior to nintedanib treatment in patients with SSc-ILD compared with patients with IPF is expected.

### Differential effects of antifibrotic treatment on outcome prediction via serial matrix metalloproteinase-degraded C-reactive protein neoepitope levels in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111YPfXW]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by an increase in proteolytic enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and markers of localized inflammation. Protein fragments (neoepitopes) are detectable in the circulation.

Research Question

Can short-term trajectories of neoepitopes following initiation of antifibrotic treatment predict therapy-related outcomes including mortality in IPF patients?

Study Design and Methods

203 treatment-naïve IPF patients from two German tertiary centres were prospectively recruited. At baseline and within 6 months of nintedanib or pirfenidone treatment, serum concentrations of MMP degraded C-reactive protein (CRPM), collagen III (C3M) and collagen 6 (C6M) fragments, as well as procollagen 6 (PRO-C6) were measured. Association of neoepitopes and their longitudinal kinetics (positive/increasing or negative/declining slope) with mortality and progression- and transplant-free survival (PTFS) was analysed. Modes of action of anti-fibrotic therapy on neoepitope kinetics were further investigated by cell culture experiments.

Results

Patient mean age was 71 years and 20.7% were female. After baseline measurements, 50% received nintedanib, 35% pirfenidone and 15% no antifibrotic treatment. Patients with a positive CRPM slope treated with nintedanib showed increased 5-year mortality (adj.HR 2.27, P = 0.020). In contrast, PTFS was significantly reduced with positive slopes of all tested neoepitopes. The association between positive CRPM slopes and impaired PTFS was confirmed by means of propensity score matching. In both cohorts, effects on PTFS were driven by the nintedanib-treated sub-cohort. Inter-cohort validation of the association between CRPM slopes and PTFS was evident. In cell-culture experiments, nintedanib exclusively modulated CRPM kinetics in human umbilical cord derived endothelial cells, but not IPF-derived fibroblasts. This suggests the observed nintedanib/CRPM related effect is partly mediated by endothelial cells.

Interpretation

Positive/increasing CRPM serum levels (slopes) were associated with worse 5-year survival in IPF patients treated with nintedanib, but not pirfenidone. Nintedanib, but not pirfenidone reduced endothelial CRPM formation in-vitro.

### Pirfenidone capsule, 267 mg [^113Sd5Rn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624) in these three trials. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years). Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%). Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Baseline mean % FVC and %DLCOwere 72% and 46%, respectively. Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.

Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity

In Study 1, the primary efficacy analysis for the change in %FVC from baseline to Week 52 demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect of pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 278) compared with placebo (n = 277) using a rank ANCOVA with the lowest rank imputation for missing data due to death. In Study 2, there was a statistically significant difference at Week 72 for the change in %FVC from baseline. In Study 3, there was no statistically significant difference at Week 72 for the change in % FVC from baseline.

Survival

Survival was evaluated for OFEV compared to placebo in Study 2 and Study 3 as an exploratory analysis to support the primary endpoint (FVC). All-cause mortality was assessed over the study duration and available follow-up period, irrespective of cause of death and whether patients continued treatment. All-cause mortality did not show a statistically significant difference (See Figure 3).

14.2 Chronic Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases with a Progressive Phenotype

The clinical efficacy of OFEV has been studied in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 5 [NCT02999178]). A total of 663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OFEV 150 mg twice daily or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks. Randomization was stratified based on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) fibrotic pattern as assessed by central readers: 412 patients with UIP-like HRCT pattern and 251 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns were randomized. There were 2 co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: all patients (the overall population) and patients with HRCT with UIP-like HRCT fibrotic pattern.

The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks. Other endpoints included time to first acute ILD exacerbation and time to death.

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic fibrosing ILD were selected if they had relevant fibrosis (greater than 10% fibrotic features) on HRCT and presented with clinical signs of progression (defined as FVC decline ≥ 10%, FVC decline ≥ 5% and < 10% with worsening symptoms or imaging, or worsening symptoms and worsening imaging all in the 24 months prior to screening). Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 45% of predicted and a DLCO 30% to less than 80% of predicted. Patients were required to have progressed despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice by investigators for the patient's relevant ILD.

### Pirfenidone (Esbriet) [^116dBhHc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ESBRIET was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or ESBRIET 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.

Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease. Eligible patients were to have %FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline. In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.

A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624) in these three trials. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years). Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%). Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Baseline mean %FVC and %DLCOwere 72% and 46%, respectively. Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.

### Pirfenidone [^112MjEbF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of pirfenidone was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or pirfenidone 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment.

### Nintedanib (Ofev) [^116KfpzW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with IPF, relevant airways obstruction (i.e., pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.7), or significant pulmonary hypertension were excluded from the trial. Patients with greater than 1.5 times ULN of ALT, AST, or bilirubin, patients with a known risk or predisposition to bleeding, patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulation treatment, and patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they received other investigational therapy, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, oral corticosteroids greater than 20 mg/day, or the combination of oral corticosteroids + azathioprine + n-acetylcysteine within 4 weeks of randomization, cyclophosphamide within 8 weeks prior to randomization, rituximab within 6 months, or previous treatment with nintedanib or pirfenidone.

The majority of patients were Caucasian (74%) or Asian (25%). Patients were mostly male (54%) and had a mean age of 66 years and a mean FVC percent predicted of 69%, and 49% were never-smokers. The underlying clinical ILD diagnoses in groups represented in the trial were hypersensitivity pneumonitis (26%), autoimmune ILDs (26%), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (19%), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (17%), and other ILDs (12%).

### Patient characteristics and pharmacologic treatment patterns in antifibrotic-treated patients with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases: real-world results from a claims database [^114KoLcS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Antifibrotics have been approved for use in many countries, including Japan, based on the results of several phase III clinical trials in patients with IPF, SSc-ILD, and PPF, which showed slower lung function decline with antifibrotic treatment. There is a paucity of information on the real-world use of antifibrotics in clinical practice.

Methods

Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and drugs used prior to and concomitant with antifibrotics were collected for patients with IPF, SSc-ILD, and PPF using a health insurance claims database in Japan from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2023. Descriptive statistics were generated for all study variables.

Results

This study included 657 nintedanib users with IPF; 418 pirfenidone users with IPF; 4160 nintedanib users with PPF; 18,403 users of glucocorticoids/immunosuppressants for ILD treatment with PPF; 676 nintedanib users with SSc-ILD; and 698 users of glucocorticoids/immunosuppressants for ILD treatment with SSc-ILD. At index, pirfenidone users with IPF were the oldest (mean [SD] 74.8 [7.3] years), and nintedanib users with SSc-ILD were the youngest (mean [SD] 65.6 [11.7] years). In nintedanib users with IPF, 76.7% were prescribed nintedanib as monotherapy, and 75.6% of pirfenidone users were prescribed pirfenidone, as monotherapy. In patients with IPF, 75.2% were prescribed nintedanib, and 76.1% were prescribed pirfenidone, as first-line therapy. In patients with SSc-ILD, 34.9% were prescribed nintedanib as monotherapy for ILD treatment, and 38.6% as first-line therapy. Approximately half of patients with PPF were prescribed nintedanib concomitantly with other glucocorticoids/immunosuppressant drugs, and after one or more glucocorticoids/immunosuppressant drugs. The most common concomitant drug in all patient groups was glucocorticoids. In patients with IPF, 18.6% of nintedanib users and 18.2% of pirfenidone users were prescribed glucocorticoids concomitantly. Concomitant glucocorticoid use was 52.7% for nintedanib users with SSc-ILD, and 44.1% for nintedanib users with PPF.

Conclusions

These results provide real-world evidence of antifibrotic use in clinical practice. Most patients with IPF were prescribed antifibrotics as monotherapy for ILD treatment whereas antifibrotics were used concomitantly with glucocorticoids/immunosuppressants in many patients with SSc-ILD and PPF. While most patients with IPF were prescribed antifibrotics as first-line therapy, patients with SSc-ILD and PPF were more likely to be prescribed nintedanib as second-line or later-line treatment after glucocorticoids/immunosuppressants.

Chronic Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases with a Progressive Phenotype

OFEV was studied in a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 5) in which 663 patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype were randomized to receive OFEV 150 mg twice daily (n = 332) or placebo (n = 331) for at least 52 weeks. At 52 weeks, the median duration of exposure was 12 months for patients in both treatment arms. Subjects ranged in age from 27 to 87 years (median age of 67 years). The majority of patients were Caucasian (74%) or Asian (25%). Most patients were male (54%).

The most frequent serious adverse event reported in patients treated with OFEV, more than placebo, was pneumonia (4% vs. 3%). Adverse events leading to death were reported in 3% of patients treated with OFEV and in 5% of patients treated with placebo. No pattern was identified in the adverse events leading to death.

Adverse reactions leading to permanent dose reductions were reported in 33% of OFEV-treated patients and 4% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent dose reduction in the patients treated with OFEV was diarrhea (16%).

Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were reported in 20% of OFEV-treated patients and 10% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to discontinuation in OFEV-treated patients was diarrhea (6%).

The safety profile in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype treated with OFEV was consistent with that observed in IPF patients. In addition, the following adverse events were reported in OFEV more than placebo in chronic progressive fibrosing ILD: nasopharyngitis (13% vs. 12%), upper respiratory tract infection (7% vs. 6%), urinary tract infection (6% vs. 4%), fatigue (10% vs. 6%), and back pain (6% vs. 5%).

### Tocilizumab (Actemra) [^1155hyju]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study WA29767, 212 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly SC injections of 162 mg of ACTEMRA or placebo during the 48-week, double-blinded, placebo controlled period. Rescue treatment was allowed during the treatment period after 16 weeks for > 10% percent predicted FVC (ppFVC) decline or after 24 weeks for worsening skin fibrosis. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline at Week 48 in mRSS. Change from baseline in FVC at Week 48 was a key secondary endpoint.

In the overall population of Study WA29767, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 48 in mRSS (primary endpoint) in patients receiving ACTEMRA compared to placebo (difference: -1.73; 95% CI: -3.78, 0.32). There also was not a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint of mRSS in Study WA27788.

In the overall population of Study WA29767, patients treated with ACTEMRA, as compared to placebo treated patients, were observed to have less decline from baseline in ppFVC and observed FVC at 48 weeks. FVC results from Study WA27788 were similar.

Of the 212 patients who were randomized in Study WA29767, 68 patients (65%) in the ACTEMRA arm and 68 patients (64%) in the placebo arm had SSc-ILD at baseline, as confirmed by a visual read of high resolution computed tomograph (HRCT) by blinded thoracic radiologists. The mean ppFVC at baseline for patients with SSc-ILD identified by HRCT was 79.6% (median 80.5%). Post-hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results within the subgroups of patients with and without SSc-ILD.

Nausea and Vomiting

In IPF studies (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), nausea was reported in 24% versus 7% and vomiting was reported in 12% versus 3% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively. In the chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5), nausea was reported in 29% versus 9% and vomiting was reported in 18% versus 5% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively. In the SSc-ILD study (Study 4), nausea was reported in 32% versus 14% and vomiting was reported in 25% versus 10% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most patients, these events were of mild to moderate intensity. In IPF studies (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), nausea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 2% of patients and vomiting led to discontinuation of OFEV in 1% of the patients. In the chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5), nausea led to discontinuation of OFEV in less than 1% of patients and vomiting led to discontinuation of OFEV in 1% of the patients. In the SSc-ILD study (Study 4), nausea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 2% of patients and vomiting led to discontinuation of OFEV in 1% of the patients.

For nausea or vomiting that persists despite appropriate supportive care including anti-emetic therapy, dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe nausea or vomiting does not resolve, discontinue treatment with OFEV.

### Therapies for mitochondrial disease: past, present, and future [^114MduhR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Mitochondrial disease is a diverse group of clinically and genetically complex disorders caused by pathogenic variants in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA‐encoded genes that disrupt mitochondrial energy production or other important mitochondrial pathways. Mitochondrial disease can present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and can often be difficult to recognize. These conditions can be devastating; however, for the majority, there is no targeted treatment. In the last 60 years, mitochondrial medicine has experienced significant evolution, moving from the pre‐molecular era to the Age of Genomics in which considerable gene discovery and advancement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disease have been made. In the last decade, in response to the urgent need for effective treatments, a wide range of emerging therapies have been developed, driven by innovative approaches addressing both the genetic and cellular mechanisms underpinning the diseases. Emerging therapies include dietary intervention, small molecule therapies aimed to restore mitochondrial function, stem cell or liver transplantation, and gene or RNA‐based therapies. However, despite these advances, translation to clinical practice is complicated by the sheer genetic and clinical complexity of mitochondrial disease, difficulty in efficient and precise delivery of therapies to affected tissues, rarity of individual genetic conditions, lack of reliable biomarkers and clinically relevant outcome measures, and the dearth of natural history data. This review examines the latest developments in the pursuit to identify effective treatments for mitochondrial disease and discusses the barriers impeding their success in translation to clinical practice. While treatment for mitochondrial disease may be on the horizon, many challenges must be addressed before it can become a reality.

### Lamivudine [^116GT1fi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Genotypic analysis of on-therapy isolates from 22 subjects identified as virologic failures in the lamivudine once-daily group showed that isolates from 8 of 22 subjects contained a treatment-emergent lamivudine resistance-associated substitution (M184V or M184I), isolates from 0 of 22 subjects contained treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions associated with zidovudine resistance (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E), and isolates from 10 of 22 subjects contained treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions associated with efavirenz resistance (L100I, K101E, K103N, V108I, or Y181C).

Genotypic analysis of on-therapy isolates from subjects (n = 22) in the lamivudine twice-daily treatment group showed that isolates from 5 of 22 subjects contained treatment-emergent lamivudine resistance substitutions, isolates from 1 of 22 subjects contained treatment-emergent zidovudine resistance substitutions, and isolates from 7 of 22 subjects contained treatment-emergent efavirenz resistance substitutions.

Phenotypic analysis of baseline-matched on-therapy HIV-1 isolates from subjects (n = 13) receiving lamivudine once daily showed that isolates from 7 of 13 subjects showed an 85- to 299-fold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine, isolates from 12 of 13 subjects were susceptible to zidovudine, and isolates from 8 of 13 subjects exhibited a 25- to 295-fold decrease in susceptibility to efavirenz.

Combination with Pirfenidone

Concomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone was investigated in an exploratory open-label, randomized (1:1) trial of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily with add-on pirfenidone (titrated to 801 mg three times a day) compared to nintedanib 150 mg twice daily alone in 105 randomized patients for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with gastrointestinal adverse events from baseline to Week 12. Gastrointestinal adverse events were in line with the established safety profile of each component and were experienced in 37 (70%) patients treated with pirfenidone added to nintedanib versus 27 (53%) patients treated with nintedanib alone.

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (includes upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain) were the most frequent adverse events reported in 20 (38%) versus 16 (31%), in 22 (42%) versus 6 (12%), in 15 (28%) versus 6 (12%), and in 15 (28%) versus 7 (14%) patients treated with pirfenidone added to nintedanib versus nintedanib alone, respectively. More subjects reported AST or ALT elevations (greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal) when using pirfenidone in combination with nintedanib (n = 3 (6%)) compared to nintedanib alone (n = 0) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

### Taletrectinib (Ibtrozi) [^113vwLsp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis

IBTROZI can cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis.

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with IBTROZI, including Grade 3 or 4 in 1.1% of patients. The median time to first onset of ILD/pneumonitis was 3.8 months (range: 12 days to 11.8 months).

ILD/pneumonitis led to dose interruption of IBTROZI in 1.1% of patients. ILD/pneumonitis required dose reduction in 0.6% of patients and permanent discontinuation of IBTROZI in 0.6% of patients. One fatal ILD case occurred in a patient who received 400 mg once daily dose of IBTROZI.

Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Immediately withhold IBTROZI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Withhold, then reduce the dose or permanently discontinue IBTROZI if Grade ≥ 2 ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^114pHQcT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a clinical trial of treatment-naïve subjects, isolates from 8/47 (17%) analyzed subjects receiving TDF developed the K65R substitution through 144 weeks of therapy; 7 of these occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and one at Week 96. In treatment experienced subjects, 14/304 (5%) of TDF treated subjects with virologic failure through Week 96 showed greater than 1.4-fold (median 2.7) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. Genotypic analysis of the resistant isolates showed a substitution in the HIV-1 RT gene resulting in the K65R amino acid substitution.

Efavirenz: Clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility in cell culture to EFV have been obtained. The most frequently observed amino acid substitution in clinical trials with EFV is K103N (54%). One or more RT substitutions at amino acid positions 98, 100, 101, 103, 106, 108, 188, 190, 225, 227, and 230 were observed in subjects failing treatment with EFV in combination with other antiretrovirals. Other resistance substitutions observed to emerge commonly included L100I (7%), K101E/Q/R (14%), V108I (11%), G190S/T/A (7%), P225H (18%), and M230I/L (11%).

### Comparing outcomes with subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) by baseline immunosuppressant use: a post hoc analysis of the LIBERTY-CD and LIBERTY-UC studies [^111M5rt4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Superior efficacy of subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) over placebo for maintenance therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was demonstrated in the randomized LIBERTY-CD and LIBERTY-UC studies. The current post hoc analysis compared outcomes with CT-P13 SC by baseline immunosuppressant use.

Methods

Patients with moderately to severely active CD or UC randomized to the CT-P13 SC maintenance arm of the 54-week LIBERTY trials at week 10 and who were treated in the open-label extension (weeks 56–102) were included. Pharmacokinetic, efficacy, biomarker, safety, and immunogenicity endpoints were evaluated by baseline immunosuppressant use (monotherapy vs combination therapy).

Results

A total of 192 patients with CD (monotherapy, n = 126; combination therapy, n = 66) and 237 patients with UC (monotherapy, n = 180; combination therapy, n = 57) were included. In both studies, efficacy outcomes were generally comparable between monotherapy and combination therapy at week 54 or week 102. Serum concentrations were generally higher, and antidrug antibody-positive conversion rates were lower, with combination therapy relative to monotherapy. In combined analyses of CD and UC, comparable safety profiles were observed between monotherapy and combination therapy.

Conclusions

Despite some differences in pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity between CT-P13 SC received alone or in combination with immunosuppressants in patients with CD or UC, efficacy outcomes at week 54 or week 102 were generally comparable. The overall safety profile and incidence of systemic injection reactions were also comparable between monotherapy and combination therapy.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell and lentiviral-based gene therapy — HIV NAT interpretation requires caution because recent reports indicate that these vectors may interfere with long terminal repeat genomes in HIV NAT results and, thus, produce false-positive results, and routine HIV-1 NAT results may give rise to false results. In addition, lentiviral vector–based gene therapy as treatment for severe combined immunodeficiency can give rise to false-positive HIV NAT results, and laboratories should, therefore, have appropriate alternate HIV-1 NAT resulting platforms made available for this emerging patient population.

### Nintedanib (Ofev) [^1168jh7p]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Nintedanib

Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4. Coadministration with the P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61-fold based on AUC and 1.83-fold based on Cmaxin a dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug interaction study with the P-gp and CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% based on AUC and to 60.3% based on Cmaxupon coadministration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone.

Effect of pirfenidone coadministration on nintedanib AUC and Cmaxwas evaluated in a multiple-dose drug-drug interaction study. Pirfenidone did not have an effect on the exposure of nintedanib. Concomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone was also investigated in a separate trial, which was an exploratory open-label, randomized (1:1) trial of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily with add-on pirfenidone (titrated to 801 mg three times a day) compared to nintedanib 150 mg twice daily alone in 105 randomized patients for 12 weeks. Similar nintedanib trough plasma concentrations were observed when comparing patients receiving nintedanib alone with patients receiving nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone.

Healthy volunteers received a single dose of 150 mg nintedanib before and after multiple dosing of 125 mg bosentan twice daily at steady state. Coadministration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib.

Nintedanib displays a pH-dependent solubility profile with increased solubility at acidic pH less than 3. However, in the clinical trials, coadministration with proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 antagonists did not influence the exposure (trough concentrations) of nintedanib.

In in vitro studies, nintedanib was shown not to be a substrate of OATP-1B1, OATP-1B3, OATP-2B1, OCT-2, MRP-2, or BCRP. In vitro studies also showed that nintedanib was a substrate of OCT-1; these findings are considered to be of low clinical relevance.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHANTIX has no clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug interactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Other Smoking Cessation Therapies: Safety and efficacy in combination with other smoking cessation therapies has not been established. Coadministration of varenicline and transdermal nicotine resulted in a high rate of discontinuation due to adverse events. (7.1)
Effect of Smoking Cessation on Other Drugs: Pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain drugs (e.g., theophylline, warfarin, insulin) may be altered, necessitating dose adjustment. (7.2)

7.1	Use with Other Drugs for Smoking Cessation

Safety and efficacy of CHANTIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not been studied.

Bupropion

Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion (150 mg twice daily) in 46 smokers. The safety of the combination of bupropion and varenicline has not been established.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)

Although co-administration of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and transdermal nicotine (21 mg/day) for up to 12 days did not affect nicotine pharmacokinetics, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, and fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. In this study, eight of twenty-two (36%) patients treated with the combination of varenicline and NRT prematurely discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared to 1 of 17 (6%) of patients treated with NRT and placebo.

7.2	Effect of Smoking Cessation on Other Drugs

Considerations for myeloma therapy — relapsed/refractory disease direct regimen selection to the relapse context, potential reuse of agents after defined intervals, triplet composition, and supportive care. Consideration for appropriate regimen in previously treated myeloma should be based on the context of clinical relapse, and agents/regimens may be reconsidered or repeated if relapse is after at least 6 months after stopping therapy; a new triplet regimen should preferably include drugs or drug classes in patients who have not been exposed to, or not exposed to for at least 6 months. Clinical trials with these triplet regimens primarily included patients who were naïve or sensitive to the novel drug in the doublet comparator arm, and patients with disease refractory to the novel drug in the doublet backbone should be considered for triplet therapy that does not contain the drug they are progressing on. Immunoglobulin replacement should be considered for patients with an IgG < 400 mg/dL or at a higher level for supportive care as clinically indicated, and patients may be candidates for TCR Therapy. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Sitagliptin hydrochloride oral (Brynovin) [^112ox3nc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of BRYNOVIN has been established for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus based in adequate and well-controlled trials of sitagliptin tablets, referenced below as "sitagliptin" [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Common Adverse Reactions

In controlled clinical trials as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with sitagliptin were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with sitagliptin was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo.

Two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg daily, sitagliptin 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy trials were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dosage of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with sitagliptin 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, in ≥ 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

### Progressing future osteoarthritis treatment toward precision medicine: integrating regenerative medicine, gene therapy and circadian biology [^115DomES]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, regenerative medicine has emerged as a promising strategy for OA treatment, with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at the forefront owing to their ability to differentiate into chondrocytes, specialized cells that produce the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, gene therapy has opened new pathways to treat OA at the molecular level by targeting inflammatory and catabolic pathways. Gene therapy has the potential to disrupt key mechanisms driving OA progression by modulating key genes and signaling pathways involved in cartilage degradation and joint inflammation. Targeted delivery systems, such as viral vectors and nanoparticle-based platforms, have been explored to improve the precision and durability of gene therapy. Along with advancements in stem cell and gene therapies, biomaterials have also become integral to the development of OA therapy, providing innovative solutions for delivering drugs, cells and genes directly to the joint. Hydrogels, nanoparticles and nanofibers allow for the sustained release and enhanced bioavailability of therapeutic agents, optimizing treatment efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects. Circadian biology is another emerging area of OA research, as circadian rhythms influence inflammation and cartilage homeostasis. Evidence suggests that disruption of circadian clock genes contributes to OA pathogenesis by disturbing cartilage repair processes and enhancing inflammatory responses. Finally, the role of organelles, such as peroxisomes and mitochondria, in OA is gaining attention. These organelles regulate cellular energy metabolism, lipid homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, all of which are crucial for maintaining cartilage health. Dysfunction of these organelles has been linked to oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances in OA, indicating that organelle-targeted therapies could provide novel treatment avenues. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of regenerative therapies for OA, focusing on the potential limitations of MSCs, gene therapy, biomaterials, circadian biology and organelle-targeted treatments (Fig. 1). By exploring these novel approaches, this review aims to underscore the shift toward precision medicine in OA management, emphasizing the need for biologically informed personalized treatment strategies that address the diverse molecular mechanisms underlying OA.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

From clinical trials with dutasteride as monotherapy or in combination with tamsulosin:

The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving dutasteride were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), and ejaculation disorders. The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving combination therapy (dutasteride plus tamsulosin) were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders, and dizziness. Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving combination therapy (11%) compared with those receiving dutasteride (2%) or tamsulosin (4%) as monotherapy.
Trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of subjects receiving dutasteride and 3% of subjects receiving placebo in placebo-controlled trials with dutasteride. The most common adverse reaction leading to trial withdrawal was impotence (1%).
In the clinical trial evaluating the combination therapy, trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of subjects receiving combination therapy (dutasteride plus tamsulosin) and 4% of subjects receiving dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy. The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to trial withdrawal was erectile dysfunction (1% to 1.5%).

### Nintedanib (Ofev) [^111uVvCE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Coadministration of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase nintedanib exposure. Monitor patients closely for tolerability of OFEV. (7.1)

7.1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers

Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration with oral doses of a P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased exposure to nintedanib by 60%. Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) with OFEV may increase exposure to nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of OFEV. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with OFEV [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Coadministration with oral doses of a P-gp and CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, decreased exposure to nintedanib by 50%. Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort) with OFEV should be avoided as these drugs may decrease exposure to nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Anticoagulants

Nintedanib is a VEGFR inhibitor and may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitor patients on full anticoagulation therapy closely for bleeding and adjust anticoagulation treatment as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.3 Pirfenidone

In a multiple-dose study conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic effects of concomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone, the coadministration of nintedanib with pirfenidone did not alter the exposure of either agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of nintedanib with pirfenidone.

7.4 Bosentan

Coadministration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

14.2 Pediatric CML

A total of 51 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed and untreated CML in chronic phase were enrolled in an open-label, multicenter, single-arm Phase 2 trial. Patients were treated with Gleevec 340 mg/m2/day, with no interruptions in the absence of dose limiting toxicity. Complete hematologic response (CHR) was observed in 78% of patients after 8 weeks of therapy. The complete cytogenetic response rate (CCyR) was 65%, comparable to the results observed in adults. Additionally, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) was observed in 16%. The majority of patients who achieved a CCyR developed the CCyR between Months 3 and 10 with a median time to response based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6.74 months. Patients were allowed to be removed from protocol therapy to undergo alternative therapy, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Thirty-one children received stem cell transplantation. Of the 31 children, 5 were transplanted after disease progression on study and 1 withdrew from study during first week treatment and received transplant approximately 4 months after withdrawal. Twenty-five children withdrew from protocol therapy to undergo stem cell transplant after receiving a median of 9 twenty-eight day courses (range, 4 to 24). Of the 25 patients 13 (52%) had CCyR and 5 (20%) had PCyR at the end of protocol therapy.

One open-label, single-arm study enrolled 14 pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic phase CML recurrent after stem cell transplant or resistant to interferon-alpha therapy. These patients had not previously received Gleevec and ranged in age from 3 to 20 years old; 3 were 3 to 11 years old, 9 were 12 to 18 years old, and 2 were greater than 18 years old. Patients were treated at doses of 260 mg/m2/day (n = 3), 340 mg/m2/day (n = 4), 440 mg/m2/day (n = 5) and 570 mg/m2/day (n = 2). In the 13 patients for whom cytogenetic data are available, 4 achieved a major cytogenetic response, 7 achieved a CCyR, and 2 had a minimal cytogenetic response.

In a second study, 2 of 3 patients with Ph+ chronic phase CML resistant to interferon-alpha therapy achieved a CCyR at doses of 242 and 257 mg/m2/day.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^112Sdtj3]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Categories of drug recommendations in pregnancy — The Panel assigns U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to one of five categories for use in pregnancy. Preferred: drugs or combinations are designated as Preferred for therapy in pregnancy when clinical trial data in adults have demonstrated efficacy and durability with acceptable toxicity and ease of use and when pregnancy-specific pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available to guide dosing. Alternative: drugs or combinations are designated as Alternative options for therapy in pregnancy when clinical trial data in adults show efficacy and the data in pregnancy are limited but generally favorable. Insufficient Data to Recommend: these drugs or combinations are approved for use in adults, but pregnancy-specific PK or safety data are too limited to make a recommendation for use in pregnancy. Not Recommended Except in Special Circumstances: although some drugs are not recommended for initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) when ART has never been used because of specific safety concerns or very limited safety and efficacy data in pregnancy, there may be circumstances in the context of ART experienced when initiation or continuation of specific drugs is needed to reach or maintain viral suppression. Not Recommended: drugs and combinations in this category are not recommended for use in pregnancy because of inferior virologic efficacy or potentially serious maternal or fetal safety concerns.

DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACIDOSIS, CARDIAC ARREST AND, POSSIBLY, DEATH.

Methemoglobinemia

Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended.

Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death.
