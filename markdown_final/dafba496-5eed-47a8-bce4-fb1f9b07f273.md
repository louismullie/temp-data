## Question

Can I order flagyl while waiting for vaginal swab for bacterial vaginosis to come back

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to start empiric metronidazole (Flagyl) for suspected bacterial vaginosis while awaiting swab results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether empiric therapy is justified. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about empiric treatment and diagnostic confirmation. Next, I will review first-line regimens and pregnancy-specific considerations. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks of empiric therapy, including stewardship and recurrence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and follow-up plan, making sure I double-check any areas where I might overstate guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the strength of suspicion for BV. BV is common and often symptomatic with homogeneous discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, a positive whiff test, and clue cells on microscopy, so a compatible presentation plus bedside testing can reasonably support a working diagnosis while swabs are pending, especially when symptoms are bothersome or access to follow-up is uncertain [^11249KRi] [^111kJL73] [^113hzAfT].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines actually say about empiric treatment. The CDC 2021 STI Treatment Guidelines recommend treating symptomatic BV and list metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as a first-line regimen, without requiring confirmatory NAAT before initiating therapy in symptomatic patients, which supports empiric treatment when clinical suspicion is high [^116ecoQF] [^117TswHd]. ACOG similarly recommends treating symptomatic BV using oral or intravaginal metronidazole or intravaginal clindamycin, again aligning with empiric management based on clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for molecular confirmation [^1162FA55]. WHO 2024 guidance likewise recommends metronidazole 400–500 mg twice daily for 7 days for symptomatic BV, reinforcing that empiric therapy is acceptable in typical clinical practice [^114kX2MY].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy-specific nuances before jumping to conclusions. In pregnancy, symptomatic BV should be treated to relieve symptoms, and oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 7 days are acceptable options; routine screening of asymptomatic low-risk pregnant patients is not recommended, but symptomatic patients should be treated without delay, and metronidazole is not contraindicated in pregnancy [^114pLHUK] [^1118uXGb] [^11187FjD] [^116xorrG]. I initially thought "do not use topical therapy for prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes", but wait, I should clarify: that SOGC statement refers to using topical therapy to prevent preterm birth, not to symptom relief; symptomatic pregnant patients can receive either oral or vaginal antibiotics per SOGC, so I should correct that overstatement and tailor the route to clinical context and patient preference [^114pLHUK] [^112u6uaj].

> Next, I should review the recommended regimens and make sure I'm precise. For nonpregnant patients, first-line options include metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, metronidazole gel 0.75% one full applicator intravaginally once daily for 5 days, or clindamycin cream 2% intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days; tinidazole or secnidazole single-dose regimens are alternatives when adherence is a concern, though pregnancy status matters for some of these agents [^116ecoQF] [^117TswHd] [^114n4Gn7]. For pregnant patients, I should confirm that oral metronidazole or oral clindamycin are preferred when treating to prevent adverse outcomes, while acknowledging that symptomatic treatment can be oral or vaginal depending on the scenario and shared decision-making [^114pLHUK] [^112u6uaj].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit balance is sound. The benefits of empiric therapy include prompt symptom relief and potential reduction in infectious complications and STI acquisition risk, whereas risks include overtreatment if the diagnosis is incorrect, adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset or candidiasis, and contribution to antimicrobial resistance; importantly, BV recurrence is common regardless of awaiting results, so delaying therapy rarely prevents recurrence and may prolong symptoms [^117TswHd] [^116Ac4vJ] [^1145i9xf]. But wait, what if the patient has poor follow-up or faces access barriers? In settings where return is uncertain, empiric therapy is especially reasonable to avoid loss to follow-up and persistent symptoms, which is why many outpatient and emergency care pathways support empiric treatment for symptomatic vaginitis when diagnostic confirmation is delayed [^1173pBYj] [^1122BST5].

> Let me consider special populations and adherence. For patients with high likelihood of nonadherence to multidose regimens, single-dose options like tinidazole 2 g or secnidazole 2 g can be considered where appropriate, keeping in mind pregnancy restrictions for some agents and the higher cost of secnidazole; shared decision-making about regimen choice and follow-up is essential to optimize cure and minimize recurrence [^114n4Gn7] [^113vc9zU]. I should also remember that suppressive strategies may be needed for recurrent BV after an initial treatment course, but that is a separate issue from starting empiric therapy in a new symptomatic episode [^114xe75Z].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach to avoid misclassification. While awaiting NAAT, bedside Amsel criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring can substantiate the diagnosis and guide empiric therapy; if the clinical picture is atypical or mixed, I need to keep alternative diagnoses in mind and adjust treatment accordingly once results return, but this does not preclude starting evidence-based empiric therapy now for likely BV [^11249KRi] [^111kJL73] [^113hzAfT].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is yes, you can start empiric metronidazole for suspected symptomatic BV while swab results are pending, using metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as a first-line regimen, with intravaginal metronidazole gel or clindamycin cream as acceptable alternatives based on patient preference, tolerability, and pregnancy status; in pregnancy, treat symptomatic BV without delay using oral metronidazole or clindamycin, and avoid delaying care for confirmatory testing [^116ecoQF] [^1162FA55] [^114kX2MY] [^114pLHUK]. I should confirm pregnancy status, screen for STI risk as indicated, counsel on expected side effects and adherence, and arrange follow-up to ensure symptom resolution and revisit the diagnosis if symptoms persist or results contradict the initial impression [^117TswHd] [^11249KRi].

Empiric metronidazole (Flagyl) can be started while awaiting BV swab results when clinical suspicion is high or symptoms are significant, as **empiric treatment is guideline-supported** for symptomatic BV [^116ecoQF] [^1162FA55]. Use **500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** as first-line therapy [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY]. In pregnancy, treat symptomatic BV without delay; metronidazole is safe [^116xorrG] and recommended [^114pLHUK]. Avoid empiric therapy if suspicion is low or allergies are present, and reassess if cultures indicate another diagnosis or resistance.

---

## Clinical guidelines supporting empiric treatment

- **CDC 2021 guidelines**: Recommend metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as first-line therapy for symptomatic BV [^116ecoQF] [^117TswHd].

- **WHO 2024 guidelines**: Recommend metronidazole 400–500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days for symptomatic BV, including in pregnancy [^114kX2MY].

- **ACOG 2020 guidelines**: Support empiric treatment of symptomatic BV based on clinical diagnosis, with metronidazole as a first-line option [^1162FA55].

---

## Clinical scenarios where empiric treatment is appropriate

Empiric metronidazole is appropriate when:

- **Symptomatic patients**: High clinical suspicion of BV (characteristic discharge, fishy odor, elevated pH, clue cells) [^111kJL73].

- **Pregnancy**: Symptomatic BV should be treated promptly to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [^114pLHUK] [^114N4PwB].

- **Limited access to follow-up**: Patients may not return for results, making delayed treatment impractical [^1122BST5].

---

## Clinical scenarios where empiric treatment should be avoided

Empiric metronidazole should be avoided when:

- **Low clinical suspicion**: Symptoms are atypical or suggest another diagnosis (e.g. candidiasis, trichomoniasis) [^111NNnWg].

- **Allergy or intolerance**: Known hypersensitivity to metronidazole or other nitroimidazoles [^116hjJNy].

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Routine treatment of asymptomatic BV is not recommended unless specific indications exist (e.g. pregnancy with risk factors) [^11187FjD].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of empiric treatment

### Benefits

Empiric treatment provides **rapid symptom relief** and may reduce complications, including PID and STI acquisition [^117TswHd]. In pregnancy, prompt therapy may reduce adverse outcomes [^114pLHUK] [^114N4PwB].

---

### Risks

Empiric treatment carries risks of **unnecessary antibiotic exposure** if the diagnosis is incorrect, contributing to resistance [^114bV3r6]. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, metallic taste, and rare neurologic effects; **fungal superinfection** may also occur [^114bV3r6].

---

## Alternative treatments and considerations

Alternative regimens include **clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days**, metronidazole gel 0.75% intravaginally for 5 days, or clindamycin cream 2% intravaginally for 7 days [^116ecoQF] [^114n4Gn7]. Single-dose options such as tinidazole 2 g orally or secnidazole 2 g orally are available but are generally reserved for specific situations due to cost and availability [^114n4Gn7] [^113vc9zU].

---

## Follow-up and management based on test results

- **Positive BV test**: Confirm completion of therapy; no routine test-of-cure is needed unless symptoms persist [^notfound].

- **Negative BV test or alternative diagnosis**: Stop metronidazole and initiate appropriate therapy (e.g. antifungal for candidiasis, different antibiotic for trichomoniasis) [^11488KRC].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Re-evaluate for resistance, reinfection, or alternative diagnoses; consider alternative regimens or suppressive therapy [^114h7Zfb].

---

Empiric metronidazole can be started while awaiting BV swab results when clinical suspicion is high or symptoms are significant, especially in pregnancy or when follow-up is uncertain. Use **500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** and adjust therapy based on test results and patient response [^116ecoQF].

### Metronidazole (metronidazole vaginal) [^111NNnWg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Metronidazole Vaginal Gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).

NOTE: For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1145i9xf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The bacteriologic cure rates based on Nugent score were considerably lower than the clinical cure rates, but similar results were seen in a recent study. The first assessment was performed immediately after the end of treatment, and the lactobacillary flora may have still not had enough time to recover. However, like the clinical cure rate, at visit 2 the bacteriologic cure rate worsened in both groups, suggesting that some patients either never reached a normal Nugent score or relapsed shortly afterward. The noninferiority analyses of these exploratory secondary outcomes were inconclusive. Factors contributing to relapses, such as intercourse, hormones, and hygiene, should be taken into consideration in future trials.

The low correlation between the Nugent score and the Amsel criteria has been reported before, but it is still surprising because the Nugent score assesses the flora composition, whereas the Amsel criteria assess the clinical effects of bacterial overgrowth. Despite having 4 Amsel criteria at entry, approximately 45% had a Nugent score of 6 or less (ie, BV negative). This rate is higher than the 19% to 26% reported by a recent study with a similar design and patient populationbut lower than the 75% reported elsewhere. Clinicians rely almost exclusively on the Amsel criteria to diagnose BV and prescribe treatment, and this empirical treatment approach for vaginal infections is unlikely to change anytime soon. Although clindamycin and metronidazole are effective in the short term, they have several disadvantages that warrant further consideration of the first-line treatment options. For example, the spectrum of each antibiotic does not fully cover all the pathogens typically present in BV, and combinations with both antibiotics have not significantly improved the efficacy. Successive rounds of treatment rapidly increase the resistance to antibiotics, and neither metronidazole nor clindamycin seems capable of completely eliminating the biofilm. Prolonged antibiotic treatment is temporarily effective to reduce the relapse rate but potentially damages the normal flora. The risk of subsequent vulvovaginal candidiasis is 10% to 25% of the treated patients, likely due to an overgrowth of Candida or a misdiagnosed mixed infection. Finally, adherence to the treatment is crucial for efficacy and to prevent the development of resistance, but the frequent adverse effects and personal preferences can reduce patient adherence. Adverse effects can be as high as 32% with metronidazoleand 20% with clindamycin, with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among the most frequent. Some patients reportedly dislike antibiotics and prefer other treatments even if perceived as less effective.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1122BST5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Women who seek care and can follow up at sexual health clinics and primary care offices are different than many from disadvantaged groups for whom there may be only one opportunity to address their symptoms when seen in the ED. Empirical treatment of vaginitis carries risks of overtreatment, although use of a single‐dose regimen would minimize stewardship concerns for collateral adverse antibiotic effects. Further, overall treatment effectiveness must be considered in the context of a woman's specific circumstances and needs, such as CDC‐endorsed empirical EPT treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and in the case of sexual assault, for which compliance with follow‐up visits is acknowledged to be poor.

For women with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis, particularly in EDs where point‐of‐care NAAT testing is not available, we believe empirical treatment with 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole for BV and TV and 150‐mg single‐dose fluconazole for Candida should be offered through shared decision making. Reliance on microscopy testing poses a substantial risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment with subsequent persistent symptoms, additional health care visits, and risk of transmission. Alternatively, if the patient believes she can comply, the CDC‐recommended second‐day 2‐g tinidazole dose or 7‐day 500‐mg twice‐daily metronidazole regimen can also be prescribed empirically to treat BV and TV, and women with a history of recurrent or persistent Candida infection can be prescribed a Day 4 and 7 fluconazole dose. Whether empirical or microscopy/point‐of‐care NAAT‐directed treatment is provided, follow‐up should be recommended for patients whose symptoms persist beyond 1 week, at which time further diagnostic testing can be considered.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant adolescents and women to prevent preterm delivery: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^111x9NPu]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preterm delivery results in adverse outcomes; identifying and treating bacterial vaginosis may reduce its occurrence.

Objective

To update the evidence on screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 29, 2019; bibliographies from retrieved articles, experts, and surveillance of the literature through December 31, 2019.

Study Selection

Fair- or good-quality English-language studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of tests feasible within primary care; randomized clinical trials (RCTs); nonrandomized controlled intervention studies (for harms only); or meta-analyses of metronidazole or clindamycin.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, preterm delivery, maternal adverse effects, congenital birth defects, childhood cancer.

Results

Forty-four studies (48 publications) were included. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n = 15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n = 7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n = 7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n = 6307). Among 5 trials reporting findings among women with a prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent; 3 showed a significant beneficial effect, while 2 did not. Maternal adverse events from treatment were infrequent and minor (eg, candidiasis) but were slightly more common with active treatment compared with placebo across 8 RCTs. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported no significant association between metronidazole exposure and congenital malformations (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.22]; odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.29]). One cohort study reported no significantly increased incidence of childhood cancer among metronidazole-exposed children (adjusted relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.59]). However, studies of in utero exposure had important limitations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Accuracy of screening tests for bacterial vaginosis varies. The evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of preterm delivery and related outcomes from treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in a general obstetric population but was inconclusive for women with a prior preterm delivery. Maternal adverse events from treatment appear to be infrequent and minor, but the evidence about harms from in utero exposure was inconclusive.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^113vc9zU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Secnidazole is substantially more expensive than metronidazole and tinidazole, well beyond the means of many women. Based on(accessed March 1, 2025) for major chain pharmacies at multiple U.S. cities, the current cost of metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and of 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole is about $10; the cost of 2‐g single‐dose secnidazole is about $300. Tinidazole is widely available in U.S. pharmacies and could be easily stocked in EDs. Author review of Medicaid Preferred Drug Lists (PDL; conducted during December 2024) found that tinidazole is included in 25 states presently (nine additional states require prior authorization); metronidazole is included in 44 states and secnidazole in two states (five states have no publicly accessible online PDL and 11 do not specifically address these treatments). Medicaid would cover costs of ED testing and treatment like many other insurances, through bundled payments, which come against the hospital's bottom line.

Regardless of the diagnostic and treatment approach to vaginitis, it should be stressed that a careful history for STI risk and pelvic examination remain important since vaginal discharge and discomfort can also be symptoms of gonococcal and chlamydial cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease, and broader STI screening may be indicated. As opposed to NAAT for vaginitis pathogens, gonococcal and chlamydial NAAT is relatively inexpensive and consistently covered by insurance, and laboratories are also required to report these infections to local public health agencies, which helps ensure proper follow‐up care. Women with STI risk suspected of TV should be advised of the need for abstinence pending partner evaluation and treatment, which could include expedited partner therapy (EPT) with 2‐g single‐dose metronidazole or tinidazole in states that allow it. Although not recommenderd in the last U.S. CDC STI guidelines, a recent placebo‐controlled clinical trial demonstrated that concurrent treatment of the male partner of a woman with BV significantly reduced the incidence of recurrent vaginitis within 12 weeks. Of note, metronidazole is no longer contraindicated in pregnancy, whereas tinadazole and fluconazole are contraindicated in the first 3 months of pregnancy and, therefore, would require pregnancy screening. Secnidazole has not been assigned a pregnany rating.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy — evidence on benefits of treatment among those with prior preterm delivery: Five studies provided evidence on treatment in women with a previous preterm delivery to reduce preterm delivery; four evaluated oral metronidazole and reported preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks, three reported statistically significant absolute reductions in preterm delivery after treatment ranging from 18% to 29% and one reported no significant difference, and two studies (one oral metronidazole, one vaginal clindamycin) reported results for preterm delivery at less than 34 weeks with mixed results.

### Indications for therapy and treatment recommendations for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant and pregnant women: a synthesis of data [^112hoB9d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence has associated bacterial vaginosis (BV) with serious medical complications such as premature delivery. The present article synthesizes available data on the treatment of nonpregnant and pregnant women with BV to prevent preterm delivery. A literature search identified articles published since 1976 that evaluated treatment of BV. An intention-to-treat sensitivity analysis was performed, to better compare studies. Studies that evaluated therapy efficacy varied with regard to diagnostic criteria, patient characteristics, clinicians, and laboratories. Therapies varied in efficacy for cure 4 or more weeks after therapy, from 48% to 85%. Intervention studies to reduce BV-related adverse outcomes of pregnancy differed in populations studied, medication used, type of therapy (oral or intravaginal), and timing of treatment. The benefit of treating women at high risk with oral metronidazole has been shown in several studies; however, the effect of treating women without a history of premature delivery is unclear. The use of intravaginal clindamycin therapy, especially during the latter half of the second trimester and thereafter, appears to increase infections during the neonatal period.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^116widQW]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion (GRADE 1C). Symptomatic patients with BV should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. BV is common, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in reproductive-age, pregnant-capable persons globally, and is associated with increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21). Randomized trials of perioperative metronidazole or clindamycin showed no statistically significant differences in postabortion upper genital tract infection versus placebo when standard prophylactic antibiotics were provided; one study using treatment dosing with metronidazole 500 mg three times daily orally for 10 days starting 7 days before the abortion procedure significantly reduced the risk of developing PID postprocedure, but these patients did not receive universal prophylactic antibiotics before abortion.

### Metronidazole (Flagyl) [^114bV3r6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole in the plasma. The FLAGYL 375 capsules dosage or the frequency of administration should be reduced in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Renal Impairment

Patients with end-stage renal disease may excrete metronidazole and metabolites slowly in the urine, resulting in significant accumulation of metronidazole metabolites. Monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Fungal Superinfections

Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with FLAGYL 375 capsules and requires treatment with a candidacidal agent.

Use in Patients with Blood Dyscrasias

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leucopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy.

Drug-Resistant Bacteria and Parasites

Prescribing FLAGYL 375 capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial or parasitic infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria and parasites.

### What have we learned about vaginal infections and preterm birth? [^1123uzGo]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic maternal genital tract infection during pregnancy, particularly bacterial vaginosis, has been consistently associated with preterm birth. In response to this evidence, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (MFMU) designed and conducted 2 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis in a general obstetrical population. These studies showed that treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis failed to prevent preterm birth, regardless of their history of prior preterm birth. Metronidazole treatment of women with trichomoniasis significantly increased the risk of preterm birth compared to placebo. These results formed the basis of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that screening for bacterial vaginosis not be undertaken in low-risk pregnant women, and show that MFMU network studies can have a direct and immediate impact on obstetrical practice.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences including increased risk of acquisition of the others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus‐2 as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, and cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). Current U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single‐dose, point‐of‐care treatment strategy, novel to the U.S. but evidence‐based and consistent with international guidelines, to address existing deficiencies in availability of inexpensive and accurate point‐of‐care diagnosis, and substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow‐up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^115vUjNS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, the only point‐of‐care NAAT for BV, Candida, and TV, the Cepheid Xpert Express MVP PCR test, with a minimum laboratory assay turnaround time of 60 min but longer in practice, is not generally available in U.S. EDs (based on a survey of 12 U.S. EDs in our EMERGE ncy ID NET research network and communication with Cepheid Company). Urgent care facilities likely have even less laboratory support. Use of microscopy testing leads to missed diagnoses and inadequate or delayed treatment, with persistence of symptoms additionally contributing to these women's disabilities as well as risks of adverse health outcomes. In many centers, NAATs can be ordered as send‐out tests; however, they are expensive, covered by most but not all insurance, and require follow‐up, which pose real obstacles for many women who are uninsured or underinsured, are unhoused, and lack a telephone and transportation. Further, follow‐up of send‐out test results, counseling, and prescriptions take time, which has a potential operational impact on ED workflow. The consequences of inadequate treatment and inefficient testing approaches could be mitigated in these circumstances by an affordable, single‐dose, empirical point‐of‐care treatment strategy.

The 2021 U.S. CDC STI guidelines primarily recommend a 7‐day 500‐mg twice‐daily oral metronidazole regimen to treat BV and TV in women and 150‐mg single‐dose oral fluconazole to treat candidal infection (Table 1). For treatment of women with TV, a 7‐day 500 mg twice daily metronidazole regimen has been found to be associated with higher proportion of patients achieving 4‐week cure than the 2‐g single dose. Adherence is difficult due to this regimen's long duration and metronidazole's unpleasant metallic taste and frequent gastrointestinal side effects. As opposed to sexual health clinics, regulatory barriers obviate point‐of‐care ED medication dispensing, thus requiring the patient to go to a pharmacy to fill their prescription. One study found that patient adherence to multidose oral metronidazole treatment of BV was 50%–68%. Women of ethnic minorities and low socioeconomic status are at greatest risk of medication nonadherence.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116Ac4vJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommended first-line antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole or clindamycin, provide broad anaerobic coverage and are administered orally or intravaginally. These regimens have similar efficacy and cure ~70–85% of women with BV within 1 month; however, more than 50% experience recurrence of symptoms and/BV on microscopy within 6 months. The low rate of sustained cure not only highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, but also compounds women's distress and frustration, and leads to repeated presentation to health services or adoption of unproven home-remedies. Factors including persistence of a BV-associated biofilm, failure to recolonise the vagina with lactobacilli, reinfection from an untreated partner, and host genetic and/or immune factors may all play a role in recurrence (Fig. 1). Frustratingly for both clinicians and patients, the contribution of reinfection and vaginal relapse cannot be separated, as the clinical presentation of both mechanisms of recurrence is identical. Point-of-care laboratory tests cannot resolve this issue yet, and molecular methods, including next generation sequencing, are unable to identify a unique or specific microbial signature to separate the two routes of recurrence. While persistence or resistance of BVAB or BV biofilm following antibiotic therapy is likely to be the dominant mechanism among some women, there is a robust body of evidence to support the exchange of both optimal and detrimental bacteria between partners during sexual activity. These data suggest that reinfection of women with pathogenic BVAB may be a key driver of recurrence following treatment. If this is the case, current antimicrobial regimens directed solely to women are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure.

Fig. 1
Factors hypothesised to drive BV recurrence. Thicker arrows indicate main hypothesised drivers of BV recurrence

Clinicians and researchers agree that there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments to improve BV cure, and ultimately reduce adverse health outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the disconnect between the epidemiological and microbiological evidence supporting the contribution of reinfection from an untreated sexual partner to the BV-syndrome, and the outcomes of prior trials that have evaluated partner treatment to improve BV cure. We will outline the opportunities that sexual partner treatment may afford to women with BV and discuss the challenges faced when conducting partner treatment trials.

### Antimicrobial resistance associated with the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [^114Geo5n]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility of vaginal anaerobic bacteria before and after treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

Study Design

A randomized clinical trial of 119 nonpregnant women with bacterial vaginosis receiving either intravaginal metronidazole for 5 days or clindamycin for 3 days was performed. Women had 1 baseline and 3 follow-up visits at which quantitative vaginal cultures were performed. Anaerobic isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Results

Complete susceptibility data was available on 95 women (47 metronidazole and 48 clindamycin). Of 1059 anaerobic bacterial isolates, less than 1% demonstrated resistance to metronidazole. In contrast, 17% demonstrated baseline clindamycin resistance, and 53% demonstrated resistance to clindamycin after therapy. Women exposed to clindamycin (but not metronidazole) had high frequencies (80%) of clindamycin-resistant anaerobic bacteria that persisted for 90 days after treatment.

Conclusion

Treatment of bacterial vaginosis with clindamycin is associated with marked evidence of antimicrobial resistance among vaginal anaerobic bacteria. This may increase the vaginal reservoir of macrolide-resistant bacteria.

### Periodic presumptive treatment for vaginal infections may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted bacterial infections [^116kvqKK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may increase women's susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In a randomized trial of periodic presumptive treatment (PPT) to reduce vaginal infections, we observed a significant reduction in BV. We further assessed the intervention effect on incident Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycoplasma genitalium infection.

Methods

Nonpregnant, human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected women from the United States and Kenya received intravaginal metronidazole (750 mg) plus miconazole (200 mg) or placebo for 5 consecutive nights each month for 12 months. Genital fluid specimens were collected every other month. Poisson regression models were used to assess the intervention effect on STI acquisition.

Results

Of 234 women enrolled, 221 had specimens available for analysis. Incidence of any bacterial STI (C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium infection) was lower in the intervention arm, compared with the placebo arm (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval, .32-.91). When assessed individually, reductions in STI incidences were similar but not statistically significant (IRRs, 0.50 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .20–1.23] for C. trachomatis infection, 0.56 [95% CI, .19–1.67] for N. gonorrhoeae infection, and 0.66 [95% CI, .38–1.15] for M. genitalium infection).

Conclusions

In addition to reducing BV, this PPT intervention may also reduce the risk of bacterial STI among women. Because BV is highly prevalent, often persists, and frequently recurs after treatment, interventions that reduce BV over extended periods could play a role in decreasing STI incidence globally.

### A randomized trial of the duration of therapy with metronidazole plus or minus azithromycin for treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis [^116XWrAk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginitis worldwide. Currently recommended treatments have poor efficacy and are associated with high rates of BV recurrence. We examined whether a longer duration of treatment with metronidazole or combination therapy with metronidazole and azithromycin would enhance the cure rates for BV. In addition, we examined factors other than drug therapy associated with cure.

Methods

Women with symptomatic BV (defined by a modified Amsel criteria) were enrolled in a 4-arm study that compared metronidazole for 7 days versus 14 days, plus or minus azithromycin on days 1 and 3. Data regarding interim behaviors were also obtained, as were vaginal specimens for Gram staining.

Results

At the first follow-up visit (7 days after the completion of therapy), there was a significant difference in cure rates among patients who received 7 days of metronidazole therapy, compared with those who received 14 days of therapy, combined across azithromycin therapy (P = .0003). There was no effect associated with azithromycin therapy. There were no differences in cure rates between any of the treatment groups at 21 days after completion of therapy. Abstinence or protected sex, refraining from douching, and a lower baseline Nugent score for the vaginal Gram stain were all significantly associated with cure.

Conclusions

Cure rates for BV were significantly improved by 14 days of metronidazole treatment (compared with 7 days of treatment), but the effects were not sustained, suggesting that relapse or reinfection occurred. Combination therapy with the addition of azithromycin had no benefit. Lower baseline Nugent scores — presumably reflecting less complex vaginal flora — were significantly associated with cure, as was refraining from unprotected sex and from douching.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112c1uL7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^116upMax]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of the present study suggest that the current approach to management of vaginal discharge provides suboptimal care. Significant time burdens placed on primary care providers and the time and effort necessary to perform inexpensive point-of-care tests are likely balanced against other competing priorities. Different models of care may be warranted for women having vaginal discharge syndromes. This requires a combination of sensitive and specific laboratory testing as well as careful patient evaluation and clinical acumen to accurately diagnose women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis. One approach could be to ask women who contact a clinician's office with vaginal symptoms to provide self-collected vaginal swab samples, which have been proven to be equivalent to clinician-collected samples, for testing. Prescriptions could be written to cover the specific pathogens identified and women having no infectious etiology identified could be counseled that no antifungal or antibiotic therapy is warranted. The excess healthcare costs associated with empiric treatment deserves further study.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^116Eqpgz]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The UMB-HMP cohort

The study results and associated clinical data were previously publishedand all data provided were de-identified to this study. The UMB-HMP study was not an interventional study, but an observational prospective study, where treatment information was recorded during a clinical exam at week 5 and week 10 for 135 nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Within this study, MNZ treatment was provided as standard of care, as recommended by the CDC (metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days). The original study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Written informed consent was appropriately obtained from all participants, who also provided consent for storage and use in future research studies related to women's health.

Women self-collected cervicovaginal swabs for 10 weeks. Vaginal microbiota data were generated by sequencing the V3–V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene and is available in dbGAP BioProject PRJNA208535. In this study, the vaginal microbiota composition data from 11 women who experienced BV and were treated with MNZ during the UMB-HMP study were analyzed. Any participants who failed to complete the MNZ regimen, who did not have BV according to Nugent scoring at the time of MNZ treatment, or who did not have follow-up data available were excluded from the analysis. The initial relative abundances were averaged across the week before starting MNZ treatment. Patients were classified to have recurrent BV if they exhibited a second episode of BV based on Nugent scoring (7–10) during remaining of the 10-week observation period.

The CONRAD BV cohort

The study results and associated clinical data were previously publishedand all data provided were de-identified to this study. The original clinical study protocol was approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Pro #00006122) with a waiver of oversight from the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT01347632). A total of 69 women were screened from symptomatic discharge and 35 women were enrolled in the study. Vaginal microbiota data were generated by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, providing taxonomic resolution at the general level.

Thirty-three women completed all three visits. BV was evaluated by vaginal microbiota compositional data (molecular-BV). After biological samples were obtained at visit 1 (V1), women with BV were prescribed twice daily, 500-mg MNZ for 7 days. Participants returned for visit 2 (V2) 7–10 days after completing the course of MNZ therapy and visit 3 (V3) 28–32 days after completing treatment. At all three visits, samples were obtained to evaluate vaginal semen (ABAcard, West Hills, CA), vaginal pH, gram stain for Nugent score and semiquantitative vaginal flora culture. CVLs were collected, followed by vaginal swabs and three full-thickness biopsies.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^116dNKcF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 2‐g single‐dose oral secnidazole (two 1‐g packets) for treatment of BV and TV, and this is currently listed as an alternative BV treatment option in U.S. CDC guidelines. Table 2 shows the results of clinical trials among women with symptomatic vaginitis comparing metronidazole, tinidazole, and secnidazole, including single‐dose regimens, to treat BV and TV. For BV, when compared with metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days, both 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole and 2‐g single‐dose secnidazole demonstrated similar cure rates to metronidazole. Another trial comparing single doses of secnidazole, tinidazole, and metronidazole to treat BV found that tinidazole had a significantly greater clinical cure rate than metronidazole but secnidazole did not, further supporting the efficacy of single‐dose tinidazole. Across all trials, for BV, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole demonstrated clinical cure rates of 83%–100%.,

TABLE 2
Comparative clinical trials of tinidazole, secnidazole, and metronidazole treatment for symptomatic women diagnosed with BV and trichomoniasis.

Unlike FDA guidance for comparative noninferiority trials to evaluate new antibiotics to treat other common infections, guidance for BV antimicrobial approval specifies a placebo‐controlled superiority trial. Tinidazole was FDA‐approved in 2004 based on a placebo‐controlled trial that demonstrated efficacy of both 2 g daily for 2 days and for 5 days. Earlier placebo‐controlled trials and many comparative studies of a single 2‐g dose of tinidazole were conducted outside the United States and had a different design than specified in U.S. FDA guidance to evaluate BV treatments, which may explain the divergence of U.S. and international treatment recommendations (i.e. 2 g daily for 2 days vs. single dose). Tinidazole has gone off‐patent, so no commercial interest now exists for FDA approval of single‐dose treatment. However, as shown in Table 2, single‐dose tinidazole has compared favorably to both 7‐day twice‐daily metronidazole and single‐dose secnidazole, regimens that have met FDA guidance criteria, and tinidazole has the endorsement of agencies outside the United States, supporting its off‐label use.

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1121TTZs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the efficacy of dequalinium chloride comparable to that of oral metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 147 premenopausal women with bacterial vaginosis, the difference in the clinical cure rate between dequalinium chloride and metronidazole was −0.5. The results are statistically significant and indicate the noninferiority of dequalinium chloride.

Meaning

These findings indicate that treatment with dequalinium chloride is as effective as oral metronidazole for curing bacterial vaginosis, thus showing similar efficacy to first-line antibiotic treatments.

### Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation [^1166JtZJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Practitioners and patients alike widely recognize the limitations of current therapeutic approaches to the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Options remain extremely limited, and our inability to prevent the frequently, often relentless symptomatic recurrences of BV and to reduce serious sequelae such as preterm delivery, remains an acknowledged but unresolved shortcoming. Our incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this unique form of vaginal dysbiosis has been a significant impediment to developing optimal treatment and prevention approaches. New drugs have not been forthcoming and are not likely to be available in the immediate future; hence, reliance on the optimal use of available agents has become essential as improvised often unproven regimens are implemented. In this review, we will explore the limitations of currently recommended therapies, with a particular focus on the contribution of reinfection and pathogen persistence to BV recurrence, and the development of interventions that target these mechanisms. Ultimately, to achieve sustained cure and effectiveness against BV-associated sequelae, it is possible that we will need approaches that combine antimicrobials with biofilm-disrupting agents and partner treatments in those at risk of reinfection.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^115kcTLF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

We screened 176 women, and 68 women completed metronidazole treatment (ineligibility reasons in Appendix A, Figure A.1): 82.4% had BV alone, 2.9% had T. vaginalis alone, and 14.7% had both BV and T. vaginalis. The median age was 31 years (range 19–42), and most were sex workers (Table 1). Thirteen women (26.5%) reported unusual vaginal discharge at the pretreatment visit, but none had proactively sought care for these symptoms before joining the study. Some women (26.5%) received another antibiotic in addition to metronidazole for another condition, or had an ongoing C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae infection during metronidazole treatment (38.2%; Table 1). At the posttreatment visit, all women were BV-negative by modified Amsel criteria and T. vaginalis -negative by culture and wet mount, and no women reported urogenital symptoms (including unusual vaginal discharge), adverse events (including vomiting), or social harms. Of the 56 women with Nugent 7–10 pretreatment, 30 (54.5%) had Nugent 0–3, 11 (20.0%) Nugent 4–6, and 14 Nugent 7–10 posttreatment (Table 2).

### Assessment and treatment of vaginitis [^1166aRMr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is the presenting symptom at millions of office visits each year in the United States. Although treatment of sporadic cases is often straightforward, recurrent cases present both diagnostic and treatment challenges. Molecular diagnostic tests are likely superior to in-office microscopy for most clinicians and most cases. In both recurrent bacterial vaginosis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, national treatment guidelines recommend an extended treatment duration with one of the first-line agents. In cases in which such treatment is not successful, vaginal boric acid is likely the cheapest and easiest alternative option. New antifungal medications offer additional but limited treatment options. Probiotics are not recommended for prevention of vulvovaginal candidiasis; however, vaginal products containing Lactobacillus crispatus may have promise for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Trichomoniasis should be treated with a 1-week course of metronidazole; this is the only sexually transmitted infection for which treatment recommendations vary by sex. In cases in which patients do not respond to initial treatment, the diagnosis should be reconsidered, and other potential causes such as desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or vulvodynia should be considered.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^116UhLau]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a condition associated with adverse reproductive outcomes and characterized by a shift from a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota to a polymicrobial microbiota, consistently colonized by strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Metronidazole is the first-line treatment; however, treatment failure and recurrence rates remain high. To understand complex interactions between Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus involved in efficacy, here we develop an ordinary differential equation model that predicts bacterial growth as a function of metronidazole uptake, sensitivity, and metabolism. The model shows that a critical factor in efficacy is Lactobacillus sequestration of metronidazole, and efficacy decreases when the relative abundance of Lactobacillus is higher pre-treatment. We validate results in Gardnerella and Lactobacillus co-cultures, and in two clinical cohorts, finding women with recurrence have significantly higher pre-treatment levels of Lactobacillus relative to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria. Overall results provide mechanistic insight into how personalized differences in microbial communities influence vaginal antibiotic efficacy.

### Changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations with intravaginal metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis as assessed by quantitative PCR [^111rNdf2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) using broad-range bacterial PCR methods such as consensus sequence 16S rRNA gene PCR, but their role in BV remains poorly defined. We describe changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations following metronidazole therapy for BV. Vaginal swabs were collected from women with BV diagnosed using Amsel clinical criteria, and vaginal fluid was assessed by Gram stain to generate Nugent scores. Follow-up swabs were collected 1 month after a 5-day course of vaginal 0.75% metronidazole gel and analyzed for 24 subjects with cured BV and 24 subjects with persistent BV. Changes in bacterial concentrations were measured using eight bacterium-specific 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assays. DNA from several fastidious BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) were present at high concentrations in the vagina prior to treatment. Successful antibiotic therapy resulted in 3- to 4-log reductions in median bacterial loads of BVAB1 (P = 0.02), BVAB2 (P = 0.0004), BVAB3 (P = 0.03), a Megasphaera-like bacterium (P < 0.0001), Atopobium species (P < 0.0001), Leptotrichia/Sneathia species (P = 0.0002), and Gardnerella vaginalis (P < 0.0001). Median posttreatment bacterial levels did not change significantly in subjects with persistent BV except for a decline in levels of BVAB3. The presence or absence of BV is reflected by vaginal concentrations of BV-associated bacteria such as BVAB1, BVAB2, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Atopobium species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and a Megasphaera-like bacterium, suggesting that these bacteria play an important role in BV pathogenesis and may be suitable markers of disease and treatment response.

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^115cZtpP]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study adds to the knowledge on the dismal effect of antibiotic use on vaginal dysbiosis. We suggest medical professionals take this into account when counselling patients known to have recurrent BV when they need antibiotics for another condition.

Furthermore, we suggest that GPs prioritise in-person consultation over repeat prescriptions in patients with recurrent complaints. Critical evaluation of the (previous) diagnosis is justified using standardised criteria, such as Amsel criteria, and warrants microbiological testing before treatment is installed again, to prevent unnecessary prescriptions and further development of antibiotic resistance.

In conclusion, the present study provides tools for GPs to better recognise patients at risk of developing recurrent complaints and re-evaluate their approach to the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent BV.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^115eWUnQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
U.S. CDC, European International Union/WHO, and U.K. guidelines for treatment of BV and trichomoniasis.

In light of these practical realities, empirical single‐dose oral tinidazole treatment of both BV and TV (with single‐dose fluconazole) would offer a patient‐centered solution to optimize the chance for first‐time cure, particularly for women challenged by medication adherence and follow‐up capability. Currently, the 2021 U.S. CDC STI guidelines recommend 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole (as four 500‐mg tablets) for TV treatment and 2 g on Days 1 and 2 as an alternative BV treatment option. Due to ED dispensing limitations, the next day's dose would require the patient to fill a prescription. However, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole is already recommended as an alternative treatment of both BV and TV by the European International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) and World Health Organization (WHO) and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) U.K. guidelines (Table 1). Tinidazole's plasma half‐life is 12–14 h, which is longer than metronidazole's (~8 h), allowing for a shorter treatment course, and its safety profile is less adverse, with metallic taste, nausea, anorexia, and constipation associated with longer duration as opposed to single‐dose treatment.TV also exhibits less resistance to tinidazole than metronidazole, demonstrating both lower in vitro minimum lethal concentrations and a high clinical efficacy rate for patients with metronidazole‐refractory TV infection.

### Characterization and treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114h7Zfb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition, with a number of effective available treatments, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole and clindamycin and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within 1 year of treatment for incident disease. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of recurrent etiology of BV are not known. Recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500mg twice daily for 10–14 days); if ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by two times per week for 3–6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to one-time dosing. Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise, but must be studied further before use in the clinic. Despite limitations, antimicrobial therapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for recurrent BV for the foreseeable future.

### The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women [^115sSA9Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common cause of vaginitis that has been associated with a high incidence of obstetric and gynaecologic complications and increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. This has led to renewed research interest in its treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents on BV in non-pregnant women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and African Healthline (December 2007); and proceedings of relevant international conferences (from 1981 to date).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any two or more antimicrobial agents, or antimicrobial agents with placebo or no treatment, in women with clinical or Gram-stain criteria of BV.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the original publications while the third author cross checked the data.

Main Results

Twenty-four trials involving 4422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analysed results by intention to treat; we re-analysed the remainder. Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.02); metallic taste, and nausea and vomiting were more common in the metronidazole group (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.59; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.51, respectively). Given intravaginally as gelatin tablets, lactobacillus was more effective than oral metronidazole (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.08). Similarly, oral lactobacillus combined with metronidazole was more effective than metronidazole alone (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.77). Clindamycin showed a lower rate of clinical failure than triple sulfonamide cream (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72). Hydrogen peroxide douche showed a higher rate of clinical failure (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.00) and adverse events (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.52) than a single 2 g dose of metronidazole.

Authors' Conclusions

Clindamycin preparations, oral metronidazole, and oral and intravaginal tablets of lactobacillus were effective for bacterial vaginosis. Hydrogen peroxide douche and triple sulphonamide cream were ineffective. Metronidazole caused metallic taste, nausea and vomiting. We need better-designed trials with larger sample sizes to test the effectiveness of promising drugs.

### Metronidazole (vandazole) [^116VAviF]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A single, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of VANDAZOLE for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells. Non-pregnant females at least 18 years of age were randomized to receive treatment with either VANDAZOLE or another formulation of metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% once daily at bedtime for 5 days. The modified intent-to treat population (patients who received study medication and had a Nugent score ≥ 4) consisted of 229 VANDAZOLE patients and 243 patients treated with another vaginal formulation of metronidazole. Therapeutic Cure defined as a clinical cure and Nugent score < 4 was assessed Day 22–31. Table 1 shows the therapeutic, clinical and Nugent score cure rates in this trial. The therapeutic cure rate was 42.8% for the VANDAZOLE group and 30.9% for the comparator group (95% confidence interval about the 11.9% difference in therapeutic cure rate: 2.8% to 21.0%).

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1143ZCnM]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The cure rate for BV is similar to that of clindamycin and metronidazole, but unlike them, the spectrum of dequalinium chloride covers pathogens associated with BV, aerobic vaginitis, and candidiasis. Accordingly, treatment with dequalinium chloride had a lower rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis than metronidazole and clindamycin. Despite its 30 years in the market, there are no reports of clinically relevant resistance to dequalinium chloride. The tolerability and safety profile may increase adherence to the treatment: most patients rated the tolerability of dequalinium chloride as very good, and the overall rate of adverse effects with dequalinium chloride is very low. Because there is no systemic absorption, most adverse effects are local and mild, making dequalinium chloride safe enough to use during pregnancy. Therefore, dequalinium chloride warrants consideration as first-line empirical treatment for BV due to its similar efficacy to metronidazole and clindamycin, broad spectrum, lack of resistance, tolerability, and safety. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate with dequalinium chloride was similar to that of antibiotics, likely due to a residual dysbiosis. Restoring the vaginal flora using probiotics after any anti-infective treatment for BV could help reduce recurrences.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the study are the randomized noninferiority study design with a well-defined noninferiority margin and parallel allocation. Potential biases were minimized to increase the internal validity: the double-dummy medication and triple-blinding ensured the allocation concealment, whereas the high adherence and retention rates reduced the attrition bias. The multicenter setting and broad inclusion criteria increase the generalizability. The limitations of the study are the short follow-up; the reduced sample size, which hindered subgroup analyses; and the patient population limited to White European individuals.

### High-dose vaginal metronidazole for recurrent bacterial vaginosis – a pilot study [^112Wq5jB]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate high-dose intravaginal metronidazole, with or without miconazole, in enhancing cure rates in women with recurrent BV.

Materials and Methods

A total of 43 women with symptomatic recurrent BV were enrolled in a 4-arm study comparing 500 mg versus 750 mg of metronidazole, with or without miconazole, intravaginally for 7 days. Test of cure by saline wet mount and 10% potassium chloride microscopy, pH, Gram stain for Nugent score, and yeast culture were performed 3 times after treatment: 3 to 7 days, 30 to 35 days, and 60 to 70 days.

Results

Overall cure rate for the entire group was 92.6% at visit 2, 62.1% at visit 3, and 51.4% at visit 4. At visit 2, there was no difference in cure rates among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (90.5%) compared with metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (85%). At visit 3, there was a significant improvement in cure rates among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (78.9%) compared with metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (44.4%) (p < .05). At visit 4, a significant difference in clinical cure rates persisted among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (68.4%) compared with of metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (33.3%; p < .05). Poor responses (Nugent score > 4 or pH > 4.4) at the first visit alter treatment-predicted recurrence. The addition of miconazole did not enhance BV response rates.

Conclusions

Cure rates for BV were high in this refractory cohort and seemed dose dependent.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^117TswHd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Treatment for BV is recommended for women with symptoms. Established benefits of therapy among nonpregnant women are to relieve vaginal symptoms and signs of infection. Other potential benefits of treatment include reduction in the risk for acquiring C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HIV, HPV, and HSV-2. No data are available that directly compare the efficacy of oral and topical medications for treating BV.

Recommended Regimens for Bacterial Vaginosis
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
or
Metronidazole gel 0.75% one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally, once daily for 5 days
or
Clindamycin cream 2% one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days

A review regarding alcohol consumption during metronidazole treatment reported no in vitro studies, animal models, reports of adverse effects, or clinical studies providing convincing evidence of a disulfiram-like interaction between alcohol and metronidazole. The previous warning against simultaneous use of alcohol and metronidazole was based on laboratory experiments and individual case histories in which the reported reactions were equally likely to have been caused by alcohol alone or by adverse effects of metronidazole.

Metronidazole does not inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, as occurs with disulfiram. Ethanol alone or ethanol-independent side effects of metronidazole might explain the suspicion of disulfiram-like effects. Thus, refraining from alcohol use while taking metronidazole (or tinidazole) is unnecessary. Clindamycin cream is oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms for 5 days after use (refer to clindamycin product labeling for additional information).

### Tinidazole (tindazole) [^1165DSg4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Amebiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) in adult women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.

1.5 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tinidazole Tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Tinidazole Tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections, that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis prior to delivery: a cost-effectiveness study [^11268bhu]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the cost and effectiveness of three strategies for screening and/or treating bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy prior to delivery: (1) the current standard of care was neither test nor treat for BV (Treat None); (2) test all patients for BV at 36 weeks' gestation; treat if positive (Test Treat); and (3) treat all patients undergoing cesarean delivery with intravenous metronidazole at time of surgery (Treat All Cesarean). Effectiveness was defined as avoidance of postpartum surgical site infection (SSI).

Study Design

A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was designed from a third-party payer perspective using clinical and cost estimates obtained from the literature, American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program participant use file (2005–2019), 2019 National Vital Statistics, Medicare costs, and wholesale drug costs. Cost estimates were inflated to 2020 U.S. dollars. For this study, effectiveness was defined as avoidance of postpartum SSIs.

Results

The base case analysis that is the current standard of care of not routinely testing and treating patients for BV (Treat None) was the most expensive and least effective strategy, with a mean cost of $59.16 and infection rate of 3.71%. Empirically treating all patients for BV without testing (Treat All Cesarean) was the most effective and the least expensive strategy, with a mean cost of $53.50 and an infection rate of 2.75%. Testing all patients for BV and treating those positive for BV (Test Treat) was also relatively inexpensive and effective, with an infection rate of 2.94% and mean cost of $57.05. Compared with Treat None, we would expect the Treat All Cesarean strategy to reduce the infection rate by 26%.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that treating pregnant patients with intravenous metronidazole at time of cesarean delivery could be an effective and cost-saving strategy. Testing and treating for BV could also be considered a reasonable strategy, as it has the added benefit of preserving antibiotic stewardship. In no analysis was the standard of care strategy of neither testing nor treating for BV before delivery the preferred strategy.

Key Points

· BV colonization may increase surgical site infection risk after cesarean section. · Treatment of BV before or during delivery may be cost-saving strategies as treatment could prevent costs associated with infection. · Further study is needed to best balance the risk of surgical site infection with antibiotic stewardship.

### Suppressive antibacterial therapy with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114xe75Z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Efficacy study of suppressive vaginal metronidazole in reducing recurrent symptomatic episodes of bacterial vaginosis.

Study Design

Multicenter prospective study with initial 10-day open-label metronidazole gel in which asymptomatic responders randomly assigned to receive twice weekly metronidazole vaginal gel or placebo for 16 weeks and off therapy for 12 weeks.

Results

Of 157 eligible women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis, 112 of 127 returning evaluable women (88.2%) responded clinically and were randomly assigned. During suppressive therapy, recurrent bacterial vaginosis occurred in 13 women (25.5%) receiving metronidazole and 26 (59.1%) receiving placebo (MITT analysis, relative risk [RR] 0.43, CI = 0.25–0.73, P = .001). During the entire 28-week follow-up, recurrence occurred in 26 (51.0%) on treatment compared with 33 (75%) on placebo (RR 0.68, CI = 0.49–0.93, P = .02). Probability for remaining cured was 70% for metronidazole compared with 39% on placebo, which declined to 34% and 18%, respectively, by 28 weeks follow-up. Adverse effects were uncommon; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis occurred significantly more often in metronidazole-treated women (P = .02).

Conclusion

Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel achieves a significant reduction in the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis is common.

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1156uJUJ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial confirmed that dequalinium chloride is not inferior to metronidazole in the treatment of BV, displaying a similarly high cure rate but with better tolerability and fewer adverse events. Dequalinium chloride could help reduce antibiotic consumption and thus warrants consideration as first-line treatment for BV due to its broad spectrum, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and less likelihood of resistance.

Introduction

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) remains a common and recurrent cause of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age, with substantial impact in quality of life and health care costs. The clinical diagnosis of BV is based on the presence of at least 3 Amsel criteria: characteristic vaginal discharge; "fishy" smell, clue cells; and vaginal pH greater than 4.5. Bacterial vaginosis can also be diagnosed using the Nugent score, a microscopic assessment of a Gram staining of the vaginal discharge, rarely performed at the point of care because it requires more time, trained personnel, and specialized equipment.

First-line treatments for BV are metronidazole and clindamycin. Their 1- to 4-week cure rate is 55% to 90%, but the recurrence rate within 6 months is 30% to 70%. This high recurrence has been attributed to the bacterial biofilm, a protective bacterial reservoir that neither treatment is able to eradicate. Moreover, antibiotics have frequent adverse effects and carry the risk of development of resistance; thus, effective nonantibiotic treatments for BV are needed.

One such alternative is dequalinium chloride, a broad-spectrum antiseptic effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, used since the 1950s. Several clinical studies, have reported the efficacy and safety of dequalinium chloride against vaginal infections. Dequalinium chloride is recommended by several international and European guidelines as alternative treatment for BV or inflammatory vaginitis. Dequalinium chloride adsorbs into the cell surface, altering its permeability; disrupts protein synthesis; and induces protein denaturation and precipitation of nucleic acids. Due to these multiple modes of action, the development of resistance is unlikely. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed recently that dequalinium chloride disrupts the bacterial biofilm and impairs metabolic activity. Dequalinium chloride was shown to be noninferior to clindamycin for treatment of BV; thus, the primary objective of this study was to assess the noninferiority of dequalinium chloride compared with oral metronidazole, the other first-line treatment.

### Secnidazole (Solosec) [^114bchPw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

SOLOSEC®is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial indicated for:

Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in female patients 12 years of age and older. (1.1)
Treatment of trichomoniasis in patients 12 years of age and older. (1.2)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SOLOSEC and other antibacterial drugs, SOLOSEC should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1.3)

1.1 Bacterial Vaginosis

SOLOSEC is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in female patients 12 years of age and older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2 Trichomoniasis

SOLOSEC is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis in patients 12 years of age and older. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, treat partners of infected patients simultaneously in order to prevent reinfection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SOLOSEC and other antibacterial drugs, SOLOSEC should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^116Dgvug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Women may have symptoms of a characteristic vaginal discharge but are often asymptomatic. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes and, in particular, preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2012), searched cited references from retrieved articles and reviewed abstracts, letters to the editor and editorials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora whether symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected through screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included 21 trials of good quality, involving 7847 women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora. Antibiotic therapy was shown to be effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials, 4403 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 91%). Antibiotic treatment also reduced the risk of late miscarriage (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76; two trials, 1270 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%). Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 13 trials, 6491 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 48%), or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.84; two trials, 493 women). It did increase the risk of side-effects sufficient to stop or change treatment (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.68; four trials, 2323 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%). In this updated review, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation did not reduce the risk of PTB less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; five trials, 4088 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 49%). In women with a previous PTB, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent PTB (average RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.48; three trials, 421 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 72%). In women with abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84; two trials, 894 women). One small trial of 156 women compared metronidazole and clindamycin, both oral and vaginal, with no significant differences seen for any of the pre-specified primary outcomes. Statistically significant differences were seen for the outcomes of prolongation of gestational age (days) (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.74) and birthweight (grams) (MD 75.18; 95% CI 25.37 to 124.99) however these represent relatively small differences in the clinical setting. Oral antibiotics versus vaginal antibiotics did not reduce the risk of PTB (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.52; two trials, 264 women). Oral antibiotics had some advantage over vaginal antibiotics (whether metronidazole or clindamycin) with respect to admission to neonatal unit (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.92, one trial, 156 women), prolongation of gestational age (days) (MD 9.00; 95% CI 8.20 to 9.80; one trial, 156 women) and birthweight (grams) (MD 342.13; 95% CI 293.04 to 391.22; one trial, 156 women). Different frequency of dosing of antibiotics was assessed in one small trial and showed no significant difference for any outcome assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. The overall risk of PTB was not significantly reduced. This review provides little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis will prevent PTB and its consequences. When screening criteria were broadened to include women with abnormal flora there was a 47% reduction in preterm birth, however this is limited to two included studies.

The ITT population included all randomized and treated patients allocated according to their randomization. The PP population included patients without major protocol violations. The safety population included patients who took at least 1 dose of study medication. Originally, the main efficacy analysis was planned to be performed using the modified ITT population, a subset of the ITT population that excluded patients with a Nugent score less than 7. The protocol was amended to change the main study population to the ITT. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT and PP populations. Secondary outcomes are presented using the ITT population.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116p9qnj]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy — benefits of early detection and treatment: No studies were identified that directly evaluated the benefit of screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons. Thirteen randomized clinical trials of treatment in asymptomatic pregnant women — using oral metronidazole (3 trials), oral metronidazole plus erythromycin (1 trial), oral clindamycin (2 trials), and intravaginal clindamycin (7 trials) — showed no statistically significant benefit in general obstetric populations for all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.86–1.20]; 6 studies; n = 6307), spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86–1.07]; 8 studies; n = 7571), preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks (pooled RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54–1.42]; 3 studies; n = 5564), low birth weight less than 2500 g (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83–1.29]; 5 studies; n = 5377), birth weight less than 1500 g (pooled RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.50–2.18]; 3 studies; n = 5149), and PROM or preterm PROM (pooled RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.72–1.72]; 4 studies; n = 3568). Among women with a history of prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent: for preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks, RRs ranged from 0.71 to 1.33 (4 trials; n = 451), and for preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks, RRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.07–14.05) in 1 study and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.08–2.11) in the other; Ten to 19% of participants in these trials had a history of prior preterm delivery.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^111nrQW2]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection.

Regarding medical management for trichomonas vaginalis infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering any of the following options if adherence to multiple doses is a serious concern:

- metronidazole 2 g PO as a single dose

- tinidazole 2 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy)

- secnidazole 2 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy) or ornidazole 1.5 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy) if metronidazole or tinidazole is not available.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^113mXkfX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Of the 19 (7%) women with TV, 12 (63%) had mixed vaginal infections. While 10 of the 11 (91%) women with concurrent TV and BV were prescribed oral metronidazole, only 2 of the 7 (29%) women having TV alone received oral metronidazole treatment. Seven (37%) women with TV (either alone or with coinfection) received no treatment. Of note, 8 (42%) women having TV returned for vaginitis symptoms over the next 90 days.

Of the 120 women having no diagnosed vaginal infection (BV, VVC, or TV), 41 (34%) received a prescription for antibiotics and/or antifungals; 6 (5%) received both antifungals and antibiotics, 8 (7%) received antifungals alone, and 27 (23%) received either oral or vaginal metronidazole for treatment of BV. Of the women who received prescription for treatment of infections when none were detected, 9 of 41 (22%) returned for repeat symptoms of vaginitis in the subsequent 90 days, compared to 5 of 79 (6%) women who were not prescribed a treatment (P = .02).

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^113Yi2h9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The results of this randomized clinical trial confirmed that dequalinium chloride is not inferior to metronidazole for the treatment of BV. More than 90% of the patients had resolution of the clinical signs and were considered cured at visit 1, showing constancy and neither loss of effect nor biocreep. In a noninferiority trial, a type 1 error concludes noninferiority when the new treatment is in fact inferior (false positive), whereas a type 2 error concludes inferiority in a treatment that is noninferior (false negative). Small sample sizes tend to lack power to detect an effect when there is one; however, because this study had a higher cure rate and a difference between groups far smaller than anticipated (even favoring dequalinium chloride in the PP analysis), the reduced sample size was enough to demonstrate the noninferiority of dequalinium chloride. Having similar results in the PP and ITT analyses strengthens this conclusion. The low P values indicate an extremely low likelihood of a false positive, whereas the careful design and conduct of the study minimized deficiencies that could make treatment groups appear more similar, increasing the certainty that the results are real.

The original study design and primary end point were in line with FDA guidance but do not reflect standard clinical practice. The protocol amendment to analyze all patients regardless of their Nugent score and the post hoc analysis using the standard Amsel criteria are closer to reality. The latter also confirmed the noninferiority of dequalinium chloride (difference, −0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −8.9 to 8.7 percentage points; P < .001). In this study, the clinical cure rates for both treatments are higher than those found in previous reports. This finding could be because most patients had 3 or fewer vaginal infections in the previous year, so pathogens were largely unexposed to previous treatments and potentially more susceptible. The validity of the study results, however, is supported by the trial design and execution, comparable baseline characteristics, and few missing data.

### Home screening for bacterial vaginosis to prevent sexually transmitted diseases [^116SJv3s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Longitudinal studies have consistently found a significant association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases. However, there are limited prospective data to confirm these findings.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label trial of home screening and treatment of young women with asymptomatic BV who were also at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. These women were screened every 2 months for 12 months and randomized to treatment with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or observation alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia.

Results

A total of 1365 subjects were enrolled in the study across 10 sites. Adherence with mailing specimens obtained at home was excellent in both groups (84%-88%). The incidence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia was 19.1 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 15.1–22.1) for the treatment group and 18.5 per 100 person-years (15.1–22.8) for the observation arm, a difference that was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Young women were very amenable to home screening for BV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Treatment of asymptomatic BV with 1 week of oral metronidazole did not decrease the incidence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia.

Diagnostic Considerations BV can be diagnosed by using clinical criteria that smoothly coats the vaginal walls
- Clue cells on microscopic examination
- pH of vaginal fluid > 4. 5
- A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH. They can be performed on either clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens with results available in < 24 hours, depending on the availability of the molecular diagnostic platform. Five quantitative multiplex PCR assays are available: Max Vaginal Panel, Aptima BV, NuSwab VG, OneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR, and SureSwab BV.

The three laboratory-developed tests have to be internally validated before use for patient care yet have good sensitivity and specificity, similar to FDA-cleared assays. BV NAATs should be used among symptomatic women only because their accuracy is not well defined for asymptomatic women. Despite the availability of BV NAATs, traditional methods of BV diagnosis, including the Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and the Affirm VP III assay, remain useful for diagnosing symptomatic BV because of their lower cost and ability to provide a rapid diagnosis. Culture of G. vaginalis is not recommended as a diagnostic tool because it is not specific. 1020) are being investigated to determine their role in enhancing the likelihood of BV cure relative to approved therapies.

Studies have evaluated the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal Lactobacillus and other probiotic formulations to treat BV and restore normal vaginal microbiota; overall, no studies support these products as an adjunctive or replacement therapy for women with BV. 1050). Therefore, routine screening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at high or low risk for preterm delivery for preventing preterm birth is not recommended.
