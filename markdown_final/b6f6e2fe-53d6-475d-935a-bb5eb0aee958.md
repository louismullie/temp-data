## Question

What is the most recent data on clarizanib and COVID-19?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the most recent data on clarizanib and COVID-19, and what to recommend if none exists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "clarizanib" appears anywhere in the supplied FDA, guideline, or trial materials. Then, I should consider potential name confusion or misspelling that could explain the absence. Next, I will review the established, evidence-based COVID-19 therapeutics and guideline positions to frame clinical recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize conclusions and outline pragmatic next steps while maintaining safety and regulatory context aligned with FDA/IDSA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the core finding: I searched across the provided FDA EUAs/labels, IDSA guidelines, and key summaries of COVID-19 therapeutics and did not find any mention of a product named "clarizanib". Wait, let me verify the scope of the sources I'm relying on here — these documents clearly cover authorized or approved antivirals and immunomodulators such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, pemivibart, and vilobelimab, yet none reference clarizanib, which strongly argues it is not part of current authorized or guideline-recognized options in these materials [^113xZ7dN] [^116z6cao] [^1146KBUz] [^116JZvHK] [^116HrTcM].

> Hold on, I should verify whether "clarizanib" could be a misspelling or name confusion. Initially, I wondered if this might be "clarithromycin", but that is a macrolide antibiotic used for community-acquired pneumonia and is not an established therapy for COVID-19 in the provided guidance; furthermore, moxifloxacin was compared against high-dose clarithromycin for CAP, reinforcing that these are antibacterial comparators unrelated to authorized COVID-19 therapeutics, so that line of thought appears off-target on second pass [^111nPWak] [^116C8pGD]. Hmm, wait a minute, what if the suffix "-nib" implies a kinase inhibitor like baricitinib; yes, that's plausible mechanistically, but here we do have baricitinib explicitly addressed, while "clarizanib" itself still does not appear anywhere in these sources, and relying on suffix inference alone would be speculative and inappropriate for clinical decision-making [^114wtous]. I should also note that macrolides such as azithromycin carry QT liability and are not guideline-recommended for COVID-19 treatment in the provided materials, which further cautions against extrapolating unrelated antibiotics into COVID-19 care without evidence [^115LT7pR].

> Next, I should review the therapies with demonstrated benefit for outpatients at risk for progression. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is FDA approved for high-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 and reduced hospitalization or death in EPIC-HR; IDSA recommends initiation within 5 days of symptom onset with renal dosing adjustments, which I should always double-check before prescribing [^113xZ7dN] [^115f4Nvu]. Let me verify the comparative effectiveness signal: the BMJ network meta-analysis found that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and remdesivir probably reduce hospital admissions in non-severe disease, which is consistent with the FDA labels and IDSA positioning, supporting their use over unreferenced compounds like "clarizanib" for which no data are presented here [^notfound].

> I will now examine inpatient and inflammatory-phase therapies. Baricitinib has placebo-controlled phase 3 data and is addressed in FDA labeling for hospitalized COVID-19, often in combination with remdesivir or other background care; tocilizumab has supportive data from the RECOVERY platform in severe COVID-19; and vilobelimab has an EUA for adults on IMV/ECMO within 48 hours, which I need to match carefully to the illness stage and respiratory support requirements [^114wtous] [^113uiLsW] [^116HrTcM]. Let me also ensure the pathophysiology-stage alignment is correct: evidence syntheses emphasize an early viral replication phase versus a later inflammatory phase, guiding when antivirals versus immunomodulators may have greater impact, so I should avoid conflating indications and timing when selecting agents [^1164Z5M6].

> Next, I should review prevention in the immunocompromised. Pemivibart (Pemgarda) carries an EUA as pre-exposure prophylaxis for those unlikely to mount adequate vaccine responses; it does not replace vaccination and is not authorized for treatment, which I need to confirm with patients during shared decision-making to avoid misuse [^116JZvHK] [^116j79oW]. But wait, I must also remember variant susceptibility can change; susceptibility drift can limit monoclonal effectiveness, so continual surveillance and updated recommendations are essential when planning prophylaxis strategies [^11252tY4].

> Let me synthesize the regulatory and safety context now. I should confirm that remdesivir is fully FDA-approved for hospitalized patients and for high-risk non-hospitalized patients, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is FDA-approved for high-risk adults, whereas molnupiravir remains under EUA with explicit limitations; none of these documents provide any authorization or even mention of "clarizanib", which argues against off-label consideration absent independent evidence of safety, efficacy, and interactions [^116z6cao] [^113xZ7dN] [^1146KBUz]. I need to ensure guideline concordance in my recommendations; IDSA guidance favors authorized antivirals in the appropriate window and discourages unproven agents, aligning with the absence of "clarizanib" in these materials [^115f4Nvu].

> Now, I should outline practical next steps. First, I will double-check the spelling and whether "clarizanib" is an investigational compound too new to appear in these 2024–2025 references, and if so, I would search ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed for emerging data before making any clinical inferences. Second, I must confirm eligibility and dosing for proven agents, remembering that underuse remains common and that renal adjustments for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir require careful reconciliation of drug–drug interactions and timing within 5 days of symptom onset [^116HVxTj] [^113KMK6C]. Third, if a novel agent is being considered under a trial or compassionate framework, I should consult institutional review and infectious disease pharmacology colleagues to ensure appropriate oversight and patient safety [^112YJtzt].

> Finally, the clinical implication is straightforward: without any mention of "clarizanib" in these FDA, IDSA, or trial summaries, I should not recommend its use for COVID-19 outside a rigorously governed study and should instead rely on therapies with demonstrated benefit and clear regulatory guidance; likewise, I should avoid ineffective or discouraged options such as ivermectin as outlined by IDSA, reinforcing a disciplined, evidence-based approach [^111J8RVj] [^113aLK7s].

- **COVID-19**:

The efficacy and safety of baricitinib were assessed in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials:

- **COVID I (NCT04401579)**: This trial evaluated the combination of baricitinib 4 mg plus remdesivir compared to placebo plus remdesivir.
- **COVID II (NCT04421027)**: This trial evaluated baricitinib 4 mg compared to placebo. Patients could remain on background therapy, as defined per local guidelines. An additional exploratory sub-study in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO at baseline was also conducted under this protocol and analyzed separately.

- **COVID I Study**:

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT04401579) conducted on hospitalized adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared treatment with baricitinib plus remdesivir (n = 515) to placebo plus remdesivir (n = 518). Patients had to have laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as at least one of the following to be enrolled in the trial: radiographic infiltrates by imaging, SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, a requirement for supplemental oxygen, or a requirement for mechanical ventilation or ECMO. Patients treated with the combination received the following regimen:

Baricitinib 4 mg once daily (orally) for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first.
Remdesivir 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily (via intravenous infusion) on subsequent days for a total treatment duration of 10 days or until hospital discharge.

In this study, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) was recommended for all patients unless a major contraindication existed.

### Actemra ActPen [^113uiLsW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group conducted a study to assess the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. This randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study was executed in the United Kingdom, focusing on patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the ACTEMRA portion of the study demonstrated clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection without medical contraindications to any treatments. They exhibited progressive COVID-19, defined as oxygen saturation below 92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, along with CRP levels of 75 mg/L or greater.

Patients were randomized to receive either the standard of care (SoC) or intravenous ACTEMRA at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage in addition to SoC. Efficacy analyses targeted the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of 4116 adult patients, divided into ACTEMRA + SoC (n = 2022) and SoC (n = 2094) arms. The mean age of participants was 64 years, ranging from 20 to 101. Of these, 67% were male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% required low flow oxygen, 41% needed non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Moreover, 82% were receiving systemic corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to…

### Evaluating the utilisation patterns of pharmacological therapy in COVID-19 patients: An ecological study in Italy [^114zo2GR]. BMJ Public Health (2025). Low credibility.

Evaluating how and which drugs were used to treat COVID patients in hospital and community settings provides important information about the progress of the pandemic, clinical management by health authorities, as well as the ability of clinical practice to act in situations of uncertainty and adapt to rapidly changing evidence. In this regard, studies have been conducted to assess prescribing profiles for hospitalized COVID patients or COVID outpatients, but never before our study had the treatment of COVID patients as a whole been studied simultaneously in both settings.

As reported by Alvarez et al, during the first weeks of the pandemic in Spain, more than 70% of patients hospitalized with COVID infection had received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, or azithromycin, mostly in combination. A study describing the drug utilization patterns over time in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States during 2021 showed that the most common treatment regimens were represented by corticosteroids in monotherapy and by the association of steroids/remdesivir. Its use follows the hospitalization trend, and the treatment regimens evaluated are consistent with NIH guidelines.

The study conducted in the outpatient setting showed that, for COVID-19 outpatients, in some Italian regions, the most prescribed therapies were based on the antibiotic agent (mostly azithromycin) combined with corticosteroids, also combined with antithrombotics or vitamin D. The prescription of hydroxychloroquine was limited to the first months. Unlike ours, these studies are able to observe drugs directly dispensed to COVID patients.

### Paxlovid [^116zMFFx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Efficacy in subjects at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (EPIC-HR)**: EPIC-HR (NCT04960202) was a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in non-hospitalized symptomatic adult subjects with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eligible subjects were 18 years of age and older with at least one of the following risk factors for progression to severe disease: diabetes, overweight (BMI > 25), chronic lung disease (including asthma), chronic kidney disease, smoker, immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, active cancer, medically related technological dependence, or were 60 years of age and older regardless of comorbidities. Subjects with COVID-19 symptom onset of ≤ 5 days were included in the study.

	- **Subjects were randomized (1**:1) to receive PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The trial excluded individuals with a history of prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination and excluded individuals taking any medications with clinically significant drug interactions with PAXLOVID. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28. The analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody [mAb] treatment).

### Pemgarda [^114cpQGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA to help prevent COVID-19 does not replace COVID-19 vaccination for individuals who are eligible for vaccination. If recommended by your healthcare provider, you should receive a COVID-19 vaccination prior to receiving PEMGARDA.

You should wait at least two weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine before getting PEMGARDA.

- **Before receiving PEMGARDA**:
	- Inform your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:
	- Have any allergies, especially a history of severe allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine or PEMGARDA.
	- Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, as it is unknown if PEMGARDA can harm an unborn baby.
	- Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed; it is not known if PEMGARDA passes into breast milk. Discuss the best feeding options for your baby with your healthcare provider.
	- Have any serious illnesses.
	- Take any medications, including prescription, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.

- **Administration of PEMGARDA**:
	- You will receive one dose of PEMGARDA through an intravenous (IV) infusion, which will take about 60 minutes to complete. The infusion will be administered in a healthcare setting where you will be monitored by a healthcare provider during the infusion and for at least two hours following its completion.

### Drug treatments for mild or moderate covid-19: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117UK4Ah]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of treatments for mild or moderate (non-severe) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted, sourcing data from the COVID-19 Living Overview of Evidence (COVID-19 L-OVE) repository by the Epistemonikos Foundation, a public and living repository of COVID-19 articles. The analysis covered the period from 1 January 2023 to 19 May 2024. Additionally, the search included the WHO COVID-19 database (up to 17 February 2023) and six Chinese databases (up to 20 February 2021). Studies included were identified between 1 December 2019 and 28 June 2023.

Randomized clinical trials were selected where individuals with suspected, probable, or confirmed mild or moderate COVID-19 were assigned to receive drug treatment or standard care/placebo. Two reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. After data abstraction, a Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed. The risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Following GRADE guidance, drug treatments were classified from most to least beneficial or harmful for each outcome.

Of 259 trials enrolling 166,230 patients, 187 (72%) were included in the final analysis. Compared with standard care, two drugs, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir, probably reduce hospital admissions, with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reducing admissions by 25 fewer per 1,000 patients (95% confidence interval: 28 fewer to 20 fewer), reflecting moderate certainty.

### Columvi [^112ivGSZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Of the 154 patients who initiated study treatment, 145 received COLUMVI; nine patients (6%) did not receive COLUMVI due to infection, progressive disease, or patient decision. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of COLUMVI, with 30% receiving all 12 cycles.

For patients who received COLUMVI, the median age was 66 years (range: 21 to 90 years); 66% were male; 77% were White, 4.8% were Asian, 1.4% were Black or African American, and 6% were Hispanic or Latino. The main diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS) and large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) arising from follicular lymphoma.

- **Serious adverse reactions**: Occurred in 48% of patients who received COLUMVI. Reactions in ≥ 2% of patients included cytokine release syndrome (CRS), COVID-19 infection, sepsis, and tumor flare. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients, due to COVID-19 infection (3.4%), sepsis (1.4%), and delirium (0.6%).

- **Adverse reaction outcomes**: Led to permanent discontinuation of COLUMVI in 7% of patients, with causes including infection, delirium, neutropenia, and CRS. Dose interruptions of COLUMVI occurred in 19% of patients, most frequently (≥ 2%) due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

- **Common adverse reactions**: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%), excluding laboratory terms, were CRS, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 20%) were decreases in lymphocyte count, phosphate, and neutrophil count, as well as increases in uric acid and decreases in fibrinogen.

Clinically relevant adverse reactions occurred in less than 10% of patients who received COLUMVI.

### Azithromycin [^117JZqN7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia conducted in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. Among the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 277 patients assessed at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial conducted in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluated for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 84 patients assessed at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was conducted on baseline and final visit specimens. The combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates obtained from the evaluable groups were:

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were meticulously analyzed.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus, and you can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. It is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Choosing immunomodulating therapies for the treatment of COVID-19: Recommendations based on placebo-controlled trial evidence [^111Zrt4A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

Immunomodulatory therapy has been extensively studied in randomized clinical trials for the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with inconsistent findings. Guideline committees, reviewing the same clinical trial data, have generated different recommendations for immunomodulatory therapy.

- **Objectives**: We hypothesize that trial design differences, specifically whether the study utilized an open-label or placebo-controlled design, accounted for the inconsistent mortality effects reported in clinical trials of immunomodulator therapies for COVID-19.

- **Sources**: We reviewed COVID-19 treatment guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We identified the meta-analyses associated with glucocorticoids, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK kinase inhibitors, and complement C5a inhibitors that were available to the guideline authors at the time recommendations were either made or updated.

- **Content**: We identified a meta-analysis for each of the immunomodulator classes included in COVID-19 treatment guidelines: glucocorticoids [WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group], IL-6 antagonists [WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group; Shankar-Hari M, Vale CL, Godolphin PJ, Fisher D, Higgins JPT, et al.] and others on the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists and mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: A meta-analysis.

### Drug treatments for mild or moderate covid-19: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1164Z5M6]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

As of November 2024, more than seven million people have died with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The evidence on COVID-19 continues to evolve as global efforts to identify effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 have resulted in more than 8000 completed or ongoing trials.

Summarizing the rapidly growing evidence base has proved challenging. Network meta-analysis, rather than pairwise meta-analysis, provides useful information about the comparative effectiveness of treatments that have not been tested head-to-head. The lack of such direct comparisons can otherwise limit our understanding of important comparisons, and the incorporation of indirect evidence can strengthen evidence in comparisons that were tested head-to-head.

The evidence supports two stages of COVID-19 disease: an early phase marked by viral replication (non-severe disease) and a later inflammatory phase (severe disease). The different pathogenesis and resulting severity of symptoms at each of these stages suggest different interventions are most effective at certain stages of the disease. Consequently, our systematic review and network meta-analysis now addresses patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 (also known as non-severe COVID-19), separate from those with severe COVID-19. In this publication, we compare the effects of drug treatments for mild or moderate COVID-19. A separate publication will compare the effects of drug treatments for severe or critical COVID-19, and together these two publications replace our previous living systematic review.

### Mental illness and COVID-19 vaccination: A multinational investigation of observational & register-based data [^1175K6Tq]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Individuals with mental illness are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, previous studies on the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in this population have reported conflicting results. Using data from seven cohort studies (N = 325,298) included in the multinational COVIDMENT consortium and the Swedish registers (N = 8,080,234), this study investigates the association between mental illness (defined using self-report measures, clinical diagnosis, and prescription data) and COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Results from the COVIDMENT cohort studies were pooled using meta-analyses, the majority of which showed no significant association between mental illness and vaccination uptake. In the Swedish register study population, we observed a very small reduction in the uptake of both the first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine among individuals with vs. without mental illness; the reduction was, however, greater among those not using psychiatric medication. Here we show that uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is generally high among individuals both with and without mental illness. However, the lower levels of vaccination uptake observed among subgroups of individuals with unmedicated mental illness warrant further attention.

### Summary of who infection prevention and control guideline for COVID-19: Striving for evidence based practice in infection prevention and control [^114G9Aai]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) published the seventh version of the infection prevention and control guideline for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2023. The revision and development process undertaken for this guideline consolidates and updates technical guidance developed and published at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–21) into a single guideline, following WHO guideline development processes.

The updated guideline considered the context of COVID-19, the latest evidence supporting infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions, epidemiological trends, the emergence of variants of concern, population immunity, availability and uptake of vaccines, and indoor environmental conditions.

This article provides an overview of the guideline development process and summarizes the recommendations from WHO for IPC measures when caring for people with or managing COVID-19 outbreaks.

- **What you need to know**: WHO has published an updated guideline for infection prevention and control in the context of COVID-19. In the healthcare facility, WHO recommends consistent application of standard and transmission-based precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In community settings, WHO recommends mitigation measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and its impact.

### The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection among pregnant women and its relationship with pregnancy outcomes: a retrospective review of the medical records in North EAST Iran [^1171epMp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

More studies were conducted as the pandemic continued. A meta-analysis which reviewed 52 studies reported that the rate of maternal mortality, stillbirth, and birth weight did not increase during the pandemic compared to the previous period. Moreover, in a retrospective study, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increasing probability of maternal death during childbirth, hospitalization, cardiovascular complications, and postpartum hemorrhage.

Since COVID-19 is recently emerged, there is insufficient information about its impact on pregnancy. Data is not sufficient to determine whether pregnancy increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, more information is required. Due to the concerns regarding the possible impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy outcomes, it is suggested to plan prenatal and postnatal care for women with COVID-19 and obtain the necessary preparations. However, more studies are needed.

Although there are few systematic reviews on this topic, there is still a knowledge gap in large population studies, which can yield vital new evidence in this regard. Retrospective record reviews have long been recognized as a rigorous methodology with many advantages. Examining clinical records is a very useful way to answer clinical questions and plays an essential role in advancing health research. The present study is a retrospective record review of a large Iranian population. Indeed, retrospective record review is a systematic review of existing medical records, typically used to understand…

### Favorable impact of azithromycin on patients in the intensive care unit with coronavirus disease 2019: Insights from the first wave using a Japanese database [^11354xuS]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Azithromycin has favorable effects on critical respiratory diseases owing to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, azithromycin was frequently administered before specific treatments were developed. However, the efficacy of this treatment has not been verified. We retrospectively investigated the effects of its intravenous (IV) administration in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 using the National Administrative Database of Japan during the first wave (February-April 2020).

- **Methods**: Patients were categorized based on whether they received IV azithromycin within three days of hospitalization. An overlap weighting method with estimated propensity scores was used to reduce bias.

- **Results**: Among the 830 patients with severe/critical COVID-19, 148 (17.8%) received azithromycin, and 682 (82.2%) did not. After adjustment, the use of azithromycin was associated with a shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) management (-3.48 days, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.59 to -2.38). However, other endpoints, including mortality rate, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospital stay, did not suggest any associations. Furthermore, of the 115 ICU patients, 27 (23.5%) were treated with IV azithromycin and 88 (76.5%) were not. After adjustment, azithromycin was associated with favorable outcomes, including reduced in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.92), 30-day mortality (OR, 0.46, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.94), and a shorter duration of intensive care.

### Underuse of antiviral drugs to prevent progression to severe COVID-19 - Veterans Health Administration, March-September 2022 [^116HVxTj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). High credibility.

Antiviral drugs reduce the rate of progression to severe COVID-19 when given to patients with mild-to-moderate disease within 5 days of symptom onset. Despite being recommended for patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 due to age or chronic conditions, reported antiviral use among the general adult population has been ≤ 35%. To ascertain reasons for the underuse of antiviral medications to prevent severe COVID-19 and propose interventions accordingly, a detailed review was conducted of 110 Veterans Health Administration patients with mild-to-moderate infection who were at high risk for progression due to underlying conditions, such as organ transplantation or hematologic malignancies, and did not receive an antiviral drug. Among these 110 patients, all of whom had received the COVID-19 vaccine, 22 (20.0%) were offered treatment but declined, and 88 (80.0%) were not offered treatment.

- **Provider reasons**: Among the 88 patients not offered treatment, reasons included symptom duration of > 5 days (22.7%), concern about possible drug interactions (5.7%), or absence of symptoms (22.7%). However, for nearly half (43 of 88; 48.9%) of these patients, no reason other than mild symptoms was given. Among 24 (55.8%) of those 43 patients, follow-up was limited to telephone calls to report test results and inquire about symptom evolution, with no documentation of treatment being offered.

These findings suggest that education of patients, providers, and medical personnel tasked with follow-up calls, combined with advance planning in the event of a positive test result, might improve the rate of antiviral use.

### Levofloxacin [^116V3AGj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adult inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were evaluated in two pivotal clinical studies.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia: 7 to 14 day treatment regimen**: In the first study, 590 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, unblinded randomized trial comparing levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, orally or intravenously, for 7 to 14 days to ceftriaxone 1 to 2 grams intravenously, once or in equally divided doses twice daily, followed by cefuroxime axetil 500 mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 to 14 days. Patients assigned to treatment with the control regimen were allowed to receive erythromycin (or doxycycline if intolerant of erythromycin) if an infection due to atypical pathogens was suspected or proven. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed during treatment, 5 to 7 days post-therapy, and 3 to 4 weeks post-therapy. Clinical success, defined as cure plus improvement, with levofloxacin at 5 to 7 days post-therapy, the primary efficacy variable in this study, was superior at 95% compared to the control group at 83%. The 95% confidence interval for the difference of response rates (levofloxacin minus comparator) was [-6, 19].

In the second study, 264 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, non-comparative trial of 500 mg levofloxacin administered orally or intravenously once daily for 7 to 14 days. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 93%. For both studies, the clinical success rate in patients with atypical pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila was 96%.

### The infectious diseases society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: Antigen testing (January 2023) [^115xiLGK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens (Ag) are commonly used to diagnose COVID-19. The most widely used tests are lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Ag assays have also been developed. The number of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag detection tests has increased rapidly, as has the COVID-19 diagnostic literature.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best-practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is an update to the third in a series of frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by the IDSA. IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and nonmedical settings.

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. A review of relevant, peer-reviewed published literature was conducted through 1 April 2022. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel made 10 diagnostic recommendations.

### Unlocking the power of 3D convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 detection: A comprehensive review [^112HSCAN]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The advent of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) has revolutionized the detection and analysis of COVID-19 cases. As imaging technologies have advanced, 3D CNNs have emerged as a powerful tool for segmenting and classifying COVID-19 in medical images. These networks have demonstrated both high accuracy and rapid detection capabilities, making them crucial for effective COVID-19 diagnostics.

This study offers a thorough review of various 3D CNN algorithms, evaluating their efficacy in segmenting and classifying COVID-19 across a range of medical imaging modalities. It systematically examines recent advancements in 3D CNN methodologies. The process involved a comprehensive screening of abstracts and titles to ensure relevance, followed by a meticulous selection and analysis of research papers from academic repositories.

The study evaluates these papers based on specific criteria and provides detailed insights into the network architectures and algorithms used for COVID-19 detection. It reveals significant trends in the use of 3D CNNs for COVID-19 segmentation and classification. Key findings include the diverse range of networks employed for COVID-19 detection compared to other diseases, which predominantly utilize encoder/decoder frameworks.

The study provides an in-depth analysis of these methods, discussing their strengths, limitations, and potential areas for future research. It reviewed a total of 60 papers published across various repositories, including Springer and Elsevier.

### Risk factors for the mortality of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 in northern Hunan province, China [^111mJwx4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

The globally widespread coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan province, China, in December 2019 and is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Older hemodialysis patients and those with obvious comorbidities are reported to be more susceptible to severe viral and bacterial respiratory infections, as has been shown with COVID-19. Mortality in the hemodialysis population with COVID-19 is dramatically high and also comes from chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension; these patients have higher mobility, aggregation, and a weaker immune system than the general population.

The latest data display that the global mortality rate of COVID-19 dropped from 3.85% in June 2020 to 0.35% in October 2022. During the same period, the mortality rate of the United States decreased from 3.82% to 0.26%, and that of China from 2.81% to 0.12%. Germany's rate decreased from 9.43% to 0.27%, and Japan's from 3.44% to 0.13%. All the above countries, except China, have reopened. The death rate of dialysis patients complicated with the novel coronavirus accounts for 20% to 30% of the total death rate of the novel coronavirus.

On December 1, 2022, all parts of the country began to implement the policy of epidemic prevention and development. China's Hunan province opened to the public on December 10, but there is little information on trends in its mortality rate.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^116C8pGD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Community acquired pneumonia**: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the US to compare the efficacy of moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily) to that of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community-acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 474 patients (382 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 14 to 35 day follow-up visit). Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 95% (184/194) for moxifloxacin and 95% (178/188) for high-dose clarithromycin.

Another randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in the US and Canada to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral fluoroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community-acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 516 patients, 362 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 7 to 30 day post-therapy visit. The clinical success rate was 86% (157/182) for moxifloxacin therapy and 89% (161/180) for the fluoroquinolone comparators.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: Perspectives and lessons learned [^112YJtzt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

- **Methods**: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

- **Recommendations**: The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illnesses are mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. Older people, and people of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like immune compromise, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

### The infectious diseases society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: Molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^111nCArt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and for identifying asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The number of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests continues to increase, as does the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests.

In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss nuances of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing. IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations. Access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention, and the public health response to COVID-19 infection. Information on the clinical performance of available tests continues.

### Orchestra Delphi consensus: Clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with HIV [^1169oLRC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Low credibility.

The interaction between HIV and COVID-19 resulted in a syndemic that showed an excess burden of disease for people with HIV (PWH). Four years into the COVID-19 pandemic have raised many unsolved questions about the optimal care of COVID-19 in PWH.

- **Methods**: We performed a study using a three-round Delphi methodology involving a panel of physicians with expertise in HIV and COVID-19 infections. The main aim of the study was to provide recommendations on critical clinical issues of COVID-19 among PWH and to inform physicians and policymakers for improving care and prevention of COVID-19 in PWH. A total of 27 questions were conceived, focusing on four main areas of interest in the management of COVID-19 in PWH. A panel of 34 experts in HIV and COVID-19 care expressed their level of agreement on each item. Questions that received agreement/disagreement ≥ 79.4% of panelists were identified, and statements were generated accordingly.

- **Results**: Consensus was reached on 19 out of 27 items, resulting in 18 final statements. These statements addressed: (a) risk of COVID-19 progression to severe disease among PWH; (b) COVID-19 diagnostics and laboratory procedures; (c) early treatments with antivirals and/or monoclonal antibodies; (d) use of corticosteroids; and (e) COVID-19 preventive strategies.

- **Discussion**: This consensus study guides infectious diseases physicians in making decisions regarding the care of PWH for COVID-19, where results from the scientific literature are limited or conflicting.

### Lower mortality risk associated with remdesivir + dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^111XLpiZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

COVID-19 remains a threat to lives, especially in patients who are immunocompromised, elderly, or have comorbidities. Additionally, it is a burden to health systems worldwide, with more than 75,000 deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States in 2023. Therefore, there is a continuing need to improve our treatment approach and to optimize our choice of treatment options based on the evolving evidence throughout the endemic COVID-19 era.

Much of the more commonly cited evidence regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 therapies and clinical treatment decisions is based on data obtained during the early stages of the pandemic, even though the evidence has evolved considerably. NIH guidelines, updated for the final time on 29 February 2024, suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against remdesivir use in patients who require IMV/ECMO. However, in this final update, some NIH panelists recommended adding remdesivir to immunomodulator therapy in patients recently placed on IMV/ECMO who are immunocompromised, have evidence of ongoing viral replication, or are within 10 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Retrospective analyses utilizing RWD can help clarify and support updates to COVID-19 treatment guidelines.

The most frequent serious infections have been appendicitis, COVID-19 infection (including pneumonia), and sepsis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, multi-dermatomal herpes zoster was reported with Litfulo.

Avoid the use of Litfulo in patients with an active, serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Litfulo in patients:

- **Chronic or reinfection**: Evaluate the patient's history.
- **Exposure to TB**: Take into account any past exposures.
- **History of serious infection or opportunistic infection**: Assess vulnerability and risks.
- **Residing or traveling in areas of endemic TB or mycoses**: Be cautious and evaluate history thoroughly.
- **Underlying conditions**: Consider conditions that may predispose patients to infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Litfulo. Interrupt Litfulo if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Litfulo should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. Litfulo may be resumed once the infection is controlled.

- **Tuberculosis**: Screen patients for tuberculosis (TB) before starting therapy. Litfulo should not be given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be started prior to initiating therapy with Litfulo in patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or previously untreated latent TB.

### Paxlovid [^115peikQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Viral RNA rebound and treatment-emergent substitutions**: EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR were not designed to evaluate COVID-19 rebound; exploratory analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between Paxlovid use and rebound in viral RNA shedding levels. Post-treatment increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples were observed on Day 10 and/or Day 14 in a subset of Paxlovid and placebo recipients in EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. The frequency of detection of post-treatment viral RNA rebound varied according to analysis parameters but was generally similar among Paxlovid and placebo recipients. A similar or smaller percentage of placebo recipients compared to Paxlovid recipients had nasopharyngeal viral RNA results < lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at all study timepoints in both the treatment and post-treatment periods. In EPIC-HR, of 59 Paxlovid-treated subjects identified with post-treatment viral RNA rebound and with available viral sequence data, treatment-emergent substitutions in Mpro potentially reducing nirmatrelvir activity were detected in 2 (3%) subjects, including E166V in 1 subject and T304I in 1 subject. Both subjects had viral RNA shedding levels < LLOQ by Day 14. Post-treatment viral RNA rebound was not associated with the primary clinical outcome of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 following the single 5-day course of Paxlovid treatment. The clinical relevance of post-treatment increases in viral RNA following Paxlovid or placebo treatment is unknown.

### Summary of who infection prevention and control guideline for Covid-19: Striving for evidence based practice in infection prevention and control [^111JLcKn]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Throughout the pandemic response (January 2020 to May 2023), WHO's processes for developing guidance on infection prevention and control (IPC) for Covid-19 evolved. Initially, WHO developed emergency interim IPC guidance to provide advice on emerging issues and address the evolving scientific evidence. This emergency interim guidance was developed rapidly, following a guideline development process that differed from the standard WHO guideline development process.

Beginning in December 2021, the standard WHO requirements for guideline development were followed, and a comprehensive guideline was published, which consolidated and updated earlier emergency guidance. Since December 2021, seven versions of this consolidated guideline have been published.

### Lagevrio [^117CNhpB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lagevrio is not approved for any use, including for the treatment of COVID-19. Prior to initiating treatment with Lagevrio, carefully consider the known and potential risks and benefits [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Lagevrio is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of Lagevrio under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

### Pemgarda [^116p1NRP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Justification for emergency use of drugs during the COVID‑19 pandemic: There is currently an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) caused by SARS‑CoV‑2, a novel coronavirus. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has determined that there is a public health emergency, or significant potential for a public health emergency [1]. The Secretary has declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 [2].

An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is an FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product (i.e. drug, biological product, or device) in the United States under certain circumstances. These include, but are not limited to, when the Secretary of HHS declares a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, involving biological agent(s) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s).

- **Criteria for issuing an EUA**:
	- The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
	- Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
	- The known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks.

### Effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to prevent infections in planned vaginal births in low-income and middle-income countries: a post-hoc analysis of data from a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113cpPGL]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The study A-PLUS (post-hoc analysis) was published in 2025 in the journal Lancet Global Health. This study focused on infections related to vaginal delivery. In the A-PLUS trial, the primary question was: What is the role of intrapartum azithromycin in preventing infections in women planning vaginal delivery? The study utilized a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial design, involving 29,278 female patients.

The inclusion criteria included women in labor at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation planning a vaginal delivery. Key exclusion criteria encompassed non-emancipated minors, evidence of chorioamnionitis or other infections requiring antibiotic therapy, arrhythmia, known history of cardiomyopathy, allergy to azithromycin or other macrolides, receipt of azithromycin, erythromycin, or other macrolide ≤ 3 days before randomization, and planned Cesarean delivery.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Azithromycin**: n = 14,590 (a single intrapartum oral dose of 2 g)
	- **Placebo**: n = 14,688 (matching placebo)

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in any maternal infection was observed (4% vs. 5.6%; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant decrease in maternal death or infection was noted (4% vs. 5.7%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.8).
	- No significant difference was found in any neonatal infection (15.1% vs. 15%; RR 1.01, 95% CI).

How do I report side effects or adverse events with Gohibic? Contact your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Report side effects to FDA MedWatch at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1–800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to InflaRx GmbH by calling 1–888–254–0602.

How can I learn more about COVID-19? Ask your healthcare provider. Visit https://www.cdc.gov/COVID19. Contact your local or state public health department.

What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? The United States FDA has made Gohibic available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gohibic, as a treatment for COVID-19, has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product for this indication. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling, and may be effective in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Drug treatments for mild or moderate covid-19: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113aLK7s]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

Several interventions, including ACEi/ARB, aspirin, colchicine, fluvoxamine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and lopinavir-ritonavir, do not seem to result in a benefit for any patient-important outcomes. Lopinavir-ritonavir, in particular, increases the risk of adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation and prolongs the length of hospital stay.

- **Strengths and limitations of this review**: Our review includes studies from various stages of the pandemic, with many trials conducted earlier, before the deployment of vaccines and when covid-19 had worse outcomes. To ensure that our results remain applicable, we consulted with the WHO guideline panel to choose baseline risks (non-severe, moderate risk) most reflective of this population. Additionally, while our included studies encompass patients infected with different covid-19 variants, we do not believe this importantly affects our results as, to our knowledge, no substantial evidence suggests that viral subtype is an effect modifier of any included drugs. Some of the included drugs have downsides not captured in this review; however, further details can be found in the guideline. For example, molnupiravir could be carcinogenic, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has many critical drug-drug interactions, and remdesivir is administered intravenously. Thus, while this review provides an overview of the evidence, individual considerations — such as patient values and preferences, contraindications, drug-drug interactions, and drug-specific adverse events not included in this review — must be taken into account when making treatment decisions.

### Favipiravir for treating COVID-19 [^116qo9XD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus, continues to challenge the health workforce of countries across the globe. It also continues to have an appreciable adverse impact on the lives of people in all parts of the world.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) weekly update, there has been a steady reduction in new hospital admissions and deaths over the last few years. At the end of August 2021, there were 286,333 hospital admissions per week worldwide versus 17,576 in September 2023. Similarly, in August 2021, the daily worldwide death rate from COVID-19 was 17,935 versus 63 in September 2023. Currently, while most regions have reported a reduction in cases and deaths, the Western Pacific region alone is an exception, with increasing cases and deaths.

Testing criteria have been changing regularly from country to country, with a trend toward a lower rate of testing and, therefore, case detection. At the country level, the highest number of cases in the first half of 2023 occurred in the Republic of Korea, Australia, Singapore, Italy, and the UK.

### Azithromycin resistance patterns in Escherichia coli and Shigella before and after COVID-19, Kenya [^116CM72K]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

As with previous studies conducted in Kenya, acute bacterial enteric infections in this study were primarily caused by E. coli and Shigella spp. Although E. coli prevalence was slightly higher in the post-COVID-19 period, the increase was not significant (p > 0.05), suggesting a return to baseline circulation of enteric pathogens after the cessation of COVID-19 prevention measures. The largest increase in prevalence was observed among children under 18 years of age, possibly because of the reentry of immune-naive children into public spaces and schools, as has been hypothesized for other infectious diseases.

Notably, this study revealed that E. coli isolates from adults and children after the COVID-19 pandemic were five times more likely to be resistant to azithromycin than those isolated before the pandemic. Potential explanations for these increases include Kenya's insufficient antimicrobial regulation and suboptimal clinical use of antimicrobial drugs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The likelihood of encountering antimicrobial drugs is increased, which might enable resistance development. It is possible that the increases in azithromycin resistance observed in this study were part of the gradual increase in resistance patterns over time, but it is also possible resistance patterns were accelerated because of increased use of antimicrobial drugs, such as azithromycin, for viral respiratory infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Macrolide resistance genes, such as the mph(A) gene responsible for azithromycin resistance, are commonly found in E. coli.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk of depressive symptoms: A retrospective longitudinal study from the population-based CONSTANCES cohort [^115JGxxt]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

According to the hypothesis of a direct link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and depression, the gradient of depressive symptoms across the different COVID-19 status categories would follow the probability of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is arguably the lowest in participants who did not report COVID-19 (either suspected or biologically confirmed) and had negative SAPRIS serology test results, and the highest in those with biologically confirmed COVID-19, with an intermediate probability in those with self-reported, yet unconfirmed COVID-19. However, depressive symptoms were higher among subjects with self-reported unconfirmed COVID-19 than among subjects with biologically confirmed COVID-19.

One might argue that among those with biologically confirmed COVID-19, false positives in those who did not report COVID-19 but had positive SAPRIS serology test results could have diluted the effect. However, when splitting our population into four groups according to self-report and SAPRIS serology test results, only participants with self-reported COVID-19 but negative SAPRIS serology test results displayed higher levels of depressive symptoms than those without COVID-19. Participants with self-reported COVID-19 and positive SAPRIS serology test results did not, despite an undoubtedly higher probability of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results are consistent with studies by Thompson et al. and Davisse-Paturet et al.

One should keep in mind the clinical heterogeneity of the sample and the fact that few participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 may have experienced different outcomes.

### Remdesivir-associated survival outcomes among immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19: Real-world evidence from the Omicron-dominant era [^114Jv2Tf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Several barriers remain for appropriate antiviral utilization. A survey of Australasian infectious diseases (ID) specialists concluded that even ID specialists have varied approaches to managing COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients. One explanation for this could be the inconsistencies across different guidelines. The NIH guideline provided guidance on managing COVID-19 in hospitalized patients who are immunocompromised and incorporated real-world evidence into its recommendations. On the other hand, other international and national guidelines for COVID-19 lack information on this topic, provide only general commentary regarding the immunocompromised population, discuss only outpatient management of COVID-19, use strictly randomized clinical trials for their recommendations, or have not been updated with recent evidence.

Considering the continued risk of COVID-19 in this patient population, it is critical for the international and national guidelines, which are heavily consulted by both generalist and specialist practitioners, to incorporate comprehensive sections on managing COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients. The NIH updated its COVID-19 guideline for the last time on 29 February 2024 and deactivated the living guideline website on 16 August 2024. Thus, the only comprehensive guideline that addressed management of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients is neither up at the time of writing nor available for practitioners.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JSnbC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza was one of the most clinically burdensome respiratory viruses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 29 million cases, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths from influenza in the US during the 2018 to 2019 season. While COVID-19 led to a temporary reduction in infections, influenza is now expected to have a resurgence. Novel strains or a rise in a relatively less immune population could trigger an influenza pandemic resembling the crises experienced in 1968 or 2009. As such, the availability of safe and effective treatments is critical to avoid overwhelming health care systems and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a breakthrough in the COVID-19 pandemic occurred when outpatient randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in hospitalization and death. In contrast, despite the substantial threat that influenza poses, there are no evidence-based outpatient treatments proven to prevent the progression to hospitalization.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an antiviral that is commonly prescribed to outpatients with influenza to accelerate recovery and prevent complications. Detailing by key opinion leaders, guideline panels, and the manufacturer has even led to stockpiling of the medication as part of national pandemic responses. Yet, despite guideline recommendations and millions of doses prescribed, it is unclear whether oseltamivir reduces severe complications requiring hospitalization. Three prior systematic reviews (one independent and two supported by the manufacturer) have arrived at different conclusions regarding its efficacy.

### Pemgarda [^117Gqqbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For more information about the symptoms of COVID-19, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html.

If you develop COVID-19, your healthcare provider may recommend one of the available COVID-19 treatments.

- **Prevention choices**: Vaccines to help prevent COVID-19 are approved or available under Emergency Use Authorization. Use of PEMGARDA does not replace vaccination against COVID-19.
- **Decision regarding PEMGARDA**: It is your choice to receive or not receive PEMGARDA for pre-exposure prophylaxis to help prevent COVID-19. Should you decide not to receive PEMGARDA, it will not change your standard medical care.

- **Authorization limitations**: PEMGARDA is not authorized to treat COVID-19 or for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19.

- **Pregnancy or breastfeeding considerations**: There is no experience using PEMGARDA in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving PEMGARDA may be greater than the risk of using the product. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider.

### Azithromycin [^115LT7pR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens, such as *S. pneumoniae* and *S. aureus*. The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms, and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

Since the mean Cmax of azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hour is higher than the mean Cmax of azithromycin following the administration of a 1,500 mg oral dose, it is possible that QTc may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one-hour infusion of 500 mg.

### Using the 2024 National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine definition of long COVID: Implications for pulmonary and critical care medicine [^112N4BD6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Currently, the unknowns are far greater than the knowns regarding long COVID. The 2024 NASEM definition of long COVID serves as a scaffold on which we can build studies to better understand the burden and biological pathways that contribute to SARS-CoV-2–associated chronic conditions and the harms and benefits of potential interventions. Key considerations for the design of research in long COVID are outlined below.

- **Use the 2024 NASEM definition of long COVID**: The definition is intentionally broad. Researchers, however, are advised to use study inclusion and exclusion criteria to select the appropriate segment of the long COVID population that is fit for purpose. For example, for studies to understand SARS-CoV-2–associated postviral ILD, inclusion criteria should include results of imaging studies (including high-resolution chest computed tomography) that confirm findings consistent with ILD.

- **Report whether the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was "suspected", "probable", or "confirmed" (World Health Organization categorization)**: Many patients are now not being formally tested, with significant implications for the rising risk of misclassifying exposure (SARS-CoV-2 infection). However, for studies to understand the extent to which viral persistence contributes to the pathogenesis of long COVID or clinical trials of antiviral interventions, researchers may wish to limit participation to individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g. positive RT-PCR or positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test result during acute illness).
