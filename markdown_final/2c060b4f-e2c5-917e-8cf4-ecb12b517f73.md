## Question

What is the likelihood of getting Gonorrhea from receiving oral sex without a condom?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the likelihood of getting gonorrhea from receiving oral sex without a condom. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact exposure and outcome definitions. Then, I should verify the best available evidence on per-act risk and population-level attributable fractions. Next, I will consider modifiers such as partner number, age, and HIV/PrEP status. After that, I should review guideline implications for screening and prevention. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk estimate and counseling message, while noting uncertainties and what would change my conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the exposure and outcome. Receiving oral sex without a condom is receptive oro-penile contact, and the outcome is incident urethral gonorrhea in the receptive partner; I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with oropharyngeal infection in the insertive partner, which is a different question entirely [^2f0212d5].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality direct estimate. A case-control study of MSM found that 27.5% of gonococcal urethritis cases had the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure in the prior 60 days, and the population attributable risk percent for symptomatic gonococcal urethritis from oropharyngeal exposure was 33.8%, which suggests a substantial fraction of urethral gonorrhea in that population is attributable to receptive oral sex [^2f535075].

> Wait, let me verify whether a per-act estimate is available. A mathematical modeling analysis cited a per-act transmission probability of about 1% for oral sex, but I should be cautious because this figure is model-derived and not from a direct observational per-act study; still, it aligns with the epidemiologic signal that receptive oral sex carries a non-negligible risk, albeit lower than penetrative vaginal or anal sex [^4aef1346].

> I will now examine supportive clinic data. Among MSM who reported only receiving fellatio in the prior 3 months, urethral gonorrhea positivity was 4.1% and chlamydia 4.8%, which were similar to positivity among men reporting unprotected insertive anal sex; this supports the plausibility that receptive oral sex can transmit gonorrhea at meaningful rates in some populations [^df86cc7a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability. These data are largely from MSM cohorts and sexual health clinics, where background prevalence and partner number are higher; in lower-prevalence heterosexual populations, absolute risk from a single receptive oral exposure is likely lower, though still not zero, and I should emphasize that uncertainty when counseling patients [^2f0212d5].

> Let me consider modifiers. Risk rises with more partners, younger age, and concurrent STIs; importantly, oropharyngeal gonorrhea is frequently asymptomatic and can persist for weeks to months, which increases the chance of transmission to receptive partners and complicates partner management and reinfection risk [^2c9eeb05] [^f7cb62eb].

> Next, I should review guideline implications to ensure my counseling aligns with best practice. CDC recommends that MSM be screened at all exposed anatomic sites, including the pharynx, at least annually and every 3–6 months if risk behaviors persist, precisely because extragenital reservoirs drive transmission; this reinforces that receptive oral sex is a credible exposure route warranting screening and prevention counseling [^8c23b563] [^c65317c5].

> I need to check prevention strategies. Condoms during oral sex reduce exposure, though adherence is often low; for high-risk MSM, doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis within 72 hours after condomless sex reduces chlamydia and syphilis substantially and reduces gonorrhea by about 50%, which can meaningfully lower incident infections including those acquired via receptive oral sex [^36e7b8c5] [^75fd263d].

> Let me synthesize a practical risk estimate, keeping the caveats explicit. In MSM populations with moderate-to-high gonorrhea prevalence, receptive oral sex without a condom likely carries a per-act risk on the order of about 1% for urethral gonorrhea, and accounts for roughly one-third of symptomatic gonococcal urethritis cases; in lower-prevalence heterosexual settings, absolute risk per act is likely lower, perhaps substantially so, but a precise per-act estimate is not available and would depend heavily on partner prevalence and number of exposures [^4aef1346] [^2f535075].

> But wait, what if the patient is concerned about a single exposure? I should confirm that a single receptive oral exposure is not zero risk, especially if the partner has oropharyngeal gonorrhea, which is often silent; testing is reasonable if symptoms occur or if the patient prefers reassurance, and baseline STI screening is appropriate in sexually active patients with risk factors [^f7cb62eb] [^a3e05f66].

> Finally, I should double-check that my counseling is balanced. I will explain that receptive oral sex is lower risk than vaginal or anal sex but is not risk-free, that partner number and community prevalence strongly influence absolute risk, and that condoms, partner communication, and, for eligible MSM, doxyPEP can reduce risk; I will also tailor screening recommendations to anatomy, behavior, and local epidemiology, consistent with CDC guidance [^8c23b563] [^36e7b8c5].

The risk of getting gonorrhea from receiving oral sex without a condom is **low but not zero** [^2f0212d5]. The best available estimate suggests a **per-act risk around 1%** in high-prevalence populations, such as MSM, and lower in lower-prevalence groups [^4aef1346]. Risk varies with partner status, oral health, and exposure to saliva or ejaculate [^5162fdb5]. Because pharyngeal gonorrhea is often asymptomatic and persistent, screening is recommended for those with risk exposures, especially MSM and people with multiple partners [^8c23b563] [^2c9eeb05]. Condoms during oral sex reduce risk, and doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis can further lower incidence in high-risk groups [^b0deea53] [^36e7b8c5].

---

## Estimated risk of gonorrhea transmission via receptive oral sex

Quantitative estimates of gonorrhea transmission from receptive oral sex are limited; however, mathematical modeling and observational studies provide useful approximations. A modeling study estimated a **per-act transmission probability of approximately 1%** for receptive oral sex in MSM populations, where pharyngeal gonorrhea prevalence is higher [^4aef1346]. This estimate aligns with observational data showing measurable urethral gonorrhea positivity among men whose only exposure was receiving fellatio, with positivity around 4–5% in some cohorts, reflecting cumulative risk over multiple exposures rather than a single act [^df86cc7a].

---

## Factors influencing transmission risk

Several factors influence the **risk of acquiring gonorrhea** through receptive oral sex:

- **Partner's infection status**: The presence of pharyngeal gonorrhea in the insertive partner significantly increases risk [^2c9eeb05].
- **Saliva exposure**: Saliva containing viable N. gonorrhoeae can facilitate transmission, especially with ejaculation or prolonged exposure [^5162fdb5].
- **Oral health**: Gingival disease, ulcers, or mucosal breaks increase susceptibility by providing entry points for bacteria [^notfound].
- **Population prevalence**: Higher background prevalence in sexual networks (e.g. MSM, sex workers) elevates individual risk [^731da650].

---

## Comparison with other sexual activities

Receptive oral sex generally carries a **lower risk of gonorrhea transmission** than vaginal or anal intercourse, which have higher per-act transmission probabilities due to greater mucosal exposure and friction. However, the risk is not negligible, particularly in high-prevalence populations or with high-risk partners [^2f0212d5].

---

## Asymptomatic nature of pharyngeal gonorrhea

Pharyngeal gonorrhea is **often asymptomatic**, with up to 90% of cases lacking symptoms [^2c9eeb05]. This asymptomatic carriage facilitates ongoing transmission, as infected individuals may unknowingly expose partners through oral sex, kissing, or saliva exchange [^f3755f7f].

---

## Preventive measures

Effective strategies to **reduce the risk** of gonorrhea transmission during receptive oral sex include:

- **Condom use**: Consistent condom use during oral sex significantly reduces risk, though adherence is often low [^b0deea53].
- **Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP)**: In high-risk populations (e.g. MSM with recent bacterial STIs), doxyPEP taken within 72 hours after condomless sex reduces gonorrhea incidence by about 50% [^75fd263d].
- **Regular screening**: Routine screening for extragenital gonorrhea (pharyngeal, rectal) is recommended for MSM and individuals with multiple partners or high-risk behaviors [^8c23b563].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the possibility of asymptomatic infection and ongoing transmission, clinicians should:

- **Screen high-risk patients**: Perform extragenital testing (pharyngeal, rectal) in MSM and those with risk factors, even in the absence of symptoms [^8c23b563].
- **Counsel on risk reduction**: Discuss condom use, doxyPEP, and partner notification strategies [^36e7b8c5].
- **Treat promptly**: Use recommended regimens (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin or doxycycline) and arrange partner treatment to prevent reinfection [^f73703c7].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study/method** | **Estimated risk or finding** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Mathematical modeling | ~1% per-act risk | MSM population [^4aef1346] |
| Observational cohort | 4–5% urethral positivity | Only exposure: receptive oral sex [^df86cc7a] |
| Review of evidence | Asymptomatic in ~90% | Facilitates transmission [^2c9eeb05] |
| DoxyPEP trial | ~50% reduction in incidence | High-risk MSM [^75fd263d] |

---

The risk of acquiring gonorrhea from receptive oral sex without a condom is **low but real**, estimated around 1% per act in high-prevalence populations, with risk modulated by partner status, saliva exposure, and oral health. Asymptomatic pharyngeal infection is common, so screening and risk-reduction counseling are essential for those at risk [^2c9eeb05].

### Frequent transmission of gonorrhea in men who have sex with men [^0b9763d6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

One behavior that may be important for transmitting gonorrhea that has not been well studied is kissing. Kissing has not been asked about in any national sex surveys and only occasionally in clinical sexually transmitted infection studies. We were unable to find any published studies on kissing partners in which sex did not occur (termed kissing-only partners) either in heterosexuals or MSM, besides the data we recently presented. We surveyed 1,151 MSM attending our clinic in 2016 and found a mean of 3.7 kissing-only partners and a mean of 4.5 kissing and sex partners in the previous 3 months (Technical Appendix Figure 1). Kissing-only partners were much more common among younger MSM, who are at substantially higher risk for gonorrhea than older MSM. The reason for this preponderance of gonorrhea in young MSM is currently unknown but is consistent with and could be explained by kissing being an important transmission route.

We determined what we consider to be the accepted transmission routes for gonorrhea by anatomic site in MSM (Figure, panel A), although one should acknowledge that no studies have reported site-specific gonorrhea transmission between MSM partners. Major textbooks and published studies indicate the penis is key to gonorrhea transmission between men (Figure, panel A). Studies suggest that urethral infection is largely acquired from unprotected anal sex, with perhaps one third of cases acquired by receiving oral sex (Technical Appendix Table).

Regarding preventative measures for gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^365c731a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The population distribution of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) varies broadly across settings. Although there have been many studies aiming to define subgroups at risk of infection that should be a target for prevention interventions by identifying risk factors, questions remain about how these risk factors interact, how their effects jointly influence the risk of acquisition, and their differential importance across populations. Theoretical frameworks describing the interrelationships among risk determinants are useful in directing both the design and analysis of research studies and interventions. In this article, we developed such a framework from a review looking at determinants of risk for STI acquisition, using gonorrhea as an index infection. We also propose an analysis strategy to interpret the associations found to be significant in uniform analyses of observational data. The framework and the hierarchical analysis strategy are of particular relevance in the understanding of risk formation and might prove useful in identifying determinants that are part of the causal pathway and therefore amenable to prevention strategies across populations.

Transmission Probability

The transmission probability, directly in relation to R₀, varies from one pathogen to another. In the case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, it is estimated to be high and modified by individual-level determinants. Transmission from male to female seems to be more efficient than from female to male. Young women are more susceptible to infection than older women, through the same biological pathway observed due to the use of oral contraceptive and injectable hormones, whereby cervical ectopy increases the risk of acquiring gonorrhea and is more common among hormonal contraceptive users and younger women.

Coinfections have also been found to increase the transmission probability, whereas barrier methods, such as condoms, are effective in decreasing the risk for gonorrhea transmission or acquisition in particular and STIs in general. In a vulnerable population, such as female sex workers, the risk of STI acquisition is modified by a consistent use of condoms. Condom use in turn varies depending on the type of sexual partner. It has been observed to be less consistent with partners or regular clients than new or occasional clients, implying that only the partners with whom female sex workers do not use condoms are increasing their risk. Therefore, in a population such as female sex workers, the number of partners might be a less accurate measure of risk than the type of partner, which in turn will determine the sexual behavior.

Duration of Infectiousness

Early diagnosis and effective treatment are the most efficient approaches to reduce the duration of infectiousness (in direct relation to R₀) and, as such, were classified as proximate. These are influenced by the presence of biological symptoms, health beliefs, and community and structural determinants of access to healthcare, such as structure of healthcare systems and measures of marginalization or social conflict.

### Committee opinion no. 582: addressing health risks of noncoital sexual activity [^b60c0e3e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Noncoital sexual behavior is a common expression of human sexuality, which commonly cooccurs with coital behavior. Sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis virus (types A, B, and C), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydial infection, can be transmitted through noncoital sexual activity. When engaging in oral and anal sex, most individuals, including adolescents, are unlikely to use barrier protection for a variety of reasons, including a greater perceived safety of noncoital sexual activity compared with vaginal sex. Clinicians should assess patient sexually transmitted infection risk and provide risk reduction counseling accordingly. Clinicians should encourage and counsel patients regarding the correct and consistent use of condoms, barrier protection during oral sex, and cleaning of sex toys. Patients who engage in noncoital sexual activity also commonly have vaginal sex and may require contraceptive counseling.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^209b54ca]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The spread of STIs, including gonorrhea, in a population can be understood within the basic reproductive number (R₀) framework, where R₀ depends on 3 components: (1) β, a measure of infectivity or transmissibility; (2) c, a measure of the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals; and (3) D, a measure of the duration of infectiousness. The heterogeneous distribution of these determinants and behaviors among individuals, across populations, and over time explains why STIs behave differently within and between populations. The theoretical framework provided by mathematical models allows us to integrate biological and behavioral data to improve our understanding of the distribution of STIs in populations. Each of these 3 determinants are driven by a complex range of factors (social, economic, demographic, cultural, and behavioral) and at a number of levels (in the individual, within a partnership, and in the community). The key questions are which ones are driving an epidemic in a specific context and how we can describe the interconnectedness of different levels and among different factors to explain the causal pathways that lead to an individual being at risk of acquiring or transmitting an STI. In other words, what are the risk factors influencing each component of R₀ directly, and what are the broader risk factors that must be altered to influence the spread of infection in a population?

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^32ec29cd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Expedited partner therapy (EPT) for chlamydia and gonorrhea — definition, indications, evidence, and MSM considerations — is described as "a harm-reduction strategy and the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of persons with diagnosed chlamydia or gonorrhea… by providing medications or prescriptions to the partners at allowable by law". Unless prohibited, "medical providers should routinely offer EPT to patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure that all of a patient's sex partners from the previous 60 days will seek timely treatment", and "If the patient has not had sex during the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer EPT for the patient's most recent sex partner". Implementation favors medication in hand: "Providing patients with packaged oral medication is the preferred approach… " Evidence includes three U.S. trials showing more partners treated and reductions in reinfection; across trials, "reductions in chlamydia prevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up". For trichomoniasis, "Existing data indicate that EPT also might have a role…; however, no partner management intervention has been reported to be more effective than any other", and "No data support use of EPT in the routine management of patients with syphilis". Among men who have sex with men (MSM), "Data are limited", and HIV risk has been observed: "5% of MSM have a new diagnosis of HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal or chlamydial infection", therefore "shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended". Additionally, "All persons who receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, particularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk for HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP".

### Rationale and ethical assessment of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea controlled human infection model [^f184167f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Managing the risk of gonorrhea transmission to sexual partners and the broader public health implications of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM relies in part on behavioral management strategies. In the CHIM setting, where participants are aware of their infection status, transmission risk can be mitigated by infection prevention measures, education, and advice to participants regarding potential risk behaviors — specifically, restrictions on sexual contact (eg, open-mouth kissing), the use of saliva in sexual activity, and the sharing of sex toys and objects that may be put in the mouth (eg, cutlery and toothbrushes). Although N gonorrhoeae is usually transmitted by sexual contact or vertical transmission, there are several case reports of transmission via fomites, usually in children. Individuals with household or occupational contact with people aged < 18 years will therefore be excluded from participation. Despite behavioral modification advice, there may be persistent risks of transmission of N gonorrhoeae to participants' sexual partners. To manage this risk, regular sexual partners of potential participants may be corecruited for screening and treatment of gonorrhea infection as part of the trial.

COMPENSATION

Volunteers in CHIMs typically receive compensation for the time required to participate in such studies. A potential baseline for such compensation is the local minimum wage hourly rate. If the oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM is considered safe and approved by an ethics committee as an outpatient study, time commitments would likely be approximately 50 hours over a 6-month period — similar to many other CHIM designs. Where time commitments are significant (eg, for inpatient studies requiring several days of isolation), large total payments are widely considered to be ethically acceptable. Potential concerns associated with large payments include that they might sometimes constitute an undue inducement to participate and/or conceal relevant medical history (eg, which might increase study risks or distort study findings). Enrollment should therefore include (1) a careful informed consent process to ensure that participants understand the study and its associated risks and (2) efforts to confirm the relevant medical history of participants, which may include requesting consent for their doctor to provide this information or grant access to their digital health record.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^c7df2f9c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The nature of causation has been the subject of a comprehensive debate in philosophy, medicine, and, relatively more recently, epidemiology. The 2 main interpretations of causation that have been explored are (1) a deterministic interpretation, whereby a cause is invariably followed by its effect, being both necessary and sufficient; and (2) a probabilistic interpretation, where a cause increases or decreases the likelihood of the effect occurring, but is not required to be necessary or sufficient. In this article, we aim to provide a plausibility and probability assessment of the available literature to develop risk pathways, taking as an example sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in general and gonorrhea in particular.

Sexually transmitted infections, including treatable bacterial infections such as gonorrhea, represent a significant global health burden. Eighty percent of women and up to 10% of men remain asymptomatic during gonorrhea infection; when symptomatic, patients present with inflammation of the urogenital tract, throat, or rectum producing discomfort and discharge. Possible complications include pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The presence of an untreated STI also enhances human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition and transmission risks. Whereas the deterministic (necessary and sufficient) cause of gonorrhea infection at an individual level (ie, the presence of the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae), is well described; at a population level, probabilistic causes that determine the variability in the population distribution of the infection and their complex interplay are less well understood.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^7ab40019]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

While advocating more consistent reporting, this review highlights the need to move from a rigid etiological analysis to a broader perspective. It is known that gonorrhea infection is sexually transmitted. Therefore, the function of observational epidemiology could be 2-fold: to identify other biological correlates predisposing to infection, such as ectopy, where controlling for confounding is appropriate; and to identify pathways of risk, where excluding variables from analyses because they are correlated would seem inappropriate as the difference in role with and without controlling is informative.

Effectively, the analyses of individual risk factors will always be limited to studying acquisition and duration, rather than spread in the population. But these risks will depend on the population-level risks determining prevalence and thereby exposure. By building a picture of only direct risks, we could overlook variables contributing to the wider spread of infection and potential points for intervention.

USPSTF patient population and risk stratification: This recommendation 'applies to asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons'. In this statement, 'the recommendations are stratified by "men" and "women", although the net benefit estimates are driven by biological sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity', and 'Persons should consider their sex at birth and current anatomy (especially presence of a cervix/vagina) and consult with their own clinician, if necessary, to determine which recommendation best applies to them'. 'Age is a strong predictor of risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, with the highest infection rates in women occurring during ages 15 to 24 years'. For women 25 years or older, risk factors include 'a new sex partner, more than 1 sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI; practice inconsistent condom use when not in a mutually monogamous relationship; or have a previous or coexisting STI', and 'Exchanging sex for money or drugs and history of incarceration also are associated with increased risk'.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^11bb03a2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The standard method for identifying risk factors in epidemiological research involves comparing exposures in those with and without infection or comparing the incidence of infection in those with or without an exposure in observational studies. These methods have played an important and successful role in understanding many noncommunicable diseases, and have been widely used to explore risk factors for acquiring STIs. However, the intrinsic limitation of risk factor epidemiology is that an enumeration of associations is just the start of the interpretation of a process leading to disease. An explanation requires a hierarchy in the association to develop understanding. Additionally, the selection made by researchers of which risk factors are measured or included in the analyses is often an unclear process and one that may limit the interpretation of the results.

In the case of gonorrhea infection, questions remain about how risk factors interact, how their effects jointly influence the risk of acquisition, and their differential importance across populations. The understanding of the links between these variables will then have both programmatic and policy implications. The decision of where to target an intervention should be guided by this understanding in a particular population and, therefore, in the identification of "drivers" (ie, those determinants with the biggest potential for risk reduction), so that prevention efforts could be directed toward modifiable risk factors within the risk formation pathway in specific vulnerable subgroups — for example, an improvement of healthcare access in defined geographical areas or a reduction of high-risk sexual behaviors within characterized subpopulations.

### An estimate of the proportion of symptomatic gonococcal, chlamydial and non-gonococcal non-chlamydial urethritis attributable to oral sex among men who have sex with men: a case-control study [^2f535075]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) of the pharynx are common among men who have sex with men (MSM); the degree to which these infections are transmitted through oral sex is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study of MSM attending Public Health-Seattle & King County STD Clinic between 2001 and 2013 to estimate the proportion of symptomatic urethritis cases attributable to oral sex using two methods. First, we categorised men into the following mutually exclusive behavioural categories based on their self-reported sexual history in the previous 60days: (1) only received oral sex (IOS); (2) 100% condom usage with insertive anal sex plus oral sex (PIAI); (3) inconsistent condom usage with anal sex (UIAI); and (4) no sex. We then determined the proportion of cases in which men reported the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure (IOS and PIAI). Second, we calculated the population attributable risk per cent (PAR%) associated with oral sex using Mantel-Haenszel OR estimates.

Results

Based on our behavioural categorisation method, men reported the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure in the past 60days in 27.5% of gonococcal urethritis, 31.4% of chlamydial urethritis and 35.9% non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial urethritis (NGNCU) cases. The PAR%s for symptomatic gonococcal urethritis, chlamydial urethritis and NGNCU attributed to oropharyngeal exposure were 33.8%, 2.7% and 27.1%, respectively.

Conclusions

The pharynx is an important source of gonococcal transmission, and may be important in the transmission of chlamydia and other, unidentified pathogens that cause urethritis. Efforts to increase pharyngeal gonorrhoea screening among MSM could diminish STI transmission.

### Serosorting and recreational drug use are risk factors for diagnosis of genital infection with Chlamydia and gonorrhoea among HIV-positive men who have sex with men: results from a clinical cohort in Ontario, Canada [^efeb7b25]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings have implications for chlamydia/gonorrhoea prevention, testing and treatment among HIV-positive MSM. Non-zero diagnosis rates among men reporting condom-protected anal sex suggests some acquisition through unmeasured risk practices such as oral sex; sexual education messages should emphasise the differences in bacterial STI transmission routes compared with HIV. Testing was below recommended guidelines; the proportion of untested men reporting high-risk behaviours was substantial. We strongly encourage rectal testing which could detect up to 80% more asymptomatic infections. There is a need to design and deliver interventions to promote safer sex and testing in ways that are engaging, non-stigmatising and acceptable for men at risk. Potential clinic-based interventions to optimise testing include algorithms targeting high-risk patients, clinical decision support systems, automated patient/provider alerts and laboratory technologies to improve case detection.

Regarding preventative measures for syphilis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Frequent transmission of gonorrhea in men who have sex with men [^05dfe58f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The rate of gonorrhea is much higher in men who have sex with men than in heterosexuals. Because of unique behavioral characteristics, asymptomatic sites of infection, mainly the pharynx, are principal drivers of gonorrhea prevalence in men who have sex with men. On the basis of this observation, we call for interventions.

### A gonococcal vaccine has the potential to rapidly reduce the incidence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection among urban men who have sex with men [^bc664b9a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

A limitation of our study is the uncertainty of transmission probabilities for different transmission pathways (eg, anal sex, oral sex, kissing), as highlighted in other modelling studies. Furthermore, due to a lack of robust data to the contrary, we assumed that transmission probabilities are the same for asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, and that vaccine efficacy will be similar for all gonococcal strains. These issues will likely remain unresolved until data informing per-act transmissibility is available for all transmission pathways in the presence and absence of symptoms. Our study also did not consider changes in sexual behavior that may emerge with the introduction of a gonococcal vaccine, such as decreased risk-reduction behaviors (eg, condom use) that have been observed following the introduction of PrEP. Our main analysis assumed a relatively high per-visit vaccine uptake rate (30%), on top of high annual STI testing coverage (80%). These assumptions result in an effective vaccination coverage peaking close to 40% within 2 years. As vaccination uptake is tied to STI testing visits, vaccination coverage will increase more slowly in settings, such as in the United States, where STI testing coverage is lower. The effect on N. gonorrhoeae prevalence under lower STI testing coverage is predicted to be comparable to scenarios with lower vaccine uptake, on top of other effects caused by lower baseline STI testing. In this regard, we also considered a lower 15% per-visit vaccination uptake. Finally, we only considered sexual contacts between men in the model and have not considered the role of men who have sex with both men and women and the possible bridging with heterosexual populations.

In conclusion, this modelling study indicates that a vaccine of modest efficacy and an immunization strategy that targets MSM presenting for STI screening could significantly, and rapidly, reduce the incidence of gonorrhea in this population. These findings will inform the potential implementation of gonococcal vaccination programs and, given the high rates of gonorrhea in MSM, a targeted immunization strategy could significantly contribute to the WHO targets for reducing gonorrhea incidence by 90% by 2030.

Gonorrhea and Chlamydia

The following testing is recommended for MSM:

A test for urethral infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had insertive intercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT is preferred).
A test for rectal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal intercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT is preferred).
A test for pharyngeal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae among men who have had receptive oral intercourse during the preceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).
Testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not recommended.

Basing screening practices solely on history might be suboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable taking a detailed sexual history, men might also feel uncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with their provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be identified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors. Furthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e. oral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis has not been well studied.

Rectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-collected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who report exposure at these sites. Testing can be offered to MSM who do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed explanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. All MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of exposure as well as for syphilis.

More frequent STI screening (i.e. for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g. every 3–6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.

Hepatitis B Virus

All MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core antibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV infection. Vaccination against both HAV and HBV is recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection or vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can be considered before vaccinating if the patient's vaccination history is unknown; however, vaccination should not be delayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection or vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related adverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).

### CDC grand rounds: the growing threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea [^f73703c7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What Public Health Agencies and Partners Can Do

Several steps taken now might delay the emergence of cephalosporin-resistant strains, mitigate the public health consequences of expanded resistance, and prevent a return to the era of untreatable gonorrhea. Local and state STD control programs are encouraged to use local surveillance data to prioritize high-prevalence areas and populations for enhanced primary prevention, screening, or partner services. Clinicians can help prevent sequelae and spread of gonorrhea by eliciting sexual histories from their patients, screening sexually active MSM and high-risk sexually active women for gonorrhea at least annually at exposed anatomic sites, and treating appropriately. Clinicians also can counsel sexually active adults, particularly those living in high prevalence areas, to engage in mutually monogamous partnerships with uninfected partners and to consistently and correctly use latex condoms, which can reduce transmission.

Ensuring effective treatment is critical. Based on surveillance trends, CDC recently updated its treatment recommendations: gonorrhea at any anatomic site should be treated with a single 250 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus either 1 g of azithromycin as a single oral dose or 100 mg of doxycycline orally twice daily for 7 days. If this recommended regimen cannot be used, two alternative treatment options exist for urogenital or rectal gonorrhea: 1) if ceftriaxone is not available, clinicians can consider cefixime 400 mg as a single oral dose and either azithromycin 1 g as a single oral dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, or 2) if the patient is cephalosporin-allergic, clinicians can consider azithromycin 2 g as a single oral dose. If either of these two alternative regimens is prescribed, the patient should return in 1 week for a test of cure. CDC will continue to update treatment recommendations based on surveillance data and clinical research.

Uncomplicated gonococcal infection of the pharynx — testing and management considerations note that the majority of gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common among certain populations, are more difficult to eradicate than urogenital and anorectal infections, and few antimicrobial regimens reliably cure > 90% of pharyngeal infections. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal gonorrhea about oral sexual exposure; if reported, pharyngeal testing should be performed. To maximize adherence and reduce transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed; if medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^dcbdc46d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pre‑exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV — populations and regimens — uses daily oral antiretroviral combinations of emtricitabine (FTC) with either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), which have demonstrated safety and a substantial reduction in HIV acquisition for MSM. TDF/FTC has demonstrated safety and efficacy for mixed‑status heterosexual couples and for heterosexual men and women recruited individually; however, no evidence is yet available regarding TAF/FTC among heterosexually active women. One clinical trial involving persons who inject drugs and one involving heterosexual mixed‑status couples demonstrated substantial efficacy and safety of daily oral PrEP with TDF. High adherence to oral PrEP was strongly associated with protection from HIV infection. Studies with MSM have shown that taking PrEP at specific times before and after sexual intercourse was effective in preventing HIV; however, less experience exists with this regimen, it is not FDA cleared, and it has not been studied among other populations. Among HIV‑negative sexually active men and women, bacterial STIs are key indicators of risk; studies document MSM risk within 1 year after rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (one in 15 men) and after primary or secondary syphilis (one in 18).

### Urgent need to understand and prevent gonococcal infection: from the laboratory to real-world context [^7053d90f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is widespread globally, with an estimated 82 million new infections in individuals 15–49 years of age during 2020. Most gonococcal infections occur in low- and middle-income countries, with the highest incidence in low-income countries. In developed countries, as with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the highest incidence is seen in adolescents and young adults, ethnic minority groups, and those of low socioeconomic status. Other populations at particular risk of gonococcal infection include people with multiple sexual partners, people receiving preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) therapy for human immunodeficiency virus, men who have sex with men, and people engaging in transactional sex. Gonococcal infection is increasing in incidence. Primary prevention measures (sexual abstinence or condom use) are not successful, and increases in antimicrobial resistance threaten the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment.

Unfortunately, there is no specific vaccine against gonococcal infection and there have been numerous challenges associated with the development of an effective vaccine. The classical approach to vaccine design is to mimic natural infection; however, the ability of N gonorrhoeae to avoid and suppress the immune response means that natural infection does not reliably induce immunity. In addition, there have been difficulties in implementing vaccine clinical trials due to frequent asymptomatic infections (notably in the pharynx and rectum), a limited infrastructure for providing care related to STIs, and social stigma related to STIs that can impact successful participation.

We have conducted a narrative review with the purpose of assessing available evidence on gonococcal infection and the impact of the closely related Neisseria meningitidis group B vaccine in preventing gonorrhea.

### Transmission of nonviral sexually transmitted infections and oral sex [^1cd1e7df]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral sex is usually considered a lower-risk sexual activity when compared with sex, but it is frequently the cause of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In particular, STI transferred through oral sex might have no visible symptoms, depending on the type of infection.

Aims

The aim of this study is to review the literature about the role of oral sex in the transmission of nonviral STI.

Main Outcome Measures

State-of-the-art information in the area of STI in relation to sexual function and self-care, this last important for development of STI prevention products such as vaginal microbicides. Sexual behaviors assessed focusing on receiving oral sex and giving oral sex.

Methods

A search of the main electronic databases including registers of clinical controlled trials was performed in addition to a hand search of the most relevant Journals. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, literature review of research articles, and public health department Internet Web sites, for the period of 1945–2011. In addition to searching the Clinical Trials Registry at the US National Institutes of Health, we also used the meta Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Results

STI affect the mucous membranes both directly and indirectly producing characteristic diagnostic signs and lesions. Daily dental clinical activity needs an appropriate knowledge of any kind of oral lesions-related STI. The reader is offered a practical approach with clinically relevant recommendations that may prove useful in his/her daily practice when dealing with STI.

Conclusions

These data provide a foundation for understanding diverse STI. We advise physicians to be receptive to discuss sexuality issues and provide patients with adequate therapy.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) — preventive screening for common STIs is indicated and should be performed at least annually, with anatomic site–specific testing and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) preferences as follows. The following testing is recommended for MSM: a test for urethral infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis among men who have had insertive intercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT is preferred); a test for rectal infection with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal intercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT is preferred); and a test for pharyngeal infection with N. gonorrhoeae among men who have had receptive oral intercourse during the preceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred), whereas testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not recommended; regardless of condom use during exposure. Rectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-collected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who report exposure at these sites, and testing can be offered to MSM who do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed explanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. HIV serologic testing is indicated if HIV status is unknown or if HIV negative and the patient or their sex partner has had more than one sex partner since the most recent HIV test. All MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of exposure as well as for syphilis. More frequent STI screening (i.e., for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners, and providers can consider offering more frequent HIV screening, for example every 3–6 months, to MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.

### Screening recommendations for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^5ef65cfb]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency, and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

Bottom Line

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### Rationale and ethical assessment of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea controlled human infection model [^d92eaf77]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

POTENTIAL ETHICAL ISSUES RELATED TO AN OROPHARYNGEAL GONORRHEA CHIM

Despite the potential benefits of CHIMs, robust ethical assessment is necessary to ensure that the risks of exposing a healthy participant to N gonorrhoeae are acceptable after appropriate mitigation measures. While the ethical considerations for CHIMs are similar to those for research in general, exposure of healthy volunteers to risks is one reason why fulfilling appropriate ethical criteria is particularly important. Such criteria include the need for scientific justification, risk-benefit assessment, consultation and engagement with the public, coordination between key stakeholders, and appropriate site and participant selection to minimize risk. Independent ethical review and robust informed consent with a test of understanding represent important components. Here we outline the features of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM that we consider the most challenging issues to address.

Scientific Justification

One key question to consider in assessing the scientific justification of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM is whether equivalent data could be obtained via alternative methods. Phase 3 field trials are typically the gold standard for assessing efficacy of novel treatment and prevention strategies. One large gonorrhea trial was conducted with the primary outcome being the prevention of oropharyngeal gonorrhea with antibacterial mouthwash. Additionally, prospective longitudinal cohort studies have been performed to determine the incidence and duration of oropharyngeal gonorrhea. These studies have shown that field trials with oropharyngeal gonorrhea as the primary outcome are feasible. However, these studies require an extended duration of follow-up and sampling, may be difficult to control for factors influencing trial outcomes, and can face challenges related to recruitment and participant retention. For example, one-third of the 786 potential participants screened for the OMEGA antibacterial mouthwash study were ineligible, and approximately 15% of the enrolled participants were lost to follow-up. The ExGen prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolled 140 men who have sex with men to perform self-collected oropharyngeal swabs weekly for 48 weeks. Yet, 28 participants (20%) did not complete any at-home testing, and only 56 (40%) completed at least 40 weeks of testing.

Although a small number of participants with oropharyngeal gonorrhea have been included in trials of investigational antimicrobials for treatment of gonorrhea, most studies have been designed to study efficacy against uncomplicated urogenital infection. However, when we consider that the oropharynx is the predominant site for acquisition of AMR and treatment failure and is likely a significant driver of transmission, there is a clear imperative for novel antimicrobials to have robust efficacy at the oropharynx. An oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM would enable preliminary efficacy assessment of novel antimicrobials at this site prior to larger licensing studies.

### Gonorrhoea [^2f0212d5]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhoea, which has an estimated global annual incidence of 86.9 million adults. Gonorrhoea can present as urethritis in men, cervicitis or urethritis in women, and in extragenital sites (pharynx, rectum, conjunctiva and, rarely, systemically) in both sexes. Confirmation of diagnosis requires microscopy of Gram-stained samples, bacterial culture or nucleic acid amplification tests. As no gonococcal vaccine is available, prevention relies on promoting safe sexual behaviours and reducing STI-associated stigma, which hinders timely diagnosis and treatment thereby increasing transmission. Single-dose systemic therapy (usually injectable ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin) is the recommended first-line treatment. However, a major public health concern globally is that N. gonorrhoeae is evolving high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which threatens the effectiveness of the available gonorrhoea treatments. Improved global surveillance of the emergence, evolution, fitness, and geographical and temporal spread of AMR in N. gonorrhoeae, and improved understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for current and future antimicrobials in the treatment of urogenital and extragenital gonorrhoea, are essential to inform treatment guidelines. Key priorities for gonorrhoea control include strengthening prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of patients and their partners; decreasing stigma; expanding surveillance of AMR and treatment failures; and promoting responsible antimicrobial use and stewardship. To achieve these goals, the development of rapid and affordable point-of-care diagnostic tests that can simultaneously detect AMR, novel therapeutic antimicrobials and gonococcal vaccine(s) in particular is crucial.

Gonorrhea — management of sex partners and expedited partner therapy (EPT): Recent sex partners (sexual contact < 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment; if the last potential sexual exposure was > 60 days before onset or diagnosis, the most recent partner should be treated. When partner-management strategies are impractical or access to prompt care is limited, EPT can be delivered. For EPT, treatment of the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose is recommended if concurrent chlamydial infection has been excluded; if a chlamydia test result has not been documented, the partner may be treated with a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day for 7 days, and if adherence with multiday dosing is a concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered. Because effectiveness data are limited among men who have sex with men (MSM), shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

### Kissing, saliva exchange, and transmission of Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^f3755f7f]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Data from mathematical models suggest that kissing and saliva exchange during sexual activity might be major contributors to community gonorrhoea morbidity. Although there is little evidence to support this, it provokes discussion of the potential role of the oropharynx in gonorrhoea control. Improved sensitivity and ease of diagnostic testing, as well as increased screening for extragenital infections among men who have sex with men, have increased awareness of the high frequency of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. However, there are insufficient data to determine the mechanisms of transmission for these infections. Innovative studies that use quantitative microbiological techniques are needed to accurately assess how oral gonorrhoea or saliva exchange in infected people contribute to the morbidity of gonorrhoea in the community. More empirical data on pharyngeal gonorrhoea infections, and the role of transmission to and from the oropharynx, are needed to inform prevention planning.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^e8d2895c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

For a curable STI such as gonorrhea, we can expect the determinants involved in the epidemic to be similar to those shaping HIV epidemiology. However, the relative importance of determinants may differ due to the differences in natural history and influence of healthcare, implying that while different strategies or targets might be needed for prevention and control programs, a similar conceptual framework could be brought to bear in the formulation of a priori hypotheses. In this study, we build on the 2 frameworks using the hierarchical structure of the social epidemiology framework while applying the linear risk structure of the proximate determinants framework to test our hypotheses and structure the evidence available on risk factors for gonorrhea acquisition in female sex worker populations. We present a strategy for interpretation of observational data analysis to assess pathways of risk. We reviewed the literature to identify factors statistically associated with gonorrhea, and analyzed results aiming to distinguish determinants on the risk formation pathway (which are therefore useful to the targeting of intervention) from determinants not on the risk formation pathway that might be considered confounders (for which adjustment is imperative but targeting of an intervention might prove futile). In brief, studies published since 1989 were identified through searches of PubMed/Medline with no restrictions on language. Articles were retrieved by searching "prostitute/prostitution/sex work/sex worker", with either "gonorrhoea/gonorrhea" or "sexually transmitted infection/STI/sexually transmitted disease/STD". We included publications of primary research only that assessed urogenital gonorrhea by biological tests only. Studies were included if they calculated an effect estimate for risk factors on gonorrhea or if they provided enough information on their distribution for this to be calculated (more detail is given in the).

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention

PrEP is the use of medications for preventing an infection before exposure. Studies have demonstrated that a daily oral medication TDF/FTC is effective in preventing HIV acquisition, and specifically among MSM. PrEP guidelines provide information regarding sexually active persons who are at substantial risk for acquiring HIV infection (having had anal or vaginal sex during the previous 6 months with either a partner with HIV infection, a bacterial STI in the past 6 months, or inconsistent or no condom use with a sex partner) or persons who inject drugs (injecting partner with HIV infection or sharing injection equipment). Those guidelines provide information regarding daily PrEP use for either TDF/FTC (men or women) or tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for MSM. Screening for bacterial STIs should occur at least every 6 months for all sexually active patients and every 3 months among MSM or among patients with ongoing risk behaviors. MSM taking PrEP might compensate for decreased HIV acquisition risk by using condoms less frequently or modifying their behavior in other ways, although data regarding this behavior are inconsistent. Studies have reported that MSM taking PrEP have high rates of STIs, and frequent screening is warranted.

Importance of Rectal and Pharyngeal Testing

Rectal and pharyngeal testing by NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recognized as an important sexual health consideration for MSM. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia are associated with HIV infection, and men with repeat rectal infections can be at substantially higher risk for HIV acquisition. Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or chlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections. Studies have demonstrated that among MSM, prevalence of rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.2% to 24% and 2.1% to 23%, respectively, and prevalence of pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.5% to 16.5% and 0% to 3.6%, respectively. Approximately 70% of gonococcal and chlamydial infections might be missed if urogenital-only testing is performed among MSM because most pharyngeal and rectal infections are asymptomatic. Self-collected swabs have been reported to be an acceptable means of collection for pharyngeal and rectal specimens, which can enhance patient comfort and reduce clinical workloads.

A detailed sexual history should be taken for all MSM to identify anatomic locations exposed to infection for screening. Clinics that provide services for MSM at high risk should consider implementing routine extragenital screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections, and screening is likely to be cost-effective.

DISCUSSION

We categorized risk factors for gonorrhea acquisition reported in 36 studies according to their proximity in the causal pathways to understand risk formation in a population at higher risk. The aim was to explore and explain an analysis strategy moving from a uniform to a hierarchical account of disease causation. In so doing, a critique of the reporting of observational studies of gonorrhea infection is offered. The picture that emerges of the risk of gonorrhea acquisition is that these theoretical frameworks are justified, but only through glimpses they provide at the underlying pathways leading to risk. These pathways should be the target of effective interventions. The use of "proximate/distal" nomenclature has been previously criticized, as it might imply notions of time or distance that are not part of the analysis of observational data. However, it can be useful for researchers to adopt a hierarchical approach to the analysis and interpretation of the data to test hypotheses while recognizing the limitations of the linear image to drawing the whole picture.

This review employed a systematic approach to minimize biases and by going beyond traditional risk factors, the theoretical framework proposed offers a broad picture of the relationships between social, cultural, and individual determinants. However, it also presented limitations. The number of studies included was small compared with the number of publications identified. Additionally, by limiting this review to published articles, we aimed to avoid poor-quality studies, which might have led to some publication bias.

The quality of reporting of the studies included was mixed. Few studies reported a wide range of variables. None of them explored causal pathways explicitly. An ideal analysis of STI risk determinants should include a hierarchical approach based on the framework proposed. This will help avoid distal factors being inappropriately adjusted for by proximate determinants, with a consequent loss of valuable information related to the causal pathway. Indeed, it is important to explore which underlying determinants can be explained by proximate determinants and which cannot. To do this, the aim should be to report different multivariable analyses with and without underlying determinants to be able to analyze the variations between them. In this review, only 13 studies reported detailed univariable and multivariable analyses, and all of them went from univariable to multivariable, without hierarchy, making generalization of estimates of risk impossible. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement was published to standardize the reporting of observational studies. It is hoped that by following agreed guidelines, the quality of reporting in observational studies will be more homogeneous, perhaps allowing in the future a generalization of results.

Management of Sex Partners

Recent sex partners (i.e. persons having sexual contact with the infected patient < 60 days preceding onset of symptoms or gonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment. If the patient's last potential sexual exposure was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated.

If health department partner-management strategies (e.g. disease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable for persons with gonorrhea and partners' access to prompt clinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be delivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating pharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Treatment of the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose is recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not been documented, the partner may be treated with a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is a considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered but has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections). Provision of medication by EPT should be accompanied by written materials for educating partners about gonorrhea, their exposure to gonorrhea, and the importance of therapy. These materials should also educate partners about seeking clinical evaluation for adverse reactions or complications and general follow-up when able. Educational materials for female partners should include information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation for PID, especially if symptomatic; undertreatment of PID among female partners and missed opportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women are of concern. MSM with gonorrhea have a high risk for coexisting infections (especially undiagnosed HIV) among their partners, and they might have partners without HIV who could benefit from PrEP. Data are also limited regarding the effectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent gonorrhea among MSM; thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

### Frequent transmission of gonorrhea in men who have sex with men [^8db2a4c2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The rates of sexually transmitted infections are rising rapidly in men who have sex with men (MSM). Gonorrhea is of particular concern because rising rates will increase the probability of antimicrobial drug resistance. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended reducing the prevalence of gonorrhea as a key strategy to mitigate against antimicriobial resistance. However, reducing prevalence requires understanding why gonorrhea is so common in MSM. We suggest that specific sexual practices of MSM result in them having a high prevalence of asymptomatic infection in particular anatomic sites and that these infections are the primary drivers of transmission.

In heterosexuals, the primary sites of gonorrheal infection are the urethra in men and cervix in women. Most heterosexual men with urethral infection become symptomatic and quickly seek healthcare (after a few days). About half of women are asymptomatic, and thus they take longer to seek healthcare than men.

In MSM, 3 sites are commonly infected: pharynx, rectum, and urethra. In a Seattle clinic, the proportion of MSM with pharyngeal gonorrhea was 6.5%, rectal gonorrhea 9.7%, and urethral gonorrhea 5.5%. Almost all urethral infections were symptomatic (96%), but most pharyngeal and rectal infections were asymptomatic. Most pharyngeal or rectal infections (58%) were not associated with urethral infection.

An additional factor favoring the persistence of gonorrhea-infected sites in MSM is their lower rate of partner notification compared with heterosexuals. This behavior creates a scenario in which men with pharyngeal or rectal gonorrhea often go untreated, even if they transmit an infection to the urethra of a sex partner. This longer duration of infectiousness translates into a higher reproductive rate for gonorrhea in MSM compared with heterosexuals, independent of the number of sexual partners. Determining the key drivers of the reproductive rate for gonorrhea in MSM involves characterizing transmission between anatomic sites, which requires quantifying the site-specific sexual practices of MSM. Studies assessing the most recent sexual acts among MSM show that most have kissed (75%), practiced mutual masturbation (64%), or had oral sex (77%); oro-anal sex (25%) and penile-anal sex (35%) are less common. In contrast, in heterosexuals, penile-vaginal sex occurs in 95% of most recent sexual acts; therefore, most sexual acts between heterosexuals in which gonorrhea transmission occurs will lead to symptomatic infections that prompt them to seek treatment.

Alternative Intramuscular or Oral Regimens

No data have been published regarding use of oral cephalosporins for treating PID. As a result of the emergence of quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, regimens that include a quinolone agent are not recommended for PID treatment. However, if the patient has cephalosporin allergy, the community prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea are low, and follow-up is likely, alternative therapy can be considered. Use of either levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days or azithromycin 500 mg IV daily for 1–2 doses, followed by 250 mg orally daily in combination with metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 12–14 days, can be considered. Moxifloxacin is the preferred quinolone antimicrobial for M. genitalium infections; however, the importance of providing coverage for M. genitalium is unknown. Diagnostic tests for gonorrhea should be obtained before starting therapy, and persons should be managed as follows:

If a culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be based on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
If the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae or if antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be assessed (e.g. if only NAAT testing is available), consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended.

Other Management Considerations

To minimize disease transmission, women should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is complete, symptoms have resolved, and sex partners have been treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). All women who receive a diagnosis of PID should be tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis. The value of testing women with PID for M. genitalium is unknown (see Mycoplasma genitalium). All contraceptive methods can be continued during treatment.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^06dce11f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF RISK FOR GONORRHEA ACQUISITION

The findings of our review are summarized in Figure 1. As mentioned above, at a population level, the spread of an infection is defined by its R₀, representing the average number of new cases generated by 1 primary case. It is implied that the higher the R₀, the greater the potential for the infection to spread (Figure 1). However, it is worth noting that whereas R₀ is theoretically related to the potential for spread through the population, the reviewed studies relate to the risk of an infection occurring in the individual. Theoretically, this will be determined by the force of infection that combines the transmission probability, number of contacts, and prevalence of infection in these contacts, along with the duration of infection and the associated chance of an infection remaining at the period of sampling (access to treatment and healthcare). Thus, the importance of the 3 components of R₀ differs from the reason they are central in our framework for risk, but the correspondence is useful in translating findings from the individual to the population. Subsequently, risk factors found in the literature were organized in 2 levels (underlying and proximate) influencing the 3 components of R₀: probability of transmission, probability of exposure to an infected person, and average duration of infectiousness.

Figure 1.
Proposed framework of gonorrhea risk from studies of female sex worker populations. R₀, the reproductive number, is at the center of the figure. At the first level, directly influencing R₀, are its 3 components: probability of exposure to infected, transmission probability, and the duration of infectiousness. At a second level, we positioned all the proximate determinants that influence each of the components of R₀. At a third level, there are the distal/underlying determinants. When different types of measures or proxies of the same determinant were found in the literature, we indicated the determinant and proceeded to list the different measures found (eg, characteristics of sex work: age at first sex work, duration of sex work, registration, place of sex work, place of client recruitment, price per intercourse). Abbreviations: CT, Chlamydia trachomatis; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NG, Neisseria gonorrhoeae; No, number; R₀, reproductive number; STI, sexually transmitted infection; TV, Trichomonas vaginalis.

Gonococcal Infections

Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults

In the United States, an estimated 1,568,000 new N. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year, and gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial communicable disease. Urethral infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent sequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission to others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications (e.g. PID) have occurred. PID can result in tubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.

Annual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended for all sexually active women aged < 25 years and for older women at increased risk for infection (e.g. those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting STIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and consult local public health authorities for guidance regarding identifying groups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. MSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g. those with multiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at risk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic sites of exposure every 3–6 months (see Men Who Have Sex with Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all MSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and women aged > 25 years who are at low risk for infection is not recommended. A recent travel history with sexual contacts outside the United States should be part of any gonorrhea evaluation.

### Oral and anal sex are key to sustaining gonorrhoea at endemic levels in MSM populations: a mathematical model [^b0deea53]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite early treatment of urethral infection, gonorrhoea is endemic in urban populations of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Australia. By contrast, gonorrhoea is not common in urban heterosexual populations. Sexual activities among MSM usually involve anal or oral sex, and as these behaviours are becoming increasingly common among heterosexuals, there is a need to investigate their roles in transmission of gonorrhoea.

Methods

We developed individual-based models of transmission of gonorrhoea in MSM and heterosexuals that incorporate anatomical site-specific transmission of gonorrhoea. We estimated the probabilities of transmission for anal sex and oral sex by calibrating an MSM model against prevalence of gonorrhoea and sexual activity data. These probabilities were then applied to a heterosexual model in order to examine whether gonorrhoea can persist in a heterosexual population through the addition of anal sex and oral sex.

Results

In the MSM model, gonorrhoea can persist despite prompt treatment of urethral infections. The probability of gonorrhoea persisting is reduced if use of condom for oral sex is increased to more than 15% of acts. Assuming that treatment of symptomatic infections is prompt, gonorrhoea is unlikely to persist in a heterosexual population even with the addition of anal and oral sex.

Conclusions

Our models suggest that oral sex has an important role in sustaining gonorrhoea in a population of MSM by providing a pool of untreated asymptomatic infection. The importance of anal sex or oral sex in sustaining gonorrhoea in a heterosexual population remains uncertain due to the lack of information linking different types of sex acts and transmissibility.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^f1e20c07]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — Doxycycline (Doxy-PEP) taken after condomless anal or oral sex is recommended for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women and nonbinary people at risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis within the past 12 months (evidence rating: AIa), and doxyPEP is also recommended, using a shared decision-making approach, for MSM and transgender women who have not had a bacterial STI during the previous year but have a high likelihood of condomless exposure to STIs (evidence rating: AIII). Initiating oral doxyPEP is recommended as quickly as possible (but certainly within 72 hours) after condomless sexual exposure for cisgender MSM and transgender women (evidence rating: AIa). This intervention reduces the incidence of chlamydia by 70% to 88% and early syphilis by 73% to 87%, while effects on gonorrhea are less consistent. Dosing may be taken as frequently as daily (evidence rating: BIa). One study of doxyPEP for cisgender women in Kenya did not show a protective effect, but pharmacologic modeling suggests that doxyPEP should be effective for vaginal exposures and should be considered on a case-by-case basis among individuals with likelihood of STI acquisition via vaginal exposure (evidence rating: BIII). DoxyPEP prescriptions are recommended in quantities of 30 doses at a time (evidence rating: CIII), and screening of sites/orifices with sexual contact as well as blood testing for syphilis is recommended quarterly (evidence rating: AIa).

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^81bbd8b0]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Appendix B. Glossary — population and biomedical prevention terms define partner services specialists, persons at high risk of HIV infection, persons who inject drugs (PWID), population-level interventions, postnatal infant prophylaxis, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and presumptive treatment. Partner services specialists are persons who provide partner services, including trained disease investigation specialists, public health investigators, or communicable disease investigators in health departments and other agencies authorized to provide these services. A person at high risk of HIV infection is one with behaviors that place him/her at high risk of contracting HIV infection, such as having unprotected sex or sharing drug-injection equipment with a person known to be HIV-infected or with persons from communities with a high prevalence of HIV infection. PWID are persons who inject illicit drugs using equipment that may facilitate HIV transmission, such as nonsterile syringes, needles, cookers, or spoons. A population-level intervention focuses on the population or community as a whole to improve risk conditions and behaviors and may include community mobilization, social marketing campaigns, community events, policy interventions, and housing programs meant to alter social norms, policies, or environmental characteristics. Postnatal infant prophylaxis is the use of selected antiretroviral medications for several weeks by newborns born to women with HIV to prevent HIV acquisition. PrEP is the daily, continuous use of a select antiretroviral regimen by an HIV-uninfected person to achieve levels of drug in the blood and anal and genital mucosa sufficient to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. Presumptive treatment is treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis before the results of STD testing or clinical evaluation are available and is recommended for persons who report symptoms suggestive of these STDs or recent sex partners who were treated for these STDs, or have clinical signs of these STDs.

### Willingness to change behaviours to reduce the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea transmission and acquisition in men who have sex with men: a cross-sectional survey [^9a13310e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine the willingness of men who have sex with men (MSM) to change their behaviours to potentially reduce the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea transmission and acquisition.

Methods

A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among MSM attending the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Australia, between March and September 2015. Participants were asked how likely they would change their behaviours to reduce the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea. Six different potential preventive interventions were asked: (1) stop tongue kissing; (2) stop having receptive oral sex; (3) stop performing rimming; (4) stop using saliva as a lubricant during anal sex; (5) use of condoms during oral sex; and (6) use of alcohol-containing mouthwash daily.

Results

Of the 926 MSM who completed the questionnaire, 65.4% (95% CI 62.3% to 68.5%) expressed they were likely to use mouthwash daily to reduce the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea, 63.0% (95% CI 59.8% to 66.1%) would stop using saliva as a lubricant, and 49.5% (95% CI 46.2% to 52.7%) would stop rimming. In contrast, 77.6% (95% CI 74.8% to 80.3%) of MSM expressed they were unlikely to stop tongue kissing. MSM who were younger and had less male partners expressed they were unlikely to use mouthwash daily as an intervention to reduce risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea acquisition.

Conclusions

The practices MSM are willing to change to reduce the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea transmission and acquisition vary greatly; however, the majority of men are likely to use mouthwash daily to reduce the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhoea.

### Models of gonorrhoea transmission from the mouth and saliva [^5162fdb5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

This Personal View argues for a new framework of gonorrhoea transmission in men who have sex with men in which the oropharynx plays a major role in transmitting gonorrhoea to, or acquiring gonorrhoea from, their partner's oropharynx, penis, or anorectum through either direct contact or via saliva. To avoid preconceived notions of transmission dynamics, we ask readers to imagine that they are investigating a new sexually transmitted infection. On the basis of the existing clinical and epidemiological data for gonorrhoea at the penis, oropharynx, and anorectum site, we develop two models for transmission: the so-called penile model and the so-called oropharyngeal model. We argue that the existing epidemiological data and behavioural data best fit the oropharyngeal model. Our argument rests on the observation that, at the population level, the prevalence of urethral gonorrhoea is too rare to explain the high incidence of oropharynx and anorectum infection. We describe studies of gonorrhoea detection in saliva, saliva use during sex, epidemiological studies of kissing and oropharyngeal gonorrhoea, as well as studies aided by mathematical models. Finally, we argue that the correlation between sexual acts (eg, kissing, oral sex, anal sex, and saliva use) is so high that any epidemiological study that does not measure these factors will be prone to confounding.

### Frequent transmission of gonorrhea in men who have sex with men [^5b126205]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Transmission models for gonorrhea in MSM should be consistent with current site-specific prevalence and incidence. We estimated prevalence and incidence of pharyngeal and anal gonorrhea from 3,034 MSM attending a Seattle clinic on the basis of site-specific duration data (Technical Appendix Figure 2). The incidence of urethral gonorrhea was ≈5.5/100 person-years, and we estimated the prevalence among MSM to be low (0.24%) because the infections are often of short duration due to their treatable and symptomatic nature. It is difficult to see how, even with frequent changes in sex partners, the estimated incidence of pharyngeal infection (26/100 person-years) could arise from urethral infection, given its low prevalence.

There are several implications if our model of transmission is correct. First, a preventive approach using condoms will not work because, unlike heterosexuals, the penis is not responsible for most gonorrhea transmission among MSM. Second, the screening that is advocated annually for MSM would need to be much more frequent to reduce the disease reproductive rate. MSM taking pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV are screened every 3 months; this screening frequency might be sufficient to reduce gonorrhea prevalence. Third, our model suggests reducing pharyngeal duration and transmissibility is needed for gonorrhea control, and we call for suggestions of interventions that might achieve this. One approach we are investigating is an antibacterial mouthwash (clinical trial no. ACTRN12616000247471), following up some of our earlier data.

Finally, it is possible that the rapidly rising rates of syphilis in MSM may share similarities with gonorrhea transmission. Syphilis is also uncommon in heterosexuals and more likely to be asymptomatic in MSM with anal infection. When interventions are being tested for their effects on gonorrhea transmission, investigators might consider including syphilis as an outcome.

### Risk factors for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men: an age-matched case-control study [^e6c7de8e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Oropharyngeal gonorrhoea is common among men who have sex with men (MSM). We aimed to clarify which oral sex practices were independent risk factors for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea: tongue kissing, receptive oro-penile sex (fellatio) or insertive oro-anal sex (rimming), and whether daily use of mouthwash and recent antibiotic use was protective.

Methods

In 2015, we conducted an age-matched case-control study of MSM who attended the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre. Cases had tested positive for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea by nucleic acid amplification testing, and controls had tested negative. Questionnaire items included tongue kissing, oral sex practices, condom use, recent antibiotic use, mouthwash use and alcohol consumption.

Results

We identified 177 cases, age matched to 354 controls. In univariable analyses, cases were 1.90 times (95%CI 1.13 to 3.20) more likely than controls to have had casual sexual partners (CSP) in the preceding 3 months, were 2.17 times (95%CI 1.31 to 3.59) more likely to have kissed CSP and were 2.04 times (95%CI 1.26 to 3.30) more likely to have had receptive oro-penile sex with CSP. Oropharyngeal gonorrhoea was not associated with insertive oro-anal sex or mouthwash use. The number of CSP for tongue kissing and receptive oral sex and total CSP were highly correlated, and in multivariable analysis neither kissing nor receptive oro-penile sex was significantly associated with having oropharyngeal gonorrhoea, after adjusting for total number of CSP.

Conclusions

The finding that oropharyngeal gonorrhoea was associated with a higher number of sexual partners but not specific sexual practices highlights the need for further research in the area of gonorrhoea transmission to define the probability of transmission from specific sex acts.

### A gonococcal vaccine has the potential to rapidly reduce the incidence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection among urban men who have sex with men [^f0e3636c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

(.)

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, is an urgent public health threat due to rising incidence, the severe reproductive tract morbidities that it causes, and the difficulties of treating multidrug-resistant strains. Although there is currently no vaccine of proven efficacy available, interest in developing gonococcal vaccines has greatly intensified, and mathematical modelling of vaccine impact is key to informing vaccine development and implementation.

An estimated 87 million gonorrhea infections are reported each year. In many settings, the highest incidence of gonorrhea is reported in men who have sex with men (MSM). Incidence among MSM in Australia is reported to be 39 per 100 person-years even though approximately 80% of MSM in urban Australia are tested annually.

N. gonorrhoeae can be transmitted through penile-vaginal, penile-anal, and penile-oral sex, and via other pathways such as oropharynx to oropharynx. Infection of the male urethra usually results in noticeable symptoms and infected men tend to promptly seek treatment. However, anorectal and oropharyngeal infections are usually asymptomatic and may remain untreated allowing for ongoing transmission. Complications of untreated gonococcal infection in men include urethral stricture, urogenital tract abscesses, epididymo-orchitis, infertility, and increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Sector Strategy on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has set targets for reducing global gonorrhea incidence by 90% by 2030. N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to almost all classes of antibiotics used to treat it and extensively drug-resistant strains have been reported. Therefore, vaccine development and implementation are considered priorities to providing a long-term solution to gonorrhea. Although challenging, the feasibility of developing a gonococcal vaccine is supported by a retrospective case-control study that estimated approximately 30% protective efficacy against gonorrhea by the MeNZB vaccine licensed for the closely related bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. Mathematical modelling predicted that a vaccine with 30% efficacy could reduce gonorrhea prevalence by 50% within 20 years in a heterosexual population. Vaccinating key, at-risk populations (eg, MSM) may be an effective strategy to reduce gonorrhea prevalence.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^40a2d57d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neisseria meningitidis urethritis — diagnosis, transmission, and partner management are noted: Neisseria meningitidis can colonize mucosal surfaces and cause urethritis, and studies indicate it can be transmitted through oral-penile contact (i.e., fellatio). Because N. meningitidis cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram stain, identification as the etiologic agent when Gram stain suggests gonococcal urethritis but nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for gonorrhea is negative requires a confirmation by culture. Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis, and treatment of sex partners with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered.

### Association of HIV preexposure prophylaxis with incidence of sexually transmitted infections among individuals at high risk of HIV infection [^342a6ded]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emerging evidence suggests that risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increases among gay and bisexual men following initiation of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

Objective

To describe STI incidence and behavioral risk factors among a cohort of predominantly gay and bisexual men who use PrEP, and to explore changes in STI incidence following PrEP commencement.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Expanded (PrEPX) Study, a multisite, open-label intervention study, was nested within the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) clinic network. A total of 4275 participants were enrolled (July 26, 2016-April 1, 2018) in Victoria, Australia. Of these, 2981 enrolled at 5 ACCESS clinics (3 primary care, 1 sexual health, and 1 community-based HIV rapid testing service), had at least 1 follow-up visit, and were monitored until April 30, 2018.

Exposures

Upon enrollment, participants received daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumurate and emtricitabine for HIV PrEP, quarterly HIV and STI testing, and clinical monitoring.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was incidence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis. Incidence rates and hazard ratios describing behavioral risk factors of STI diagnosis were calculated. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs), adjusted for change in testing frequency, described changes in STI incidence from 1-year preenrollment to study follow-up among participants with preenrollment testing data (n = 1378).

Results

Among the 2981 individuals (median age, 34 years [interquartile range, 28–42]), 98.5% identified as gay or bisexual males, 29% used PrEP prior to enrollment, 89 (3%) withdrew and were censored at date of withdrawal, leaving 2892 (97.0%) enrolled at final follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 1.1 years (3185.0 person-years), 2928 STIs were diagnosed among 1427 (48%) participants (1434 chlamydia, 1242 gonorrhea, 252 syphilis). STI incidence was 91.9 per 100 person-years, with 736 participants (25%) accounting for 2237 (76%) of all STIs. Among 2058 participants with complete data for multivariable analysis, younger age, greater partner number, and group sex were associated with greater STI risk, but condom use was not. Among 1378 participants with preenrollment testing data, STI incidence increased from 69.5 per 100 person-years prior to enrollment to 98.4 per 100 person-years during follow-up (IRR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.29–1.56]). After adjusting for testing frequency, the increase in incidence from 1 year preenrollment to follow-up was significant for any STI (adjusted IRR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02–1.23]) and for chlamydia (adjusted IRR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04–1.33]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among gay and bisexual men using PrEP, STIs were highly concentrated among a subset, and receipt of PrEP after study enrollment was associated with an increased incidence of STIs compared with preenrollment. These findings highlight the importance of frequent STI testing among gay and bisexual men using PrEP.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^b83911ef]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services at follow-up HIV care visits provide all persons with HIV the following services: review of sexual, alcohol, and substance use histories since last visit to determine if behavioral risk-reduction interventions are warranted; review of STD symptoms since last visit and recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment to determine if STD testing, physical examination, or treatment is warranted; STD screening at least annually or more often if indicated by sexual risk behaviors; and review of sex partners who were not notified of possible HIV or STD exposure to determine if offering HIV partner services is warranted. For persons with a positive STD test; STD symptoms or signs; or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or experiencing STD symptoms, provide oral or injectable treatment onsite according to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines (including presumptive treatment [while awaiting STD test results] if indicated because of STD symptoms, or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment), advise to return 3 months after treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to obtain retesting for the relevant infection at the anatomic site of infection, advise persons diagnosed with syphilis to return for follow up serologic testing according to latest CDC recommendations, provide or refer to brief or intensive behavioral risk-reduction interventions, refer to voluntary HIV/STD partner services at health department or other trained partner services provider, and report cases of STD according to jurisdiction requirements and inform persons diagnosed with STD that case reporting may prompt health departments to offer voluntary, confidential partner services in some jurisdictions.

### Extragenital Chlamydia and gonorrhea among community venue-attending men who have sex with men-five cities, United States, 2017 [^52f9d9fe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a community venue–based sample of sexually active MSM, approximately one in eight participants was positive for either rectal or pharyngeal chlamydia or gonorrhea. Compared with chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence estimates among MSM derived from largely clinic-based samples, these estimates are lower. Persons screened for STDs in clinical settings (often STD clinics) might represent a population at higher risk (e.g. previous STD, larger number of sexual partners, and known or suspected STD exposure). This analysis demonstrates that risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea also might be high among MSM when sampled from nonclinical MSM community venues. This finding suggests that the general population of sexually active MSM might be at elevated risk for STDs and that bacterial STD prevalence estimates from STD clinic-based samples of MSM might not be substantially biased.

The current recommendation for sexually active MSM is to screen for STDs at all exposed anatomic sites at least annually, and MSM living with HIV infection likely have more opportunities for STD screening when in care. This study found a high prevalence of extragenital chlamydia and gonorrhea among MSM living with HIV, and the findings reinforce current HIV care guidance, which recommends that MSM who report receptive anal and oral sex should be screened for rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia, respectively, at their initial visit and at least annually thereafter.

Among this sample of MSM recruited at community venues, approximately one third reported that they had not been tested for an STD in the previous 12 months, suggesting that a substantial number of MSM at high risk for STDs are not being screened per current recommendations. Although the extragenital STD prevalence among these men was high, prevalence was similarly high among MSM who did report having been tested within the past 12 months. Among those tested in the previous 12 months, this survey did not record which testing was performed or how frequently these men were tested. More frequent (e.g. every 3–6 months) screening of MSM with elevated risk might be needed to reduce prevalence among those who are already being screened for STDs.

### Barriers to infectious disease care among lesbians [^434afd8d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Some sexual practices, including oral-genital sex, vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative sex toys, and oral-anal sex, are commonly practiced by female sex partners. Practices involving digital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared penetrative sex toys, present a plausible means for transmission of infected cervicovaginal secretions. This concept is most directly supported by reports of metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis and genotype-concordant HIV, which have been sexually transmitted between women who reported these behaviors. Reports of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission between women are anecdotal and largely unpublished; however, approximately 3%–5% of respondents to surveys assessing lesbians' lifetime history of these STIs indicate that a chlamydial infection had been diagnosed by a healthcare provider. Among 6,146 respondents in the National Lesbian and Bi Women's Health Survey, conducted in the early 1990s, women reported contracting an STI from a female partner (including herpes by 135 persons, chlamydia by 102, genital warts by 100, gonorrhea by 16, hepatitis by 9, and HIV by 1). Although self-report of STI history is often inaccurate (as is attribution of STI to a specific source partner), these data indicate that the respondents sought care for perceived genitourinary abnormalities and received a diagnosis that indicated the provider had reason to suspect an STI. The most important bacterial STI for which more precise data are needed is C. trachomatis infection. Although the rate of transmission of STIs between women is probably low relative to that of transmission from men to women, a substantial proportion of lesbians, including those who self-identify as lesbians, and especially younger women most at risk for chlamydial infection, may continue to have sex with men.

### Prevalence and incidence of pharyngeal gonorrhea in a longitudinal sample of men who have sex with men: the EXPLORE study [^2c9eeb05]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of gonorrhea of the pharynx among select samples of men who have sex with men (MSM) ranges from 9% to 15%. To our knowledge, there have been no longitudinal studies in a prospective MSM cohort to estimate pharyngeal gonorrhea incidence or predictors of infection. We examined the prevalence, incidence, and sociodemographic and behavioral predictors of pharyngeal gonorrhea in a cohort of sexually active, human immunodeficiency virus-negative MSM.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study of pharyngeal gonorrhea among MSM who were enrolled in a behavioral intervention study to prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection (Project EXPLORE). Participants were enrolled in this ancillary study from March 2001 through July 2003. At baseline and every 6 months thereafter until 31 July 2003, participants were tested for pharyngeal gonorrhea and were administered a questionnaire regarding their oral sex practices. Rectal and urethral gonorrhea testing were also performed.

Results

Prevalence of pharyngeal gonorrhea was 5.5% (136 cases diagnosed from 2475 tests). The incidence rate was 11.2 cases per 100 person-years. Pharyngeal gonorrhea was positively associated with younger age and the number of insertive oral sex partners in the past 3 months. Ejaculation did not increase the risk of pharyngeal gonorrhea. Gonorrhea of the pharynx was asymptomatic in 92% of cases.

Conclusions

The pharynx is a common, asymptomatic reservoir for gonorrhea in sexually active MSM.

### Oropharyngeal gonorrhea in absence of urogenital gonorrhea in sexual network of male and female participants, Australia, 2018 [^32b38927]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Oropharyngeal gonorrhea is considered to be acquired primarily from an infected penis during oral sex. However, male urethral gonorrhea is usually symptomatic, prompting men to seek treatment soon after symptoms appear, resulting in short duration of infectivity and low point prevalence. Thus, infected penises are unlikely to be the source to explain the observed high prevalence of oropharyngeal gonorrhea. To address this epidemiologic conundrum, we previously described a paradigm of gonorrhea transmission in which oropharyngeal gonorrhea can be acquired from a partner's oropharynx during tongue kissing, as originally proposed in the 1970s and 1980s. However, investigating whether kissing can lead to gonorrhea transmission has been difficult because kissing often occurs concurrently with other sexual acts. We describe a sexual network of 1 nonbinary, 2 male, and 4 female participants who were tested for gonorrhea at genital and oropharyngeal sites in early 2018 to explore gonorrhea transmission dynamics.

### Frequent transmission of gonorrhea in men who have sex with men [^1d1f7533]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Relatively little research has been done on gonorrhea transmission not involving the penis. Some observational studies support the potential transmission of gonorrhea between the pharynx and rectum, although this is not consistently described as a route of transmission in major textbooks. Studies have shown that receptive oro-anal sex has been associated with rectal infection, and oro-anal sex has been associated with pharyngeal gonorrhea (Technical Appendix Table).

We propose new models of gonorrhea transmission: throat-to-throat transmission through kissing and throat-to-anus transmission (and vice versa) through oro-anal sex (Figure, panel B). We propose that transmission to the penis occurs but contributes little to the reproductive rate because it is present there a short time relative to the other anatomic sites.

Unfortunately, there are few studies on gonorrhea transmission between the throats of sex partners to support or refute our suggestion. We did, however, find case reports of transmission through kissing from > 40 years ago, and kissing is a well-recognized transmission route for other Neisseria species. In a matched, case–control study of 15- to 19-year-olds, intimate kissing with multiple partners was associated with an odds ratio of 3.7 for meningococcal disease. One of the few cohort studies in MSM to ask about kissing showed it to be significantly associated with pharyngeal gonorrhea (Technical Appendix Table), but few studies have examined kissing behavior.

The frequent detection of gonorrhea in the saliva of men with pharyngeal infection suggests saliva likely plays a role in gonorrhea transmission. Saliva is central to oral sex, oro-anal sex, and even penile-anal sex; saliva is commonly used as lubricant.

### Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission from the oropharynx to the urethra among men who have sex with men [^df86cc7a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on the risk of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission from oropharynx to urethra. We examined urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity among men who have sex with men (MSM) seen at San Francisco City Clinic (San Francisco, CA) during 2007.

Methods

All patients who sought care at the San Francisco City Clinic (the only municipal sexually transmitted disease clinic in San Francisco) received a standardized interview conducted by clinicians. We estimated urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity for 2 groups of visits by MSM who visited during 2007: (1) men who reported their only urethral exposure was receiving fellatio in the previous 3 months and (2) men who reported unprotected insertive anal sex in the previous 3 months. Additionally, urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity was estimated, stratified by human immunodeficiency virus infection status, urogenital symptom history, and whether the patient had been a contact to a sex partner with either chlamydia or gonorrhea.

Results

Among MSM who reported only receiving fellatio, urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity were 4.8% and 4.1%, respectively. These positivity estimates were similar to positivity found among MSM who reported unprotected insertive anal sex.

Conclusions

A more complete understanding of the risks of transmission of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae from oropharynx to urethra will help inform prevention and screening programs.

KDIGO Living Kidney Donor — preventing infection transmission recommends evaluation steps that are "Not Graded", including that risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections should be assessed before donation, donor candidates should be assessed for factors associated with an increased likelihood of endemic or unexpected infections, donor candidates should complete a urinalysis and testing for HIV, HBV, HCV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Treponema pallidum (syphilis), and — if indicated — testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Strongyloides, Trypanosoma cruzi, West Nile virus, Histoplasmosis, and/or Coccidiomycosis; transplant programs should develop protocols to screen donor candidates for emerging infections with public health specialists; and donor infection risk factor and microbiological assessments should be performed or updated as close in time to donation as possible, with HIV, HBV and HCV screening current within 28 days of donation; if a donor candidate is found to have a potentially transmissible infection, the donor candidate, intended recipient and transplant program team should weigh the risks and benefits of proceeding with donation. The 2013 US Public Health Service (PHS) Guideline provides an evidence-based instrument to screen for behavioral factors associated with recent HIV, HBV, or HCV infection, and donors who meet one or more of its criteria should be identified as being at increased risk for recent HIV, HBV, and HCV infections; the first 6 factors address sexual contact, defined as any method of sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral contact, and include whether in the preceding 12 mo a donor had sex with a person known or suspected to have HIV, HBV, or HCV infections, if male had sex with another man, if female had sex with a man with a history of male-sex-with-male behavior, had sex in exchange for money or drugs, had sex with a person that has injected drugs for nonmedical reasons, or has injected drugs for nonmedical reasons; additional criteria include having been in lockup, jail, prison, or a juvenile correctional facility for more than 72 h in the preceding 12 mo and being newly diagnosed with or treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, or genital ulcers in the preceding 12 mo; donors who meet the following criterion should be identified as being at increased risk for recent HCV infection only: have you been on hemodialysis in the preceding 12 mo?

Global distribution and antimicrobial resistance — travel implications: The distribution of both STI and HIV prevalence and antimicrobial resistance to available treatment varies globally; some countries and regions have very high rates of infections with STIs or with HIV, and healthcare professionals and travelers should be aware of the burden of infections at planned destinations. International travelers having condomless sex with new partners can serve as a conduit for importing novel STIs or antimicrobial-resistant STIs, and rates of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates are higher in countries in Europe, South America, and Asia; multidrug-resistant gonorrhea infections have been associated with commercial sex and encounters that include oral sex during travel, and antimicrobial-resistant gonococcal infections should prompt healthcare professionals to ask about their travel histories and the travel histories of their sex partners.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0d70d27a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — research needs and gaps: Studies on assessing risk and for whom screening may be most effective are a high priority, and studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic men to reduce infection complications and transmission or acquisition of other STIs are also needed. Studies are needed to better understand the benefits and harms of screening specific populations at risk such as men who have sex with men, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with nonbinary gender identity. Prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is highest in the American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons, and studies providing information on differential access and effective prevention strategies for persons in these groups may help reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies with direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening pregnant persons, testing extragenital sites, dosing for concurrent STIs, and screening intervals would help provide more information for practice.

### Oropharyngeal gonorrhea in absence of urogenital gonorrhea in sexual network of male and female participants, Australia, 2018 [^f91935f4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Accumulating evidence suggests that tongue kissing might be a common mode of gonorrhea transmission. The observation that expectorated saliva from persons with oropharyngeal gonorrhea contains high loads of N. gonorrhoeae DNA suggests a plausible mechanism for transmission. The sexual network described here adds to this evidence. We also highlight the need for routine screening for oropharyngeal gonorrhea for all persons with multiple sexual partners.

### Kissing, fellatio, and analingus as risk factors for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men: a cross-sectional study [^bc3eeeb4]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gonorrhoea disproportionately affects gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and has substantially increased in many high-income countries since the 2010s. In Australia, the incidence of gonorrhoea among MSM attending sexual health clinics has increased from 14·1 per 100 person-years in 2010 to 24·6 per 100 person-years in 2017, and the most significant increase in incidence was in anorectal and oropharyngeal infections.

Reducing the incidence of gonorrhoea is a global public health priority because of the increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly at the oropharynx, which is an important anatomical site for the development of AMR through horizontal gene transfer. Gonorrhoea prevention programs have primarily focused on increasing condom use. However, condoms may not be effective for preventing oropharyngeal gonorrhoea because condoms are not commonly used during oral sex among MSM. Additionally, substantial reductions in condom use for anal sex which coincided with treatment as prevention (TasP)and the availability of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the late 2010s among MSM, make strategies to promote this approach challenging. This has led some investigators to explore the transmission of gonorrhoea in more detail to determine novel and effective interventions.

Past studies have shown that N. gonorrhoeae can be cultured in the saliva of individuals who have oropharyngeal gonorrhoea, suggesting that viable N. gonorrhoeae can be transmitted when saliva is exchanged through tongue-kissing, and this contention is also supported by several epidemiological studies. A number of cross-sectional studies have investigated kissing as a risk factor for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in MSM, but some of these studies reported exposures to all three anatomical sites of partners among male-male partnerships using categorical data (i.e. 'never', 'occasionally' or 'often') that seemed somewhat unclear or subjectiveand/or did not measure kissing in the absence of sex. Thus, these studies were not able to find the independent association between kissing and oropharyngeal gonorrhoea.

### Adult and pediatric emergency department sexually transmitted disease and HIV screening: programmatic overview and outcomes [^812f55b1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure the prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among emergency department (ED) patients who accept screening, and to assess treatment outcomes and risks for infection.

Methods

Research staff offered voluntary testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia (by urine transcription-mediated amplification) and HIV (by enzyme immunoassay/Western blot of oral mucosal transudate) to ED patients. Pediatric (15–21 years) and adult (22–29 years) patients were eligible for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing; patients aged 15–54 years were eligible for HIV testing. The authors surveyed behavioral risks of patients accepting HIV testing.

Results

From November 2003 to May 2004, 497 of 791 eligible pediatric patients (63%) and 1,000 of 2,180 eligible adult patients (46%) accepted screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and/or HIV. There were 41 patients infected with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or both among 380 pediatric patients (10.8%) and 11 of 233 adult patients (4.7%); 14 of 52 patients (27%) were treated presumptively by ED clinicians. Through study efforts, 33 of the 38 remaining patients were treated (90% overall treatment). Eight HIV infections were diagnosed: seven of 969 adult patients (0.7%) and one of 459 pediatric patients (0.2%); five HIV-infected patients (63%) received test results, and three (38%) attended an HIV clinic. Gonorrhea or chlamydia infection in pediatric patients was associated with multiple sex partners, same-sex intercourse, and suspicion of sexually transmitted diseases by the ED clinician.

Conclusions

The high prevalence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia infection among pediatric ED patients tested supports consideration of expanded screening. Targeted HIV screening with rapid tests merits exploration in the authors' ED, given the low-moderate numbers of patients identified through screening, receiving test results, and linked to care.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^25721ecd]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Testing for sexually transmitted infections in people prescribed preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — Tests to screen for syphilis are recommended for all adults prescribed PrEP, both at screening and at semi-annual visits; tests to screen for gonorrhea are recommended for all sexually active adults prescribed PrEP, both at screening and at semi-annual visits; tests to screen for chlamydia are recommended for all sexually active MSM prescribed PrEP, both at screening prior to initiation and at semi-annual visits. Because chlamydia is very common and does not strongly correlate with risk of HIV acquisition, regular screening for chlamydia is not recommended for all sexually active women as a component of PrEP care. For gonorrhea and chlamydia testing in MSM, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are preferred because of their sensitivity, and pharyngeal, rectal, and urine specimens should be collected ("3-site testing"); self-collected samples have equivalent performance as clinician-obtained samples and can help streamline patient visit flow. For gonorrhea testing in women, vaginal specimens for NAAT tests are preferred and may also be self-collected; for women who report engaging in anal sex, rectal specimens for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing should be collected in addition to vaginal specimens. Studies have estimated that 29% of HIV infections in women are linked to sex with MSM and that more than 1/3 of women report having had anal sex; in the HPTN 064 trial that recruited women at high risk of HIV acquisition, 38% reported condomless anal sex in the 6 months prior to enrollment. Identifying asymptomatic rectal gonorrhea in women at substantial risk for HIV infection and providing treatment can provide benefits to the woman's health and help reduce the burden of infection in her sexual networks as well, especially when accompanied by partner services or expedited partner therapy.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^15b25b40]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — potential preventable burden and harms note that chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis; uncommon complications include reactive arthritis and disseminated gonococcal infection; urogenital positivity among men who have sex with men was 6% for chlamydia and 7% for gonorrhea across 11 jurisdictions in 2019; infections at extragenital sites are typically asymptomatic; and these infections may increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Potential harms of screening include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety. Current practice data indicate that a review of claims from 4296 patients (2000 to 2003) found a large proportion of patients with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit, and billing codes for 1074 high-risk patients showed men were less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs 50.9%), but more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs 27.6%).

### Evidence for a new paradigm of gonorrhoea transmission: cross-sectional analysis ofinfections by anatomical site in both partners in 60 male couples [^194375fd]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gonorrhoea transmission between men is currently thought to occur primarily to and from the urethra. Transmission without urethral involvement, from throat-to-throat and throat-to-anus, is considered to be uncommon. Using gonorrhoea results from male couples, we aimed to investigate the transmission dynamics of gonorrhoea. If current medical consensus is correct, then most throat and anal infections should be explained by the partner's urethral infection.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional analysis of gonorrhoea diagnosed by nucleic acid amplification tests in both partners in male couples who attended Melbourne Sexual Health Centre together between March 2015 and June 2017. Isolates obtained from culture-positive infections underwent whole genome sequencing to assess phylogenetic relatedness between partners.

Results

In all 60 couples (120 men) at least one partner had gonorrhoea, and isolates had very high phylogenetic relatedness between partners. After excluding men with urethral gonorrhoea, among 32 men with anal gonorrhoea, 34% (95% CI 19% to 53%) had a partner with throat gonorrhoea. After excluding couples where either man had urethral gonorrhoea, among 48 couples in which at least one man had throat gonorrhoea, in 23% (95% CI 12% to 37%) of couples both men had throat gonorrhoea.

Conclusions

The observed gonorrhoea positivity when urethral infection is absent supports a new paradigm of gonorrhoea transmission, where the throat is a major source of gonorrhoea transmission between men, through tongue kissing, oroanal sex and saliva use as anal lubricant. Public health messages may need to address the risk of saliva exposure during sex.

### Validation of an abbreviated version of the Denver HIV risk score for prediction of HIV infection in an urban ED [^ec4cf8fe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Denver HIV risk score" for human immunodeficiency virus infection, syphilis, gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis infection.

The Denver HIV Risk Score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of HIV infection in patients. It is specifically designed for individuals who are undergoing HIV testing, particularly those who are considered to be at high risk due to their lifestyle, sexual behavior, or other risk factors. The score is calculated based on a variety of factors including age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual behavior, drug use, and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections. The clinical utility of this calculator is to help clinicians identify individuals who are at a higher risk of HIV infection and may benefit from more frequent testing or other preventive measures. It is not intended to be used as a diagnostic tool for HIV, but rather as a risk stratification tool. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may be less accurate in populations with a low prevalence of HIV.

The Denver HIV risk score is designed to assess an individual's likelihood of contracting HIV by evaluating six factors: age, gender, sexual practices, injection drug use, past HIV testing, and race/ethnicity. Each attribute is assigned a score based on predefined criteria, and the sum of these scores indicates the overall HIV risk level.

For age, individuals are placed into the following brackets, each with an associated score:

- **Under 22 years**: 0 points
- **22–25 years**: 4 points
- **26–32 years**: 10 points
- **33–46 years**: 12 points
- **47–54 years**: 10 points
- **55–60 years**: 4 points
- **Over 60 years**: 0 points

Gender scores are straightforward:

- **Male**: 21 points
- **Female**: 0 points

Sexual practices contribute the following scores:

- **Having sex with a man**: 22 points
- **Engaging in receptive anal intercourse**: 8 points
- **Participating in vaginal intercourse**: 10 points
- **None of the above sexual activities**: 0 points

Injection drug use adds to the risk score:

- **Yes**: 9 points
- **No**: 0 points

For past HIV testing, individuals receive:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

Race and ethnicity are scored as:

- **Black**: 9 points
- **Hispanic**: 3 points
- **White or Other**: 0 points

Once all points have been tallied, the total score illuminates the individual's level of risk. Interpretation of the score is as follows:

- A score of 0–19 indicates a very low risk of HIV.
- Scores between 20–29 suggest a low risk.
- Scores from 30–39 indicate a moderate risk.
- Scoring between 40–49 signifies a high risk.
- A score of 50 or above reveals a very high risk.

This strategic evaluation guides individuals in understanding their potential risk level, highlighting the importance of considering preventive measures and seeking relevant healthcare advice.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^c37d1042]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervicitis — presumptive therapy criteria and antimicrobial regimens — presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g., those aged < 25 years and women with specified partner risks), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected. For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option; if treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered. Recommended regimen: doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days; alternative regimen: azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose. Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high.

### Evaluation of WHO screening algorithm for the presumptive treatment of asymptomatic rectal gonorrhoea and Chlamydia infections in at-risk MSM in Kenya [^90bcff90]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over one-third of participating MSM were eligible to receive PT for NG or CT infection according to WHO criteria. The WHO algorithm was 74% sensitive for detecting rectal infections in 'at-risk' MSM, but had low specificity as expected. For every four MSM meeting the criteria, one infection would be treated in this population. Overall, the WHO algorithm performed poorly, and this would not improve using alternative criteria. While the WHO algorithm currently requires that healthcare workers ask men about three risk factors (ie, unprotected RAI, sex with multiple partners, and partners with an STI), a PT algorithm based only on unprotected RAI in the past 6 months would be easier to use. According to our results, such an algorithm would have a slightly better sensitivity but lower specificity. Similarly to the WHO algorithm, for every four MSM reporting unprotected RAI, one infection would be treated.

Recent studies among mostly MSM sex workers in capital cities of Uganda, Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire reported high (3.1–8.5%) rectal NG prevalence, but data were not presented specifically for MSM reporting RAI. In a recent study by our group, RAI and symptomatic NG infection in the past 6 months were the strongest predictors of HIV-1 acquisition in MSM, who had an overall HIV-1 incidence of 8.6 (95% CI 6.7 to 11.0) per 100 PY. As Kenyan MSM are often unaware of the risks that RAI poses for HIV-1 and STI acquisition, risk-reduction counselling for these men should focus on sexual role-taking and condom use. However, frontline health workers in Kenya lack sensitivity training on male same-sex behaviour and the prevention needs of MSM, and may find it difficult to establish who qualifies for PT or provide effective counselling messages. They also face challenges in offering effective treatment, as national Kenyan guidelines recommend quinolones as a first-line regimen, and wide-spread resistance of NG to quinolones has emerged in Kenya. Directly observed treatment with ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscularly immediately) or cefixime (400 mg by mouth immediately) and doxycycline (100 mg by mouth twice a week for 7 days) or azithromycin (1.0 g by mouth immediately) are currently the optimal PTs for 'at-risk' MSM meeting WHO criteria.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^57b31dd3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Other Management Considerations

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies and reduce complications and transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed. If medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present). All persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

A test of cure (i.e. repeat testing after completion of therapy) is unnecessary for persons who receive a diagnosis of uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens. Any person with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days after initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or NAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased likelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort should be made to perform a confirmatory culture before retreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All positive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or without simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused by other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).

A high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection has been observed among men and women previously treated for gonorrhea. The majority of these infections result from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient education and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment.

### Update to CDC's sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2010: oral cephalosporins no longer a recommended treatment for gonococcal infections [^06661c51]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is a major cause of serious reproductive complications in women and can facilitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Effective treatment is a cornerstone of U.S. gonorrhea control efforts, but treatment of gonorrhea has been complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop antimicrobial resistance. This report, using data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), describes laboratory evidence of declining cefixime susceptibility among urethral N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in the United States during 2006–2011 and updates CDC's current recommendations for treatment of gonorrhea. Based on GISP data, CDC recommends combination therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and either azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the most reliably effective treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. CDC no longer recommends cefixime at any dose as a first-line regimen for treatment of gonococcal infections. If cefixime is used as an alternative agent, then the patient should return in 1 week for a test-of-cure at the site of infection.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^ceb34e0d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

T. vaginalis can cause urethritis among heterosexual men; however, the prevalence varies substantially by U.S. geographic region, age, and sexual behavior and within specific populations. Studies among men with and without overt urethritis in developed countries document relatively low rates of T. vaginalis in the Netherlands (0.5%), Japan (1.3%), the United States (2.4%), and the United Kingdom (3.6%). Studies in other countries have documented higher rates, such as in Croatia (8.2%) and Zimbabwe (8.4%), particularly among symptomatic patients.

Neisseria meningitidis can colonize mucosal surfaces and cause urethritis. Urogenital N. meningitidis rates and duration of carriage, prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, and modes of transmission have not been systematically described; however, studies indicate that N. meningitidis can be transmitted through oral-penile contact (i.e. fellatio). N. meningitidis has similar colony morphology appearance on culture and cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram stain. Identification of N. meningitidis as the etiologic agent with presumed gonococcal urethritis on the basis of Gram stain but negative NAAT for gonorrhea requires a confirmation by culture. Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis. Although evidence is limited regarding the risk for sexual transmission or recurrent infections with meningococcal urethritis, treatment of sex partners of patients with meningococcal urethritis with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered. No indication exists for treating persons with N. meningitidis identified in their oropharynx when not also associated with symptomatic urethritis.

### Rationale and ethical assessment of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea controlled human infection model [^b98fad2f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of treatment failure is another consideration. The oropharynx is typically colonized with numerous organisms, including commensal Neisseria species. There is a risk that the N gonorrhoeae challenge strain may acquire AMR due to horizontal genetic exchange. Although such transformation can occur rapidly in vitro, the prospective development of resistance in the oropharynx has not been studied. These risks could be mitigated by excluding participants at higher risk of carrying oral flora with AMR determinants (eg, those with antimicrobial exposure in the past 6 months). Additionally, using challenge strains susceptible to multiple antimicrobial classes would ensure that multiple treatment options are available in case resistance develops in vivo.

Furthermore, there is a risk of genetic exchange of virulence determinants from N gonorrhoeae to N meningitidis isolates at the oropharyngeal site, which may increase the risk for this potential pathogen to cause disease. Recombination events between N gonorrhoeae and N meningitidis have been observed with the US N meningitidis urethritis clonal complex 11.2 clade (N m UC), which has caused outbreaks of meningococcal urethritis in men since 2015. Virulence factors acquired from N gonorrhoeae have been identified through genomic analysis of these isolates, including the aniA - norB denitrification apparatus and isp, both of which may promote N m UC growth and survival in the microaerobic urethral environment. The risk of exchange of N gonorrhoeae virulence determinants to potentially pathogenic commensal N meningitidis isolates in the oropharynx during oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM could be mitigated by excluding participants with nasopharyngeal meningococcal carriage in the week prior to challenge.

The risk of long-term sequelae of N gonorrhoeae infection largely occurs in women and neonates. These risks can be mitigated by excluding women from gonorrhea CHIM studies. Although N gonorrhoeae would not be inoculated in the urogenital tract in an oropharyngeal model, there is an undetermined risk of self-inoculation and ascending genital infection, which may result in unacceptable long-term damage to the female reproductive system.

Challenge models involving a sexually transmitted infection could plausibly involve psychosocial risks, including potential stigma. A key aspect of the development and ethical assessment of any proposed CHIM is community consultation and engagement. This is particularly important for a CHIM involving a sexually transmitted infection. Formal community consultation and qualitative research exploring the attitudes of key stakeholders, including potentially eligible CHIM participants, are arguably essential for the ethical acceptability of a gonorrhea CHIM.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^fb652973]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician implementation — screening intervals and treatment notes that in the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach is to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result, and that chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics; because treatment varies by patient and antibiotic resistance for gonorrhea is increasing, clinicians are encouraged to consult the most up-to-date guidance on treatment from the CDC.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^0da06de4]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV partner services — indications and provider actions are as follows: Newly diagnosed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that indicate recent unprotected sex and facilitate HIV transmission — primary and secondary syphilis; gonorrhea and chlamydial infection (including rectal infection); herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2); and trichomoniasis (in women); increased risk of HIV transmission due to pregnancy; behaviors that pose a high risk of exposing others to HIV (e.g., multiple, anonymous partners; having unprotected sex with persons with negative or unknown HIV-infection status; sharing drug-injection equipment); and a specific request for partner services. Ask index patients if they have disclosed their HIV infection to all sex and drug-injection partners and if self-notification would pose any risks, promptly refer index patients to health department partner services directly or through HIV case reporting according to the methods of the jurisdiction, if the index patient declines referral for health department assistance, offer partner services as appropriate to the provider's legal authority and skills and the index patient's preferences, and offer services to partners who are referred by index patients as appropriate to the provider's legal authority and skills.

### Global resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: when theory becomes reality [^35253744]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gonococcal urethritis:

- **Definition**: Gonococcal urethritis is a STI of the urethra caused by N. gonorrhoeae.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of gonococcal urethritis involves N. gonorrhoeae invading the urethral epithelium, adhering to epithelial cells, multiplying, and initiating an inflammatory response. The infection is transmitted by direct inoculation of infected secretions from one mucosal surface to another. Antibiotic resistance is associated with specific gene mutations, including penA, penB, and mtrR for penicillin resistance, rpsJ, penB, and mtrR for tetracycline resistance, and gyrA and parC for fluoroquinolone resistance.
- **Epidemiology**: Gonococcal infection is the second most common STI in US, with a reported incidence of 1,264 per 100,000 in men and 1,611 per 100,000 in women.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for gonococcal urethritis include unprotected sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, and a history of STIs.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of gonococcal urethritis typically involves symptoms such as mucopurulent urethral discharge, dysuria, and erythema of the urethral meatus. However, asymptomatic cases can occur, especially in men.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of gonococcal urethritis is generally good with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Untreated cases can lead to complications such as epididymitis, prostatitis, and disseminated gonococcal infection.

### Risk factors for and trends in gonorrhea incidence among persons infected with HIV in the United States [^846e356a]. AIDS (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk factors for and trends in gonorrhea infections among HIV-infected persons.

Design

Longitudinal review of medical records of HIV-infected patients.

Methods

We analyzed data about HIV-infected patients obtained from 1991 to 1998 in over 100 facilities participating in the Adult/Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project.

Results

The overall incidence of gonorrhea was 9.5 cases per 1000 person — years. Factors associated with higher gonorrhea incidence (P < 0.01) included younger age, male — male sex, black race, HIV infection without AIDS (namely AIDS-defining opportunistic illness or CD4 cell count < 200 × 10⁶ cells/l), and recent recreational use of injection or non-injection drugs. There was an increase in the trend among men who have sex with men (P < 0.01) and a decrease in the trend among patients with heterosexual contact as their HIV exposure risk (P < 0.01). Among injection drug users there was no significant trend from 1991 to 1996, but there was an increase in gonorrhea incidence from 6.6 cases/1000 person-years in 1997 to 16.3 cases/1000 person — years in 1998.

Conclusions

Following HIV diagnosis, some individuals continue to practice risky sexual behaviors which result in gonorrhea and may transmit HIV. The increase in the trend in gonorrhea incidence among HIV-infected men who have sex with men is of particular concern because it suggests an increase in risky sexual behaviors. These findings indicate a need for effective HIV prevention strategies that involve reducing risky sexual behaviors in HIV-infected persons.

### Incidence of gonorrhea and Chlamydia following human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men: a modeling study [^add27a43]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective for preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but risk compensation (RC) in men who have sex with men (MSM) raises concerns about increased sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) PrEP guidelines recommend biannual STI screening, which may reduce incidence by treating STIs that would otherwise remain undiagnosed. We investigated these two counteracting phenomena.

Methods

With a network-based mathematical model of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) transmission dynamics among MSM in the United States, we simulated PrEP uptake following the prescription indications and HIV/STI screening recommendations in the CDC guidelines. Scenarios varied PrEP coverage (the proportion of MSM indicated for PrEP who received it), RC (a reduction in the per-act probability of condom use), and the STI screening interval.

Results

In our reference scenario (40% coverage, 40% RC), 42% of NG and 40% of CT infections would be averted over the next decade. A doubling of RC would still result in net STI prevention relative to no PrEP. STIs declined because PrEP-related STI screening resulted in a 17% and 16% absolute increase in the treatment of asymptomatic and rectal STIs, respectively. Screening and timely treatment at quarterly vs biannual intervals would reduce STI incidence an additional 50%.

Conclusions

Implementation of the CDC PrEP guidelines while scaling up PrEP coverage could result in a significant decline in STI incidence among MSM. Our study highlights the design of PrEP not only as antiretroviral medication but as combination HIV/STI prevention incorporating STI screening.

### A gonococcal vaccine has the potential to rapidly reduce the incidence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection among urban men who have sex with men [^f967b245]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Here we model the potential impact on gonorrhea prevalence of vaccinating 15%, 30%, and 60% of MSM participating in routine STI testing each year, with and without booster vaccination. We investigate gonococcal vaccines that differ in their ability to prevent infection at all sites or at specific anatomical sites (protective efficacy), reduce transmission (transmission suppression efficacy), and/or reduce symptoms of infection (symptom suppression efficacy).

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives ("the birth control pill"
or "the pill") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of
birth control. Although oral contraceptives have important advantages over other
methods of contraception, they have certain risks that no other method has, and
some of these risks may continue after you have stopped using the oral
contraceptive. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need
to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of
developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to
use Jolessa™properly so that it will be as effective as
possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion
between you and your healthcare provider. You should discuss the information
provided in this leaflet with your healthcare provider, both when you first
start taking Jolessa™and during your revisits. You
should also follow your healthcare provider's advice with regard to regular
check-ups while you are on Jolessa™.

### Oropharyngeal gonorrhea in absence of urogenital gonorrhea in sexual network of male and female participants, Australia, 2018 [^4aef1346]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

No men in this network had urethral gonorrhea, suggesting that the oropharynx-to-penis route has a lower transmission probability than tongue kissing. This finding is consistent with an existing mathematical model that included transmission by kissing, which calculated a per-act transmission of 1% for oral sex and 17% for kissing. Few observational studies have examined transmission by kissing, but 1 study of male couples found 26% concordance of oropharyngeal gonorrhea between partners.

Because this report describes sexual contacts that occurred at a music festival, participants' recall might have been affected by alcohol or drugs. Also, awareness of being part of a study involving sexual partners could have affected participants' willingness to disclose information. However, recall was consistent between participants, suggesting that their recall was accurate.

### USPSTF recommendations for STI screening [^2132e275]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Since 2000, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has issued eight clinical recommendation statements on screening for sexually transmitted infections. This article, written on behalf of the USPSTF, is an overview of these recommendations. The USPSTF recommends that women at increased risk of infection be screened for chlamydia, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis. Men at increased risk should be screened for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis. All pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis; pregnant women at increased risk also should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Nonpregnant women and men not at increased risk do not require routine screening for sexually transmitted infections. Engaging in high-risk sexual behavior places persons at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. The USPSTF recommends that all sexually active women younger than 25 years be considered at increased risk of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Because not all communities present equal risk of sexually transmitted infections, the USPSTF encourages physicians to consider expanding or limiting the routine sexually transmitted infection screening they provide based on the community and populations they serve.

### Rationale and ethical assessment of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea controlled human infection model [^3206ef51]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation

For the risk assessment of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM, it is essential to consider the risks to individuals and the community (Table 1).

Table 1.
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Procedures of an Oropharyngeal Gonorrhea Controlled Human Infection Model for Participants and the Community

Although rare, the development of DGI is the most severe immediate complication that requires mitigation for the safety of the CHIM participant. In recent studies that utilized public health notification data, DGI represented 0.06% to 1.3% of all gonorrhea cases. However, the proportion of gonorrhea infections that present with DGI as reported in these studies is likely an overestimate due to underascertainment of asymptomatic oropharyngeal gonorrhea. A single-center study from the 1970s suggested that oropharyngeal gonorrhea may be associated with DGI, due to the observation that N gonorrhoeae was isolated in 10 of 60 individuals with DGI over a 2-year period. Yet, no clear association between oropharyngeal infection and DGI has been demonstrated in contemporary studies comprising systematically collected mandatory gonorrhea notification data. Interpretation of associations between oropharyngeal gonorrhea and DGI may be confounded by factors such as heterogeneous sample collection from asymptomatic mucosal sites in individuals with DGI. Given that the median duration of N gonorrhoeae carriage at the oropharynx is 16 weeks, it is plausible that extended carriage may increase the risk of systemic infection. This risk can be mitigated in an oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM by terminating infection with effective antimicrobials after several days of infection, selecting a strain without specific features associated with DGI, and excluding participants with reported risk factors for DGI (eg, complement deficiency, immunocompromise, and drug and/or alcohol misuse). Although the oropharyngeal gonorrhea model can be designed to mitigate risk, the risk of DGI cannot be eliminated. Importantly, DGI and other invasive forms of N gonorrhoeae infection remain treatable and are rarely associated with long-term morbidity or mortality if treated early. Many CHIM studies have been undertaken with treatable pathogens that cause potentially severe systemic disease, including malaria and typhoid. The rates of serious adverse events associated with CHIM studies is low, with 0.2% among 10 016 participants in a recent systematic review. This demonstrates that careful CHIM study design can mitigate disease risks associated with human challenge.

### Bridging of Neisseria gonorrhoeae lineages across sexual networks in the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis era [^731da650]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In our study, all major MSM-associated N. gonorrhoeae clusters included HIV-positive and HIV-negative men, providing compelling evidence for sexual mixing and gonococcal transmission between HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM — including those not taking PrEP. Although it is likely that most HIV-infected patients in our setting are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) with undetectable viral load (posing no risk for HIV transmission), our observation of gonorrhoea transmission across HIV risk groups has potential implications for the spread of HIV in other geographic settings where adherence or access to ART is problematic. Moreover, our data further highlight the need for improved access to PrEP in high-risk individuals, such as those in our study with confirmed STI transmission.

Female sex workers with gonorrhoea were scattered in primarily heterosexual networks, suggesting sex workers may have played a role in facilitating transmission. Oropharyngeal gonorrhoea was the most common site of infection in female sex workers (occurring in approximately three-quarters of female sex workers in this study). In Victoria, sex work is legal, although under the Sex Work Act (1994) and Sex Work Regulations (2006), quarterly screening for HIV and other STIs is required. Here, we demonstrate that oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in female sex workers is part of major heterosexual-associated transmission networks, despite previous work in Australia suggesting a high level of condom use during fellatio with male clients. Recently, kissing has been suggested as a risk factor for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea amongst MSM, but to date, there have been no studies investigating kissing as a risk factor for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in sex workers.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^e3fad380]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services — health department strategies to promote services that may prevent HIV transmission include educating providers and laboratories about the role of STD preventive services in HIV prevention, the latest CDC recommendations for STD screening and treatment, the benefits of screening MSM for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection in nongenital sites, N. gonorrhoeae antimicrobial drug resistance and the need for laboratory capacity for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to evaluate treatment failures, voluntary health department partner services, and case reporting and surveillance case definitions for STD; educating the community about the local burden of STDs and the role of STD preventive services in clinical and nonclinical settings for HIV prevention; increasing access to routine behavioral risk-reduction services, STD screening services, and latex or polyurethane condoms in clinical and nonclinical settings; and increasing laboratory capacity to screen rectal and oropharyngeal specimens for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and to monitor gonococcal antimicrobial drug resistance trends using culture tests.
