## Question

A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of painful vision loss in her left eye. The patient is otherwise healthy with a history only notable for a few emergency department presentations for numbness and tingling in her extremities with no clear etiology of her symptoms. Her temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 122/83 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Examination of the patient's cranial nerves reveals an inability to adduct the left eye when the patient is asked to look right. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?
A. Estriol
B. Glatiramer acetate
C. Interferon-beta
D. Methylprednisolone

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which treatment is most appropriate for a 34-year-old woman with sudden painful vision loss in the left eye and a left medial rectus palsy on right gaze, likely representing optic neuritis with a concurrent internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and localize the lesion. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies, especially demyelinating disease. Next, I will review the evidence-based acute treatment for optic neuritis and whether timing matters. After that, I need to check the role of disease-modifying therapies and why they are not first-line for acute attacks. Finally, I will consider dosing, alternatives, and what to do if steroids fail, before selecting the best option among the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and localization. Sudden painful vision loss with a relative afferent pupillary defect and optic disc changes points to optic neuritis, while inability to adduct the left eye on right gaze indicates a left medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion causing an internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which localizes to the brainstem and strengthens the case for a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis or an antibody-mediated demyelinating disorder rather than a purely ocular cause [^fce191ce] [^e044e718].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the differential. Typical optic neuritis in young women is most often demyelinating and can be the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis, but I need to keep atypical forms in mind, including AQP4-IgG–positive NMOSD and MOGAD, which can present with severe vision loss and may be steroid responsive or dependent. Early recognition matters because management and prognosis differ, and delays can worsen outcomes [^fce191ce] [^0ae6ffd6] [^696cdf31].

> Next, I should review the evidence-based acute treatment. High-dose corticosteroids are the standard of care for acute optic neuritis. They accelerate visual recovery without changing the final visual outcome in typical MS-associated ON, and this principle is supported by the ONTT and subsequent reviews, with IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days being the conventional regimen, often followed by an oral taper depending on context [^ba2fba2b] [^fce191ce] [^34201220].

> Wait, let me verify the timing claim. I initially thought steroids must be started within 48 hours to be effective, but that overstates the ONTT protocol. The ONTT enrolled patients within about 8 days and showed faster recovery with IV steroids, not a hard 48-hour deadline, so I should correct that. However, in antibody-mediated ON (AQP4 or MOG), emerging data suggest that earlier treatment, ideally within about 7 days and possibly even within 4 days, is associated with substantially better visual outcomes, so I should emphasize prompt initiation even if the exact window varies by subtype [^6d98ef51] [^c814e0b0].

> I need to ensure I distinguish acute attack therapy from disease modification. Glatiramer acetate and interferon-beta are disease-modifying therapies for MS that reduce relapse risk over time. They are not treatments for acute optic neuritis attacks and would not address the current inflammatory episode, so they are inappropriate as first-line therapy here [^4fc8f824].

> Let me consider the provided options carefully. Estriol is not standard therapy for acute optic neuritis. Glatiramer acetate and interferon-beta are maintenance DMTs, not acute treatments. Methylprednisolone is the only option aligned with guideline-based acute care for optic neuritis, and the FDA-labeled dosing for optic neuritis is 1,000 mg IV daily for 3–5 days, which matches contemporary practice patterns [^34201220] [^ba2fba2b].

> But wait, what if this is atypical or antibody-mediated ON. I should double-check escalation pathways. In severe attacks or steroid-refractory cases, particularly when NMOSD or MOGAD is suspected, early plasma exchange or immunoadsorption is recommended as rescue therapy, and guidelines endorse early escalation if there is inadequate response to high-dose steroids, given the risk of poor recovery with delays [^3f30101c] [^e1fface3] [^7a747bc2].

> I will now examine practical next steps. Immediate initiation of IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days is appropriate, with concurrent planning for MRI of the brain and orbits with fat suppression, visual evoked potentials, and antibody testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG to refine etiology and guide long-term management. If there is no meaningful improvement within days, escalate to plasma exchange without delay [^e044e718] [^3f30101c] [^e1fface3].

> Final answer: D. Methylprednisolone, because high-dose IV corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for acute optic neuritis and should be started promptly to accelerate recovery, with early escalation to plasma exchange if the response is inadequate or if antibody-mediated disease is suspected [^ba2fba2b] [^34201220] [^3f30101c].

---

The most appropriate treatment is **high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone** [^34201220] for 3–5 days [^ba2fba2b] to accelerate visual recovery in acute optic neuritis, especially when accompanied by a brainstem sign (internuclear ophthalmoplegia) suggesting demyelination [^fce191ce]. Estriol is not indicated, and glatiramer acetate or interferon-beta are **disease-modifying therapies** for long-term MS prevention, not for acute attacks [^4fc8f824]. Early steroid therapy improves short-term outcomes [^ba2fba2b], though it does not change long-term visual prognosis [^edda3341].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and significance

The patient's presentation of **painful vision loss** with impaired adduction of the left eye on right gaze (internuclear ophthalmoplegia) strongly suggests demyelinating optic neuritis with a brainstem lesion, most consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS) [^fce191ce]. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia results from a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a hallmark of brainstem demyelination in MS [^notfound].

---

## Evidence-based treatment for acute optic neuritis

High-dose intravenous corticosteroids are the **standard of care** for acute optic neuritis [^ba2fba2b], as they accelerate visual recovery without altering long-term visual outcomes [^edda3341]. The recommended regimen is methylprednisolone 1,000 mg intravenously once daily for 3–5 days [^34201220], often followed by an oral prednisone taper [^0c8a3691].

---

## Comparison of treatment options

| **Treatment option** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Methylprednisolone | High-dose corticosteroid reducing inflammation and demyelination | Strong evidence supporting accelerated visual recovery in acute optic neuritis [^ba2fba2b] [^c60084a5] | First-line treatment for acute optic neuritis |
| Glatiramer acetate | Disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for MS | Not indicated for acute attacks; used for long-term relapse prevention [^4fc8f824] | Long-term management of MS, not acute optic neuritis |
| Interferon-beta | DMT for MS | Not indicated for acute attacks; used for long-term relapse prevention [^4fc8f824] | Long-term management of MS, not acute optic neuritis |
| Estriol | Estrogen hormone | No evidence supporting use in acute optic neuritis or demyelinating diseases | Not indicated |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus **strongly recommend high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone** as the first-line treatment for acute optic neuritis, particularly when demyelination is suspected [^ba2fba2b] [^0c8a3691]. This approach is supported by multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrating accelerated visual recovery [^c60084a5] [^edda3341].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of methylprednisolone

Benefits include **accelerated visual recovery** [^ba2fba2b] and reduced inflammation, whereas risks include short-term adverse effects such as insomnia, mood changes, gastrointestinal upset, and transient hyperglycemia. Long-term risks are minimal with short courses, but monitoring for infections and gastrointestinal complications is recommended [^edda3341].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's presentation and current clinical evidence, **high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone** is the most appropriate treatment [^34201220]. This approach aligns with established clinical guidelines and will expedite visual recovery while further diagnostic workup and long-term management planning are undertaken [^ba2fba2b].

### Recurrent optic neuritis and perineuritis followed by an unexpected discovery: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^d7aa3b49]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

In September 2020, a 67-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of left eye burning and difficulty reading fine print (Figure 1). Her clinical history dates to January 2009 when she presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful central vision loss in her right eye. The ophthalmologic examination at that time was remarkable for a visual acuity (VA) of 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. There was decreased color vision in the right eye, a right relevant afferent pupillary defect, and right optic disc swelling with areas of hemorrhage. The aquaporin-4 antibody (anti-AQP4; assessed by cell-based assay [CBA]) was negative, and she was diagnosed with right anterior optic neuritis (ON).

Figure 1
Chronologic Heat Map

In this figure, we detail the condition of the patient over time. The longitudinal axis (left to right) depicts the condition of disease, where the smaller amplitude and lighter color indicates greater stability of disease. Alternately, the expanded amplitude of the colored heat map (above and below the horizontal linear axis over time) designates increased disease activity (whether on a clinical or paraclinical basis) or complications of the treatment of disease. Other fields of information are added either above or below the heat map and include information about treatments, diagnoses, commentaries adding contextual perspectives, and results from specific test assessments from each most relevant period of clinical decision-making. Each field is consistently color-coded throughout as defined in the figure legend.

MRI of the brain and orbits (with fat suppression) with and without contrast (Figure 2) showed greater than 50% T1 enhancement of the right optic nerve extending to the level of the optic chiasm and with prechiasmatic involvement of the contralateral optic nerve, most consistent with an inflammatory process localized to the orbital segments of the optic nerves and sheath (i.e. perineuritis). MRI of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord was unremarkable. CT of the chest was normal.

### Clinical reasoning: a 56-year-old woman with new-onset hoarseness and dysphagia [^d4b372d2]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Statement Of The Clinical Problem Addressed By The Case

We report an atypical clinical presentation of a rapidly progressive neurologic emergency that required prompt investigation and treatment of impending respiratory failure. We discuss the differential diagnosis, evaluation, emergency management, and treatment options of patients with atypical variants of this disorder.

Brief Description Of Case Presentation

A 56-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after an upper respiratory and ear infection with cough, pain with sinus palpation, tingling in her fingers bilaterally and right foot, hives, and an episode of blurry vision on awakening. She was discharged home with antibiotics. That evening, she developed rapidly progressing hoarseness and dysphagia and returned to the emergency department. An initial examination and laryngoscopy revealed complete left vocal cord paralysis, consistent with a left cranial nerve X palsy, which prompted a neurologic evaluation. Her examination progressively worsened over the next day requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.

Summary Of The Key Teaching Point In The Case

New-onset bulbar cranial neuropathies should raise concern for neurologic disorders that can be rapidly progressive and result in respiratory failure. Urgent diagnosis and treatment are warranted.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^6307aed4]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Over the past decade, the role of ophthalmologists in diagnosing and managing ON has evolved significantly. The diverse causes of ON, many of which require urgent intervention, have highlighted the criticality of timely management in ON, akin to stroke care, under the principle of "time is vision". Effective collaboration with neuro-ophthalmologists or neurologists is essential for specialised investigation and treatment. Ophthalmologists have a vital role to play in advancing the differential diagnosis, taking the time-critical first decisions about investigation and management and identifying conditions that may arise as complications of treatment.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient's presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 74-year-old woman who presents to the emergency department with a 3-month history of bilateral leg weakness and paresthesia. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Obliteration of carotid-cavernous fistulas using direct surgical and coil-assisted embolization: technical case report [^9533be3f]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Carotid cavernous fistulas (CCF) type-D are often refractory to endovascular treatment. Surgery for these lesions is a well-described alternative option. A case of combined pretemporal approach to the cavernous sinus and direct coiling of CCF is presented as well as treatment options in cases of recurrent and intractable fistulas.

Clinical Presentation

A 58-year-old woman with three years' history of double vision, headache, and numbness of the right upper extremity. On clinical examination she was noted to have congestion in the left eye with neurological examination without any deficits. Angiography revealed a type-D fistula.

Intervention

Patient underwent craniozygomatic pretemporal approach and direct coiling of the fistula. Intraoperative angiogram was done to confirm adequate obliteration of the fistula and preservation of flow in the parent artery.

Conclusion

Although the first-line treatment option for symptomatic cavernous sinus fistulas is endovascular embolization, surgery is indicated in cases where it fails to achieve satisfactory results. This is especially important when the patient has progressive neurological deficit, and in cases of compromised venous drainage. Direct coil-assisted obliteration of the fistula is a successful treatment option for these lesions.

### Sudden vision loss… [^dfb60553]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Muth CC. Sudden Vision Loss. JAMA. 2017; 318:

584. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.7950 Vision loss is caused by problems at any point along the visual pathway from the eyes to the brain, and sudden vision loss is an emergency. The process of vision involves light passing into the eye and being transformed into electrical signals that are processed in the brain. Light enters the eye through an opening called the pupil and is changed into electrical signals by cells located toward the back of the eye in the retina. These signals then travel from the eyes through the optic nerves to the brain. In the brain, the occipital lobes process the visual information to make sense of it. Problems at any point along this visual pathway can cause vision loss. Sudden vision loss is vision loss that occurs over a period of a few seconds or minutes to a few days. Vision may become blurry or cloudy, completely absent, or affected by flashing lights or specks in the visual field called floaters.

Part of the field of vision or the entire field of vision may be affected. It is helpful to cover one eye and then the other to determine whether one eye or both eyes are affected. Sudden vision loss is most often painless but may be associated with eye pain, redness, and headache. Any sudden change in vision is potentially serious, even if it involves only part of the visual field or resolves on its own. Common causes of sudden vision loss include eye trauma, blockage of blood flow to or from the retina, and pulling of the retina away from its usual position at the back of the eye. Inflammation of the blood vessels that supply the eye and the optic nerve or inflammation of the optic nerve itself can also cause vision loss. A sudden blockage of blood flow to the occipital lobe of the brain is another common cause of sudden vision loss.

Sudden vision loss is a medical emergency, and anyone with sudden vision loss should seek medical attention quickly. Evaluation may include an eye examination and a neurological examination to test the function of the eyes and brain. Blood tests and brain imaging tests may also be ordered as part of the initial evaluation. The examination and tests are performed to look for specific eye problems as well as generalized medical conditions that may be related to the vision loss. Vision loss due to problems with the eye may be treated with eye drops, medications, or surgery. If inflammation is the cause of the vision loss, steroids may be used. If the vision loss is caused by a sudden blockage of a blood vessel, treatment is directed at improving blood flow as soon as possible. Depending on the cause, vision loss can be minimized or reversed if treatment occurs quickly.

### Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence [^7242eed4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Given these limitations, h it is not surprising that more recent non-inferiority trials have refuted the finding that intravenous corticosteroid treatment is superior to oral administration.

The ONTT leaves unanswered at least two vital questions. If steroids are given within some 'critical window' of symptom onset, are they efficacious, in certain types of ON, or even in patients with demyelinating ON? Also if patients with ON of uncertain aetiology at presentation are given steroids promptly (eg, within 48 hours), can blindness be averted? Persisting uncertainty from this landmark trial has resulted in controversy and ongoing practice variation internationally, and the stakes are high. In this opinion piece, a case is made on the need for a new corticosteroid versus placebo treatment trial in ON.

### "Will the real demyelinating disorder please stand up? ": from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^f2c50038]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 46-year-old White man presented with 2 weeks of progressive left-sided vision loss with associated pain with extraocular movement (EOM), headache, and photophobia. He further reported several weeks of circumferential numbness and tingling in his distal left lower extremity (LLE). He did not have any bowel or bladder dysfunction and denied any sensory symptoms along the torso. He denied any preceding trauma, surgery, vaccination, or infection. He had never had an event like this before. His medical history was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use disorder, and he had no personal or family history of autoimmune disease.

His general examination was unremarkable with normal vital, cardiopulmonary, and skin examinations. His ophthalmologic examination revealed poor visual acuity (VA) on the left with only the ability to count fingers (CF) at 3 feet and normal high contrast VA on the right. He also had pain with EOM testing and positive afferent pupillary defect in the left eye but no evidence of optic disc edema or pallor and normal-appearing vessels on fundoscopic examination. Neurologic examination was notable for symmetrically brisk 3+ patellar reflexes with crossed adductors and moderately decreased vibratory sense at the left great toe but otherwise intact cranial nerve (other than optic findings), motor, coordination, and gait assessments.

He was admitted to the inpatient neurology service for further diagnostic evaluation and management. MRI of orbits revealed abnormal T2 signal and contrast enhancement of the intraorbital segment of the left optic nerve with optic nerve sheath involvement compatible with optic neuritis/perineuritis (Figure 1). MRI brain revealed T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions, some of which had contrast enhancement (Figure 2). Subsequent MRI cervical spine and thoracic spine also revealed multiple areas consistent with active demyelination (Figures 3 and 4). Laboratory results including comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), and Lyme antibody testing were unremarkable. Inpatient optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed normal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness bilaterally (84 µm in the right eye and 86 µm in the left eye), but the ganglion cell inner plexus layer was mildly thinned in the left eye (71 µm) compared with the right eye (75 µm).

### The atypical faces of optic neuritis: neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease [^0ae6ffd6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to provide a review of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), with a focus on what renders optic neuritis "atypical" in these two conditions. Clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and epidemiology are outlined. Acute treatments for optic neuritis, as well as immunotherapy for NMOSD and MOGAD are discussed.

Recent Findings

Updates in NMOSD and MOGAD are highlighted, with an emphasis on novel work including the new 2023 MOGAD diagnostic criteria, our evolving understanding on the epidemiology of these conditions, and recently FDA-approved NMOSD treatments. Pipeline therapies are also discussed.

Summary

A thorough history and examination, supported by ancillary testing, continues to be the mainstay of optic neuritis diagnosis. Stratifying typical versus atypical optic neuritis is paramount. Within the atypical category, NMOSD and MOGAD are important considerations. Clues can point towards these diagnoses and guide steps for treatment, which is increasingly becoming targeted to individual diseases, as the pathophysiology is different for these disorders.

### Management of acute optic neuritis [^ba2fba2b]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Optic neuritis is a common condition that causes reversible loss of vision. It can be clinically isolated or can arise as one of the manifestations of multiple sclerosis. Occasional cases are due to other causes, and in these instances management can differ radically. The treatment of optic neuritis has been investigated in several trials, the results of which have shown that corticosteroids speed up the recovery of vision without affecting the final visual outcome. Other aspects of management, however, are controversial, and there is uncertainty about when to investigate and when to treat the condition. Here we review the diagnostic features of optic neuritis, its differential diagnosis, and give practical guidance about management of patients. The condition's association with multiple sclerosis will be considered in the light of studies that define the risk for development of multiple sclerosis and with respect to results of trials of disease-modifying drugs in these individuals.

Case presentation

A fit-and-well 40-year-old male patient (construction worker) presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of acute onset right upper and lower extremity numbness/tingling. The patient reported associated transient symptoms of mild gait ataxia and left ocular burning pain sensation just prior to the paraesthesia onset. These associated symptoms were completely resolved at the time of presentation. The patient denied any trauma or previous episodes of similar symptoms. Although the patient denied any personal medical history or home medications, family history revealed that his father suffered from two strokes between the ages of 40 and 50 years old. The patient denied any alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use.

On general examination, the patient was a muscular Caucasian male with a body mass index of 34.6. He was afebrile but noted to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 165/111 mm Hg. Neurological exam revealed persistent light touch (brush) impairment localised to the right fingertips extending to the elbow and right toes extending to the knee. In addition, the patient displayed minimal transient proprioception and vibration impairments on the distal right fingertips and toes. Both pain (pin prick) and temperature sensations remained intact. Muscle strength and tone were grossly normal. No other focal neurological deficits were appreciated.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^64fcdea6]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that may occur together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.
Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.
Peripheral Neuropathies: Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and tell them to contact their physician.
Central nervous system effects (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to moxifloxacin hydrochloride before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.
Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that moxifloxacin hydrochloride can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients that severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) has been reported in patients taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Instruct patients to inform their physician if they experience any signs or symptoms of liver injury including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, right upper quadrant tenderness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, light colored bowel movements or dark colored urine.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.
Prolongation of the QT Interval: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.
Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity: Inform patients that photosensitivity/phototoxicity has been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Inform patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while taking quinolones. If patients need to be outdoors while using quinolones, instruct them to wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. If a sunburn-like reaction or skin eruption occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician.
Blood Glucose Disturbances: Inform the patients that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, they should discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and consult a physician.

### Clinical considerations and key issues in the management of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease: a seven case series [^d84335f6]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patient #1: a longstanding disease with multiple system involvement and a dramatic response to vemurafenib

A 39 year-old woman of Turkish-Iraqi descent presented in September 2007 to the emergency department with low grade fever, signs of weakness and difficulty walking due to diffuse bone pain mostly in the knees and both pectoral and pelvic girdles. Shortly before her admission the patient began experiencing alternating hot flashes and cold bouts disproportionate to the weather or clothing and suffered from frequent night sweats. Approximately six months prior to this incident, fatigue and leg pain slowly developed. The pain originally began as a tingling sensation, accompanied by paresthesia. It had escalated over several months and progressed to fully fledged bone pain. At the time of presentation, the pain was described as initiating at rest and constant, occasionally accompanied by episodes of fever. The patient was admitted for several consecutive hospitalizations. Upon inspection of her face, both exophthalmos and yellowish peri-orbital xanthelasmae-like lesions were apparent. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable, without deformation or bony swelling and without neurological deficits. It is noteworthy that the patient was polydypsic and polyuric for approximately five years prior to the onset of bone pain, consuming and excreting up to 12 liters of water per day. Despite this, a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was established and treatment with intranasal desmopressin initiated only upon hospitalization, presumably due to the patient's adjustment to the gradual changes in water metabolism over the years. Apart from her known iron deficiency anemia, laboratory studies revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP: 70 mg/L) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 72 mm/hour). A broad panel of immunologic studies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibodies was unremarkable. Negative blood and urine cultures ruled out an infectious etiology. Protein electrophoresis (PEP) yielded no monoclonal spike and the oncological markers were found to be within normal limits. Further investigations included radiography, which revealed bilateral sclerotic changes in the femoral and tibial bones and electromyography, which demonstrated normal muscle and nerve functionality. A subsequent 99m Tc bone scintigraphy demonstrated increased tracer uptake in the superior aspect of both orbits, the central sphenoidal region, left humeral head, right femoral greater trochanter and lateral superior aspect of the left iliac crest as well as diffuse, symmetric, bilateral increased tracer uptake in the femurs and tibiae enveloping both knees (Figure 1 A). A CT of the femurs and tibiae exhibited an irregular osseous texture demonstrating bones riddled with mixed patchy lesions of sclerotic and lytic nature. This was suggestive of either a metabolic, malignant or granulomatous process. An additional CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed congestion of both renal sinuses with slightly distended ureters (Figure 2 A). CT and later MRI of the brain revealed bilateral retro-orbital nodular lesions (Figure 3 A), diffuse thickening and tortuosity of the optic nerves, enlargement of both lacrimal glands and soft tissue fullness of the sphenoid sinus (Figure 3 C). An MRI dedicated to the pituitary revealed no deviation from the normal anatomy. Over the two week period between two consecutive hospitalizations papilledema developed, accompanied by headaches, blurred vision and nausea. A lumbar puncture revealed an increased opening pressure of 44 cmH₂O. Treatment with acetazolamide (250 mg X3 daily) was initiated, the increased intracranial pressure normalized and related symptoms abated. Biopsies were obtained from the tibial bone marrow and from a lacrimal gland. A microscopic examination of the tibial biopsy revealed bony trabeculae separated by a xanthomatous, diffuse spindle cell macrophage population with few interspersed giant cells (Figure 4 A). The spindle cells stained relatively uniformly for the presence of CD163, and in a more patchy fashion but quite strongly for factor XIIIa (Figure 4 C), surface staining for CD14 and granular intense staining for CD68 (Figure 4 B). CD1a and S-100 staining were globally negative (Figure 4 D) except for one focus of S-100(+) cells, suggesting infiltration of the marrow with Langerhans cells. Overall, these findings were most consistent with a diagnosis of ECD with a component of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Over the five years pursuant to her diagnosis on May 2007, the patient was treated with several treatment protocols. At first, steroids (prednisone, 60 mg/day) provided a temporary relief - a marked decrease in bone pain, decrease in CRP levels and normalization of fever. Two months later vinblastine (6 mg/m² /week) was introduced as a steroid sparing agent. This protocol failed to evoke a favorable long lasting response and was substituted for treatment with interferon-α. Since then, interferon-α has served as the primary therapeutic agent administered at dosages as low as 3 × 10⁶ IU X 3 times weekly and as high as 6 × 10 6 IU X 5 times weekly. Initially, interferon-α was administered as a single agent. Later on, it was complemented by vinblastine (8 mg/1 to 4 months) and by pamidronic acid (60 mg/1 to 3 months) in order to better control the lytic lesions. It is noteworthy that this patient continued to deteriorate neurologically even at the highest doses of interferon-α administered (6 × 10 6 IU X 5 times weekly). However, the addition of vinblastine to this regimen succeeded in stabilizing the patient clinically and allowed for a gradual decrease in the dosage of interferon-α to a maintenance dose of 6 × 10 6 IU X 2 times weekly over a two year period. Three years after the diagnosis of ECD, a four-month trial of anakinra (100 mg/day) was attempted, mainly due to multifocal disease progression. However, this agent yielded unsatisfactory results. This attempt was followed by a five-month trial of cladribine (0.14 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days, every four weeks), a drug which yielded no apparent benefit to the patient and was very poorly tolerated. By this time, the patient's neurological symptoms, vis-à-vis her lingual and motor capabilities, had deteriorated greatly once again. She was markedly dysarthric and confined to a wheelchair. Consequently, a biopsy obtained from the peri-renal mass was attempted and found to contain ECD histiocytes which harbor the V600E BRAF mutation. After receiving proper counseling and signing an informed consent, treatment with vemurafenib (1,920 mg/day later tapered to 960 mg/day) was initiated with no less than a spectacular improvement. After two weeks of treatment the patient began to exhibit clinical improvement. Ultimately, following treatment with this agent, the patient regained her ability to walk distances of up to 500 meters and recovered her ability to speak fluently.

### Endogenouspanophthalmitis in a patient visiting the Dominican Republic [^3078fe9f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 67-year-old woman presented with painful, acute vision loss after 5days of fever and muscle aches while visiting the Dominican Republic. She had no recent history of ocular surgery, dental work or recent trauma. Anterior chamber aspiration confirmed an initial diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis, positive for Streptococcus miti s that progressed to panophthalmitis on return to Canada. Treatment included systemic antibiotics, intravitreal antibiotics and intravitreal dexamethasone. Despite the best medical treatment, the left eye progressed to corneal perforation 5weeks after presentation. An evisceration with fitted orbital implant was successful in alleviating pain following the surgery. S. mitis is a rare, but possible cause of endogenous endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis. It was important to work with a multidisciplinary and global team to coordinate and offer appropriate treatment measures. Although vision was lost, evisceration of the left eye provided ocular comfort and good cosmetic outcomes for the patient.

Advise the patient to read the FDA -approved patient labeling. (Medication Guide)

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that may occur together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of ciprofloxacin tablets and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.
Tendinitis and tendon rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue ciprofloxacin tablets treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.
Peripheral Neuropathies: Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with ciprofloxacin use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue ciprofloxacin tablets and tell them to contact their physician.
Central nervous system effects (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including Ciprofloxacin. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to ciprofloxacin tablets before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.
Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that ciprofloxacin can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients that severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) has been reported in patients taking ciprofloxacin tablets. Instruct patients to inform their physician if they experience any signs or symptoms of liver injury including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, right upper quadrant tenderness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, light colored bowel movements or dark colored urine.
Aortic aneurysm and dissection: Inform patients to seek emergency medical care if they experience sudden chest, stomach, or back pain.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.
Prolongation of the QT Interval: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.
Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients: Instruct parents to inform their child's physician if the child has a history of joint-related problems before taking this drug. Inform parents of pediatric patients to notify their child's physician of any joint-related problems that occur during or following ciprofloxacin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
Tizanidine: Instruct patients not to use ciprofloxacin if they are already taking tizanidine. Ciprofloxacin increases the effects of tizanidine (Zanaflex®).
Theophylline: Inform patients that ciprofloxacin may increase the effects of theophylline. Life-threatening CNS effects and arrhythmias can occur. Advise the patients to immediately seek medical help if they experience seizures, palpitations, or difficulty breathing.
Caffeine: Inform patients that ciprofloxacin tablets may increase the effects of caffeine. There is a possibility of caffeine accumulation when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking quinolones.
Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity: Inform patients that photosensitivity/phototoxicity has been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Inform patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while taking quinolones. If patients need to be outdoors while using quinolones, instruct them to wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. If a sunburn-like reaction or skin eruption occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician.
Blood Glucose Disturbances: Inform the patients that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, they should discontinue ciprofloxacin and consult a physician.
Lactation: For indications other than inhalational anthrax (post exposure), advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ciprofloxacin tablets and for an additional 2 days after the last dose. Alternatively, a woman may pump and discard during treatment and for additional 2 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### Bilateral central retinal artery occlusion from catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^3e90662d]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old woman with history of systemic lupus erythematous presented with dizziness and headache and was admitted for the stroke workup. During her stay, she had sudden painless loss of vision in her right eye consistent with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Ocular massage and paracentesis were attempted without success to resume the flow. She was started on oral high-dose steroids (1mg/kg) for lupus flare and therapeutic anticoagulation for antiphospholipid syndrome (positive for anticardiolipin and beta-2 microglobulin antibodies). On day 4, she started having painful bluish discoloration of her left index finger and right fifth toe, and on day 5 she had acute onset of left blurry vision with findings consistent with CRAO. She fulfilled the criteria of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and was started on intravenous pulse steroids, plasmapheresis and higher international normalised ratio goal of 3–3.5 with improvement in her left eye vision from 20/200 to 20/20 on near card test by the end of treatment.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^50ef2044]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guidelines Subcommittee analytic process — In November 2017, the Guidelines Subcommittee (GS) convened a panel and searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2008 to September 2018; the initial search yielded 1,044 articles, of which 155 were identified as potentially relevant and each of the 155 articles was reviewed by 2 panel members, leading to 95 articles selected for inclusion. The selected articles were required to be randomized controlled trials with more than 20 participants. An updated search in April 2020 identified an additional 20 potentially relevant articles, and 34 articles from the 2011 guideline had been previously rated as Class I or Class II; risk of bias for each of the 149 (95 + 20 + 34) articles was assessed independently by 2 authors using 2017 AAN criteria, with sixteen of the 149 rejected, and only Class I and Class II studies were included.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part II: attack therapy and long-term management [^3f30101c]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

How to treat attacks?

Without treatment, the outcome of NMOSD attacks is often poor, with full recovery observed in only a minority of patients. However, recovery can be improved by prompt initiation of therapy in acute attacks and early escalation. Factors such as pre-existing disability, type and severity of an attack, age, and, most importantly, time interval to treatment initiation also contribute to recovery.

The standard of care for acute attacks in both AQP4-IgG-positive and double-negative NMOSD are high-dose glucocorticoids and apheresis therapy. Methylprednisolone (MP) should be usually administered intravenously (i. v.) at a dose of 1000 mg per day for 3–5 days, followed by an oral MP taper (starting with either 1 mg/kg/day or 20–30 mg/day and then tapered to 10–15 mg/day within 2–3 weeks) in combination with proton pump inhibition and thrombosis prophylaxis. Low-dose oral glucocorticoids for up to 3–6 months are also considered beneficial for preventing subsequent early attacks, although there is a lack of prospective studies. The duration of low-dose add-on glucocorticoid treatment depends on the AQP4-IgG serostatus, disease activity, mode of action, and the expected time to the attack-preventive effect of the subsequent immunotherapy.

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking BAXDELA if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with BAXDELA or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions that may occur together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of fluoroquinolones and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking BAXDELA immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.
Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue BAXDELA treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.
Peripheral Neuropathy: Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with BAXDELA use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue BAXDELA and tell them to contact their physician.
Central Nervous System Effects: (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to BAXDELA before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.
Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that BAXDELA can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue BAXDELA at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.
Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection: Inform patients to seek emergency medical care if they experience sudden chest, stomach, or back pain.
Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BAXDELA Tablets and Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When BAXDELA Tablets and BAXDELA Injection are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BAXDELA Tablets and BAXDELA Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^2a445a36]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammation of or around the optic nerve, frequently caused by infectious or immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. In the UK, its strongest association is with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), though the combined prevalence of other associated infectious and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (I-IMID) is similar to that of MS-ON. Prompt identification and understanding of ON's underlying cause informs tailored management and prognosis. Several IMIDs linked to ON, such as aquaporin-4 antibody-associated optic neuritis (AQP4-ON), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated optic neuritis (MOG-ON), and neuro-sarcoidosis, show remarkable response to corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, urgent investigation and treatment are crucial in cases 'atypical' for MS-ON. Following the 1992 Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, clinical practice has evolved, with short-course high-dose corticosteroids considered safe and effective for most people. Timely recognition of patients who could benefit is critical to avoid irreversible vision loss. This review provides a practical guide and a summary of evidence on the investigation and management of acute optic neuritis. It reflects the knowledge and limitations of current evidence, framed through the neuro-ophthalmic perspective of clinical practice at multiple UK academic centres.

### Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence [^6d98ef51]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optic neuritis (ON) is a condition that causes loss of vision. Most frequently, ON affects one eye, but occasionally, simultaneous bilateral loss of vision occurs. Typically, a variable degree of spontaneous recovery takes place within about 3 months and can continue for up to 1 year. There are a number of triggers for ON, ranging from postvaccination episodes to any type of inflammation and specific autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) ON amongothers. In about 5% of patients, there is risk of severe permanent loss of vision and blindness. A major challenge is that it is not possible to know the subtype of ON at presentation. While certain demographic features, symptoms and clinical signs are suggestive, more definitive results from blood tests and neuroimaging can take days or weeks to obtain. Furthermore, negative findings in the blood tests do not rule out non-multiple sclerosis-associated optic neuritis (MSON).

The clinical management of patients who suffer from MSON has been profoundly influenced by the 1992 US Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT). This trial recommended intravenous corticosteroids, not to improve the final outcome but to speed up visual recovery. There were, however, limitations to the ONTT protocol, which may have influenced the findings. First, the ONTT used a vague definition of 'symptom onset'. This is relevant because loss of vision (used in the ONTT) is frequently preceded by several days of pain from inflammation. Second, there was delayed treatment initiation, at a mean of 5.0 ± 1.6 days, which was timed from the visual loss but not from the onset of pain. Third, by contemporary standards, the trial primary outcome measure of high-contrast visual acuity (HCVA) was relatively crude. Fourth, the ONTT recruited a heterogeneous cohort of ON types, including a minority of MOG antibody-positive cases, who may well behave differently from MSON and be corticosteroid sensitive and even corticosteroid dependent. There were no aquaporin 4 (AQP4) seropositive cases in the ONTT. Furthermore, the ONTT did not include any pharmacokinetic data. It was thus not possible for investigators to comment on blood levels, resulting in an inability to propose a plausible biological explanation for as to why oral versus intravenous corticosteroids should be harmful compared with intravenous corticosteroids.

### The investigation of acute optic neuritis: a review and proposed protocol [^e044e718]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory optic neuropathy that affects many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) at some point during their disease course. Differentiation of acute episodes of MS-associated optic neuritis from other autoimmune and inflammatory optic neuropathies is vital for treatment choice and further patient management, but is not always straightforward. Over the past decade, a number of new imaging, laboratory and electrophysiological techniques have entered the clinical arena. To date, however, no consensus guidelines have been devised to specify how and when these techniques can be most rationally applied for the diagnostic work-up of patients with acute optic neuritis. In this article, we review the literature and attempt to formulate a consensus for the investigation of patients with acute optic neuritis, both in standard care and in research with relevance to clinical treatment trials.

### Superior ophthalmic vein embolism following forehead augmentation with autologous fat injection [^09f92f97]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 32-year-old healthy woman presented to our hospital with sudden onset of painful proptosis and decreased vision in her right eye. These symptoms had appeared 30 minutes prior to arrival. She had undergone cosmetic forehead augmentation with autologous fat injection at another clinic. An approximately 10-mL fat graft was harvested from her right medial thigh and injected into her right forehead under local anesthesia. During the procedure, she developed painful bulging of her right eye with blurred vision. The injection was terminated and the patient was immediately referred to our hospital. She denied a history of surgery or trauma.

Upon arrival at our hospital, the patient was fully conscious and afebrile. She had no tachypnea, dyspnea, or petechiae on her skin. Physical examination revealed needle marks with bruits on the right side of her forehead. Her vital signs were stable. Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated visual acuity of 20/40 with a positive relative afferent pupillary defect in her right eye. The patient exhibited right eye bulging and droopiness of her right upper eyelid (Fig. 1 a). The intraocular pressure of her right eye was 44 mmHg. Anterior segment and fundus examination findings were within normal limits. Extraocular movements were limited in all directions. Decreased sensation was present in the right forehead and right upper eyelid regions. Ophthalmic examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Her muscle strength was grade 5 in all extremities. Initial management involved immediate administration of oral acetazolamide at 500 mg followed by 250 mg every 6 hours, 0.5% timolol eye drops every 12 hours, 0.15% brimonidine-P eye drops every 12 hours, and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid at 1.2 g every 8 hours. Her intraocular pressure gradually improved after beginning these medical treatments. Therefore, further canthotomy and cantholysis were postponed.

### Patients' knowledge and perception on optic neuritis management before and after an information session [^4cbfd88c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Integrating evidenced based practice into daily clinical care of patients is the driving force behind much needed clinical research. It is commonly assumed that clinical evidence ultimately transforms clinical management by health professionals and results in better patient outcomes. Recently it has been highlighted that evaluation of the impact of major clinical trials "Translational T2 Clinical Research" is essential when assessing the effects of interventions designed to improve quality of care. Although such translational research is important to implement change, there are other barriers to change that may occur at the level of the patient, the clinician or the healthcare system.

Patient preferences in adopting the best practice for their own management is not known. Making evidence based decisions is a complex process integrating evidence based information with patient's circumstances and the individual patient's preferences. Surveying patient understanding of their condition, their choice of treatment and barriers to treatment options is important to implement best practice.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an acute inflammation of the optic nerve resulting in painful loss of vision. Optic neuritis may be a clinically isolated syndrome but it can also be associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) which is a systemic demyelinating condition. In about a quarter of MS cases, the patient first presents with optic neuritis and over half of MS patients have at least one episode of optic neuritis during the course of their condition. There is Level 1 evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial that treatment of an acute optic neuritis with intravenous corticosteroid followed by oral steroid results in faster vision recovery. Optic neuritis is an ideal model to investigate patient understanding and belief as the signs and symptoms of optic neurits can be readily identified; the natural history of the condition and the effect of treatment with intravenous steroid have been studied. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroid can help with faster vision recovery but does not change the final vision. As optic neuritis is a prominent feature of MS, which is a chronic condition that affects young people in the most productive years of their lives, and understanding patient preferences is essential to ensure good chronic disease management.

The aim of this study is to evaluate patient understanding and preferences regarding the treatment of acute optic neuritis and to determine whether a patient information session can assist in increasing the likelihood that patients will engage in guideline recommended best practice management.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^ba5b69e6]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The first decision the ophthalmologist needs to make when ON is suspected: Does this patient need to be admitted today?

Patients with acute or recent onset bilateral moderate to severe vision impairment require consideration of acute medical admission. This can also be considered for patients with severe monocular vision loss, or other factors precluding safe out-patient management. Patients with low vision and sluggish or unreactive pupils are of particular concern for possible AQP4-ON, MOG-ON, or severe post-viral ON. Focal neurology may advance the differential diagnosis. These patients will require urgent investigation including neuroimaging (see Table 2), and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1 g once daily for 3 to 5 days. Given the time needed to arrange medical admission, we usually offer a STAT high dose of oral methylprednisolone, but note this might mask subtle MRI nerve enhancement. The patient will typically have early review by the on-call neurology team, and/or neuro-ophthalmologist for consideration of lumbar puncture (LP). If there is poor initial response to IVMP, Plasma Exchange (PLEX) may be considered. This is particularly effective in AQP4-ON and MOG-ON.

### Patients' knowledge and perception on optic neuritis management before and after an information session [^26120834]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, patients have shown good understanding of the symptoms and signs of optic neuritis. The finding that significant increases in the likelihood of patients engaging in best practice in their management can be achieved with a simple information session. This is important as patient knowledge of available treatment options and treatment effects can play an integral role to help adopting guideline recommendations in their management.

### Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis [^edda3341]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve. It usually presents with an abrupt loss of vision and recovery of vision is almost never complete. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. Closely linked in pathogenesis, optic neuritis may be the initial manifestation for multiple sclerosis. In some people, no underlying cause can be found.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of corticosteroids on visual recovery in eyes with acute optic neuritis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1950 to April 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (January 1982 to April 2015), PubMed (January 1946 to April 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) was last searched on 6 March 2014. The electronic databases were last searched on 7 April 2015. We also searched reference lists of identified trial reports for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids, in any form, dose or route of administration, in people with acute optic neuritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs with a total of 750 participants. Each trial was conducted in a different country: Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and United States. Additionally, we identified two ongoing trials not due to be completed until 2016. Among the six trials included in this review, we judged one to be at high risk of bias. The remaining five trials were judged to be at either low or uncertain risk of biases. Five trials compared only two intervention groups and one trial had a three-arm comparison of oral corticosteroids or intravenous corticosteroids with placebo. Of the five trials with only two intervention groups, two trials compared oral corticosteroids versus placebo, two trials compared intravenous corticosteroids with placebo, and one trial compared intravenous dexamethasone with intravenous methylprednisolone plus oral prednisolone. Three trials evaluating oral corticosteroids used varying doses of corticosteroids versus placebo. In the meta-analyses to assess visual acuity, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.23; participants = 398) at one month; 0.92 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; participants = 355) at six months; and 0.93 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.24; participants = 368) at one year. In the meta-analyses of two trials evaluating corticosteroids with total dose greater than 3000 mg administered intravenously, the RR of normal visual acuity (defined as 20/20 Snellen fraction or equivalent) in the intravenous corticosteroids group compared with the placebo group was 1.05 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; participants = 346) at six months. The RR of contrast sensitivity in the normal range for the same comparison was 1.11 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.33; participants = 346) at six months follow-up. The RR of normal visual field for this comparison was 1.08 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; 346 participants) at six months; and 1.01 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.19; participants = 316) at one year. Four trials reported adverse events primarily related to gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep disturbance; one trial reported minor adverse event of acne.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no conclusive evidence of benefit in terms of recovery to normal visual acuity, visual field or contrast sensitivity six months after initiation with either intravenous or oral corticosteroids at the doses evaluated in trials included in this review.

### Clinical reasoning: a 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^54d81f1d]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions. The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation. MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed. This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^fb92fc61]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination — patient history and examination procedures state that a comprehensive examination includes an in-depth patient history; tests to thoroughly evaluate the patient's visual function, ocular health, and related systemic health status; an assessment of examination findings; and the development of a plan for treatment/management and future care, and that "Clinicians should remain alert for new and emerging technologies, instruments, and procedures, and incorporate them into the clinical examination, as appropriate". The patient history is an initial and ongoing component of the examination, with the objective to obtain specific information about the patient's perception of their eye and vision status and important background information on related medical issues; it helps to identify and assess problems, provides an opportunity to establish a relationship of confidence and trust, and the collection of demographic data generally precedes the taking of the patient history; major components include the nature and history of the presenting problem (including chief complaint), visual and ocular history, general health history (including a social history and review of systems), and family ocular and health histories; a clinical note adds that some patients may fail to disclose medically-relevant information to clinicians, which can undermine patient care or even lead to patient harm, and nondisclosure may occur because of embarrassment or a desire to avoid potential judgement or lecturing.

### Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis [^0182e668]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. Usually presenting with an abrupt loss of vision, recovery of vision is almost never complete. Closely linked in pathogenesis to multiple sclerosis, it may be the initial manifestation for this condition. In certain patients, no underlying cause can be found.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids on visual recovery of patients with acute optic neuritis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to February 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 February 2012. We also searched reference lists of identified trial reports to find additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials that evaluated corticosteroids, in any form, dose or route of administration, in people with acute optic neuritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data on methodological quality and outcomes for analysis.

Main Results

We included six randomized trials which included a total of 750 participants. Two trials evaluated low dose oral corticosteroids while one trial evaluated low dose intravenous corticosteroids across two treatment arms and two trials evaluated a higher dose of intravenous corticosteroids. One three-arm trial evaluated low-dose oral corticosteroids and high-dose intravenous corticosteroids against placebo. Trials evaluating oral corticosteroids compared varying doses of corticosteroids with placebo. Hence, we did not conduct a meta-analysis of such trials. In a meta-analysis of trials evaluating corticosteroids with total dose greater than 3000 mg administered intravenously, the relative risk of normal visual acuity with intravenous corticosteroids compared with placebo was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.27) at six months and 1.06 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.22) at one year. The risk ratio of normal contrast sensitivity for the same comparison was 1.10 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.32) at six months follow up. We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this outcome at one year follow up since there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. The risk ratio of normal visual field for this comparison was 1.08 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.22) at six months and 1.02 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.20) at one year. Quality of life was assessed and reported in one trial.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no conclusive evidence of benefit in terms of recovery to normal visual acuity, visual field or contrast sensitivity with either intravenous or oral corticosteroids at the doses evaluated in trials included in this review.

### Peripheral ulcerative keratitis secondary to chronic hepatitis B infection [^4c1e645f]. Cornea (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a unique case of peripheral ulcerative keratitis secondary to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated cryoglobulinemia and vasculitis and its pharmacological and surgical treatment and 2-year follow-up.

Methods

A 52-year-old woman presented with unilateral eye pain and photophobia, arthralgia, remnants of a maculopapular rash, and subsequently facial numbness several weeks later. Her best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) in the affected eye was 20/80. Slit-lamp examination revealed severe superior corneal thinning without infiltrate. Corneal ulceration worsened until 10% of the cornea remained. Laboratory workup was positive for rheumatoid factor and revealed significantly decreased C4 complement, and HBV serology was positive.

Results

Clinical history, examinations, and laboratory results suggest HBV-associated cryoglobulinemia and vasculitis. Management included prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression and tenofovir for HBV treatment. Conjunctival resection and a glue patch were used to reduce inflammation and stabilize corneal melt. BSCVA improved after treatment was initiated. Two years after initial presentation, her BSCVA is 20/30, significantly improved from her vision at presentation.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of peripheral ulcerative keratitis requires thorough history and physical examinations given the numerous causes. Prompt treatment including immunosuppressive medication and, in this case, antiviral medication is crucial to preventing serious visual consequences including corneal perforation and blindness.

### A 40-year-old woman with pain in the chest, hands, and feet [^7976a2eb]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 40-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain and pain in the joints of her hands and feet. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

Box 6: Recommendation — long-term therapy: switching drugs

B12 In case of treatment failure with classical immunosuppressive therapies, therapy should be switched to a monoclonal antibody.

B13 In case of treatment failure with a monoclonal antibody, therapy should be switched to another monoclonal antibody, preferably with a different mode of action.

B14 The interval between therapies should be as short as possible and based on the mode and latency to onset of action of the subsequent therapy, as well as potential side effects resulting from overlapping treatments.

B15 When switching immunotherapy, bridging therapy with low-dose oral glucocorticoids should be performed for up to 3–6 months, depending on the mode and onset of action of the subsequent therapy, duration of action of the previous therapy, disease activity, comorbidities, and side effects.

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^14781363]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Strength of clinical recommendation levels — A Strong Recommendation is used when the benefits clearly exceed the harms (or the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B), and this recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A Recommendation applies when the benefits exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C), and this recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information. An Option applies when the benefits exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is low (Grade D) or well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage of one approach versus another, and there should be an awareness of this recommendation, but a flexibility in clinical decision-making, as well as remaining alert for new information.

### Skull base osteomyelitis with secondary cavernous sinus thrombosis: a rare presentation of an animate foreign body in the ear [^9bfa50e6]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 42-year-old woman presented with fever, left ear pain, restricted mouth opening, difficulty in swallowing and inability to open her left eyelid for a period of 10 days. She was treated with antibiotics for the same at a local medical facility; however, a sudden decrease in her left eye vision prompted her to visit our tertiary centre. Her history was insignificant except for having multiple left ear syringing for an insect removal 10 days before onset of her current symptoms. On examination, she had ptosis of the left eye with chemosis, dilated pupil with only perception of light and restricted ocular mobility. Oral examination revealed trismus and bulge in the left peritonsillar region. Left ear examination revealed a large central perforation with mucopurulent discharge. CT of the neck with contrast demonstrated a collection in the left peritonsillar space with left internal carotid artery thrombosis. MRI of the brain with gadolinium revealed left cavernous sinus thrombosis with acute infarcts in the left frontal lobe. An emergency incision and drainage of the left peritonsillar abscess was performed. Culture grew broad aseptate fungal hyphae. Despite starting on antifungal therapy, she succumbed to her illness.

### Parainfectious optic neuritis followed by microcystic macular oedema [^d30e60eb]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Parainfectious optic neuritis is a very rare cause of acute vision loss. We present a case of a 51-year-old man with a recent upper respiratory tract infection, presumably of viral aetiology, who showed up with complains of painless right eye vision loss, followed by the same symptoms on the left eye 3weeks later. Ophthalmological examination revealed optic disc swelling (sequential in severity) which was confirmed by optic disc imaging. The remaining evaluations (lumbar puncture, MRI, laboratory and genetic testing) were completely normal. Considering a postviral aetiology, 5-day intravenous methylprednisolone treatment was performed. Follow-up examinations revealed slight visual acuity and visual fields recovery, with subsequent optic disc atrophy and microcystic macular oedema, bilaterally. This case illustrates how important a correct clinical history is to guide a correct diagnosis and posterior management.

### Challenges and opportunities in designing clinical trials for neuromyelitis optica [^db74c6eb]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Current management of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is noncurative and only partially effective. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of maintenance treatment. Safer, better-tolerated, and proven effective treatments are needed. The perceived rarity of NMO has impeded clinical trials for this disease. However, a diagnostic biomarker and recognition of a wider spectrum of NMO presentations has expanded the patient population from which study candidates might be recruited. Emerging insights into the pathogenesis of NMO have provided rationale for exploring new therapeutic targets. Academic, pharmaceutical, and regulatory communities are increasingly interested in meeting the unmet needs of patients with NMO. Clinical trials powered to yield unambiguous outcomes and designed to facilitate rapid evaluation of an expanding pipeline of experimental agents are needed. NMO-related disability occurs incrementally as a result of attacks; thus, limiting attack frequency and severity are critical treatment goals. Yet, the severity of NMO and perception that currently available agents are effective pose challenges to study design. We propose strategies for NMO clinical trials to evaluate agents targeting recovery from acute attacks and prevention of relapses, the 2 primary goals of NMO treatment. Aligning the interests of all stakeholders is an essential step to this end.

Box 5: Recommendation — long-term therapy: double-negative NMOSD

B9 Research studies should focus on unveiling the significance of "true" double-negative NMOSD, which remains unknown to date.

B10 Long-term immunotherapy in double-negative NMOSD should be initiated after a second attack or after a severe first attack.

B11 First-line treatments in double-negative NMOSD are classical immunosuppressive therapies or rituximab, depending on the patient's characteristics. In case of therapy failure with rituximab, a combination therapy, tocilizumab, or other experimental therapies may be considered.

Symptom time course and differentiation from inherited retinal disease (IRD) in AIR include that symptoms typically are progressive and evolve over the course of weeks to months, although some patients may rarely have symptoms for years prior to diagnosis. IRD patients typically present when young, but they can also present for evaluation in adulthood after they reach a threshold level of visual impairment; however, careful questioning may reveal subtle visual symptoms years before presentation including in childhood (e.g., an aversion to playing outside at night, difficulty with ball sports, inability to see stars at night) which is not typical in patients with AIR who present as adults with a more acute onset of vision loss.

### A rare case of bilateral sequential posterior scleritis in an elderly woman [^7f78d791]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 63-year-old woman came with complaints of decreased vision and minimal pain on extraocular movements in the left eye and, after investigations, was diagnosed with posterior scleritis. Systemic steroid treatment helped resolve the symptoms and signs. One year later, she presented with right eye involvement. She was evaluated for systemic illness and, based on clinical and investigational findings, it was deduced that probably a sarcoidosis was predisposing her to the eye problem. She was provisionally diagnosed with bilateral sequential posterior scleritis secondary to sarcoidosis. She was prescribed oral steroids, which helped resolve her eye problem. She was next referred to a rheumatologist and a pulmonologist for further evaluation and treatment.

### Eye emergencies… [^e864b168]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Chemical Injury CASE SCENARIO A 34-year-old man presents with eye pain, tearing, and decreased vision in his right eye two hours after spraying liquid fertilizer on plants. His visual acuity on presentation is 20/200, and a penlight examination shows swollen upper and lower eyelids, conjunctival injection, and an opaque cornea. BACKGROUND Chemical eye injuries occur when the ocular surface is exposed to an acid or alkali in the form of a liquid, powder, or gas. The severity of the injury is dependent on the chemical's pH concentration and the duration of contact with the ocular surface. 18 Chemical burns may cause ischemic damage to conjunctival vessels and corneal limbal stem cells, resulting in conjunctival scarring and corneal opacification. Alkali burns are more common because of the prevalence of alkali in household cleaning agents and are more harmful than acid burns because alkali agents penetrate the ocular surface more quickly. 19, 20.

DIAGNOSIS Patients with a chemical eye injury commonly present with eye pain, redness, tearing, sensitivity to light, and decreased vision. The physician should identify the type of chemical involved and the amount that came in contact with the eye to evaluate for severity of the injury. Examination of the external and anterior segments of the eye may reveal swelling and burns to the eyelids; a cloudy cornea or epithelial defect; conjunctival injection; or a white eye, indicating conjunctival ischemia. Initial pH testing of the ocular surface may be performed by placing a strip of litmus paper in the conjunctival fornix. 5 The eye should be irrigated with at least 2 L of fluid using a lens irrigation system or intravenous tubing. The pH of the ocular surface should be remeasured five minutes after initial irrigation. The fornices are swept with a wet cotton swab to remove any retained crystallized chemical particles.

Further irrigation is necessary if the pH of the ocular surface has not been neutralized.
5. Once the ocular surface has been neutralized, the patient should be referred immediately to an ophthalmologist. For mild burns with minimal or no corneal epithelial defects, treatment with antibiotic eye drops and preservative-free artificial tears may be effective. 6 More severe burns with corneal opacities or white-appearing limbal ischemia require topical antibiotics, steroids, ascorbate, citrate, autologous serum drops, and amniotic membrane tissue to reduce inflammation and promote epithelialization.
7. PROGNOSIS The prognosis depends on how much time elapsed between the chemical injury and eye irrigation. Immediate irrigation of the eye results in less damage to the ocular surface and better vision outcomes.

5 Visual acuity following a chemical injury may achieve 20/40 or better in 100% of patients with mild corneal epithelial defects, compared with 60% of patients who have corneal opacities and limbal ischemia. 6 At follow-up, the patient should be monitored for elevated intraocular pressure, corneal opacities, and eyelid abnormalities. Mechanical Globe Injury CASE SCENARIO A 28-year-old man presents with acute pain in his right eye, redness, and loss of vision after using a nail gun. His visual acuity on presentation is 20/100. A penlight examination reveals an irregular pupil with a penetrating corneal foreign body. DIAGNOSIS Patients with a mechanical globe injury will experience eye pain, redness, tearing, or decreased vision soon after trauma to the eye. Anterior segment examination with a slit lamp can identify an injury to the globe; however, a penlight may also be used.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^e9ac061b]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- the predominant course of neuromyelitis optica is characterized by recurrent severe attacks of myelitis and/or uni- or bilateral optic neuritis with incomplete recovery and is up to 10 times more prevalent in women than in men

- age of onset, the late 30s, is approximately 10 years later than the age of onset in multiple sclerosis, but neuromyelitis optica may also occur in children and elderly people

- optic neuritis with severe visual loss and in rapid succession may be indicative of neuromyelitis optica

- optic atrophy is more pronounced than in multiple sclerosis and may form cavitation

- complete transverse myelitis is typical for neuromyelitis optica, and partial transverse myelitis syndromes are more indicative of multiple sclerosis

- expansion of the spinal cord lesion may lead to brainstem symptoms and life-threatening complications.

### Current options for the treatment of optic neuritis [^0aaff973]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis can be defined as typical (associated with multiple sclerosis, improving independent of steroid treatment), or atypical (not associated with multiple sclerosis, steroid-dependent improvement). Causes of atypical optic neuritis include connective tissue diseases (eg, lupus), vasculitis, sarcoidosis, or neuromyelitis optica. In this manuscript, updated treatment options for both typical and atypical optic neuritis are reviewed. Conventional treatments, such as corticosteroids, therapeutic plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy are all discussed with commentary regarding evidence-based outcomes. Less commonly used treatments and novel purported therapies for optic neuritis are also reviewed. Special scenarios in the treatment of optic neuritis - pediatric optic neuritis, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and optic neuritis occurring during pregnancy - are specifically examined.

### Effect of treating acute optic neuritis with bioequivalent oral vs intravenous corticosteroids: a randomized clinical trial [^c60084a5]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Intravenous (IV) administration of corticosteroids is the standard of care in the treatment of acute optic neuritis. However, it is uncertain whether a bioequivalent dose of corticosteroid administered orally, which may be more cost-efficient and convenient for patients, is as effective as IV administration in the treatment of acute optic neuritis.

Objective

To determine whether recovery of vision following treatment of acute optic neuritis with a high-dose IV corticosteroid is superior to that with a bioequivalent dose of an oral corticosteroid.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-blind (participants unblinded) randomized clinical trial with 6-month follow-up was conducted at a single tertiary care center in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled from March 2012 to May 2015, with the last participant's final visit occurring November 2015. Patients 18 to 64 years of age presenting within 14 days of acute optic neuritis onset, without any recovery at time of randomization and without history of optic neuritis in the same eye, were screened. Inclusion criteria included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or worse and corticosteroids deemed required by treating physician. In total, 89 participants were screened; 64 were eligible, but 9 declined to participate. Thus, 55 participants were enrolled and randomized. Primary analysis was unadjusted and according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 to the IV methylprednisolone sodium succinate (1000-mg) or oral prednisone (1250-mg) group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was recovery of the latency of the P100 component of the visual evoked potential at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were the P100 latency at 1 month and BCVA as assessed with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter scores on the alphabet chart and scores on low-contrast letters at 1 and 6 months.

Results

Of 55 randomized participants, the final analyzed cohort comprised 23 participants in the IV and 22 in the oral treatment groups. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 34.6 (9.5) years, and there were 28 women (62.2%). At 6 months' recovery, P100 latency in the IV group improved by 62.9 milliseconds (from a mean [SD] of 181.9 [53.6] to 119.0 [16.5] milliseconds), and the oral group improved by 66.7 milliseconds (from a mean [SD] of 200.5 [67.2] to 133.8 [31.5] milliseconds), with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.07). Similarly, no significant group difference was found in the mean P100 latency recovery at 1 month. For BCVA, recovery between the groups did not reach statistical significance at 1 month or 6 months. In addition, improvements in low-contrast (1.25% and 2.5%) BCVA were not significantly different between treatment groups at 1 or 6 months' recovery.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study finds that bioequivalent doses of oral corticosteroids may be used as an alternative to IV corticosteroids to treat acute optic neuritis.

### Vertebral artery dissection in evolution found during chiropractic examination [^f4c0db69]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 30-year-old woman presented to an emergency department with sudden onset of transient loss of left peripheral vision. Owing to a history of migraine headaches, she was released with a diagnosis of ocular migraine. Two days later, she sought chiropractic care for the chief symptom of severe neck pain. The chiropractor suspected the possibility of vertebral artery dissection (VAD). No manipulation was performed; instead, MR angiography (MRA) of the neck was obtained, which revealed an acute left VAD with early thrombus formation. The patient was placed on aspirin therapy. Repeat MRA of the neck 3 months later revealed resolution of the thrombus, without progression to stroke. This case illustrates the importance for all healthcare providers who see patients with neck pain and headache to be attentive to the symptomatic presentation of possible VAD in progress.

### Acute bilateral vision loss secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis-induced intracranial hypertension: a case report [^3a60c50e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The present case describes a rare presentation of sudden onset acute bilateral vision loss due to cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to malignant rise in intracranial pressure.

Case Presentation

A 23-year-old male patient presented with sudden onset bilateral loss of vision of one week duration. Best-corrected visual acuity was 6/18, N12, and perception of light in the right and left eye, respectively. Fundus examination revealed papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thrombotic occlusion of the superior sagittal, straight, and inferior sagittal sinuses. Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was elevated to 40 cm H₂O. Laboratory investigations showed the presence of polycythemia (Hemoglobin- 18.6 g/dl) and elevated serum homocysteine (38.64 µmol/L) levels. Early initiation of appropriate treatment resulted in improvement of vision to 6/9, N8 and 6/6, N6 in the right and left eye, respectively. One month following treatment, there was complete resolution of papilledema and retinal haemorrhages in both eyes.

Conclusion

Malignant rise in intracranial pressure can rarely lead to the sudden onset bilateral vision loss. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can be associated with a good visual prognosis.

Regarding medical management for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to consider initiating one of the following options as first-line therapy in patients with NMOSD:

- **Azathioprine plus prednisolone**: azathioprine PO 2.5–3 mg/kg/day plus prednisolone PO 1 mg/kg/day, tapered when azathioprine becomes effective (after 2–3 months)

- rituximab: option 1: i.v. 375 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks (lymphoma protocol); option 2: 1,000 mg infused twice, with a 2-week interval between the infusions (rheumatoid arthritis protocol); options 1 and 2: re-infusion after 6–12 months.

### New therapies for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [^911dc197]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Most patients have serum antibodies targeting the aquaporin-4 water channel expressed on the end-feet of astrocytes. Although the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is limited to around 1–2 people per 100000, severe immune-mediated attacks can quickly lead to blindness and paralysis if undiagnosed and untreated. However, diagnosis is straightforward when the highly specific serum aquaporin-4 antibodies are detected with cell-based assays.

Recent Developments

Four randomised controlled trials have tested the efficacy of three new therapies (eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab) for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder that all showed a benefit in preventing future attacks. These therapies have different targets within the immune pathogenic process, and the four trials have similarities and differences that mean they might change the therapeutic landscape for people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in different ways. Efficacy, safety, tolerability, and practical considerations, including potential cost, differ for each drug and might affect the rate of use in real-world populations of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. WHERE NEXT? Despite the rarity of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a relative abundance of preventive treatment options now exists. In the future, trials should focus on areas of unmet need, including aquaporin-4 seronegative disease, and on development of treatments for acute relapses and for recovery from autoimmune attacks in the CNS.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelitis optica: recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS) [^cb3fddf6]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute disease attacks

After standard neurological examination and the exclusion of infection, steroids are applied on five consecutive days with 1 g methylprednisolone (MP) per day i.v. in combination with a proton pump inhibitor and thrombosis prophylaxis. In the case of a confirmed diagnosis of NMO, and depending on severity of the attack, an oral steroid tapering period should be considered.

If the patient's condition does not sufficiently improve or the neurological symptoms worsen, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE, five to seven cycles) can be performed. Notably, TPE was effective both in seropositive and in seronegative patients with NMOSD in some studies. Early initiation of TPE might be associated with better clinical outcome. In some cases, e.g. if contraindications for TPE exist, a second course of steroids can be applied at a higher dosage of up to five times 2 g MP. In a retrospective review of 10 patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) for acute relapses because of lack of response to steroids with/without TPE, improvement was noted in about 50% of patients.

If the patient is known to have responded well to TPE during earlier attacks and the present attack is severe, TPE can also be considered as a first measure. Immunoadsorption is an option for patients with contraindication for TPE, such as hypersensitivity reactions, or if TPE is not available; however, whether the treatment has the same therapeutic efficacy as TPE has not been investigated to date.

Long-term treatment of NMO

As NMO takes a relapsing course in most cases, with often incomplete recovery and rapid accumulation of neurological deficits, long-term immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated once the diagnosis of NMO has been confirmed. This also applies to APQ4-Ab-negative NMO patients with a severe first relapse and incomplete remission. However, as seronegative NMO more often follows a monophasic course, it may be justified to taper immunosuppressive therapy after some years of disease stability and after careful assessment of the risks and benefits in this group of patients.

Data on the long-term treatment (> 5 years) of NMO are sparse, all retrospective, and mainly concern azathioprine (AZA) and rituximab (RX). Accordingly, AZA and RX are currently the most widely used first-line therapies in NMO. No studies comparing the efficacy of these two therapies have been published.

The following section discusses the currently most widely used therapy regimens and reports on new and emerging NMO therapies.

Ethambutol (EMB) optic neuritis — incidence, monitoring, and management: EMB-related visual impairment during treatment of active tuberculosis has been estimated to occur in 22.5 per 1000 persons (2.25%) receiving EMB at standard doses, and the onset of optic neuritis is usually > 1 month after treatment initiation but can occur within days. The opinion of experts is that baseline visual acuity (Snellen test) and color discrimination tests followed by monthly color discrimination tests are performed during EMB use; to avoid permanent defects, EMB is promptly discontinued if visual abnormalities are found, and if vision does not improve with cessation of EMB, experts recommend stopping INH as well, as it is also a rare cause of optic neuritis.

### Prognostic factors for visual outcomes following the first episode of NMOSD-related optic neuritis in affected eyes [^7a747bc2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe demyelinating disease. It is a spectrum of disease that includes optic neuritis (ON), longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, area postrema, brainstem, diencephalon, and cerebral syndrome. One of the most-common presentations is acute-onset ON. Patients tend to present with severe visual loss, often accompanied by periorbital pain. Early treatment not only preserves better visual outcomes, but also prevents further morbidity and mortality.

NMOSD is a central nervous system (CNS) disease associated with aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies. Initial treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP, 1 gm daily for 3 to 5 consecutive days) is recommended. Plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy is suggested for patients who have severe clinical attacks and who are unresponsive to glucocorticoids. Intravenous immunoglobulin has not been specifically evaluated for acute attacks and is rarely used in this setting. Only a few studies have identified prognostic factors regarding disease outcomes following treatment for NMOSD. Factors predictive of worse outcome include the number of relapses within the first 2 years, the severity of the first attack, older age at disease onset, length of the ON lesion, and perhaps an association with other autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune antibody status. In one retrospective study of ON overall (not exclusively neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-related optic neuritis (NMOSD-ON)), the researchers found that younger age at ON onset and good initial visual acuity were associated with good visual outcomes. However, the authors did not report the prognostic factors for visual outcomes following the first episode of NMOSD-ON per eye. Therefore, our study aimed to identify the prognostic factors for visual outcomes following the first episode of NMOSD-ON in affected eyes.

A 30-year-old woman with chronic foot pain after an orthopaedic surgery and chronic neck pain presented to the emergency department (ED) with a history of self-rotatory vertigo with unsteadiness. She had started low-dose pregabalin, 25 mg two times a day 9 months before experiencing symptoms with the dose gradually increased to 150 mg two times a day over this period. Clinical examination revealed difficulty performing eye pursuit with left eye and dysdiadochokinesia of the left arm. Owing to a suspicion of multiple sclerosis she underwent cerebral MRI, which was normal. Pregabalin was tapered over 2 months with a complete disappearance of the symptoms. We concluded that symptoms were due to pregabalin treatment.

### The changing landscape of optic neuritis: a narrative review [^476c152e]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory optic neuropathy that is often a harbinger of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders. ON is frequently misdiagnosed in the clinical arena, leading to either inappropriate management or diagnostic delays. As a result, patients may fail to achieve optimal recovery. The treatment response to corticosteroids and long term risk of multiple sclerosis was established in the first clinical trials conducted roughly 30 years ago. Spontaneous resolution was observed in the vast majority of patients and intravenous high-dose corticosteroids hastened recovery; half of the patients eventually developed multiple sclerosis. Over the ensuing decades, the number of inflammatory conditions associated with ON has significantly expanded exposing substantial variability in the prognosis, treatment, and management of ON patients. ON subtypes can frequently be distinguished by distinct clinical, serological, and radiological profiles allowing expedited and specialized treatment. Guided by an increased understanding of the immunopathology underlying optic nerve and associated CNS injuries, novel disease management strategies are emerging to minimize vision loss, improve long-term surveillance strategies, and minimize CNS injury and disability. Knowledge regarding the clinical signs and symptoms of different ON subtypes is essential to guide acute therapy, prognosticate recovery, accurately identify underlying CNS inflammatory disorders, and facilitate study design for the next generation of clinical and translational trials.

### Optic neuritis [^fce191ce]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute optic neuritis is the most common optic neuropathy affecting young adults. Exciting developments have occurred over the past decade in understanding of optic neuritis pathophysiology, and these developments have been translated into treatment trials. In its typical form, optic neuritis presents as an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the optic nerve, which can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Atypical forms of optic neuritis can occur, either in association with other inflammatory disorders or in isolation. Differential diagnosis includes various optic nerve and retinal disorders. Diagnostic investigations include MRI, visual evoked potentials, and CSF examination. Optical coherence tomography can show retinal axonal loss, which correlates with measures of persistent visual dysfunction. Treatment of typical forms with high-dose corticosteroids shortens the period of acute visual dysfunction but does not affect the final visual outcome. Atypical forms can necessitate prolonged immunosuppressive regimens. Optical coherence tomography and visual evoked potential measures are suitable for detection of neuroaxonal loss and myelin repair after optic neuritis. Clinical trials are underway to identify potential neuroprotective or remyelinating treatments for acutely symptomatic inflammatory demyelinating CNS lesions.

### Does time equal vision in the acute treatment of a cohort of AQP4 and MOG optic neuritis? [^696cdf31]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common inflammation of the optic nerve associated with numerous autoimmune conditions, including MS, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs), chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis (CRION), and autoimmune optic neuritis (AON).NMOSD is further subdivided into aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody–positive disease and a seronegative form. A subset of patients with ON have serum IgG autoantibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The protein and cellular targets of these 2 antibodies are distinct in that AQP4 is expressed on astrocytes and retinal Müller cells, whereas MOG is expressed by oligodendrocytes. Despite these pathogenic differences, ON attacks in both conditions are treated similarly with high-dose corticosteroids and/or plasma exchange (PE). Although some patients with MOG ab disease meet the 2015 criteria for NMOSD, there is an ongoing debate as to whether MOG ab-positive patients should receive a diagnosis of NMOSD. Although a significant number of MOG ab-positive patients have a relapsing course leading to accumulative disability, others do not relapse; thus, their inclusion together with other AQP4-seronegative patients with NMOSD could compromise the study of therapeutic candidates in NMOSD.

Acute treatment of ON in MS was shaped by the North American Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), which showed that IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) accelerates recovery but does not affect the final visual outcome.

However, the clinical course of ON in NMOSD and in MOG ab-positive patients differs from MS and is typically steroid responsive or dependent. Disability from both AQP4 and MOG-ON is accumulated by poor recovery from attacks. The recommended acute treatment options in antibody-mediated ON are high-dose IVMP, PE, and immunoadsorption.

Historically, NMOSD-ON has been associated with a poor visual outcome. Studies have correlated the visual outcome of AQP4-ON attacks with the severity of visual loss at presentation, type of antibody, and with the use of additional PE. Visual disability has been shown to be accrued with each attack, resulting in poor quality of life. Three previous studies focused on the effect of timing of IVMP on visual outcome. These studies included several subtypes of ON, with only a few patients with NMOSD and no MOG-positive patients.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^be9ffd89]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or Devic's disease is a rare inflammatory and demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis (ON) and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), which is distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS). The guidelines are designed to provide guidance for best clinical practice based on the current state of clinical and scientific knowledge.

Search Strategy

Evidence for this guideline was collected by searches for original articles, case reports and meta-analyses in the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. In addition, clinical practice guidelines of professional neurological and rheumatological organizations were studied.

Results

Different diagnostic criteria for NMO diagnosis [Wingerchuk et al. Revised NMO criteria, 2006 and Miller et al. National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) task force criteria, 2008] and features potentially indicative of NMO facilitate the diagnosis. In addition, guidance for the work-up and diagnosis of spatially limited NMO spectrum disorders is provided by the task force. Due to lack of studies fulfilling requirement for the highest levels of evidence, the task force suggests concepts for treatment of acute exacerbations and attack prevention based on expert opinion.

Conclusions

Studies on diagnosis and management of NMO fulfilling requirements for the highest levels of evidence (class I-III rating) are limited, and diagnostic and therapeutic concepts based on expert opinion and consensus of the task force members were assembled for this guideline.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part II: attack therapy and long-term management [^e1fface3]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

If, within the first days, patients do not respond sufficiently to MP, rescue treatment with apheresis therapy, such as therapeutic plasma exchange (PE) or immunoadsorption (IA), should be administered early on. Most studies performed an average of 5 cycles daily or every other day, but up to 10 cycles may be applied. IA has been used less frequently, and no clear difference has been established between PE and IA in terms of therapeutic outcomes, but data are limited, and more experience exists for PE.

Several retrospective studies have shown that an early start of apheresis therapy is associated with better outcomes in NMOSD patients. When apheresis therapy was started within 0–2 days of symptom onset without delay, up to 40% of patients showed complete remission; however, with a later treatment starting ≥ 7 days after symptom onset, only 3.7% of patients completely recovered. Therefore, early adjunctive (add-on to glucocorticoids) apheresis therapy should be considered in patients with severe attacks. Using apheresis as the only first-line treatment without high-dose glucocorticoids was advantageous for patients with the presence of myelitis in one study. A repeated treatment course has also been shown to improve outcomes and lower the number of non-responders. Thus, patients may benefit from repeated therapy courses (apheresis and/or glucocorticoids) if they insufficiently responded or continued exhibiting functional deficits after the first or second treatment course for NMOSD attacks (Fig. 1). Other experimental therapy approaches, such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), early anti-CD20 therapy, and early anti-complement therapy, have been reported in single case series to possibly lead to favorable outcomes in acute attacks. Future therapies may also include antibodies against the neonatal Fc receptor, which are currently being studied in an open-label trial [, ClinicalTrials.gov].

### A young man with numbness in arms and legs: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^af5ccaa4]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Several proposed diagnostic approaches to neurosarcoidosis have been used in the literature over the years. Updated consensus diagnostic criteria for neurosarcoidosis were published in 2018. Diagnosis of "definite" neurosarcoidosis is supported by a confirmatory biopsy from the nervous system consistent with sarcoidosis in the context of a consistent clinical phenotype and rigorous exclusion of other causes, particularly infection and malignancy. However, CNS biopsy is often not preferable or advisable due to risk of morbidity. A diagnosis of "probable" neurosarcoidosis, as in this case, can be made with a syndrome consistent with granulomatous inflammation of the CNS and a confirmatory biopsy of sarcoidosis from another organ system. Cases in which sarcoidosis is suspected but in which there is no biopsy confirmation are best designated as "possible" neurosarcoidosis.

There are no randomized controlled trials of treatment of CNS neurosarcoidosis. While glucocorticoids are effective for most patients with neurosarcoidosis, the doses needed to achieve or sustain remission can be prohibitive due to glucocorticoid toxicity. Common steroid-sparing therapies in clinical practice include methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and, increasingly, infliximab. Retrospective analyses suggest that mycophenolate mofetil may be less effective than methotrexate (at least for preventing "relapse"), but such studies risk confounding by indication. In retrospective analyses, infliximab, a TNFα inhibitor, is associated with favorable outcomes, including some cases refractory to other therapies.

In the patient presented here, given concern about glucocorticoid adverse effects, the patient elected to initiate infliximab with weekly oral methotrexate and tapered off glucocorticoids completely within 4 months with gradual resolution of symptoms without functional limitation. Surveillance MRIs at 7 and 12 months showed complete remission.

### Does time equal vision in the acute treatment of a cohort of AQP4 and MOG optic neuritis? [^c814e0b0]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether visual disability which is known to accumulate by poor recovery from optic neuritis (ON) attacks can be lessened by early treatment, we investigated whether the time from symptom onset to high-dose IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) affected visual recovery.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed in a consecutive cohort of patients following their first aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG-ON. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in ON eyes at 3 months (BCVA3mo) was correlated with time to IVMP (days). In cases of bilateral ON, 1 eye was randomly selected.

Results

A total of 29 of 37 patients had ON (27 AQP4-seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [NMOSD] and 9 MOG-IgG-ON), 2 of whom refused treatment. Of the 27 patients included, 10 presented later than 7 days from onset. The median BCVA3mo of patients treated > 7 days was 20/100 (interquartile range 20/100–20/200). Patients treated > 7 days had an OR of 5.50 (95% CI 0.88–34.46, p = 0.051) of failure to regain 0.0 logMAR vision (20/20) and an OR of 10.0 (95% CI 1.39–71.9) of failure to regain 0.2 logMAR vision (20/30) (p = 0.01) compared with patients treated within 7 days. ROC analysis revealed that the optimal criterion of delay in IVMP initiation was ≤ 4 days, with a sensitivity and specificity of 71.4% and 76.9%, respectively.

Conclusions

In this retrospective study of ON with AQP4 and MOG-IgG, even a 7-day delay in IVMP initiation was detrimental to vision. These results highlight the importance of early treatment for the long-term visual recovery in this group of patients. A prospective, multicenter study of the effects of timing of IVMP is currently underway.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that hyperacute treatment of AQP4 and MOG-ON with IVMP increases the chance for good visual recovery (20/20 vision) and that even a greater than 7-day delay in treatment is associated with a higher risk for poor visual recovery.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to disease-modifying therapies, switching to another agent, EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend to switch to a more efficacious drug in patients treated with interferon or glatiramer acetate showing evidence of disease activity.

Conclusions

Shared decision-making is a central part of patient-centered health care and is particularly important when the benefits of an intervention have a marginal effect on outcomes and harms are an important concern. Personalizing the ONTT data to inform clinicians and patients about treatment benefits and long-term outcome has the potential to support both evidence-based care and shared decision-making. Further studies are needed to understand those patients with poor recovery and, importantly, to integrate information about corticosteroid benefits with estimates of corticosteroid harms.
