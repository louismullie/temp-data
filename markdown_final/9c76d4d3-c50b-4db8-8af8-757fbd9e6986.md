## Question

myocardial infarction and alcohol consumpyion benefits?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alcohol consumption confers any benefits for myocardial infarction (MI) risk, and if so, how to interpret that in light of conflicting evidence and clinical guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic signal for a protective association at low-to-moderate intake. Then, I should verify the strength and limitations of that evidence, including confounding, reverse causation, and measurement error. Next, I will examine contradictory findings from Mendelian randomization and burden-of-proof analyses. After that, I need to check dose–response patterns, drinking patterns, and sex-specific differences. Finally, I will integrate clinical guidelines and translate this into practical, risk-informed counseling for patients who already drink and for those who do not [^113stk1V] [^111yVaVc].

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic signal. Multiple large observational datasets show that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of MI compared with abstention, often described as a J-shaped or log-linear inverse association; for example, the INTERHEART case-control study found current drinkers had a lower MI risk than nonusers, and large pooled analyses of current drinkers show a log-linear inverse association with MI incidence of about a 6% relative risk reduction per 100 g/week higher intake, with the lowest MI risk around 100 g/week or less [^114FjNZt] [^1137yYgb] [^113TGqK7]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across designs: cohort and case-control syntheses generally replicate this inverse association for MI, including in burden-of-proof frameworks that pool conventional observational studies, though with acknowledged heterogeneity and potential bias [^113hHdMN] [^115sAyX2].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and shape of the association. The large Lancet analysis of 599,912 current drinkers without baseline CVD found a log-linear inverse association with MI (HR 0.94 per 100 g/week), suggesting benefit across a range of low-to-moderate intakes, with no clear lower threshold for MI risk reduction, although the lowest all-cause mortality risk sits near or below 100 g/week, highlighting that MI-specific and overall mortality curves are not identical [^1137yYgb] [^113TGqK7]. I should double-check whether this holds in secondary prevention: meta-analyses in patients with established CVD suggest a J-shaped relationship for mortality with a nadir near 7–8 g/day, and observational post-MI cohorts show lower long-term mortality with light-to-moderate intake, albeit with residual confounding concerns [^112R3cbr] [^111j23bM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check for confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization studies using alcohol-related genetic variants generally do not support a protective effect of alcohol on coronary disease; linear MR links higher genetically predicted alcohol intake with higher risks of hypertension and coronary artery disease, and nonlinear MR suggests minimal benefit at very low intake with exponential increases at higher levels, implying that observational benefits may be largely noncausal [^115jDRFY]. Let me reconsider: burden-of-proof analyses also show that while conventional observational studies often find inverse associations with MI, pooled MR data show no association, reinforcing that the epidemiologic signal is fragile and likely biased [^113hHdMN] [^113gCdYL]. I should confirm that abstainer bias and sick-quitter effects can inflate protective estimates; indeed, when former drinkers are excluded, the apparent benefit attenuates in several analyses, supporting the notion that part of the J-curve is artifactual [^113Y9SxT] [^1133n2cy].

> Next, I should review dose–response and drinking patterns. Frequent, low-quantity consumption (for example, 3–7 days per week at about 1 standard drink/day) shows the most consistent inverse association with MI, whereas episodic heavy drinking increases short-term MI risk and erodes any benefit; heavy episodic drinking within 24 hours is associated with a 1.4-fold higher MI risk, particularly in older adults, and binge drinking after MI doubles mortality risk, negating the otherwise observed inverse association with mortality [^116avEez] [^114FjNZt] [^116kqwY7]. Let me verify whether total weekly volume alone captures risk: in some cohorts, frequency per se appears more protective than total quantity, and the cardioprotective signal is lost with irregular or heavy episodic patterns, underscoring that pattern modifies risk independent of average intake [^1177xj1d] [^111BB52L].

> I will now examine sex-specific differences. In many large cohorts, men show a clearer inverse association with MI at low-to-moderate intake, whereas women either have a weaker or nonsignificant association and may face increased risk at higher levels; for example, in a Korean national cohort, women exhibited increased MI risk with heavy drinking and with eight or more drinks per occasion, and in the Alpha Omega post-MI cohort, women's lowest mortality risk sat around 10 g/day but was not statistically significant due to small numbers [^112NYqPB] [^114NTZDq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm whether guidelines reflect this nuance: contemporary guidance emphasizes lower recommended limits for women and highlights that benefits, if present, are modest and context dependent [^113stk1V] [^1176oxmW].

> Let me think about mechanisms to ensure biological plausibility aligns with the epidemiology. Alcohol increases HDL cholesterol, reduces fibrinogen, and inhibits platelet aggregation, which could lower thrombotic MI risk; however, alcohol also raises blood pressure and atrial fibrillation risk, which would be expected to increase other cardiovascular outcomes like stroke and heart failure, explaining why the inverse association is most consistent for MI but not for overall CVD or mortality [^1137nNbz] [^113TGqK7]. Hold on, I should verify whether HDL mediates the MI signal: adjustment for HDL, fibrinogen, and HbA1c attenuates much of the frequent-drinking association with MI, supporting mediation by lipid and hemostatic pathways rather than a direct myocardial effect [^1137nNbz].

> Next, I should review clinical guidelines to anchor recommendations. The 2023 AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guideline notes a J-shaped relationship with observational benefit for light-to-moderate intake but stresses that all benefit data are observational and subject to confounding; it advises counseling against binge drinking and does not recommend initiating alcohol for cardioprotection, aligning with broader statements that emphasize uncertainty and potential harms even at low levels [^115QugsL] [^111yVaVc]. I need to ensure I incorporate the harm profile: even if MI risk is modestly lower, alcohol increases risks of cancer, liver disease, injury, and atrial fibrillation, so population-level advice favors minimizing intake rather than promoting moderate drinking as a prevention strategy [^115zg3nn] [^113XJyoV] [^114c7mZD] [^113irgCj].

> But wait, what if the patient already drinks heavily? I should double-check whether reducing intake helps. Multiple 2024 cohorts show that reducing heavy alcohol consumption is associated with lower major adverse cardiovascular events, with benefits most pronounced for angina and ischemic stroke and less consistent for nonfatal MI, suggesting that risk reduction is real even if the MI-specific effect size is modest or neutral in some analyses [^115eUcAU] [^115jNmkX] [^112RqfE1]. Let me verify timing: benefits appear after several years of sustained reduction, reinforcing that counseling to cut down is appropriate and beneficial for heavy drinkers with cardiovascular risk [^112VeoAF].

> I should now translate this into practical counseling. For patients who already drink, if they are otherwise low risk and truly consume no more than about 1 standard drink/day (women) or 1–2/day (men) in a regular, non-binge pattern, it is reasonable not to insist on abstinence solely for cardiovascular reasons, while emphasizing that the benefit is modest, observational, and not guaranteed; for those who drink more, the clearest, evidence-based advice is to reduce quantity and frequency and strictly avoid binge episodes [^1176oxmW] [^115QugsL]. For patients who do not drink, I should confirm that we should not recommend starting alcohol, given the lack of causal evidence, the potential for harm, and the availability of safer, proven risk-reduction strategies such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and appropriate pharmacotherapy [^115QugsL] [^113irgCj] [^116d1oTq].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: there is a consistent, likely noncausal, observational association between light-to-moderate, frequent alcohol intake and lower MI risk, with the most robust signal around 1 drink/day or less and with clear erosion of benefit from binge or heavy episodic drinking; however, MR and bias-adjusted analyses cast doubt on causality, and guidelines appropriately caution against initiating alcohol for cardioprotection, prioritizing harm minimization and individualized counseling instead [^1137yYgb] [^113hHdMN] [^115QugsL] [^113irgCj].

---

Moderate alcohol consumption (about 1 drink/day for women, 1–2 drinks/day for men) is associated with a modest reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) risk, likely due to higher HDL, improved endothelial function, and reduced platelet aggregation [^1137nNbz] [^117LCJp5] [^113Cd9Ze]. However, this benefit is **not universal** and is offset by increased risks of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, cancer, and injury [^113XJyoV] [^115zg3nn]. Heavy or binge drinking increases MI risk and negates any benefit [^114FjNZt] [^116o28PC]. Given these risks, alcohol should not be recommended for MI prevention; if patients already drink moderately, they may continue, but non-drinkers should not start [^115QugsL] [^112R3cbr].

---

## Epidemiological evidence

Multiple large observational studies and meta-analyses report a **J-shaped relationship** between alcohol consumption and MI risk, with the lowest risk at moderate intake and higher risk with abstention or heavy use [^114FjNZt] [^114uFter].

- **INTERHEART study**: Low alcohol intake was associated with a modest MI risk reduction (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80–0.94), but heavy episodic drinking (≥ 6 drinks in 24 hours) increased MI risk, especially in older adults (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.9; OR 5.3 for age > 65) [^114FjNZt].

- **Health Professionals Follow-up Study**: Regular moderate drinking (3–7 days/week) reduced MI risk vs. < 1 drink/week (RR 0.68–0.63), independent of beverage type [^116avEez].

- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show a modest inverse association between moderate alcohol intake and MI risk, with maximal benefit around 1 drink/day and loss of benefit beyond 2 drinks/day [^notfound].

---

## Biological mechanisms

Several mechanisms may explain the **observed inverse association** between moderate alcohol intake and MI risk:

- **HDL cholesterol**: Alcohol increases HDL, which may promote reverse cholesterol transport and reduce atherosclerosis [^1137nNbz] [^117LCJp5].

- **Endothelial function**: Moderate intake may improve endothelial function and reduce vascular inflammation [^113Cd9Ze].

- **Platelet aggregation**: Alcohol inhibits platelet aggregation and coagulation, potentially reducing thrombotic events [^114HkS5F].

- **Insulin sensitivity**: Moderate intake may modestly improve insulin sensitivity, indirectly benefiting cardiovascular risk profiles [^1137nNbz].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Despite consistent observational findings, **confounding and bias limit causal inference**:

- **Confounding by lifestyle**: Moderate drinkers often have healthier lifestyles (diet, physical activity, social integration), which may explain part of the benefit [^115jDRFY].

- **Sick-quitter effect**: Former drinkers, often included in abstainer groups, may have higher risk due to underlying illness, inflating apparent benefits of moderate drinking [^113Y9SxT].

- **Measurement error**: Self-reported intake is prone to misclassification, potentially biasing associations [^1138DNG8].

- **Genetic evidence**: Mendelian randomization studies generally do not support a causal protective effect of alcohol on MI, suggesting observational benefits may be non-causal [^117V1FaN] [^117YHSVG].

---

## Risks associated with alcohol consumption

Alcohol consumption carries **significant risks** that may offset cardiovascular benefits:

- **Hypertension**: Even moderate intake raises blood pressure, increasing cardiovascular risk [^115jDRFY].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Alcohol increases AF risk, which is associated with stroke and other adverse outcomes [^112438Jh].

- **Cancer**: Alcohol is a known carcinogen, increasing risk of several cancers [^115zg3nn].

- **Injury**: Alcohol increases accident and injury risk, contributing to morbidity and mortality [^115zg3nn].

- **Heavy/binge drinking**: Strongly associated with increased MI risk and mortality, negating any benefit [^114FjNZt] [^116kqwY7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given mixed evidence and potential harms, **major cardiovascular societies advise caution**:

- **AHA/ACC 2023**: Acknowledges observational benefits but emphasizes risks; do not recommend starting alcohol for MI prevention; counsel against binge drinking [^113stk1V] [^115QugsL].

- **ESC**: Recommends limiting intake to ≤ 100 g/week (≤ 14 g/day) if alcohol is consumed, with no endorsement of initiation for cardioprotection [^1113GqWh].

- **WHO**: No safe level; alcohol should not be promoted for health benefits [^notfound].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Alcohol consumption level** | **Mi risk association** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| None/abstinence | Baseline risk | No recommendation to initiate |
| Moderate (1 drink/day women, 1–2 drinks/day men) | Modest risk reduction (≈ 20–30%) | May continue if already drinking; do not initiate |
| Heavy/binge drinking | Increased risk (≈ 1.4–2-fold) | Strongly discouraged |

---

Moderate alcohol intake is associated with a modest MI risk reduction, likely via HDL, endothelial function, and platelet effects, but this benefit is **not universal** and is offset by risks of hypertension, AF, cancer, and injury. Alcohol should not be recommended for MI prevention; if patients already drink moderately, they may continue, but non-drinkers should not start [^115QugsL].

### The cardioprotective association of average alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114XSdb]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Most, but not all, epidemiological studies suggest a cardioprotective association for low to moderate average alcohol consumption. The objective was to quantify the dose-response relationship between average alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) stratified by sex and IHD end-point (mortality versus morbidity).

Methods

A systematic search of published studies using electronic databases (1980–2010) identified 44 observational studies (case-control or cohort) reporting a relative risk measure for average alcohol intake in relation to IHD risk. Generalized least-squares trend models were used to derive the best-fitting dose-response curves in stratified continuous meta-analyses. Categorical meta-analyses were used to verify uncertainty for low to moderate levels of consumption in comparison to long-term abstainers.

Results

The analyses used 38,627 IHD events (mortality or morbidity) among 957,684 participants. Differential risk curves were found by sex and end-point. Although some form of a cardioprotective association was confirmed in all strata, substantial heterogeneity across studies remained unexplained and confidence intervals were relatively wide, in particular for average consumption of one to two drinks/day.

Conclusions

A cardioprotective association between alcohol use and ischaemic heart disease cannot be assumed for all drinkers, even at low levels of intake. More evidence on the overall benefit-risk ratio of average alcohol consumption in relation to ischaemic heart disease and other diseases is needed in order to inform the general public or physicians about safe or low-risk drinking levels.

### Reduced alcohol consumption and major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals with previously high alcohol consumption [^115eUcAU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This nationwide population-based cohort study provided crucial evidence of the cardiovascular benefits of reduced alcohol consumption, with the most substantial risk reduction observed in stable or unstable angina and ischemic stroke. The findings highlight the importance of disease-specific personalized guidance and targeted public health initiatives to promote alcohol intake–reduction strategies. These comprehensive interventions play a pivotal role in mitigating the risk of alcohol-attributable CVDs among people who drink heavily.

Differential Implications for Coronary Vascular and Cerebrovascular Beds

Although mild to moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered to be protective against CAD, it remains unclear whether comparable benefits are expected from habitual changes in people who drink heavily. The present study found that reducing alcohol consumption in people who drink heavily is associated with lower risk of future CAD. This study introduced a novel perspective by conceptualizing alcohol consumption as a dynamic behavior and enables the exploration of the clinical implications of alcohol-related behavioral changes. The key findings align with contemporary guidelines, supporting the potential benefit of mild to moderate alcohol consumption in CAD. Reduced alcohol consumption in individuals who drink heavily was associated with a 29% decrease in the overall risk of CAD (PSM HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.98), which was mostly accounted for by a decrease in stable or unstable angina. The benefit of mild to moderate alcohol consumption in participants with CAD appeared to be less prominent in MI occurrence. This discrepancy between angina and MI has been documented in previous studies. Although the detailed pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be clarified, the present study highlighted the divergent outcomes of reduced alcohol consumption across distinct subtypes of CAD.

### Who benefits most from the cardioprotective properties of alcohol consumption – health freaks or couch potatoes? [^113RhYNC]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The cardioprotective properties of moderate alcohol consumption, compared with abstinence or heavy drinking, are widely reported, but whether the benefits are experienced equally by all moderate drinkers is less well known.

Aims

To examine the association between average alcohol intake per week and the incidence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction during 17 years of follow-up for 9655 men and women without prevalent disease in the general population; and to test whether the level of cardioprotection differs according to subjects' other health behaviours (healthy, moderately healthy, unhealthy) at entry to the study.

Method

A longitudinal, British civil service-based cohort study, baseline in 1985–8.

Results

A significant benefit of moderate drinking compared with abstinence or heavy drinking was found among those with poor health behaviours (little exercise, poor diet and smokers). No additional benefit from alcohol was found among those with the healthiest behaviour profile (≥ 3 hours of vigorous exercise per week, daily fruit or vegetable consumption and non-smokers).

Conclusion

The cardioprotective benefit from moderate drinking does not apply equally to all drinkers, and this variability should be emphasised in public health messages.

### Patterns of alcohol consumption and myocardial infarction risk: observations from 52 countries in the INTERHEART case-control study [^114FjNZt]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although moderate alcohol use is associated with protection against myocardial infarction (MI), it is not known whether this effect is generalizable to populations worldwide. It is also uncertain whether differences in the pattern of alcohol use (and in particular heavy episodic consumption) between different regions negate any beneficial effect.

Methods and Results

We included 12 195 cases of first MI and 15 583 age- and sex-matched controls from 52 countries. Current alcohol use was associated with a reduced risk of MI (compared with nonusers: adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.94; P = 0.001); however, the strength of this association was not uniform across different regions (region-alcohol interaction P < 0.001). Heavy episodic drinking (≥ 6 drinks) within the preceding 24 hours was associated with an increased risk of MI (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.9; P = 0.01). This risk was particularly elevated in older individuals (for age > 65 years: odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–18; P = 0.008).

Conclusions

In most participants, low levels of alcohol use are associated with a moderate reduction in the risk of MI; however, the strength of this association may not be uniform across different countries. An episode of heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of acute MI in the subsequent 24 hours, particularly in older individuals.

### Reduced alcohol consumption and major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals with previously high alcohol consumption [^115jNmkX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular benefits of mild to moderate alcohol consumption need to be validated in the context of behavioral changes. The benefits of reduced alcohol consumption among people who drink heavily across different subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are unclear.

Objective

To investigate the association between reduced alcohol consumption and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in individuals who drink heavily across different CVD subtypes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening database and self-reported questionnaires. The nationally representative cohort comprised Korean citizens aged 40 to 79 years who had national health insurance coverage on December 31, 2002, and were included in the 2002 to 2003 National Health Screening Program. People who drank heavily who underwent serial health examinations over 2 consecutive periods (first period: 2005–2008; second period: 2009–2012) were included and analyzed between February and May 2023. Heavy drinking was defined as more than 4 drinks (56 g) per day or more than 14 drinks (196 g) per week for males and more than 3 drinks (42 g) per day or more than 7 drinks (98 g) per week for females.

Exposures

Habitual change in heavy alcohol consumption during the second health examination period. People who drank heavily at baseline were categorized into 2 groups according to changes in alcohol consumption during the second health examination period as sustained heavy drinking or reduced drinking.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the occurrence of MACEs, a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction or angina undergoing revascularization, any stroke accompanied by hospitalization, and all-cause death.

Results

Of the 21 011 participants with heavy alcohol consumption at baseline (18 963 males [90.3%]; mean [SD] age, 56.08 [6.16] years) included in the study, 14 220 (67.7%) sustained heavy drinking, whereas 6791 (32.2%) shifted to mild to moderate drinking. During the follow-up of 162 378 person-years, the sustained heavy drinking group experienced a significantly higher incidence of MACEs than the reduced drinking group (817 vs 675 per 100 000 person-years; log-rank P = 0.003). Reduced alcohol consumption was associated with a 23% lower risk of MACEs compared with sustained heavy drinking (propensity score matching hazard ratio [PSM HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.88). These benefits were mostly accounted for by a significant reduction in the incidence of angina (PSM HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.97) and ischemic stroke (PSM HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.86). The preventive attributes of reduced alcohol intake were consistently observed across various subgroups of participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this cohort study suggest that reducing alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of future CVD, with the most pronounced benefits expected for angina and ischemic stroke.

### Roles of drinking pattern and type of alcohol consumed in coronary heart disease in men [^116avEez]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although moderate drinking confers a decreased risk of myocardial infarction, the roles of the drinking pattern and type of beverage remain unclear.

Methods

We studied the association of alcohol consumption with the risk of myocardial infarction among 38,077 male health professionals who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at base line. We assessed the consumption of beer, red wine, white wine, and liquor individually every four years using validated food-frequency questionnaires. We documented cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease from 1986 to 1998.

Results

During 12 years of follow-up, there were 1418 cases of myocardial infarction. As compared with men who consumed alcohol less than once per week, men who consumed alcohol three to four or five to seven days per week had decreased risks of myocardial infarction (multivariate relative risk, 0.68 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.84] and 0.63 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.74], respectively). The risk was similar among men who consumed less than 10 g of alcohol per drinking day and those who consumed 30 g or more. No single type of beverage conferred additional benefit, nor did consumption with meals. A 12.5-g increase in daily alcohol consumption over a four-year follow-up period was associated with a relative risk of myocardial infarction of 0.78 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.99).

Conclusions

Among men, consumption of alcohol at least three to four days per week was inversely associated with the risk of myocardial infarction. Neither the type of beverage nor the proportion consumed with meals substantially altered this association. Men who increased their alcohol consumption by a moderate amount during follow-up had a decreased risk of myocardial infarction.

### Alcohol intake and long-term mortality risk after myocardial infarction in the alpha omega cohort [^116GMdhd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, causing substantial health loss. For many cancers and other disorders, a gradual rise in mortality risk is observed with higher alcohol intake, starting from 0 intake. For cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, an as-yet-unexplained J-shaped association between alcohol intake and mortality has been found in observational studies, suggesting that light or moderate drinking is beneficial compared to not drinking and heavy drinking. Whether alcohol indeed offers cardio protection at lower intake levels is highly debated because of potential confounding and other biases. Nondrinkers in cohort studies may not only include life-long abstainers, but also "sick quitters" who stopped drinking because of health problems and individuals who deliberately underreport their (heavy) alcohol use. The latter groups are generally at increased mortality risks, leading to biased risk estimates for 0 alcohol intake. Methods to deal with abstainer bias in observational studies are often not successful, also due to limitations of self-administered questionnaires. Randomized controlled trials of long-term alcohol use and clinical CVD endpoints are lacking because of ethical and feasibility constraints. Thus, despite extensive research, the role of alcohol in the development of CVD is still not fully understood.

### Wine drinking and risks of cardiovascular complications after recent acute myocardial infarction [^112stMEL]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Scientific data on the clinical impact of moderate alcohol consumption after a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are limited, and the specific effect of wine ethanol has not been studied.

Methods and Results

In survivors of a recent AMI, we analyzed the association between ethanol intake and the risk of recurrence. The patients were classified according to the amount of ethanol that they consumed regularly during follow-up. Major prognostic factors, including the severity of the prior AMI and drug treatment, were recorded and included in the analyses. Only patients with at least 2 reliable assessments of drinking (and dietary) habits were included (n = 437). The average ethanol intake was 7.6% of the total energy intake, wherein wine ethanol represented 92% of the total. Among these patients, 104 cardiovascular complications occurred during a mean follow-up period of 4 years. In comparison with abstainers, the adjusted risk of complications was reduced by 59% (95% confidence interval: 17 to 80) in patients whose average ethanol intake was 7.7% of the total energy intake (about 2 drinks/day), and by 52% (95% confidence interval: 4 to 76) in those whose average ethanol intake was of 16% of energy (about 4 drinks/day).

Conclusion

Whereas moderate wine drinking was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of complications in this homogenous population of coronary heart disease patients, further studies are required to confirm the data, define the clinical and biological profile of the patients who would most benefit from wine drinking after recent AMI, and examine whether the relations found are due to ethanol or other wine ingredients.

### Association of habitual alcohol intake with risk of cardiovascular disease [^115jDRFY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Observational studies have consistently proposed cardiovascular benefits associated with light alcohol consumption, while recent genetic analyses (ie, mendelian randomization studies) have suggested a possible causal link between alcohol intake and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, traditional approaches to genetic epidemiology assume a linear association and thus have not fully evaluated dose-response estimates of risk across different levels of alcohol intake.

Objectives

To assess the association of habitual alcohol intake with cardiovascular disease risk and to evaluate the direction and relative magnitude of cardiovascular risk associated with different amounts of alcohol consumption.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used the UK Biobank (2006–2010, follow-up until 2016) to examine confounding in epidemiologic associations between alcohol intake and cardiovascular diseases. Using both traditional (ie, linear) and nonlinear mendelian randomization, potential associations between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases (eg, hypertension and coronary artery disease) as well as corresponding association shapes were assessed. Data analysis was conducted from July 2019 to January 2022.

Exposures

Genetic predisposition to alcohol intake.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Results

This study included 371 463 participants (mean [SD] age, 57.0 [7.9] years; 172 400 [46%] men), who consumed a mean (SD) 9.2 (10.6) standard drinks per week. Overall, 121 708 participants (33%) had hypertension. Light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with healthier lifestyle factors, adjustment for which attenuated the cardioprotective epidemiologic associations with modest intake. In linear mendelian randomization analyses, a 1-SD increase in genetically predicted alcohol consumption was associated with 1.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2–1.4) higher risk of hypertension (P < .001) and 1.4-fold (95% CI, 1.1–1.8) higher risk of coronary artery disease (P = 0.006). Nonlinear mendelian randomization analyses suggested nonlinear associations between alcohol consumption and both hypertension and coronary artery disease: light alcohol intake was associated with minimal increases in cardiovascular risk, whereas heavier consumption was associated with exponential increases in risk of both clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, coincident, favorable lifestyle factors attenuated the observational benefits of modest alcohol intake. Genetic epidemiology suggested that alcohol consumption of all amounts was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but marked risk differences exist across levels of intake, including those accepted by current national guidelines.

### Alcohol consumption patterns, beverage type, and long-term mortality among women survivors of acute myocardial infarction [^1156JJ4R]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although moderate alcohol drinkers have lower rates of incident coronary artery disease than abstainers, much less is known about the health effects of different patterns of alcohol use in women with established coronary artery disease. In the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, 1,253 women hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) at 64 centers nationwide from 1989 to 1996 were followed for mortality through December 31, 2007. Of the women, 761 (61%) reported abstention in the year before their MIs, 280 (22%) reported consumption of < 1 serving/week, 75 (6%) reported consumption of 1 to 3 servings/week, and 137 (11%) reported consumption of ≥ 3 servings/week. Using Cox proportional-hazards models, the associations between total weekly volume of consumption, drinking days per week, drinks per drinking day, and beverage type with 10-year mortality were investigated, adjusting for clinical and socioeconomic potential confounders. Compared with abstention, adjusted hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.86) for < 1 serving/week, 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.11) for 1 to 3 servings/week, and 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.11) for ≥ 3 servings/week (p for trend = 0.008). No differences were found by beverage type, and generally inverse associations of drinking frequency and quantity with mortality were found. In conclusion, in women who survive MI, moderate drinking is associated with a decreased risk for mortality, with no clear differences on the basis of pattern or beverage type. These results suggest that women who survive MI need not abstain from alcohol, but any derived benefit would appear to occur well below currently recommended limits in alcohol consumption.

### To drink or not to drink? That is the question [^113Cd9Ze]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have used a J-shaped or U-shaped curve to describe the relationship between alcohol use and total mortality. The nadir of the curves based on recent meta-analysis suggested optimal benefit at approximately half a drink per day. Fewer than 4 drinks per day in men and fewer than 2 per day in women appeared to confer benefit. Reductions in cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction were also associated with light to moderate alcohol intake. Although some studies suggested that wine had an advantage over other types of alcoholic beverages, other studies suggested that the type of drink was not important. Heavy drinking was associated with an increase in mortality, hypertension, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, cancer, and cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular hemorrhage. Paradoxically, light-to-moderate alcohol use actually reduced the development of heart failure and did not appear to exacerbate it in most patients who had underlying heart failure. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefit that light-to-moderate alcohol intake has on the heart, including an increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reduction in plasma viscosity and fibrinogen concentration, increase in fibrinolysis, decrease in platelet aggregation, improvement in endothelial function, reduction of inflammation, and promotion of antioxidant effects. Controversy exists on whether alcohol has a direct cardioprotective effect on ischemic myocardium. Studies from our laboratory do not support the concept that alcohol has a direct cardioprotective effect on ischemic/reperfused myocardium. Perhaps the time has come for a prospectively randomized trial to determine whether 1 drink per day (or perhaps 1 drink every other day) reduces mortality and major cardiovascular events.

Alcohol consumption in CCD — risk patterns and standard drink amounts: There is a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and death with variable-quality data; in the United States, 1 "standard" drink contains about 14 g of pure alcohol, typically found in 12 oz of regular beer (usually about 5% alcohol), 5 oz of wine (usually about 12% alcohol), or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (usually about 40% alcohol); observational studies show an inverse association between light-to-moderate intake, including in patients with CVD where 5–25 g/d has been associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular and all-cause death, whereas heavy, episodic drinking is consistently associated with higher cardiovascular risk including acute myocardial infarction; all available benefit data are observational and subject to confounding.

### Association of alcohol consumption with morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease: original data and meta-analysis of 48, 423 men and women [^112R3cbr]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption has been reported to be cardio-protective among apparently healthy individuals; however, it is unclear whether this association is also present in those with disease. To examine the association between alcohol consumption and prognosis in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), we conducted a series of meta-analyses of new findings from three large-scale cohorts and existing published studies.

Methods

We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and subsequent cardiovascular events via de novo analyses of 14,386 patients with a previous myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke in the UK Biobank Study (median follow-up 8.7 years, interquartile range [IQR] 8.0–9.5), involving 1640 deaths and 2950 subsequent events, and 2802 patients and 1257 deaths in 15 waves of the Health Survey for England 1994–2008 and three waves of the Scottish Health Survey 1995, 1998, and 2003 (median follow-up 9.5 years, IQR 5.7–13.0). This was augmented with findings from 12 published studies identified through a systematic review, providing data on 31,235 patients, 5095 deaths, and 1414 subsequent events. To determine the best-fitting dose-response association between alcohol and each outcome in the combined sample of 48,423 patients, models were constructed using fractional polynomial regression, adjusting at least for age, sex, and smoking status.

Results

Alcohol consumption was associated with all assessed outcomes in a J-shaped manner relative to current non-drinkers, with a risk reduction that peaked at 7 g/day (relative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.73–0.85) for all-cause mortality, 8 g/day (0.73, 0.64–0.83) for cardiovascular mortality and 6 g/day (0.50, 0.26–0.96) for cardiovascular events, and remained significant up to 62, 50, and 15 g/day, respectively. No statistically significant elevated risks were found at higher levels of drinking. In the few studies that excluded former drinkers from the non-drinking reference group, reductions in risk among light-to-moderate drinkers were attenuated.

Conclusions

For secondary prevention of CVD, current drinkers may not need to stop drinking. However, they should be informed that the lowest risk of mortality and having another cardiovascular event is likely to be associated with lower levels of drinking, that is up to approximately 105g (or equivalent to 13 UK units, with one unit equal to half a pint of beer/lager/cider, half a glass of wine, or one measure of spirits) a week.

### Association of alcohol consumption with morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease: original data and meta-analysis of 48, 423 men and women [^112gumF5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lifestyle and dietary habits play an important role in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the impact of alcohol consumption on CVD patients' prognosis is unclear and recommendations for patients regarding upper limits of drinking vary substantially across different guidelines. While light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing multiple cardiovascular outcomes in general population cohorts, it is difficult to extend the posited cardio-protective effects to CVD patients because of their typically older age and compromised vasculature as well as the medications they take to prevent secondary events. In addition, for CVD patients, there are concerns about the potential detrimental effects of alcohol on the circulatory system, such as hypertension, arrhythmias, and haemorrhagic stroke, which may exacerbate their existing pathological conditions.

The most recent meta-analysis to have explored the association between alcohol consumption and prognosis among CVD patients was undertaken by Costanzo et al. in 2010. Pooling data from eight observational studies published between 1998 and 2008, they identified a maximal 22% relative risk (RR) reduction at approximately 8 g/day for cardiovascular mortality and 18% at 7 g/day for all-cause mortality among patients with myocardial infarction (MI), angina, or stroke, relative to non-drinkers, with risk increasing in a dose dependent manner above these levels. However, their analysis was limited to studies only on mortality and did not consider any non-fatal outcomes. Understanding how alcohol consumption is related to cardiovascular morbidity is of great importance to CVD patients because this population is at high risk of recurring cardiovascular events which can significantly compromise the patients' quality of life. Including morbidity information will complement the existing evidence base to provide a more complete picture of how alcohol consumption can be managed for optimal secondary CVD prevention. Additionally, further studies have been published in the decade since the last meta-analysis. Given the growing debate on this topic, a more detailed and comprehensive reassessment of the evidence is warranted in the absence of long-term clinical trials.

We thus analysed individual data from three large-scale cohorts. In addition to estimating risk of mortality among CVD patients, we also examined the association between alcohol intake and subsequent cardiovascular events. To consolidate all available evidence on this topic, we conducted meta-analyses of our results with those from published studies identified through a systematic review.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^113irgCj]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aside from any effect on IHD, caution must be used when judging the overall risk-benefit relationship of any form of alcohol consumption on an individual level because of well-known detrimental effects on other disease outcomes, such as injuries and cancer. Recommendations for clinical practitioners (aside from clear contra-indications because of other illnesses or medication intake) remain challenging because of the apparent simultaneous beneficial and detrimental effects from on average low alcohol consumption, and the fact that evidence from randomized controlled trials on long-term effects of alcohol consumption is and will be unavailable. Furthermore, there is no control mechanism for alcohol purchase as there is for prescription drugs because alcohol is freely available for self- and over-medication. Therefore, uptake of alcohol consumption should not be considered as a treatment option in prevention of IHD. In terms of public alcohol policy, the picture is clear: alcohol consumption should be as low as possible, no amount of consumption is safe, and any type of episodic and chronic heavy drinking should be strongly discouraged.

### The risk of acute myocardial infarction after stopping drinking [^113hiMtC]. Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Subjects at high risk of alcohol-related diseases may benefit from alcohol cessation. However, drinkers have a lower risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than abstainers, and there is very scanty information on how the risk changes after stopping drinking.

Methods

Between 1995 and 1999, we administered a structured questionnaire to 507 cases (378 men, 129 women) with a first episode of nonfatal AMI and 478 control patients (297 men, 181 women) admitted to the same network of hospitals in the greater Milan area for acute conditions.

Results

Compared to lifelong abstainers, the odds ratio (OR) adjusted for age, sex, and several AMI risk factors was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–0.84) for current and 0.65 (95% CI 0.37–1.15) for former drinkers (48 cases and 44 controls). The OR was 2.10 (0.40–11.1) for having stopped since 1 year, 0.64 (95% CI 0.19–2.16) for 2–4 years, 0.46 (95% CI 0.18–1.20) for 5–14 years, and 0.78 (95% CI 0.27–2.27) for ≥ 15 years.

Conclusions

Although our data are too limited to draw any definite conclusion, they suggest that the protection of alcohol drinking against AMI may persist, at least in part, for several years after stopping.

### Cardiovascular effects of alcohol consumption [^11647QT1]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alcohol consumption has a major but complex impact on cardiovascular diseases. Both irregular and chronic heavy drinking occasions detrimentally impact on most major cardiovascular disease categories, whereas light to moderate drinking has been associated with beneficial effects on ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke. Both detrimental and beneficial effects of alcohol consumption have been corroborated by biochemical pathways. The impact of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular disease should be evaluated within the context of other effects of alcohol on health.

### Alcohol and long-term prognosis after a first acute myocardial infarction: the SHEEP study [^112HSipe]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Few studies have investigated the relation between alcohol consumption, former drinking, and prognosis after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly for non-fatal outcomes.

Objective

To investigate the prognostic importance of drinking habits among patients surviving a first AMI.

Design, Settings, and Patients

A total of 1346 consecutive patients between 45–70 years with a first non-fatal AMI underwent a standardized clinical examination and were followed for over 8 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Total and cardiac mortality and hospitalization for non-fatal cardiovascular disease in relation to individual alcoholic beverage consumption at the time of AMI and 5 years before inclusion, assessed by a standardized questionnaire administered during hospitalization.

Results

We recorded 267 deaths, and 145 deaths from cardiac causes, during the follow-up period. After adjustment for several potential confounders, hazard ratios for total and cardiac mortality were 0.77 (0.51–1.15) and 0.61 (0.36–1.02) for those drinking > 0- < 5 g per day, 0.77 (0.50–1.18) and 0.62 (0.36–1.07) for those drinking 5–20 g per day, and 0.89 (0.56–1.40) and 0.69 (0.38–1.25) for those drinking over 20 g per day. Risk of hospitalization for recurrent non-fatal AMI, stroke, or heart failure generally showed a similar pattern to that of total and cardiac mortality. Recent quitters at the time of AMI had a hazard ratio of 4.55 (2.03–10.20) for total mortality. Measures of insulin sensitivity appeared to be the strongest mediators of this association.

Conclusions

Moderate alcohol drinking might have beneficial effects on several aspects of long-term prognosis after an AMI. Our findings also highlight that former drinkers should be examined separately from long-term abstainers. The potential mechanisms that underlie this association still need to be elucidated.

### Type of alcoholic beverage and first acute myocardial infarction: a case-control study in a mediterranean country [^116GTAqk]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although international comparisons have consistently found an inverse association between wine and coronary heart disease, few epidemiologic studies are available in Southern Europe. We assessed the association of wine, red wine, and the pattern of drinking wine during meals with the risk of myocardial infarction.

Hypothesis

We specifically evaluated three hypotheses: (1) Is the protection against incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction stronger for wine than for other alcoholic beverages? (2) Does the wine consumed during meals represent a more beneficial pattern of alcohol consumption? (3) Is red wine more advantageous than other types of wine?

Methods

A case-control study (171 cases, 171 matched controls) was conducted in Spain. Multiple dietary and nondietary potential confounders were assessed.

Results

Exposure to wine, red wine, and wine during meals was associated with risk reductions similar to those of other alcoholic beverages (point estimates of the odds ratio for low and high intake were 0.48 and 0.38 for wine; 0.42 and 0.55 for other beverages). However, after controlling for total alcohol intake, wine consumption (g/day) improved the prediction of a myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

Our data showed that red wine or drinking wine during meals was similar to alcohol from other sources for reducing coronary risk. However, an additional benefit of wine, keeping constant overall alcohol intake, deserves further research.

### Systematic evaluation of the impact of a wide range of dietary habits on myocardial infarction: a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis [^112LvdSk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In modern lifestyles, alcohol consumption is ubiquitous. Our study meticulously examined various patterns of alcohol consumption, yet found no genetically inherited effects on myocardial infarction contingent upon the type of alcohol consumed. However, compelling evidence emerged indicating that drinking patterns significantly influence the risk of myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that alcohol consumption may offer protective benefits against myocardial infarction by increasing HDL‐C levels and decreasing triglyceride levels. Replication analyses also revealed a protective effect of alcohol consumption against myocardial infarction. Wood et al demonstrated a logarithmic correlation between increased alcohol consumption and a reduced risk of myocardial infarction in a comprehensive analysis involving 599 912 participants from 3 large‐scale data sources: the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, European Project for the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk and the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, and the UK Biobank. This analysis encompassed data from a total of 8383 prospective studies across 19 high‐income countries. These findings are consistent with those of our study. Furthermore, a cross‐sectional study indicated that low, moderate, and heavy drinkers exhibited significantly lower allostatic load scores, encompassing cardiovascular, metabolic, and other health metrics, compared with nondrinkers. This reduction in allostatic load was associated with a decreased risk of CVD. The protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on CVD may be attributed to several mechanisms. Notably, alcohol reduces platelet activation and aggregation while lowering blood levels of clotting factors such as fibrinogen. It also enhances vascular endothelial function by increasing the expression of endogenous nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelial cells, which can help mitigate the development and regression of atherosclerosis, thereby potentially reducing cardiovascular death. Additionally, studies have shown that low to moderate alcohol intake correlates with lower triglyceride levels. Lipoprotein lipase, a critical enzyme in lipoprotein metabolism that hydrolyzes triglycerides, displays increased activity when moderate amounts of alcohol are consumed in a fasted state. This enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity may explain the observed reduction in triglyceride concentrations and the associated lower risk of myocardial infarction. The impact of alcohol on lipid levels may be the primary mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effects associated with alcoholic beverages.

### Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease, cancer, injury, admission to hospital, and mortality: a prospective cohort study [^115zg3nn]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Alcohol consumption is proposed to be the third most important modifiable risk factor for death and disability. However, alcohol consumption has been associated with both benefits and harms, and previous studies were mostly done in high-income countries. We investigated associations between alcohol consumption and outcomes in a prospective cohort of countries at different economic levels in five continents.

Methods

We included information from 12 countries participating in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study, a prospective cohort study of individuals aged 35–70 years. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to study associations with mortality (n = 2723), cardiovascular disease (n = 2742), myocardial infarction (n = 979), stroke (n = 817), alcohol-related cancer (n = 764), injury (n = 824), admission to hospital (n = 8786), and for a composite of these outcomes (n = 11,963).

Findings

We included 114,970 adults, of whom 12,904 (11%) were from high-income countries (HICs), 24,408 (21%) were from upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), 48,845 (43%) were from lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), and 28,813 (25%) were from low-income countries (LICs). Median follow-up was 4.3 years (IQR 3.0–6.0). Current drinking was reported by 36,030 (31%) individuals, and was associated with reduced myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.63–0.93]), but increased alcohol-related cancers (HR 1.51 [1.22–1.89]) and injury (HR 1.29 [1.04–1.61]). High intake was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.31 [1.04–1.66]). Compared with never drinkers, we identified significantly reduced hazards for the composite outcome for current drinkers in HICs and UMICs (HR 0.84 [0.77–0.92]), but not in LMICs and LICs, for which we identified no reductions in this outcome (HR 1.07 [0.95–1.21]; pinteraction < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Current alcohol consumption had differing associations by clinical outcome, and differing associations by income region. However, we identified sufficient commonalities to support global health strategies and national initiatives to reduce harmful alcohol use.

### Alcohol and immediate risk of cardiovascular events: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114uFter]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although considerable research describes the cardiovascular effects of habitual moderate and heavy alcohol consumption, the immediate risks following alcohol intake have not been well characterized. Based on its physiological effects, alcohol may have markedly different effects on immediate and long-term risk.

Methods and Results

We searched CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed from inception to March 12, 2015, supplemented with manual screening for observational studies assessing the association between alcohol intake and cardiovascular events in the following hours and days. We calculated pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the association between alcohol intake and myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to model any alcohol intake or dose-response relationships of alcohol intake and cardiovascular events. Among 1056 citations and 37 full-text articles reviewed, 23 studies (29 457 participants) were included. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with an immediately higher cardiovascular risk that was attenuated after 24 hours, and even protective for myocardial infarction and hemorrhagic stroke (≈2–4 drinks: relative risk = 30% lower risk) and protective against ischemic stroke within 1 week (≈6 drinks: 19% lower risk). In contrast, heavy alcohol drinking was associated with higher cardiovascular risk in the following day (≈6–9 drinks: relative risk = 1.3–2.3) and week (≈19–30 drinks: relative risk = 2.25–6.2).

Conclusions

There appears to be a consistent finding of an immediately higher cardiovascular risk following any alcohol consumption, but, by 24 hours, only heavy alcohol intake conferred continued risk.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^114y1oLm]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death and disease burden in the US, Europe, and globally, and alcohol consumption is one of the leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity. There are well-established risks from neuro-toxic, hepato-toxic, and carcinogenic effects caused by alcohol consumption (for example, the risk for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, injuries, and liver cirrhosis). However, there has been much debate about a beneficial effect of alcohol consumption on IHD. High prevalence of both exposure and disease make this question a frequent topic among general practitioners, researchers, media, and the public. Aside from numerous individual studies, several meta-analyses published in the last decade have summarized the association between alcohol consumption and IHD risk.

Most meta-analyses of epidemiological data have shown a mix between a beneficial and detrimental association from alcohol consumption on IHD that depends on the level of average consumption. This relationship is most often described as curvilinear, or 'J-shaped', but also sometimes as a flattened-out inverse association. The specific shape of the risk curve seems to depend at least on sex and IHD outcome (mortality versus morbidity). Findings of a beneficial effect are supported by a substantial number of short-term experimental studies on the effect of alcohol consumption on several surrogate biomarkers for IHD in a dose-dependent relationship, including improved lipid profiles, inhibition of platelet activation, reduction of fibrinogen levels, and anti-inflammatory effects. In particular, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels have a clear dose-response relationship with alcohol consumption, with the highest levels observed in people with the highest alcohol consumption. Many criticisms have arisen over the last three decades questioning the relationship found in epidemiological studies because of limited quality of alcohol assessment, the influence of drinking pattern, adjustment for confounding, or the inability for observational studies to determine causality. Although criteria for a causal relationship seem to be fulfilled (see also), a direct link for alcohol consumption on IHD risk from long-term randomized trials is currently, and for the foreseeable future, missing. Thus, epidemiological studies, as is the case for many other IHD risk factors, play an important role in assessing the role of alcohol consumption on disease risk. The objective of this review is to examine the evidence available to define the relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD based mainly on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with a focus on the reference group (that is, the use of lifetime abstainers and not current abstainers as the reference group because of the 'sick-quitter' effect); the influence of drinking pattern (in particular episodic heavy drinking among on average moderate drinkers); and the influence of several other important risk factors for IHD, such as age, smoking status, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI), all of which might confound risk estimates for alcohol.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^116o28PC]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Alcohol's effect on the human body and mind is quite strong, even at low doses. Its neuro-toxic, hepato-toxic, and carcinogenic properties make it a potent risk factor for disease burden. However, its effect on IHD risk also makes it an intriguing and sometimes controversial topic in disease epidemiology and public policy. The quality of epidemiological studies has substantially improved over the last three decades. Using current abstainers as the reference group leads to systematic bias and erroneous conclusions. Using high-quality epidemiological evidence, a clear picture supported by short-term experimental evidence emerges. When examining average alcohol consumption in comparison to lifetime abstainers, the relationship with IHD risk follows a J-curve. The curve turns into a detrimental association for much lower average alcohol levels in women compared with men.

However, average alcohol consumption alone is not sufficient to describe the alcohol-IHD relationship. Drinking patterns play an important role and both episodic and chronic heavy drinking negate any beneficial association with IHD risk, or elevate the risk substantially. Nevertheless, for drinkers having one to two drinks per drinking day without episodic heavy drinking, there is substantial and consistent evidence from epidemiological and short-term experimental studies for a beneficial association with IHD risk when compared to lifetime abstainers. The alcohol-IHD relationship fulfills all criteria for a causal association proposed by Hill. Whether one is able to detect an inverse, U-shaped, or J-shaped relationship depends on the distribution of drinking pattern in a given population. Prevalence of heavy drinking patterns has been on the rise in many countries, such as Canada, the US, the UK, and many Eastern European and Asian countries. In the US, episodic heavy drinking is more common than chronic heavy drinking.

### A burden of proof study on alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease [^113gCdYL]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Cohort and case-control data have suggested an association between low to moderate alcohol consumption and decreased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD), yet results from Mendelian randomization (MR) studies designed to reduce bias have shown either no or a harmful association. Here we conducted an updated systematic review and re-evaluated existing cohort, case-control, and MR data using the burden of proof meta-analytical framework. Cohort and case-control data show low to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with decreased IHD risk - specifically, intake is inversely related to IHD and myocardial infarction morbidity in both sexes and IHD mortality in males - while pooled MR data show no association, confirming that self-reported versus genetically predicted alcohol use data yield conflicting findings about the alcohol-IHD relationship. Our results highlight the need to advance MR methodologies and emulate randomized trials using large observational databases to obtain more definitive answers to this critical public health question.

Prognosis

Secondary prevention

People with established cardiovascular disease show improved outcomes with a reduction to low‐volume drinking. A meta‐analysis of 16 351 patients with a previous diagnosis of CVD found a J‐shaped curve with maximal risk at two drinks/day 66. A similar relationship exists between alcohol and cardiovascular mortality in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction 67, and low levels of alcohol are also associated with less atherosclerotic progression in coronary artery bypass grafts post‐coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 68.

Mortality rates

The mortality risk may decline threefold if a person with a usual alcohol intake of 96 g ethanol/day cuts down to 36 g ethanol/day compared with a constant daily intake of 60 g ethanol/day 69. In one long‐term prospective cohort study (n = 850), 15% heavy drinking patients (defined as 50 g ethanol or more per drinking occasion or daily drinking) died after 10 years and 39.1% after 20 years, compared to low‐volume drinkers consuming less than 50 g ethanol per drinking occasion less than once per month (5.3% at 10 years and 19.7% at 20 years) 70. In contrast, significantly more relapsed patients (73%) died prematurely at the mean age of 48 years (mainly from heart attack or heart failure) compared to those without relapses (30%) in the 16‐year observation period.

Conclusions

Although low‐volume alcohol consumption (one drink/day or less for women and two drinks for men) may confer some benefit in terms of reduced risk of ischaemic heart disease 71, alcohol use at higher levels is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and premature mortality. Occasional binge drinking (more than five drinks within a few hours, with intoxication as intended consequence) reverses any protection associated with low‐volume alcohol consumption. The main cardiovascular effects of long‐term alcohol consumption are hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Treatment for alcohol use disorder is best focused on abstinence from alcohol, although gains are often achieved by significant reduction in alcohol consumption or changes in pattern of drinking.

### Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies [^1138DNG8]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Our study's access to individual-participant data avoided limitations of previous literature-based reviews. To limit reverse causality, our study focused on current drinkers without baseline cardiovascular disease and omitted the initial period of follow-up. To limit confounding, our study adjusted for a variety of risk factors. To correct for misclassification in alcohol consumption and covariates, our study also used extensive information on serial assessments. Our results were robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses. Generalisability of the findings was enhanced by inclusion of data from 83 prospective studies based in many different high-income countries recruited between 1964 and 2010. Although alcohol consumption levels declined during this period, HRs were similar over calendar time.

Nevertheless, our study has some potential limitations. Self-reported alcohol consumption data are prone to bias and are challenging to harmonise across studies conducted over different time periods that used varying instruments and methods to record such data. We did not, however, identify major differences in results across studies that used differing alcohol measurement instruments. Despite our study's access to extensive serial alcohol re-surveys from mid-life, our study could not investigate alcohol consumption during the entire life course. Misclassification in outcomes would have diluted dose-response associations, suggesting that true underlying associations of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease subtypes are stronger and more divergent than we observed. Because we did not generally have access to additional alcohol-related adverse outcomes (eg, non-fatal liver disease, injuries, or psychiatric comorbidities), we probably under-estimated potential benefits associated with lowering alcohol consumption. Because some individuals who reduced, but did not cease, alcohol consumption due to health complications were probably included in our analysis, we cannot exclude the effects of reverse causation (especially since some contributing studies did not record baseline chronic disease other than cardiovascular disease). Therefore, alternative study designs including randomised trialsare needed, to control more completely for residual biases (including those related to studying ex-drinkers and never-drinkers).

In conclusion, our study shows that among current drinkers, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g per week. For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no clear thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with a lower disease risk. These data support adoption of lower limits of alcohol consumption than are recommended in most current guidelines.

### Patterns of alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease in culturally divergent countries: the prospective epidemiological study of myocardial infarction (PRIME) [^111a6qmM]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

Our findings have important public health implications. The regions we studied are within countries for which alcohol consumption is the highest recorded worldwide and is of a similar order of magnitude (11–14 l of pure ethanol per capita in adults per annum). The high proportion of heavy or binge drinking among alcohol drinkers in these two populations carries a serious risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Data from WHO shows a trend towards harmonisation across countries in consumption levels, beverage preferences, and heavy or binge drinking, especially in Europe. The prevalence of binge drinking, which was formerly a marginal drinking behaviour in the majority of Mediterranean countries, has tended to increase, particularly in the younger generation. Education has a pivotal role in any prevention campaign to reduce harmful drinking habits. The alcohol industry takes every opportunity to imbue alcohol consumption with a positive image, emphasising its beneficial effects on risk of ischaemic heart disease, but people also need to be informed about the health consequences of heavy drinking.

Patterns of alcohol consumption, with the exception of the average amount of alcohol consumed a week by drinkers, varied considerably between Belfast and the French centres. In both countries, the same behaviours were associated with a similar risk of ischaemic heart disease. Binge and irregular heavy drinking doubled the risk of developing myocardial infarction in comparison to regular and moderate drinking. Consuming a high quantity of alcohol on each drinking occasion, which characterises binge drinking, was particularly prevalent in Belfast and could contribute to the higher risk of ischaemic heart disease observed there. From our data alone, however, it is difficult to conclude whether the pattern of alcohol intake has a major role in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease independent of other behaviours, such as diet.

Main Outcomes

Over the follow-up duration of 162 378 person-years, 899 participants (6.3%) in the sustained heavy drinking group and 354 (5.2%) in the reduced drinking group developed MACEs. Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the cumulative MACE incidence according to changes in alcohol consumption after PSM. The sustained heavy drinking group showed a significantly higher incidence of MACEs than the reduced drinking group (log-rank P < .001). The Kaplan-Meier curve of cumulative MACE incidence started to diverge after 3 years, and the difference gradually increased over time. The incidence rate of MACEs was 1.21 times higher in the sustained heavy drinking group than in the reduced drinking group (817 vs 675 per 100 000 person-years; log-rank P = 0.003) (Table 2). The reduced drinking group exhibited a 23% lower risk of MACEs (crude HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74–0.94]; PSM HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67–0.88]) than the sustained heavy drinking group.

However, these preventive properties were not observed in nonfatal MI or hemorrhagic stroke.

Alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality among CVD patients

Eleven studies, comprising 41,743 CVD patients, contributed to this analysis. Overall, a J-shaped association was observed, with a protective effect that peaked at 7 g/day and remained significant up to 62 g/day (Fig. 2 A, Table 3). Although the dose-response trend followed a J-curve in men, we found no increased risk among women at higher levels of drinking (see Additional file 1: Figure S7). Regarding primary events, moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk for total mortality among patients with a previous MI or angina, but not with stroke (see Additional file 1: Figure S8). Pooled analysis of estimates relative to non-current drinkers showed a reduced mortality risk for an alcohol intake up to approximately 75 g/day. However, when studies with former drinkers in the reference group were excluded, the association was considerably weakened (see Additional file 1: Figure S9). In addition, among those studies using post-event alcohol measures, the result did not change substantively; a similar trend was seen in studies with multiple measures but failed to reach statistical significance, probably because of the low number of curves (n = 2) in this subgroup (see Additional file 1: Figure S10).

### Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies [^117UyeBE]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this analysis was that the threshold for lowest risk for all-cause mortality was about 100 g per week. For men, we estimated that long-term reduction of alcohol consumption from 196 g per week (the upper limit recommended in US guidelines) to 100 g per week or below was associated with about 1–2 years of longer life expectancy at age 40 years. Exploratory analyses suggested that drinkers of beer or spirits, as well as binge drinkers, had the highest risk for all-cause mortality.

Our study has highlighted the complex and diverse potential mechanisms by which alcohol consumption may exert cardiovascular effects. It has shown that the association between alcohol consumption and total cardiovascular disease risk comprises several distinct and opposite dose–response curves, rather than a single J-shaped association. In particular, whereas higher alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of all stroke subtypes, coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction, heart failure, and several less common cardiovascular disease subtypes, it was approximately log-linearly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. Our results are concordant with recent observational data and Mendelian randomisation studies.,

Our results contribute toward understanding of the basis for these directionally divergent cardiovascular disease associations. For example, our data have suggested that elevated systolic blood pressure could mediate alcohol consumption's positive association with stroke and coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction. By contrast, pathways related to HDL-C (but not necessarily HDL-C itself,) could mediate alcohol consumption's inverse association with myocardial infarction. Both blood pressure and HDL-C are known to increase in response to alcohol consumption. They have contrasting associations with cardiovascular disease outcomes: the inverse association of HDL-C with cardiovascular disease is substantially stronger for coronary disease than stroke, whereas the positive association of systolic blood with cardiovascular disease is considerably stronger for stroke than coronary disease. However, we did not find convincing evidence that other known risk factors were important mediators or confounders.

### Chronic heavy drinking and ischaemic heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115vekBG]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

For some time the alcohol-heart relationship has been a controversial topic in heart disease epidemiology. The relationship between average alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is usually described as a J-shaped curve in epidemiological studies. Several meta-analyses have shown a protective association of some form of average alcohol consumption on IHD outcomes, with short-term experimental studies showing support for an effect on several surrogate biomarkers for elevated IHD risk; these protective associations were quite strong and comparable to preventive measures for IHD, such as physical activity. The protective association seems to be not only relatively strong in magnitude, but also to include a wide range of average alcohol consumption. In particular, one meta-analysisconcluded that there was an inverse relation with no detrimental effect on IHD from alcohol consumption even among chronic heavy drinkers (∼25% risk reduction). However, another meta-analysisreached a very different conclusion with regard to IHD mortality among chronic heavy drinkers (no beneficial effect), and a similar conclusion with a risk reduction for IHD morbidity (beneficial effect). This underlines the importance of stratifying analyses by IHD outcome when examining evidence for the relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD. Additionally, using current abstainers as the referent (ie, the inclusion of former drinkers in the reference group) might lead to overestimation of any potential protective effects, and adjustment for potential confounding has not been optimal in many studies. The specific risk of chronic heavy drinking in comparison to abstainers taking into account these important conceptual and study design issues has not been systematically examined before and it is currently unclear whether chronic heavy drinking has a protective, neutral, or detrimental association with IHD. Furthermore, population studies often times miss many chronic heavy drinkers in order to maximise follow-up or because of other sampling issues. A good example of optimisation for follow-up availability is the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Inadvertently, these samples mostly contain more favourable drinking behaviour, such as low and regular alcohol consumption within a certain stratum of the socioeconomic continuum in high-income countries. However, as is increasingly evident in middle-income countries, this is not the drinking pattern observed globally, which is characterised by more heavy drinking occasions. Among participants missed in typical cohort studies is a subgroup of chronic heavy drinkers, namely people with alcohol use disorders (AUD), who may drink considerably more than the threshold for chronic heavy drinking we use in this meta-analysis (≥ 60 g of pure alcohol per day). Several studies conducted among patients in treatment for AUD showed a relatively strong elevated IHD risk.

### Reduced alcohol consumption and major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals with previously high alcohol consumption [^115ddtSZ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption is one of the most prevalent behavioral factors in personal and public health. Previous cohort studies and meta-analyses have reported the potential association between alcohol consumption and future cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, the dose-response relationship has not been uniformly addressed. It is widely accepted that mild to moderate alcohol consumption provides modest protection against future CVD. However, this protective attribute of mild to moderate alcohol consumption varies by individual subtypes of CVD. For example, the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) consistently decreased over a range of alcohol consumption (starting from > 2.5 g/d); otherwise, U- or J-shaped dose-response patterns were observed for CVD mortality and stroke incidence.

Most previous studies of the association between alcohol consumption and future CVD used a single time point to estimate mean alcohol intake and defined nondrinkers as the control group. However, an individual's drinking habits do not always remain the same over time. Therefore, the association of alcohol consumption on future CVD should be investigated in the context of habitual change rather than fixed behavior. This methodological approach could provide practical evidence for clinicians who often encounter questions regarding the cardiovascular benefits of changing drinking behaviors. Notably, there is a lack of studies demonstrating the cardiovascular benefits of reduced alcohol consumption in people who drink heavily. Moreover, it is crucial to substantiate the result of behavioral changes in this population according to different CVD subtypes. Herein, we hypothesized that habitual changes in alcohol consumption among individuals with sustained heavy drinking would have a long-term role in future CVD outcomes. We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to investigate the association between reduced alcohol consumption and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in people who drink heavily across different CVD subtypes.

In conclusion, we observed lower risks of all-cause, CVD, and IHD mortality in post-MI patients with light or moderate alcohol intakes compared to nondrinkers. These observational findings should be interpreted with caution in light of the total evidence on alcohol use and health, also taking into account the potential social harms of alcohol intake.

### Association of alcohol consumption with selected cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117T6hkE]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications

Given the consistency observed in our findings and compelling mechanistic data pointing to causation in our companion review, additional observational studies will have limited value except to elucidate more precisely the association of alcohol and stroke. Rather, debate should centre now on how to integrate this evidence into clinical practice and public health messages. In the realm of clinical practice, the evidence could form a foundation for proposing counselling for selected patients to incorporate moderate amounts of alcohol into their diets to improve their coronary heart disease risk. However, such a clinical strategy requires formal evaluation in pragmatic clinical trials that assess the questions of optimal patient selection, compliance, risks, and benefits. The focus of such trials would shift from assessing the association between alcohol and disease outcomes to evaluating the receptivity of both physicians and patients to the recommended consumption of alcohol for therapeutic purposes and the extent to which it can be successfully and safely implemented. In support of implementation trials, our two papers show that alcohol consumption in moderation has reproducible and plausible effects on markers of coronary heart disease risk.

With respect to public health messages, there may now be an impetus to better communicate to the public that alcohol, in moderation, may have overall health benefits that outweigh the risks in selected subsets of patients. Again, any such strategy would need to be accompanied by rigorous study and oversight of impacts. One approach would be to undertake public health messaging pilot studies on well defined target populations (such as a workplace or in a small jurisdiction) to permit detailed evaluation of effects on measures such as knowledge, attitudes, self reported drinking behaviours, and perhaps, secondarily, health outcomes.

The debate on how to integrate this evidence into clinical practice and public health messages will require integration of all possible effects of alcohol — from injury and violence to glucose metabolism and inflammation — and recognition that these effects may be distributed unequally across the population. For example, injury risk probably disproportionately affects younger individuals, whereas cardiovascular disease mainly affects older adults. Robust studies that examine multiple outcomes simultaneously are needed to identify those subsets of the population in which reduced cardiovascular risk might dominate against those for whom the risks of social and medical problems (including several cancers and injury) are too great. Despite the latter concerns, results of our secondary analysis of overall mortality (fig 5) support the notion that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with net benefit, at least in populations similar to those studied in the extant literature.

### Alcohol and cardiovascular disease [^113XJyoV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol's impact on cardiovascular health is biphasic: low-to-moderate intake may appear protective, but excessive or binge drinking causes significant harm. This review examines mechanisms linking overconsumption to cardiovascular disease. Acute heavy drinking can trigger "Holiday Heart Syndrome", a transient atrial arrhythmia from electrophysiological instability, autonomic imbalance, and electrolyte shifts. Chronic excess contributes to alcoholic cardiomyopathy via oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired calcium handling. Alcohol also promotes atrial fibrillation and hypertension by inducing atrial fibrosis, neurohormonal dysregulation, and endothelial injury. Excessive intake accelerates coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes through dyslipidemia, vascular inflammation, and insulin resistance, raising risks of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. While moderate consumption was once thought cardioprotective, emerging evidence-especially for atrial fibrillation-suggests risks may outweigh benefits. In conclusion, public health guidance increasingly emphasizes moderation, individualized assessment, and avoiding binge patterns, particularly for those with underlying cardiovascular vulnerabilities.

### Genetic variation in alcohol dehydrogenase and the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption on myocardial infarction [^117LCJp5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

A polymorphism in the gene for alcohol dehydrogenase type 3 (ADH3) alters the rate of alcohol metabolism. We investigated the relation among the ADH3 polymorphism, the level of alcohol consumption, and the risk of myocardial infarction in a nested case-control study based on data from the prospective Physicians' Health Study.

Methods

We identified 396 patients with eligible newly diagnosed cases of myocardial infarction among men in the Physicians' Health Study. Of these patients, 374 were matched with 2 randomly selected control subjects each and the remaining 22 with 1 control each (total, 770 controls). The ADH3 genotype (gamma1gamma1, gamma1gamma2, or gamma2gamma2) was determined in all subjects. We examined the relations among the level of alcohol intake, the ADH3 genotype, and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in this study population and in a similar cohort of women.

Results

As compared with homozygosity for the allele associated with a fast rate of ethanol oxidation (gamma1), homozygosity for the allele associated with a slow rate of ethanol oxidation (gamma2) was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.99). Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction in all three genotype groups (gamma1gamma1, gamma1gamma2, and gamma2gamma2); however, the ADH3 genotype significantly modified this association (P = 0.01 for the interaction). Among men who were homozygous for the gamma1 allele, those who consumed at least one drink per day had a relative risk of myocardial infarction of 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 1.13), as compared with the risk among men who consumed less than one drink per week. Men who consumed at least one drink per day and were homozygous for the gamma2 allele had the greatest reduction in risk (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.45). Such men also had the highest plasma HDL levels (P for interaction = 0.05). We confirmed the interaction among the ADH3 genotype, the level of alcohol consumption, and the HDL level in an independent study of postmenopausal women (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Moderate drinkers who are homozygous for the slow-oxidizing ADH3 allele have higher HDL levels and a substantially decreased risk of myocardial infarction.

### Optimum nutritional strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention and rehabilitation (BACPR) [^116cMn2p]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Alcohol

The relationship between alcohol consumption and CVD is still a subject of controversial debate in both primary and secondary prevention. Several meta-analysis have indicated inconsistent relationships between alcohol intake and cardiovascular health. A recent meta-analysisof 45 studies has shown a significant reduction of CHD mortality for low-volume drinkers and current drinkers comparing to abstainers. In all studies combined, low-volume alcohol consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of CHD mortality. However, in those studies that excluded participants with heart conditions, low-volume consumption was not associated with reduced CHD mortality.

Drinking patterns are also important to consider in the context of alcohol intake, and compared with moderate drinkers, those individuals who consumed a moderate volume of alcohol but did so more inconsistently had a higher risk of CHD mortality. This pattern of drinking may partly explain increased risk of an acute MI following a period of higher drinkingand indicates that alcohol use does not have a uniformly protective effect against MI. Patterns of high consumption (perhaps reflecting the social context of alcohol consumption such as binge drinking) must be considered.

A criticism of studies in this area is a lack of acknowledgement that alcohol may have a differential effect on specific types of CVD. Consuming > 100 g ethanol/week had a higher risk of all-cause mortality although a J-shaped relationship existed for all CVD outcomes. When this was disaggregated, alcohol intake (per 100 g/week higher consumption) was positively associated with stroke, CHD, HF and fatal hypertensive disease. With MI as the outcome, there was an inverse log-linear association with alcohol intake. These findings demonstrate how the consistency in frequency and low quantity of alcohol may play an essential role in cardioprotection and prevention. More evidence in needed in those individuals with a previous history of MI (figure 4).

Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular mortality among CVD patients

Nine studies, comprising 24,770 patients, were included in the meta-analysis on cardiovascular mortality, and the overall association with alcohol consumption was interpreted as a J-curve. The maximal reduction in mortality risk was found to be 27% at 8 g/day and the reversion point was reached at 50 g/day (Fig. 2 B, Table 3). Our results remained little altered when considering studies on men only, or using different types of reference groups or alcohol assessments (see Additional file 1: Figures S7, S9 and S10). Unlike the J-curve observed for men, there was no excess risk of mortality among women at higher levels of consumption (see Additional file 1: Figure S7). Stratified analyses by primary events showed that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality among patients with a previous MI; however, among those with angina or stroke, the overall dose-response trend was close to null (see Additional file 1: Figure S8).

Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular events among CVD patients

Among the four studies (28,621 patients) addressing drinking and cardiovascular events, one reported dose-response trend separately for two age groups and thus provided two curves. Alcohol intake was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events up to 15g/day (Fig. 2 C, Table 3). Pooled analysis of studies on women showed a declined risk for an alcohol intake up to approximately 49 g/day, whereas no reduction in risk was seen in men at any level of consumption (see Additional file 1: Figure S7). Moderate drinking was found to be protective against cardiovascular events within patients of different primary events and studies with multiple alcohol measures (see Additional file 1: Figures S8 and S10). However, when studies including former drinkers in the reference group were excluded, the overall protective effect was attenuated and became non-significant (see Additional file 1: Figure S9).

### A burden of proof study on alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease [^111Sk7Pq]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of the alcohol-IHD relationship using individual participant data from 83 observational studiesfound, among current drinkers, that – relative to drinking less than 50 g/week – any consumption above this level was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI) incidence and consumption between > 50 and < 100 g/week was associated with lower risk of MI mortality. When evaluating other subtypes of IHD excluding MI, the researchers found that consumption between > 100 and < 250 g/week was associated with a decreased risk of IHD incidence, whereas consumption greater than 350 g/week was associated with an increased risk of IHD mortality. Roerecke and Rehm further observed that low to moderate drinking was not associated with reduced IHD risk when accompanied by occasional HED.

The cohort studies and case-control studies (hereafter referred to as 'conventional observational studies') used in these meta-analyses are known to be subject to various types of bias when used to estimate causal relationships. First, neglecting to separate lifetime abstainers from former drinkers, some of whom may have quit due to developing preclinical symptoms (sometimes labeled 'sick quitters',), and to account for drinkers who reduce their intake as a result of such symptoms may introduce reverse causation bias. That is, the risk of IHD in, for example, individuals with low to moderate alcohol consumption may be lower when compared to IHD risk in sick quitters, not necessarily because intake at this level causes a reduction in risk but because sick quitters are at higher risk of IHD. Second, estimates can be biased because of measurement error in alcohol exposure resulting from inaccurate reporting, random fluctuation in consumption over time (random error), or intentional misreporting of consumption due, for example, to social desirability effects(systematic error). Third, residual confounding may bias estimates if confounders of the alcohol-IHD relationship, such as diet or physical activity, have not been measured accurately (e.g. only via a self-report questionnaire) or accounted for. Fourth, because alcohol intake is a time-varying exposure, time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure must be accounted for. To date, only one study that used a marginal structural model to appropriately adjust for time-varying confounding found no association between alcohol consumption and MI risk. Lastly, if exposure to a risk factor, such as alcohol consumption, did not happen at random – even if all known confounders of the relationship between alcohol and IHD were perfectly measured and accounted for – the potential for unmeasured confounders persists and may bias estimates.

### Cardiovascular risks and benefits of moderate and heavy alcohol consumption [^1133NX4V]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The heart and vascular system are susceptible to the harmful effects of alcohol. Alcohol is an active toxin that undergoes widespread diffusion throughout the body, causing multiple synchronous and synergistic effects. Alcohol consumption decreases myocardial contractility and induces arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in progressive cardiovascular dysfunction and structural damage. Alcohol, whether at binge doses or a high cumulative lifetime consumption-both of which should be discouraged-is clearly deleterious for the cardiovascular system, increasing the incidence of total and cardiovascular mortality, coronary and peripheral artery disease, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus. However, epidemiological, case-control studies and meta-analyses have shown a U-type bimodal relationship so that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption (particularly of wine or beer) is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular events and mortality, compared with abstention. Potential confounding influences-alcohol-dose quantification, tobacco use, diet, exercise, lifestyle, cancer risk, accidents, and dependence-can affect the results of studies of both low-dose and high-dose alcohol consumption. Mendelian methodological approaches have led to doubts regarding the beneficial cardiovascular effects of alcohol, and the overall balance of beneficial and detrimental effects should be considered when making individual and population-wide recommendations, as reductions in alcohol consumption should provide overall health benefits.

### Prior alcohol consumption and mortality following acute myocardial infarction [^114ZXKD2]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Studies have found that individuals who consume 1 alcoholic drink every 1 to 2 days have a lower risk of a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than abstainers or heavy drinkers, but the effect of prior drinking on mortality after AMI is uncertain.

Objective

To determine the effect of prior alcohol consumption on long-term mortality among early survivors of AMI.

Design and Setting

Prospective inception cohort study conducted at 45 US community and tertiary care hospitals between August 1989 and September 1994, with a median follow-up of 3.8 years.

Patients

A total of 1913 adults hospitalized with AMI between 1989 and 1994.

Main Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality, compared by self-reported average weekly consumption of beer, wine, and liquor during the year prior to AMI.

Results

Of the 1913 patients, 896 (47%) abstained from alcohol, 696 (36%) consumed less than 7 alcoholic drinks/wk, and 321 (17%) consumed 7 or more alcoholic drinks/wk. Compared with abstainers, patients who consumed less than 7 drinks/wk had a lower all-cause mortality rate (3.4 vs 6.3 deaths per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.71) as did those who consumed 7 or more drinks/wk (2.4 vs 6.3 deaths per 100 person-years; HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25–0.55; P < .001 for trend). After adjusting for propensity to drink and other potential confounders, increasing alcohol consumption remained predictive of lower mortality for less than 7 drinks/wk, with an adjusted HR of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.60–1.03), and for 7 or more drinks/wk, with an adjusted HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.45–1.05; p = 0.01 for trend). The association was similar for total and cardiovascular mortality, among both men and women, and among different types of alcoholic beverages.

Conclusion

Self-reported moderate alcohol consumption in the year prior to AMI is associated with reduced mortality following infarction.

### Association between clinically recorded alcohol consumption and initial presentation of 12 cardiovascular diseases: population based cohort study using linked health records [^116ERWdU]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

While we did find that heavy drinkers had a lower risk of presenting with a myocardial infarction, this needs to be considered within the context of our study, which was focused on initial presentation. This does not mean that heavy drinkers will not go on to experience a myocardial infarction in the future, just that they were less likely to present with this as their first diagnosis compared with moderate drinkers. Furthermore, heavy drinkers were more likely to initially present with death from causes other than cardiovascular disease, meaning it is possible that they are less likely to initially present with any cardiovascular disease because they die from other causes before they are able to develop a cardiovascular disease.

Similarly, while we found that moderate drinkers were less likely to initially present with several cardiovascular diseases than non-drinkers, it could be argued that it would be unwise to encourage individuals to take up drinking as a means of lowering their risk (although it must be noted that the findings from this study do not directly support this as we did not consider transitions from non-drinking to drinking). This is because there are arguably safer and more effective ways of reducing cardiovascular risk, such as increasing physical activityand smoking cessation, which do not incur increased risks of alcohol related harm such as alcohol dependence, liver disease, and cancer. It is also worth bearing in mind that our focus was on risk of initial presentation with one cardiovascular disease rather than another, not absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. Ultimately an individual's decision to drink should not be considered in isolation from other health behaviours or risk factors and instead be motivated by their own personal circumstances.

Finally, from a public health perspective, our finding that moderate drinking is not universally associated with a lower risk of all cardiovascular conditions also supports the decision not to incorporate the apparent protective effects of drinking for cardiovascular disease in the recent UK chief medical officers' alcohol guidelines review.

Conclusions

Collectively, our findings, from the most comprehensive study to date of the relation between alcohol consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, indicate that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of initially presenting with several, but not all, cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, we show that heavy drinking is differentially associated with a range of such diseases. This has implications for patient counselling, public health communication, and disease prediction algorithms and suggests the necessity for a more nuanced approach to the role of alcohol consumption in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Chronic heavy drinking and ischaemic heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qus79]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence for chronic heavy drinking and heart disease risk

What is the underlying experimental evidence base? Long-term randomised studies on IHD mortality or morbidity are unavailable. Although regular low to moderate alcohol intake has been found to have beneficial, dose-dependent effects on biomarkers for IHD in short-term experimental studies, mainly by increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, inhibiting platelet activation, reducing fibrinogen levels and producing anti-inflammatory effects, chronic heavy drinking has been found to be related to detrimental effects on the heart, with adverse effects mainly on blood pressure, fibrinolytic factors and ventricular arrhythmia after cessation of heavy drinking, as well as in participants with existing ischaemic disease through silent myocardial ischaemia and angina. Chronic alcohol intake in particular is associated with physiological changes of the heart, including prolonged QT intervals and electrolyte abnormalities. There are some short-term experimental studies specifically on regular heavy drinking. During heavy alcohol intake, trygliceride levels were elevated in most studies, with transient positive effects on trygliceride in one studyand HDL cholesterol was elevated in all studies. In fact, the highest HDL levels are observed in people with AUD. It seems that despite a beneficial effect on HDL cholesterol even in chronic heavy alcohol consumers, other effects of chronic heavy alcohol consumption on heart disease risk might negate those beneficial effects, resulting in an overall neutral or detrimental association found in our analysis. Further work on distinct biochemical pathways and differentiation of heart disease outcomes should be a priority in alcohol-heart research.

Conclusions

As the evidence base is scarce in women, we restrict our conclusions to men only. Our findings, in combination with previous investigations, lead to three main conclusions: First, there is no systematic evidence of a protective association between IHD and chronic heavy drinking. Second, the findings show that the reference category is crucial in determining IHD risk from any type of alcohol consumption. Public perception of a universal cardioprotective association, however, might overshadow these important parts of the alcohol-heart relationship, as it can be used as an excuse for heavier drinking. Third, a detrimental association of alcohol consumption on IHD is evident only for patients with AUD, the highest end of the spectrum of alcohol consumption. It should be stressed that there is a clear detrimental effect of any heavy drinking episodes on injuries and through overall intake on many cancers. Thus heavy drinking in all forms should be discouraged.

### Alcohol consumption is associated with a lower incidence of acute myocardial infarction: results from a large prospective population-based study in Norway [^1177xj1d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Compelling evidence suggests that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but several issues from previous studies remain to be addressed. The aim of this study was to investigate some of these key issues related to the association between alcohol consumption and AMI risk, including the strength and shape of the association in a low-drinking setting, the roles of quantity, frequency and beverage type, the importance of confounding by medical and psychiatric conditions, and the lack of prospective data on previous drinking.

Methods

A population-based prospective cohort study of 58 827 community-dwelling individuals followed for 11.6 years was conducted. We assessed the quantity and frequency of consumption of beer, wine and spirits at baseline in 1995–1997 and the frequency of alcohol intake approximately 10 years earlier.

Results

A total of 2966 study participants had an AMI during the follow-up period. Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was inversely and linearly associated with AMI risk. After adjusting for major cardiovascular disease risk factors, the hazard ratio for a one-drink increment in daily consumption was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.62–0.86). Accounting for former drinking or comorbidities had almost no effect on the association. Frequency of alcohol consumption was more strongly associated with lower AMI risk than overall quantity consumed.

Conclusions

Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was linearly associated with a decreased risk of AMI in a population in which abstaining from alcohol is not socially stigmatized. Our results suggest that frequent alcohol consumption is most cardioprotective and that this association is not driven by misclassification of former drinkers.

### Exploring the complex interplay between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health: mechanisms, evidence, and future directions [^116CRdGJ]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This review article explores the intricate relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health, underscoring on both clinical outcomes and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It examines the complex dose-response relationships for various cardiovascular disease (CVD) subtypes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and atrial fibrillation, while categorizing pathophysiological mechanisms into three conceptual areas: primary initiating factors, secondary transmission pathways, and end-organ effects. Although mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption may confer some benefits for cardiovascular health and certain CVD subtypes, growing evidence highlights the importance of lifestyle modifications to reduce alcohol intake, particularly among heavy drinkers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current knowledge, emphasizes the need for future research with robust methodologies, and advocates for incorporating updated scientific evidence into personalized approaches within international cardiovascular and national guidelines.

### Association of alcohol consumption with morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease: original data and meta-analysis of 48, 423 men and women [^1176oxmW]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Meta-analysis of the results from three major UK cohorts together with those from 12 published studies found J-curve relationships between alcohol consumption and mortality in those with cardiovascular disease, with the greatest risk reduction being observed at 7 g/day for all-cause mortality and 8 g/day for cardiovascular mortality relative to current non-drinkers. This dose-response trend remains consistent with the last published meta-analysis and has also been reported in other high-risk populations, such as hypertensive and diabetic individuals.

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and any subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with previous CVD, in which UK Biobank contributed nearly half of the total sample size. We found a reduction in risk for an alcohol intake up to approximately 15 g/day, an upper limit much lower than those for the mortality outcomes. Taken together, our study suggested that, among CVD patients, the upper drinking limit for lower risks of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity was about 105 g/week, which was lower than those recommended in most current guidelines. For example, the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology Foundation 2011 guidelines on secondary prevention recommend "alcohol moderation" — up to 196 g/week (2 USA drinks/day) for male and 98 g/week (1 USA drink/day) for female according to the national dietary guidelines — for patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease; the same recommendations apply in the AHA/American Stroke Association 2014 guidelines for secondary stroke prevention; the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2020 guidelines recommend to keep alcohol intake within 112 g/week (14 UK units/week) for both men and women after having an MI; and WHO 2007 recommendations for prevention of recurrent MI and stroke were no more than about 166 g/week (3 units/day, 1 unit contains 10 mL of pure alcohol).

### Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease: a mendelian randomization study [^117YHSVG]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Heavy alcohol consumption is an important cause of death and disability, but the association between moderate drinking and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is complex. On a population level, given its widespread nature, it is important to disentangle any risks or benefits of alcohol consumption. Observational studies have generally shown that alcohol consumption is positively associated with risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and hemorrhagic stroke, whereas moderate drinking is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. – Data from observational studies on alcohol consumption in relation to other CVDs, including venous thromboembolism, peripheral artery disease, aortic valve stenosis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, are limited or inconsistent. Observational studies are unable to fully account for confounding and reverse causation bias, and, therefore, causality in the associations of alcohol consumption with different CVDs remains uncertain. Furthermore, self-reported alcohol consumption may be underestimated, leading to measurement error in the assessment of alcohol consumption, which may result in attenuated categorical risk estimates.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is an epidemiological technique that utilizes genetic variants that are reliably associated with a potentially modifiable risk factor to determine its causal role for disease risk.MR studies are less vulnerable to bias from confounding, reverse causation, and measurement error compared with conventional observational studies. In a previous MR study in a population of European ancestry, increased alcohol intake instrumented by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs1229984) in the ADH1B gene was associated with higher risk of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke, which contradicts observational findings. – Results from a recent MR study conducted in a Chinese population showed that increased alcohol consumption instrumented by 2 alcohol-associated SNPs (rs1229984 in ADH1B and rs671 in ALDH2) was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage but was not associated with myocardial infarction. To our knowledge, the association between alcohol consumption and CVD other than stroke and coronary heart disease has not been studied using MR.

A recent genome-wide association meta-analysis identified multiple SNPs associated with alcohol consumption. By using those SNPs as instrumental variables, we here perform an MR study to investigate the potential causal relationship between alcohol consumption and 8 CVDs, including stroke, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, peripheral artery disease, aortic valve stenosis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. In secondary analyses, we explored the associations of genetically predicted alcohol consumption with possible mediators (blood pressure and serum lipids) and confounders (smoking and education) of the alcohol-CVD associations.

### Alcohol intake and long-term mortality risk after myocardial infarction in the alpha omega cohort [^1113GqWh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients already suffering from CVD are at an increased risk of recurrent events and premature mortality. Next to medical treatment, improvement of diet and lifestyle is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk management. The European Society of Cardiology encourages patients with chronic coronary syndromes to limit their alcohol intake to less than 100 g/week (15 g/day) if alcohol is consumed. Cardiovascular organizations in Europe and the United States do not explicitly promote total abstinence for ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients who currently drink.

Costanzo et al. performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies on alcohol use and mortality in CVD patients, mainly suffering from IHD. In 8 cohorts involving more than 16,000 patients from the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan (predominantly male), light and moderate alcohol intakes were consistently inversely associated with CVD and total mortality risks during a median follow-up of ∼5 years. In a subgroup analysis of post–myocardial infarction (post-MI) patients, risks were 19% lower for CVD mortality and 22% lower for total mortality for alcohol intakes around 12 g/d. Inverse associations were observed for all levels of intake up to 24 g/d for CVD mortality and 32 g/d for total mortality. Risk estimates for alcohol and mortality in these cohorts were adjusted for age, sex (if applicable), smoking, BMI, physical activity, socioeconomic factors, and diabetes, but not for diet.

Since alcohol use is often linked to dietary habits, residual confounding in these studies cannot be excluded. Therefore, we set up an observational study of alcohol use and mortality risk in IHD patients, overcoming major shortcomings of previous studies, including short-term follow-ups, incomplete assessments of alcohol intake and dietary confounders, and a lack of investigation of abstainer bias. In 4365 post-MI patients of the Alpha Omega Cohort, we examined habitual alcohol intakes and risks of mortality during 12 years of follow-up, with extensive adjustments for diet, lifestyle, and other potential confounders. Alcohol use was studied in relation to all-cause, CVD, and IHD mortality, and sensitivity analyses were performed to gain insight into a potential abstainer bias.

### Frequent drinking is more predictive of ischemic stroke than binge drinking, but not of myocardial infarction [^112NYqPB]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Alcohol consumption has complex effects on myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke. We investigated the difference in associations according to drinking patterns (drinking frequency vs. amount per occasion) and sex.

Methods

This population-based retrospective study included 11,595,191 subjects participating in national health examinations between 2009 and 2010. Using Cox regression analyses, we calculated MI and ischemic stroke risk according to weekly alcohol consumption, drinking frequency, and amount per occasion.

Results

For MI, all weekly alcohol consumption amounts showed lower risk compared to non-drinkers: mild (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.78; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.77–0.79), moderate (aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.70–0.73), and heavy (aHR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72–0.76). Drinking frequency and amount per occasion did not differ in MI risk. However, women showed increased risk with heavy drinking and ≥ 8 drinks per occasion. For ischemic stroke, a J-shaped association was observed for weekly alcohol consumption: mild (aHR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.90–0.92), moderate (aHR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93–0.96), and heavy (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02–1.06). Among women, ischemic stroke risk began to increase with moderate drinking. Given similar weekly alcohol consumption levels, ischemic stroke risk increased with higher frequency of drinking, not with amount per occasion.

Conclusions

Drinking frequency may be a more important risk factor for ischemic stroke than amount per occasion. Among women, the protective effect of alcohol against MI was not evident in heavy amounts, and the risk of ischemic stroke began to increase at lower levels compared to men.

### Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies [^113TGqK7]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

For all-cause mortality, there was a positive and curvilinear association with alcohol consumption, with the lowest risk for those consuming below 100 g per week (figure 1, appendix p 25). Associations were similar for men and women (appendix p 26), but weaker at older ages (appendix p 27). There was a J-shaped association for the aggregate of cardiovascular disease outcomes (figure 1, appendix p 25). However, disaggregation showed two opposing sets of associations (figure 2). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and history of diabetes, the amount of alcohol consumed had positive and roughly linear associations with stroke (HR per 100 g/week higher consumption 1·14, 1·10–1·17), coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction (1·06, 1·00–1·11), heart failure (1·09, 1·03–1·15), fatal hypertensive disease (1·24, 1·15–1·33), and fatal aortic aneurysm (1·15, 1·03–1·28; Figure 2, Figure 3). By contrast, there was an inverse and approximately log-linear association with myocardial infarction (0·94, 0·91–0·97; Figure 2, Figure 3). Stroke associations were similar for fatal and non-fatal outcomes (appendix p 28) and across subtypes (appendix p 29). However, for coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction, associations were stronger for fatal than non-fatal outcomes (appendix p 28). For myocardial infarction, inverse associations were possibly more pronounced with non-fatal than fatal outcomes (figure 3, appendix p 28).

### A burden of proof study on alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease [^113hHdMN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We found large variation in the association between alcohol consumption and IHD by study design. When we pooled the results of cohort and case-control studies, we observed an inverse association between alcohol at average consumption levels and IHD risk; that is, drinking average levels of alcohol was associated with a reduced IHD risk relative to drinking no alcohol. In contrast, we did not find a statistically significant association between alcohol consumption and IHD risk when pooling results from MR studies. When we subset the conventional observational studies to those reporting on IHD by endpoint, we found no association between alcohol consumption and IHD morbidity or mortality due to large unexplained heterogeneity between studies. When we further subset those studies that reported effect size estimates by sex, we found that average alcohol consumption levels were inversely associated with IHD morbidity in males and in females, and with IHD mortality in males but not in females. When we analyzed only the studies that reported on MI, we found significant inverse associations between average consumption levels and MI overall and with MI morbidity. Visualizations of the risk curves for morbidity and mortality of IHD and MI are provided in Supplementary Information Section 9 (Figs. S2a –c, S3a –c, and S4a–c). Among all modeled risk curves for which a BPRF was calculated, the ROS ranged from −0.40 for MI mortality to 0.20 for MI morbidity. In the Supplementary Information, we also provide details on the RR and 95% UIs with and without between-study heterogeneity associated with each 10 g/day increase in consumption for each risk curve (Table S10), the parameter specifications of the model (Tables S11 and S12), and each risk curve from the main analysis estimated without trimming 10% of the data (Fig. S5a–l and Table S13).

### Patterns of alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease in culturally divergent countries: the prospective epidemiological study of myocardial infarction (PRIME) [^111BB52L]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization estimates that 17.1 million people died from cardiovascular diseases in 2004, which represents 29% of all deaths. Of these deaths, 7.2 million resulted from coronary heart disease and 5.7 million from stroke. In 2004, cardiovascular disease accounted for nearly 10% of the burden of disease attributable to alcohol in men worldwide.

In Europe in 2006, 28% of the population more than 15 years of age reported that they consumed five or more alcoholic drinks (50 g alcohol) on one occasion at least once a week, but the prevalence of binge drinking varied considerably across countries. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that excessive alcohol drinking is responsible for approximately 79 000 deaths a year in the United States. Conversely, many observational studies have reported inverse associations between some behaviours related to alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease.

The role of specific alcoholic beverages — that is, wine, beer, or spirits — in ischaemic heart disease is still debated. The relation between ischaemic heart disease and the type of beverage consumed is often considered a proxy for more complex inter-relations between lifestyle, diet, and socioeconomic factors. Drinking patterns, however, cannot be summarised simply in terms of total intake and beverage preference.

The role of the regularity of alcohol consumption throughout the week and the effect of heavy regular or binge drinking on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are factors that have recently aroused interest. Moreover, few studies have looked at outcomes in countries where lifestyle and drinking habits are known to contrast markedly. Variation in such behaviours could lead to different incidence of ischaemic heart disease. For example, the incidence of ischaemic heart disease is higher in Northern Ireland than in France. Is it possible that this disparity could be the result, at least partly, of the alcohol behaviours specific to each country? To assess these issues, we used data from the Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction (PRIME) cohort to analyse the patterns of alcohol consumption and their relation to the incidence of "hard" coronary events (myocardial infarction and coronary death) and angina pectoris events in men aged 50–59 years in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and in three cities in France.

### Reduced alcohol consumption and major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals with previously high alcohol consumption [^112VeoAF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide population-based cohort study, reduced alcohol consumption among people who drink heavily was associated with a lower risk of future cardiovascular events. Notably, habitual changes in heavy alcohol consumption from 2009 to 2012 were beneficial over the subsequent follow-up period of up to 10 years. Moreover, these benefits became increasingly evident approximately 3 years after the initiation of alcohol-related behavioral change. These preventive attributes were consistently observed across the various subgroups of people who drank heavily. The cardiovascular benefits of reduced alcohol intake presented differentially according to subtypes of CVD. More pronounced benefits were found, such as lower risk of ischemic stroke and ischemia-driven revascularization for angina. Collectively, these findings suggest that reducing alcohol consumption among people who drink heavily is potentially associated with a broad spectrum of benefits in future cardiovascular events and specific CVD subtypes.

Biological Mechanism of Protection From Reduced Alcohol Intake

Many previous studies have reported a potential association between mild to moderate alcohol consumption and reduced cardiovascular risk; however, a causal association remains unclear. Several plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Mild to moderate alcohol consumption orchestrates various biological processes that mitigate cardiovascular risk, including beneficial regulation of lipid profiles and fibrinolysis, decreased platelet aggregation, improved endothelial dysfunction, reduced vascular inflammation, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, mild to moderate alcohol consumption can play a role in lower stress-associated neurobiological activity, a neural underpinning of atherosclerotic CVD. These biological mechanisms of mild to moderate alcohol consumption may collaborate synergistically to reduce the risk of future CVD. In contrast, heavy alcohol consumption is associated with increased future cardiovascular risk by promoting predisposing medical comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, and sleep apnea. Based on this evidence, it can be hypothesized that reducing alcohol intake among people who drink heavily may be a factor in lower future cardiovascular risks. While this hypothesis remains to be thoroughly examined, conducting a large-scale prospective randomized clinical trial is nearly impossible because of ethical concerns regarding the establishment of individuals with sustained heavy drinking as the control group. Given these constraints, this cohort study provides crucial evidence regarding this high-risk population.

### A 42-year-old man considering whether to drink alcohol for his health [^111vreM5]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol consumption is widespread and, in excess, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the same time, a consistent body of observational evidence has found that individuals who consume alcohol within recommended limits have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than do abstainers. These observations have led many to consider small amounts of alcohol as a cardioprotective strategy. Mr Q, a 42-year-old man who has consistently sought ways to preserve his health, is at a crossroads in his discussions with his physicians about the health effects of his regular, limited alcohol intake. The discussion reviews the epidemiology of drinking in the United States, the established effects of moderate alcohol intake on key pathophysiological biomarkers and pathways, the strengths and limitations of observational evidence linking alcohol intake to lower risk of coronary heart disease, other chronic diseases linked to moderate alcohol intake, and a framework in which Mr Q can discuss the potential risks and benefits of alcohol consumption with his physicians.

### Alcohol intake and long-term mortality risk after myocardial infarction in the alpha omega cohort [^114c7mZD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

On one hand, alcohol intake may induce favorable changes in the cardiovascular system, such as improvement of the blood lipid profile, elevation of adiponectin, lowering of plasma fibrinogen, and a lower endocrine response to stress, which would support a cardioprotective effect. On the other hand, alcohol raises blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for CVD, and increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. Alcohol is harmful for the liver and brain and contributes to the development of cancers. It also increases the risk of injuries, and misuse of alcohol causes social harm. Therefore, even if a protective effect of alcohol intake against CVD were present, minimizing the intake of alcohol may be recommended.

Our study has several limitations. Misclassification of patients in alcohol categories could have occurred, because alcohol intake was only assessed at baseline, and seasonal variations in individual intake were not captured by our FFQ. This misclassification, which is likely to be nonsystematic, may have attenuated the HRs for alcohol in relation to mortality endpoints. Also, we were unable to examine drinking patterns or alcohol use in the context of meals. Heavy drinking could not adequately be studied, because patients with excessive alcohol intake (7 or more glasses per day) were not eligible for enrolment in the Alpha Omega Cohort. This also hampered the study of binge drinking, for which we found neutral associations, while other studies pointed at binge drinking as an independent risk factor for mortality and IHD risks. The Alpha Omega Cohort comprises predominantly male, older, post-MI patients from the Netherlands. CVD risk factors were largely controlled by state-of-the-art drug treatment. Medication use and the underlying atherothrombotic disease process could have affected the sensitivity to alcohol in our patients. Findings from the present study cannot be generalized to healthy populations and IHD patients from non-Caucasian origin, and women were also underrepresented in our study. Sample sizes in the subgroup analyses were relatively small, and results in smokers and patients with obesity and diabetes should therefore be interpreted with caution. Strengths of our study include the unique cohort of post-MI patients, with ∼12 years of follow-up for mortality endpoints and only 1 patient lost to follow-up. Detailed data collection enabled elaborate adjustments for dietary and lifestyle factors in the analyses. Alcohol intake was adequately assessed using a comprehensive FFQ and an additional lifestyle questionnaire. Sensitivity analyses were defined a priori to investigate potential biases.

### Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies [^1137yYgb]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Low-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary substantially across different national guidelines. To define thresholds associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, we studied individual-participant data from 599 912 current drinkers without previous cardiovascular disease.

Methods

We did a combined analysis of individual-participant data from three large-scale data sources in 19 high-income countries (the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, EPIC-CVD, and the UK Biobank). We characterised dose–response associations and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) per 100 g per week of alcohol (12·5 units per week) across 83 prospective studies, adjusting at least for study or centre, age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. To be eligible for the analysis, participants had to have information recorded about their alcohol consumption amount and status (ie, non-drinker vs current drinker), plus age, sex, history of diabetes and smoking status, at least 1 year of follow-up after baseline, and no baseline history of cardiovascular disease. The main analyses focused on current drinkers, whose baseline alcohol consumption was categorised into eight predefined groups according to the amount in grams consumed per week. We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular disease, and several cardiovascular disease subtypes. We corrected HRs for estimated long-term variability in alcohol consumption using 152 640 serial alcohol assessments obtained some years apart (median interval 5·6 years [5th–95th percentile 1·04–13·5]) from 71 011 participants from 37 studies.

Findings

In the 599 912 current drinkers included in the analysis, we recorded 40 310 deaths and 39 018 incident cardiovascular disease events during 5·4 million person-years of follow-up. For all-cause mortality, we recorded a positive and curvilinear association with the level of alcohol consumption, with the minimum mortality risk around or below 100 g per week. Alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR per 100 g per week higher consumption 1·14, 95% CI, 1·10–1·17), coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction (1·06, 1·00–1·11), heart failure (1·09, 1·03–1·15), fatal hypertensive disease (1·24, 1·15–1·33); and fatal aortic aneurysm (1·15, 1·03–1·28). By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was log-linearly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0·94, 0·91–0·97). In comparison to those who reported drinking > 0– ≤ 100 g per week, those who reported drinking > 100– ≤ 200 g per week, > 200– ≤ 350 g per week, or > 350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1–2 years, or 4–5 years, respectively.

Interpretation

In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g/week. For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with lower disease risk. These data support limits for alcohol consumption that are lower than those recommended in most current guidelines.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^114HkS5F]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence

Long-term randomized studies on alcohol exposure and IHD mortality or morbidity in the general population are unavailable. Regular alcohol intake has been found to have beneficial, dose-dependent effects on surrogate biomarkers for IHD risk in short-term experimental studies, mainly by increasing HDL cholesterol levels, inhibiting platelet activation, reducing fibrinogen levels, and producing anti-inflammatory effects. The increase in HDL cholesterol was also evident in experimental studies with regular heavy drinking (≥ 60 g/day every day), and the highest levels of HDL cholesterol are found in people with AUD. Despite elevated levels of HDL cholesterol even in regular heavy alcohol consumers, an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and other detrimental effects of episodic and chronic heavy alcohol consumption on heart disease risk seem to negate those beneficial effects, resulting in an overall neutral or detrimental association. The detrimental effect on blood pressure and arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, in particular from episodic and chronic heavy drinking, might play a role here, in combination with anti-atherosclerotic and anti-thrombotic processes. Although systematic experimental evidence for the effect of episodic heavy drinking is limited, the biochemical effects might involve HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, arrhythmias, and thrombosis. It seems that episodic heavy drinking increases LDL cholesterol levels without a favorable effect on HDL, and possibly a transient detrimental effect on thrombosis, hypertension, and arrhythmias. Prolonged chronic heavy drinking can result in the most extreme form of cardiac tissue damage, cardiomyopathy.

Sensitivity analyses

After exclusion of the first two years of follow-up, the associations between baseline alcohol consumption and non-fatal CHD and stroke were little changed, as shown in supplementary table 4. Alcohol consumption had inverse associations of similar magnitude with non-fatal and overall myocardial infarction. The inverse association for non-fatal myocardial infarction was confirmed in centres that did not assess incident angina, with a hazard ratio of 0.91 per 12 g/day increase (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.94, P < 0.001 for trend). In centres that assessed angina the associations were weaker, with a hazard ratio of 0.97 per 12 g/day increase (0.93 to 1.01, P = 0.100 for trend). Further adjustment for known history of cancer and diabetes at baseline did not appreciably change the results (data not shown). Analyses by country indicated that the associations between baseline alcohol consumption and risk of non-fatal and fatal CHD and stroke were not materially different across countries (see supplementary figure 1).

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^116d1oTq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite significant progress, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is composed of coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. In 2010, it was estimated that ≈1 in every 6 deaths was from CHD. In 2012, CHD was estimated to result in > 17.3 million deaths annually worldwide. With attempts to prevent or reduce the onset of modifiable risk factors, the burden of ASCVD can be reduced, making it an attractive target for preventive measures. In the INTERHEART (A Study Of Risk Factors For First Myocardial Infarction In 52 Countries And Over 27 000 Subjects) study, for example, 9 modifiable risk factors — smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, abdominal obesity, stress, poor diet, physical inactivity, and excess alcohol consumption — were responsible for > 90% of the risk for a first MI. Furthermore, because CV risk accrues slowly over time, every person can benefit from preventive interventions, whether primordial, primary, or secondary.

Prevention has played a pivotal role in the reduction in ASCVD morbidity and mortality seen over the last 3 decades. Nearly half (44%) of the decline in CHD deaths from 1980 to 2000 resulted from population‐wide risk‐factor reduction, with another half resulting from medical therapies targeting specific risk factors in patients with known or suspected atherosclerosis (47%). – In contrast, only 5% of the reduction in CHD deaths was due to coronary revascularization for chronic stable angina.

In a busy clinical practice, incorporating the recommendations from lengthy guideline documents into every visit can be challenging and difficult to remember. We offer this simplified guide to assist clinician compliance with guideline‐based care and to promote participation in the multiple preventive initiatives that exist, including the AHA 2020 goal, the Million Hearts Initiative, and the "25×25" target, each of which is aimed at preventing MIs and strokes and promoting CV health over the next decade and beyond. We present our recommendations in a simple, easy‐to‐remember "ABCDEF" format (Table 1) that integrates the most recent CV guideline recommendations. –

### Alcohol, wine, and cardiovascular health [^112frnCx]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Studies evaluating the health benefits of alcohol and wine have demonstrated that moderate consumption is associated with a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Various populations and alcoholic beverages exhibit this effect to different degrees. Alcoholic beverages exhibit multiple mechanisms that may favorably influence cardiac risk potential actions on platelets, antioxidants, fibrinolysis, and lipids. However, other data suggest that the perceived benefit of alcoholic beverages in general, and wine in particular, are the result of socioeconomic confounders. In the absence of more rigorous evidence, it is not currently possible to define the role of wine in human health.

### Alcohol and the cardiovascular system: research challenges and opportunities [^114QqtvA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption has long been associated with cardiovascular disorders, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. However, recent evidence suggests that moderate alcohol intake can actually provide a measure of cardioprotection, particularly against coronary heart disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury. To explore the various dimensions of these opposing actions of alcohol, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a state-of-the-art workshop on "Alcohol and the Cardiovascular System: Research Challenges and Opportunities" in Bethesda, Maryland, in May 2003. Speakers discussed the following topics: the epidemiology of alcohol and cardiovascular disease, clinical manifestations of alcohol, genetics of alcohol and cardiovascular disease, mechanisms underlying the molecular and cellular effects of alcohol, the application of new and emerging technology, and translation from discovery to therapeutic modalities of treatment. The panel concluded that future studies are needed to: 1) determine the role of genes and the environment in assessing mechanisms underlying the benefits of alcohol use and cardiovascular disease risk; 2) define the biological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced peripheral vascular damage; 3) clarify the role of genetic variation in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, genetic susceptibility, and pharmacogenomics in determining cardiovascular disease risk and effective treatment; 4) determine common mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced cardiovascular disease, such as oxidative stress and inflammation; 5) assess the role of insulin resistance, blood clotting, protein kinase C isoforms, and signal transduction mechanisms mediating alcohol's beneficial effects; and 6) explore the potential of stem cells in myocardial regeneration and repair in hearts damaged by alcohol.

### A burden of proof study on alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease [^115sAyX2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the University of Washington IRB Committee (study #9060).

Overview

The burden of proof approach is a six-step framework for conducting meta-analysis: (1) data from published studies that quantified the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk were systematically identified and obtained; (2) the shape of the mean relative risk (RR) curve (henceforth 'risk curve') and associated uncertainty was estimated using a quadratic spline and algorithmic trimming of outliers; (3) the risk curve was tested and adjusted for biases due to study attributes; (4) unexplained between-study heterogeneity was quantified, adjusting for within-study correlation and number of studies included; (5) the evidence for small-study effects was evaluated to identify potential risks of publication or reporting bias; and (6) the burden of proof risk function (BPRF) – a conservative interpretation of the average risk across the exposure range found in the data – was estimated relative to IHD risk at zero alcohol intake. The BPRF was converted to a risk-outcome score (ROS) that was mapped to a star rating from one to five to provide an intuitive interpretation of the magnitude and direction of the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD risk.

We calculated the mean RR and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for IHD associated with levels of alcohol consumption separately with all evidence available from conventional observational studies and from Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. For the risk curves that met the condition of statistical significance when the conventional 95% UI that does not include unexplained between-study heterogeneity was evaluated, we calculated the BPRF, ROS, and star rating. Based on input data from conventional observational studies, we also estimated these metrics by study design (cohort studies, case-control studies), and by IHD endpoint (morbidity, mortality) for both sexes (females, males) and sex-specific. For sex-stratified analyses, we only considered studies that reported effect sizes for both females and males to allow direct comparison of IHD risk across different exposure levels; however, we did not collect information about the method each study used to determine sex. We also estimated risk curves for myocardial infarction (MI), overall and by endpoint, using data from conventional observational studies. As a comparison, we also estimated each risk curve without trimming 10% of the input data. We did not consider MI as an outcome or disaggregate findings by sex or endpoint for MR studies due to insufficient data.

### Drinking frequency, mediating biomarkers, and risk of myocardial infarction in women and men [^1137nNbz]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The associations of drinking frequency and quantity with risk of myocardial infarction have not been studied among women, and the degree to which specific risk factors mediate the inverse association of drinking frequency with risk of myocardial infarction is uncertain.

Methods and Results

We conducted nested case-control studies of 32,826 women enrolled in the Nurses Health Study followed up from 1990 to 1998 and 18,225 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study followed up from 1994 to 2000. A total of 249 women and 266 men with incident myocardial infarction were matched on age, smoking, and date of entry to 498 female and 532 male control participants. We determined the risk of myocardial infarction related to frequency and quantity of alcohol intake and the change in risk before and after adjustment for putative cardiovascular risk factors. Among both women and men, drinking frequency tended to be associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction, with the lowest risks among those who drank 3 to 7 days per week. Further adjustment for levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hemoglobin A(1c), and fibrinogen attenuated 75% of the association of frequent drinking with risk among women and fully attenuated the association among men.

Conclusions

Alcohol intake at least 3 to 4 days per week is associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction among women and men, an association apparently attributable to the relationship of alcohol with HDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and hemoglobin A(1c). Because the effects of alcohol on HDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and insulin sensitivity have been confirmed in randomized trials, our findings support the hypothesis that the inverse relation of alcohol use and myocardial infarction is causal.

### Systematic evaluation of the impact of a wide range of dietary habits on myocardial infarction: a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis [^112gULye]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Myocardial infarction stands as 1 of the leading global causes of death, imposing significant morbidity and mortality rates and posing a substantial threat to human health. Behavior modification emerges as a pivotal strategy capable of preventing a considerable number of primary and secondary cardiovascular events. Through comprehensive screening of genetic associations and causal relationships between dietary habits and myocardial infarction, targeted dietary interventions hold promise in averting or diminishing the incidence of myocardial infarction. Using a 2‐sample MR analysis, we leveraged pooled data from genome‐wide association studies of myocardial infarction and explored 9 categories (83 types) of dietary habits to identify 4 categories, comprising 7 types of dietary habits, demonstrating genetic correlations with myocardial infarction. Among these, particularly "tablespoons of cooked vegetables per day" was the most potent risk factor for myocardial infarction. Furthermore, "coffee consumption" (cups per day) and "frequency of adding salt to food" were identified as additional risk factors for myocardial infarction. Conversely, "overall alcohol intake" and "overall cheese consumption" demonstrate strong protective effect against myocardial infarction, with intermediary analysis suggesting that "overall alcohol intake" can mitigate the occurrence of myocardial infarction by modulating HDL‐C levels. Meanwhile, the protective effect of "overall alcohol intake" also against myocardial infarction is mediated by triglycerides. Moreover, the protective effect of "cereal type: muesli" against myocardial infarction is mediated by HDL‐C. Similarly, the protective effect of adhering to "cereal consumption (bowls per week)" against myocardial infarction is partially mediated by TC.

### Differential associations of alcohol use with ischemic heart disease mortality by socioeconomic status in the US, 1997–2018 [^113uhfa7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this cohort study is the first to have analyzed, at the individual level, the socioeconomic gradient in the association of alcohol use with IHD mortality in the US, with a more pronounced protective association with light-to-moderate drinking identified in the high-SES group. This specific protective association should be considered in the context of other known harms from drinking at even low levels, such as cancers, and other studies that do not show an all-cause mortality benefit. Public health interventions should account for different socioeconomic backgrounds in assessing the level of risk related to alcohol exposure, bearing in mind that levels of consumption deemed safe regarding a specific outcome such as IHD may indeed be less safe or not safe across all sociodemographic groups. Future studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms by which alcohol affects cardiovascular health in people with low SES.

### Relation of alcohol consumption and coronary heart disease in hypertensive male physicians (from the physicians' health study) [^113H4TgW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Alcohol has diverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Moderate drinking is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, yet increasing amounts of alcohol consumption are known to increase blood pressure. These opposing effects have led to interest in the effect of moderate alcohol consumption on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with hypertension. To test the hypothesis that moderate alcohol consumption decreases the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with hypertension, we used data on 5,164 participants in the Physicians' Health Study who were apparently healthy and free of CHD at baseline. Incident MI was ascertained by annual follow-up questionnaires and validated through review of medical records. Cox proportional hazard model was used to compute multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. From 1982 to 2008, 623 cases of MI occurred. Compared to subjects consuming < 1 drink per week, hazard ratios for MI were 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.28), 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.97), and 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.95) for alcohol consumption of 1 to 4, 5 to 7, and > 8 drinks per week adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, exercise, diabetes, multivitamin use, vegetable intake, breakfast cereal intake, and cholesterol (p for trend < 0.0022). Similar inferences could be made for the secondary outcomes of angina pectoris and any CHD (which included MI, angina pectoris, and previous revascularization). In conclusion, our data demonstrated an inverse relation between moderate alcohol consumption and CHD in hypertensive men.

### Alcohol and cardiovascular health: the razor-sharp double-edged sword [^1123Uxru]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

An extensive body of data shows concordant J-shaped associations between alcohol intake and a variety of adverse health outcomes, including coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, stroke, dementia, Raynaud's phenomenon, and all-cause mortality. Light to moderate alcohol consumption (up to 1 drink daily for women and 1 or 2 drinks daily for men) is associated with cardioprotective benefits, whereas increasingly excessive consumption results in proportional worsening of outcomes. Alcohol consumption confers cardiovascular protection predominately through improvements in insulin sensitivity and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The ethanol itself, rather than specific components of various alcoholic beverages, appears to be the major factor in conferring health benefits. Low-dose daily alcohol is associated with better health than less frequent consumption. Binge drinking, even among otherwise light drinkers, increases cardiovascular events and mortality. Alcohol should not be universally prescribed for health enhancement to nondrinking individuals owing to the lack of randomized outcome data and the potential for problem drinking.

### Text messaging interventions for reducing alcohol consumption among risky drinkers: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115C1wYY]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rationale

Alcohol consumption is a leading risk factor for non‐communicable diseases, which are responsible for 70% of deaths globally each year, of which cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases and diabetes account for more than 80% [1]. Alcohol also causes injuries, road traffic accidents and violence [2]. This means that alcohol consumption continues to be a leading cause of death, with approximately 4.5% of deaths globally attributable to alcohol and 25% of all deaths in the age group 20–49 years [3]. While there is evidence suggesting that a small amount of alcohol may have a protective effect on myocardial infarction, the overall risk of alcohol consumption outweighs any potential benefit, hence the conclusion that there is no safe dose [4].

mHealth and text messaging

In 2019, it was estimated that 97% of the global population resided in an area with a mobile cellular signal [5]. This global growth of mobile phone subscriptions has led to new opportunities for health promotion, and the field of mobile health (mHealth) has grown substantially over the past decade [6]. Continuous contact with individuals, interactivity, and cost reductions are some of the potential benefits associated with mHealth interventions.

One way in which mHealth interventions can be deployed is through text messaging, which is a technology ubiquitous in mobile phones. The technology runs on networks utilizing earlier standards, such as the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications, which are generally more available and cheaper than later standards (3G and 4G). Thus, interventions utilizing text messaging potentially have great reach globally among those who could benefit from health behaviour change.

In alcohol research, text messaging has been used both as a stand‐alone intervention and in combination with other digital media such as websites [7, 8, 9]. Reviews of mHealth interventions for alcohol, which have included text messaging, have indicated positive but mixed findings of their efficacy [10, 11]; however, these reviews have had a wide scope and have not included meta‐analyses. Thus, direct guidance is limited with respect to the effectiveness of text messaging as a stand‐alone alcohol intervention. Therefore, this systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to estimate the effects of text messaging interventions on alcohol consumption among risky drinkers.

### Alcohol use and cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111yVaVc]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is one of the most commonly consumed substances in the world, exhibiting complex relationships with multiple aspects of cardiovascular health and disease. The majority of the research on the topic is observational and therefore prone to bias and confounding. The available evidence suggests no risk to possible risk reduction when alcohol is consumed in low amounts (such as no more than 1 to 2 drinks a day) in regard to coronary artery disease, stroke, sudden death, and possibly heart failure. The risk associated with consuming 1 to 2 drinks a day on atrial fibrillation remains unknown. More randomized trials of low to moderate alcohol consumption are needed for more definitive conclusions. In stark contrast, heavier alcohol consumption such as binge drinking or consuming on average ≥ 3 drinks/d is consistently associated with worse outcomes in every cardiovascular disease entity studied. Considering the level of evidence, it remains unknown whether drinking is part of a healthy lifestyle and therefore clinicians should reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regularly engaging in physical activity, avoiding tobacco use, and maintaining healthy body weight.

### Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies [^111Gk88z]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary substantially across different national guidelines. To define thresholds associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, we studied individual-participant data from 599912 current drinkers without previous cardiovascular disease.

Methods

We did a combined analysis of individual-participant data from three large-scale data sources in 19 high-income countries (the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, EPIC-CVD, and the UK Biobank). We characterised dose-response associations and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) per 100 g per week of alcohol (12·5 units per week) across 83 prospective studies, adjusting at least for study or centre, age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. To be eligible for the analysis, participants had to have information recorded about their alcohol consumption amount and status (ie, non-drinker vs current drinker), plus age, sex, history of diabetes and smoking status, at least 1 year of follow-up after baseline, and no baseline history of cardiovascular disease. The main analyses focused on current drinkers, whose baseline alcohol consumption was categorised into eight predefined groups according to the amount in grams consumed per week. We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular disease, and several cardiovascular disease subtypes. We corrected HRs for estimated long-term variability in alcohol consumption using 152640 serial alcohol assessments obtained some years apart (median interval 5·6 years [5th-95th percentile 1·04–13·5]) from 71011 participants from 37 studies.

Findings

In the 599912 current drinkers included in the analysis, we recorded 40310 deaths and 39018 incident cardiovascular disease events during 5·4 million person-years of follow-up. For all-cause mortality, we recorded a positive and curvilinear association with the level of alcohol consumption, with the minimum mortality risk around or below 100 g per week. Alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR per 100 g per week higher consumption 1·14, 95% CI, 1·10–1·17), coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction (1·06, 1·00–1·11), heart failure (1·09, 1·03–1·15), fatal hypertensive disease (1·24, 1·15–1·33); and fatal aortic aneurysm (1·15, 1·03–1·28). By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was log-linearly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0·94, 0·91–0·97). In comparison to those who reported drinking > 0- ≤ 100 g per week, those who reported drinking > 100- ≤ 200 g per week, > 200- ≤ 350 g per week, or > 350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1–2 years, or 4–5 years, respectively.

Interpretation

In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g/week. For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with lower disease risk. These data support limits for alcohol consumption that are lower than those recommended in most current guidelines.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^113Y9SxT]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

One criticism of this literature is that low‐volume drinkers may appear healthier only because the 'abstainers' with whom they are compared are not drinking because of pre‐existing medical conditions (so‐called 'sick quitters') or disease caused by prior high levels of alcohol consumption. A meta‐analysis of 87 studies investigating alcohol use and mortality risk replicated the classic J‐shaped curve, with low‐volume drinkers (1.3–24.9 g ethanol/day) having reduced mortality risk [relative risk (RR) = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.83, 0.90] 15. Occasional drinkers (< 1.3 g/day) had similar mortality risk (RR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.89) and former drinkers had elevated risk (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.31). However, after adjustment for abstainer biases and quality‐related study characteristics, no significant reduction in mortality risk was observed for low‐volume drinkers (RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.88, 1.07). Restriction of the analysis to higher‐quality, bias‐free studies also failed to show a reduced mortality risk for low‐volume alcohol drinkers. Risk estimates for occasional drinkers were similar to those for low‐ and medium‐volume drinkers 15.

Any cardioprotective effect of regular low‐volume alcohol consumption disappears as soon as episodes of excessive drinking occur. One meta‐analysis found that individuals with irregular heavy drinking episodes of ≥ 60 g pure alcohol per occasion (> 12×/year but < five×/week) had a 45% increased morbidity and mortality risk from ischaemic heart disease compared with individuals with a regular, moderate alcohol use pattern, even after adjusting for study type, subject age and smoking, and exclusion of former drinkers to control for sick quitters 16. Overall, the detrimental effects of alcohol far outweigh the beneficial effects, and the risk of premature mortality increases steadily after 10 g average daily consumption in European populations 17.

### Alcohol and cardiovascular disease [^111q6Npk]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Over four decades ago, Klatsky and his colleagues published perhaps the first carefully conducted epidemiological investigation of alcohol consumption and risk of myocardial infarction, a case-control study nested within the health records of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California. Taking advantage of some 120 000 health plan members who completed a standardized set of over 500 individual questions, the authors identified 464 members who sustained an incident myocardial infarction at local Kaiser hospitals. They compared the alcohol consumption reported on a previous questionnaire among these members with that of two sets of controls drawn from the same source population. Among non-smokers, the odds of myocardial infarction were about twice as high among non-drinkers as among drinkers, raising the possibility that alcohol consumption could lower risk of coronary heart disease.

In subsequent analyses of members of the Kaiser-Permanente health maintenance organization, Klatsky and colleagues went on to show that alcohol consumption has diverse associations with various forms of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including a roughly inverse association with coronary heart disease, a U shaped association with ischemic stroke, and roughly direct associations with hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke.

### Access to alcohol and heart disease among patients in hospital: observational cohort study using differences in alcohol sales laws [^112438Jh]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Although most population based studies have suggested that increased alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of incident atrial fibrillation, not all reports have identified a significant association. In this study, wet county residents had more atrial fibrillation, whether analyzed as a prevalent or incident outcome. Atrial fibrillation was the only outcome that showed divergent results between the unadjusted numbers and the adjusted results in the intra-county analyses. Such results were in fact expected owing to two important considerations: firstly, dry county residents were older and more often male and non-Hispanic white, all particularly important risk factors for atrial fibrillation; secondly, owing to the inverse relations between county status and myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, some "negative confounding" (sometimes termed "suppression") was likely, which, once accounted for, uncovered wet county status as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Propensity based analyses also showed that atrial fibrillation was more common in wet counties. As this database tracked patients on their county of residence, and not by the location of the admitting hospital, these findings are unlikely to be explained by rural versus urban hospital referral patterns. These findings are further supported by our more robust intra-county before and after election analysis, which showed an increase in admissions for atrial fibrillation after the liberalization of drinking laws.

Although previous data generally favor a protective effect of alcohol on the risk of myocardial infarction, results from conventional epidemiologic studies have been conflicting. Previous studies have used per capita alcohol consumption and population based outcomes to understand the relation between alcohol and cardiovascular health. Interestingly, the most consistent message is that more per capita alcohol consumption is associated with an increased mortality among patients with ischemic heart disease. However, none of these studies focused on incident myocardial infarction, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation. In our study, patients residing in wet counties had a lower risk of myocardial infarction. In contrast, no significant changes in admissions for myocardial infarction were observed after a change in alcohol sales laws within the same counties. Although this may suggest that some residual confounding in the wet versus dry county analyses remains, it may be that the chronic beneficial effects of alcohol had inadequate time to confer any demonstrable protection against myocardial infarction with changes in alcohol access over a relatively short timeframe. Most of the beneficial effects on coronary artery disease are thought to be chronic, including influencing pathways related to cholesterol transport, insulin sensitivity, abdominal obesity, and oxidative stress.

### Low-risk diet and lifestyle habits in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction in men: a population-based prospective cohort study [^114oYddG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Adherence to a combination of healthy dietary and lifestyle practices may have an impressive impact on the primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI).

Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine the benefit of combined low-risk diet and healthy lifestyle practices on the incidence of MI in men.

Methods

The population-based, prospective cohort of Swedish men comprised 45- to 79-year-old men who completed a detailed questionnaire on diet and lifestyle at baseline in 1997. In total, 20,721 men with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol levels were followed through 2009. Low-risk behavior included 5 factors: a healthy diet (top quintile of Recommended Food Score), moderate alcohol consumption (10 to 30 g/day), no smoking, being physically active (walking/bicycling ≥ 40 min/day and exercising ≥ 1 h/week), and having no abdominal adiposity (waist circumference < 95 cm).

Results

During 11 years of follow-up, we ascertained 1,361 incident cases of MI. The low-risk dietary choice together with moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a relative risk of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48 to 0.87) compared with men having 0 of 5 low-risk factors. Men having all 5 low-risk factors compared with those with 0 low-risk factors had a relative risk of 0.14 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.43). This combination of healthy behaviors, present in 1% of the men, could prevent 79% (95% CI: 34% to 93%) of the MI events on the basis of the study population.

Conclusions

Almost 4 of 5 MIs in men may be preventable with a combined low-risk behavior.

### Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular risk in hypertensives with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study [^111tUCEs]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

The Losartan Intervention For End point reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study showed superiority of losartan over atenolol for reduction of composite risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction in hypertensives with left ventricular hypertrophy. We compared hazard ratios (HR) in 4287 and 685 participants who reported intakes of 1–7 and > 8 drinks/week at baseline, respectively, with those in 4216 abstainers, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, exercise, and race. Within categories, clinical baseline characteristics, numbers randomized to losartan and atenolol, and blood pressure (BP) lowering were similar on the drug regimens. Overall BP control (< 140/90 mmHg) at end of follow-up was similar in the categories. Composite end point rate was lower with 1–7 (24/1000 years; HR 0.87, P < 0.05) and > 8 drinks/week (26/1000 years; HR 0.80, NS) than in abstainers (27/1000 years). Myocardial infarction risk was reduced in both drinking categories (HR 0.76, P < 0.05 and HR 0.29, P < 0.001, respectively), while stroke risk tended to increase with > 8 drinks/week (HR 1.21, NS). Composite risk was significantly reduced with losartan compared to atenolol only in abstainers (HR 0.81 95% confidence interval, CI (0.68, 0.96), P < 0.05), while benefits for stroke risk reduction were similar among participants consuming 1–7 drinks/week (HR 0.73, P < 0.05) and abstainers (HR 0.72, P < 0.01). Despite different treatment benefits, alcohol-treatment interactions were nonsignificant. In conclusion, moderate alcohol consumption does not change the marked stroke risk reduction with losartan compared to atenolol in high-risk hypertensives. Alcohol reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, while the risk of stroke tends to increase with high intake.

### Influence of mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption on cardiovascular diseases in men from the general population [^116k6WKP]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Methods

There is controversy about the association between mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption and a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The relationships between daily alcohol consumption and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke (IS) were examined in men in a community-based, prospective cohort study (n = 8014, age 40–80 years, mean age = 64.1 years). Alcohol consumption was categorized into 3 groups (A1, none or occasional; A2, ≤ 25 g/day; A3, > 25 g/day as ethanol) at baseline.

Results

During the mean follow-up of 5.5 years, 53 MIs and 186 ISs occurred. On Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking index, and body mass index (BMI), the hazard ratio (HR) for incident MI was significantly lower in the A2 group than in the A1 group (HR = 0.49, p = 0.043). The HR for incident MI in the A3 group tended to be lower than in the A1 group (HR = 0.53, p = 0.10). In obese subjects, while a significantly lower HR for incident MI in the A2 group was retained (HR = 0.29, p = 0.049), no significant difference in the HR of the A3 group compared with the A1 group was found. No significant differences were found in the IS-free curve among the 3 groups of alcohol consumption.

Conclusions

Alcohol consumption may have a protective effect on the onset of MI but not on IS in the general population. A U-shaped relation between alcohol consumption and incident MI was found in obese subjects. An appropriate limit for daily alcohol consumption, depending on the risk of ischemic heart disease, may need to be established.

### Alcohol consumption and brain health [^1168iVc9]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Epidemiological studies often report better heath in moderate drinkers compared with abstainers. Observed first in studies of incidence of myocardial infarction, the "J shaped curve" (describing the graphical appearance of health measures plotted against consumption) reappears in studies of diabetes, stroke, and even chronic widespread pain. As methods of investigating the association between alcohol and health are refined, however, the size of the apparent benefits reduces substantially. Studies using "Mendelian randomisation", purportedly impervious to confounding or reverse causality, do not support the original claim that moderate drinking improves cardiovascular health.

Regarded as a further example of the J shaped curve, a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption against "all cause" dementia has been reported. This has not been underpinned by a convincing neural correlate, however, and it is here that the linked study by Topiwala and colleagues (doi:) is particularly ambitious. In their prospective cohort of 550 civil servants, none of whom were alcohol dependent, the authors repeatedly assessed alcohol consumption and cognition over 30 years. Participants underwent brain imaging at the most recent review, enabling examination of relations between average alcohol use, cognition, and brain structure.

After adjustment for numerous potential confounders, alcohol use was associated with reduced right hippocampal volume in a dose dependent manner; even moderate drinkers (classified as up to 21 units a week for men at the time of the study) were three times more likely to have hippocampal atrophy than abstainers, and very light drinking (1–6 units a week) conferred no protection relative to abstinence. Higher alcohol consumption was also associated with reduced white matter integrity and faster decline in lexical fluency, a test of "executive function".

With increasing longevity, maintenance of brain health into older age is the key priority of our time. Leaving aside the human cost of dementia, care of cognitively impaired older people is a looming financial crisis, prompting politicians to consider controversial and deeply unpopular policy decisions. Alcohol dependence is already established as a major cause of dementia, alcohol related brain damage (ARBD) accounts for possibly 10% of early onset dementiaand potentially 10–24% of dementia cases in nursing homes.

### Trajectories of alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease: a 35-year prospective cohort study [^115K6d2A]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature mortality and a major contributor to disability. Globally, the number of prevalent CVD cases has increased rapidly since 1990, reaching 523 million in 2019. The association between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced risk of CVD is well‐documented and heatedly debated. However, relatively few studies have focused on patients who have already experienced a CVD event and the effects that alcohol drinking may have on their subsequent health. A recent meta‐analysis suggests that drinking up to 105 g of ethanol per week is associated with lower risks of mortality and subsequent cardiovascular events than non‐drinking in those with established CVD. It is noteworthy that this threshold is lower than the upper limits of drinking recommended in most current guidelines.

Similar to the critiques of studies on general populations, the evidence among CVD patients is far from robust for several important reasons. First, most studies (11 of 14) included in the meta‐analysis only looked at the association cross‐sectionally, despite evidence that drinking behaviours change over time and that misclassification of alcohol intake has the potential to bias the risk estimates. Longitudinal prospective assessment of intake is needed to accurately measure long‐term exposure to alcohol, and this is particularly relevant when studying biological processes that cause chronic effects on health. Secondly, in those few studies of CVD patients that did include longitudinal assessment of alcohol and subsequent health risks, the methodology used can be questioned. In most cases these studies categorized the patients into different drinking groups according to each patient's average intake during follow‐up, with no accounting for intra‐individual variation in drinking levels over time. Failure to capture such variation may result in over‐simplistic interpretation of alcohol use and consequent outcomes, as there is evidence from general population samples that unstable drinking patterns confer increased risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and total mortality independent of average intake. Thirdly, these studies often included former drinkers (who might have quit in response to ill health) in the non‐drinking group, which could erroneously lead to a suggested protective effect of drinking compared to non‐drinking. Indeed, when former drinkers were excluded from the meta‐analysis, the protective effect of moderate drinking on all‐cause mortality among CVD patients was eliminated. Fourthly, most studies also had a heterogeneous group of patients with incident or recurrent CVD events and did not adequately account for concurrent changes in other life‐style and health factors, such as smoking, which is associated both with levels of drinking and with mortality and thus might confound the results.

### Binge drinking and mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^116kqwY7]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Moderate drinkers have a lower risk of mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Although binge drinking has been associated with a higher risk of MI in some studies, its relation to prognosis after MI is uncertain.

Methods and Results

In a prospective, inception cohort study conducted at 45 US hospitals, 1935 patients hospitalized with a confirmed MI between 1989 and 1994 underwent detailed personal interviews. Patients reported their usual frequency of binge drinking of beer, wine, and liquor, defined as intake of 3 or more drinks within 1 to 2 hours, and were followed up for mortality for a median of 3.8 years. Of 1919 eligible patients, 250 (94% men) reported binge drinking during the prior year, and a total of 318 patients died during follow-up. Binge drinkers had a 2-fold higher risk of mortality than drinkers who did not binge (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 3.0). A comparison of 192 binge drinkers and 192 other patients matched on propensity scores yielded a similar result. The association between binge drinking and total mortality tended to be similar among patients whose usual alcohol intake was light or heavier and for binge drinkers who consumed beer, wine, or liquor. Usual alcohol intake was inversely associated with mortality, but binge drinking completely attenuated this relation.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that alcohol consumption may be linked to potential hazards among patients who survive acute MI. Although moderate intake has been associated with lower mortality, binge drinking, even among light drinkers, appears to be associated with 2-fold higher mortality.

### Conventional and genetic evidence on alcohol and vascular disease aetiology: a prospective study of 500 000 men and women in China [^117V1FaN]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

For heart disease, the genetic epidemiological analyses are more difficult to interpret reliably. For acute myocardial infarction, they suggest little net effect on risk over the range from near zero to about 250 g per week of predicted mean intake. This is what would be expected if moderate alcohol intake is not really protective, and if (as in the meta-analysis of previous conventional studies) increased intake is not really hazardous above the range of intakes studied. The number of cases of acute myocardial infarction was, however, limited, so some real benefit or hazard cannot be excluded. Considering the two variants separately, our findings for rs1229984 (based on small numbers) are consistent with previous meta-analyses in European-origin populations, but our findings for rs671 do not support previous meta-analyses in east Asian populations, which suggested a moderate association between the alcohol-tolerant rs671 allele and decreased coronary heart disease risk.

The lack of a positive association between genotype-predicted alcohol intake and acute myocardial infarction suggests the adverse effects of alcohol intake on blood pressure could be offset by cardio-protective changes in other factors. Although HDL cholesterol increased substantially with alcohol intake, the causal relevance of different components of HDL cholesterol to coronary heart disease risk remain uncertain. A previous trialof the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib, which substantially increases HDL cholesterol, reported a coronary heart disease reduction that was no greater than would be expected just from the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effects of the drug, and in previous analysesof the China Kadoorie Biobank study, a loss-of-function variant of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein that substantially increases total HDL cholesterol had little net effect on the incidence of coronary heart disease.

### Alcohol intake and long-term mortality risk after myocardial infarction in the alpha omega cohort [^114NTZDq]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the Alpha Omega Cohort of Dutch post-MI patients with ∼12 years follow-up, light or moderate alcohol intake was inversely associated with long-term risks of all-cause, CVD, and IHD mortality. In men, we observed nonlinear, inverse associations with these mortality endpoints, with the lowest HRs for alcohol intakes around 20 g/d. In the smaller group of women, associations for light and moderate alcohol intakes were also inverse, but weak and nonsignificant, with the lowest HRs around 10 g/d. For high alcohol intake, the mortality risk (especially from IHD) was increased in women.

In a meta-analysis by Costanzo et al.) of prospective cohort studies specifically in CVD patients, light and moderate alcohol intakes were associated with lower risks of all-cause and CVD mortality during a median follow-up of ∼5 years. In their subgroup analysis of post-MI patients from the United States and Europe, the maximum observed risk reductions were 19% for CVD mortality and 22% for total mortality for alcohol intakes around 12 g/d, corresponding to roughly 1 standard drink per day. These results were mainly driven by data in men, since women were not included or were underrepresented in the different cohorts. The present analysis in the Alpha Omega Cohort showed 15%–20% lower risks of CVD and all-cause mortality for light or moderate drinking. In our study of predominantly male patients (79%), the lowest mortality risks were observed for alcohol intakes around 20 g/d, corresponding to 2 drinks a day. Because of the relatively wide CIs around the HRs, our data would also be compatible with lower "optimal" doses of alcohol (e.g. 1 drink a day), in line with the meta-analysis by Costanzo et al. In our subgroup analysis of women, the mortality risks were lowest for alcohol intakes around 10 g/d, but the HRs were not statistically significant due to small numbers.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115QugsL]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Chronic coronary disease — alcohol consumption guidance indicates risk from binge drinking and counseling messages: "In patients with CCD, excessive alcohol is linked to hypertension, increased mortality rate, and recurrent cardiovascular events". In PRIME, binge drinking "(> 50 g at least once a week) was associated with a higher risk of coronary events (hazard ratio, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.41–2.94]) compared with regular drinking". Another study across "45 community and tertiary-care medical centers" found "a 2-fold higher mortality rate after an acute MI". A global analysis concluded harm minimization at "zero". Therefore, patients who do not drink or who must avoid alcohol "should not be encouraged to drink", and "Clinicians should further counsel their patients against binge drinking".

### A burden of proof study on alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease [^111ykAtU]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

There are several limitations that must be considered when interpreting our findings. First, record screening for our systematic review was not conducted in a double-blinded fashion. Second, we did not have sufficient evidence to estimate and examine potential differential associations of alcohol consumption with IHD risk by beverage type or with MI endpoints by sex. Third, despite using a flexible meta-regression tool that overcame several limitations common to meta-analyses, the results of our meta-analysis were only as good as the quality of the studies included. We were able, however, to address the issue of varying quality of input data by adjusting for bias covariates that corresponded to core study characteristics in our analyses. Fourth, because we were only able to include one-sample MR studies that captured genetically predicted alcohol consumption, statistical power may be lower than would have been possible with the inclusion of two-sample MR studies, and studies that directly estimated gene-IHD associations were not considered. Finally, we were not able to account for participants' HED status when pooling effect size estimates from conventional observational studies. Given established differences in IHD risk for drinkers with and without HEDand the fact that more than one in three drinkers reports HED, we would expect that the decreased average risk we found at moderate levels of alcohol consumption would be attenuated (i.e. approach the IHD risk of non-drinkers) if the presence of HED was taken into account.

Using the burden of proof approach, we conservatively re-evaluated the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD risk based on existing cohort, case-control, and MR data. Consistent with previous meta-analyses, we found that alcohol at average consumption levels was inversely associated with IHD when we pooled conventional observational studies. This finding was supported when aggregating: (i) all studies, (ii) only cohort studies, (iii) only case-control studies, (iv) studies examining IHD morbidity in females and males, (v) studies examining IHD mortality in males, and (vi) studies examining MI morbidity. In contrast, we found no association between genetically predicted alcohol consumption and IHD risk based on data from MR studies. Our confirmation of the conflicting results derived from self-reported versus genetically predicted alcohol use data highlights the need to advance methodologies that will provide more definitive answers to this critical public health question. Given the limitations of randomized trials, we advocate using advanced MR techniques and emulating target trials using observational data to generate more conclusive evidence on the long-term effects of alcohol consumption on IHD risk.

### Alcohol consumption and coronary atherosclerosis progression – the stockholm female coronary risk angiographic study [^114HvhR8]. Atherosclerosis (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of alcohol intake with progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Although moderate drinkers have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than abstainers, the relation of alcohol use and coronary atherosclerosis has not been well studied.

Methods and Results

In the Stockholm Female Coronary Risk Angiographic Study, we evaluated 103 women, aged 65 years or younger, hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris who underwent serial quantitative coronary angiography 3–6 months following their index event and repeated an average of 3 years and 3 months (range 2–5 years) later. Individual alcoholic beverage consumption was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. We used mixed model analysis to estimate the effect of alcohol consumption on progression of coronary atherosclerosis, as measured by mean luminal diameter change, controlling for age, smoking, body-mass index, education, physical activity, index cardiac event, menopausal status, diabetes, and history of dyslipidemia. Of the 93 women with complete information on alcohol intake, 14 consumed no alcohol (abstainers), 55 consumed up to 5 g of alcohol per day (light drinkers), and 24 consumed more than 5 g of alcohol per day (moderate drinkers). Coronary atherosclerosis progressed by a multivariate-adjusted average of 0.138 mm (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.027–0.249) among abstainers, 0.137 mm (95% CI: 0.057–0.217) among light drinkers, and -0.054 mm (95% CI: -0.154 to 0.047) among moderate drinkers (P < 0.001). The inverse association persisted in analyses stratified by index event. No beverage type appeared to confer particular benefit.

Conclusions

Among middle-aged women with coronary heart disease, moderate alcohol consumption (over 5 g/day) was protective of coronary atherosclerosis progression.

### The use of expensive technologies instead of simple, sound and effective lifestyle interventions: a perpetual delusion [^115dqVY9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Do we need to prescribe statins or 'polypills' to more than 30% of the general adult population for CVD prevention when we already know that 80% of CVD events can be prevented with simple dietary and non-dietary lifestyle measures?As the large PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) primary prevention nutritional trial showed, simple dietary interventions can prevent many different cardiovascular problems. Indeed, only a modest increment in the adherence to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (100% fat) or with nuts (> 50% fat) obtained a 30% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death)and also attained other cardiovascular benefits in primary prevention. Improved adherence to a high-quality dietary pattern has the additional benefit of enjoying palatable foods and will allow many more people to live longer without any need of recommending low-fat diets or using pharmacological solutions which are not exempt from side effects. Yet, even though light to moderate alcohol intake might reduce cardiovascular mortality, being physically active and eating a healthier diet can be more effective than drinking a low dose of alcohol, which may have other undesirable effects.

### Alcohol intake and long-term mortality risk after myocardial infarction in the alpha omega cohort [^111j23bM]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Population-based studies generally show J-shaped associations between alcohol intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Little is known about alcohol and long-term mortality risk after myocardial infarction (MI).

Objectives

We examined alcohol intake in relation to all-cause, CVD, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in Dutch post-MI patients of the Alpha Omega Cohort.

Methods

The analysis comprised 4365 patients (60–80 years; 79% male) with an MI ≤ 10 years before study enrolment. We used a 203-item FFQ to assess alcohol (total ethanol) and dietary intakes over the past month. Patients were classified as nondrinkers (0 g/d; n = 956) or very light (> 0 to 2 g/d; n = 385), light (M: > 2 to 10 g/d; F: > 2 to 5 g/d; n = 1125), moderate (M: > 10 to 30 g/d; F: > 5 to 15 g/d; n = 1207), or heavy drinkers (M: > 30 g/d; F: > 15 g/d; n = 692). HRs of mortality for alcohol intake were obtained from Cox models, adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking, BMI, physical activity, and dietary factors.

Results

Alcohol was consumed by 83% of males and 61% of females. During ∼12 years of follow-up, 2035 deaths occurred, of which 903 were from CVD and 558 were from IHD. Compared to the (combined) reference group of nondrinkers and very light drinkers, HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78–0.98), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75–0.96), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79–1.04) for light, moderate, and heavy drinkers, respectively. For CVD mortality, corresponding HRs were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67–0.96), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69–0.98), and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.70–1.08) for light, moderate, and heavy drinkers, respectively. Findings for IHD mortality were similar. HRs did not materially change when nondrinkers or very light drinkers were taken as the reference, or after exclusion of former drinkers or patients with diabetes or poor/moderate self-rated health.

Conclusions

Light and moderate alcohol intakes were inversely associated with mortality risk in stable post-MI patients. These observational findings should be cautiously interpreted in light of the total evidence on alcohol and health. The Alpha Omega Cohort is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03192410.

### Access to alcohol and heart disease among patients in hospital: observational cohort study using differences in alcohol sales laws [^1143F4P4]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The relation between heart failure and alcohol use has been one of the more complex associations to elucidate. On the one hand, alcohol is known to cause cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, some studies have suggested that alcohol may have a protective effect when consumed in moderation. Both atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure, with myocardial infarction likely being much the more important of the two. As with myocardial infarction, wet county residents had significantly less prevalent congestive heart failure. In addition, the propensity based analysis showed a decreased incidence of congestive heart failure in wet county residents. After referendums to liberalize alcohol sales in the intra-county analyses, incidence of congestive heart failure increased. Once again, although we cannot exclude residual confounding in the between county analyses as an explanation for these disparate results, it may be that the acute effects of alcohol (known to result in negative inotropy) trump the beneficial chronic effects (such as via reduction in myocardial infarction) during this switch in access to alcohol over only one to two years. In contrast, the alcohol laws were stable for decades preceding the study timeframe of the between county analyses, which may have resulted in lower rates of myocardial infarction (through chronic protective effects against coronary artery disease) and thus lower overall rates of congestive heart failure in chronically wet versus chronically dry counties.

The discordant results, showing more atrial fibrillation but less myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in wet compared with dry counties, are particularly remarkable given that these outcomes generally share all of the same risk factors and that each can lead to the other. Specifically, atrial fibrillation predicts myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, just as myocardial infarction predicts atrial fibrillationand congestive heart failure predicts atrial fibrillation. Therefore, given these potential "downstream" influences, these discordant results may suggest that the direct effects of alcohol are more potent than the point estimates reported.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^117CpThG]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Over 80% of CVD is attributable to environmental factors, notably unhealthy diet and also smoking, alcohol and physical inactivity. Diet has primacy, accounting for a larger burden of CVD disease and death than tobacco, alcohol and inactivity combined.

For those at low risk eating an apple a day has an equivalent risk reduction for myocardial infarction as taking a statin. In a recent large primary prevention RCT for those at high risk, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 30 g of nuts daily or at least 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by almost a third. There was an absolute risk reduction of 1.5% (NNT 61) for stroke in comparison to Mediterranean diet alone and no adverse dietary effects noted. It is likely that these benefits might have been even larger if compared to the average Western diet.

Crucially, these dietary benefits are independent of differences in LDL-C. It is the abundant alpha-linoleic acid, polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids provided in nuts, olive oil, oily fish, vegetables and fruit that rapidly exert positive health effects by attenuating inflammation, atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Concentrating on LDL-lowering alone as an end in itself might therefore be counterproductive. Indeed, insulin resistance may emerge as the single most important determinant of coronary artery disease. In young adults, preventing insulin resistance could prevent 42% of myocardial infarctions, a larger reduction than correcting hypertension (36%), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (31%), body mass index (BMI) (21%) or LDL-C (16%). It is plausible that the small benefits of statins in the prevention of CVD come from pleiotropic effects which are independent of LDL-lowering. The focus in primary prevention should therefore be on foods and food groups that have a proven benefit in reducing hard endpoints and mortality.

### Moderate excess alcohol consumption and adverse cardiac remodelling in dilated cardiomyopathy [^116ximu2]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

It is notable that despite adverse cardiac remodelling, moderate excess alcohol consumption was not associated with adverse outcomes. There are a number of possible reasons. One is that moderate excess alcohol consumption may exert a protective effect in terms of cardiovascular risk. It is also possible that the effect of alcohol consumption on outcomes is mediated by an unknown or unmeasured confounder. Insufficient statistical power may also account for these findings; however, we would expect to see evidence of a large effect on outcome (either beneficial or adverse) in this cohort size; therefore, this is unlikely to be the entire explanation. This study prompts further research to explore the reasons behind this novel finding.

A J-shaped or U-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and total mortality has been well documented. There has been conflicting evidence for the role of low to moderate excess alcohol consumption in cardiovascular disease more generallyand specifically with respect to heart failure phenotypes. A large study of ~6000 individuals followed up for ~10 years in the Australian National Blood pressure study found no association between alcohol consumption and risk of incident heart failure in either men or women. In contrast, in an Italian study of ~22 000 individuals followed for ~8 years, light to moderate alcohol consumption (1–4 drinks/day) was associated with a lower risk for heart failure, with a maximal 22% risk reduction for individuals consuming 20 g alcohol per day.

A lack of international standardisation of alcohol intake and consensus definitions of low, moderate and high consumption makes between study comparisons more challenging. The WHO guidelines on alcohol define one standard drink to be 10 g of pure ethanol and recommend no more than two standard drinks per day, but these definitions are not universally adopted among all countries. In addition, there is compelling evidence that there may not be a 'safe' threshold for alcohol consumption in terms of cardiovascular risk, and cardiovascular risks may increase with alcohol consumption at levels lower than considered in this study. In a pooled analysis of almost 600 000 individuals without cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption < 12.5 units/week was associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular death. However, for other cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure (as well as stroke, coronary artery disease excluding myocardial infarction and fatal hypertensive disease), there was no clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with lower disease risk.

### Alcohol consumption and the risk of mortality and myocardial infarction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111SPbtF]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Many studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower risks of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI). Our aim was to examine the potential effects of alcohol on all-cause mortality and MI in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a risk factor condition.

Methods

A cohort study (1995–2017) was conducted using medical records of RA patients from The Health Improvement Network in the United Kingdom (UK). Alcohol exposure was divided into non-drinkers, mild (1–7 UK units/week), moderate (8–14 UK units/week), moderate-high (15–21 UK units/week), and high (> 21 UK units/week) consumption levels. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for the relation of alcohol consumption to all-cause mortality and MI, adjusting for covariates.

Results

Of 30,320 RA patients, 5,994 deaths and 1,098 MI cases occurred over 236,188 person-years. Mild-to-moderate alcohol use was associated with lower all-cause mortality in RA patients, including those taking methotrexate. The multivariable HRs (95% CI) for mortality by alcohol use category were non-drinkers 1.0, mild 0.80 (0.75–0.85), moderate 0.74 (0.67–0.82), moderate-high 0.84 (0.72–0.98), and high 0.99 (0.86–1.15). Mild, moderate-high, and high levels of alcohol use were associated with lower risk of MI among RA patients. The HRs MI risk by alcohol use category were non-drinkers 1.0, mild 0.81 (0.70–0.94), moderate 0.84 (0.68–1.04), moderate-high 0.51 (0.35–0.74), and high 0.59 (0.42–0.84).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that mild-to-moderate alcohol use is associated with a lower mortality risk and overall alcohol use is associated with a lower MI risk in RA patients, similar to the general population.

### Prior alcohol consumption and mortality following acute… [^113jiqvv]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context Studies have found that individuals who consume 1 alcoholic drink every 1 to 2 days have a lower risk of a first acute myocardial infarction than abstainers or heavy drinkers, but the effect of prior drinking on mortality after AMI is uncertain. Objective To determine the effect of prior alcohol consumption on long-term mortality. alcohol consumption remained predictive of lower mortality for less than 7 drinks/wk, with an adjusted HR of 0. 79, and for 7 or more drinks/wk, with an adjusted HR of 0.
68. The association was similar for total and cardiovascular. mortality, among both men and women, and among different types of alcoholic beverages. Conclusion Self-reported moderate alcohol consumption in the year prior to AMI is associated with reduced mortality following infarction.

In the general population, individuals who have 1 alcoholic drink every 1 to 2 days have lower rates of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction. appears to favor prevention of CHD in asymptomatic persons, it may differ in those with established CHD. For example, alcohol lowers exercise tolerance in patients with angina, 5 causes dose-dependent coronary vasoconstriction, 6 raises heart rate and systolic blood pressure, 7, 8. studies done elsewhere. 23, 24 Several physiological effects of alcohol could possibly explain our findings. In experimental studies, alcohol consumption increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels25, 26 and decreases levels of prothrombotic factors, particularly fibrinogen. 27, 28 Alcohol also reduces platelet aggregability. and ablates cyclic flow reductions in mechanically stenosed canine coronary arteries.

29, 30 Other potentially beneficial effects of alcohol include inhibition of ischemic-induced arrhythmias31 and lowering of pulmonary artery pressure among patients with congestive heart failure. 32 Whether the observed association between alcohol consumption and post-AMI. similar for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and persisted even after controlling for potentially confounding factors in a rigorous propensity analysis. Thus, taken together, the overall epidemiological evidence suggests that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of AMI and a lower risk of long-term mortality following AMI.

### Alcohol consumption and CVD risk in men with hypertension… [^111PN38U]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Adults with hypertension are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption against CVD and death in the general population. However, because heavy alcohol use is a risk factor for developing hypertension, it is unclear if this protective effect applies to patients with hypertension as well. Beulens and colleagues examined the relationship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and stroke in men with hypertension. A questionnaire was administered in 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998 that asked participants to estimate how much and how often they consumed beer, wine, and liquor. These estimates were compared with two one-week dietary records of 136 selected participants and were found to correlate well with actual alcohol consumption. Primary outcomes were the incidences of nonfatal MI, cardiac death, and stroke.

A physician who was blinded to the patient's history of alcohol consumption confirmed all events with a medical record or autopsy report review. MI that could not be confirmed by medical record review was classified as "probable" and was excluded in sensitivity analyses. Statistical methods were used to control for cardiac risk factors such as age, smoking status, body mass index, diabetes, and cholesterol levels. The analysis also was adjusted for standard measurement errors that result from self-reported nutritional data. Results: During the follow-up period, 374 nonfatal and 279 fatal MIs occurred. An inverse relationship was found between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of MI. Consuming liquor was associated with a lower risk of MI than consuming beer or wine. There was no statistically significant association between alcohol consumption and the risk of ischemic stroke, cardiac death, or death from all causes.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that in men with hypertension, alcohol consumption decreases the risk of MI and does not affect cardiac or all-cause mortality. These results suggest that it is safe to continue drinking in moderation after a diagnosis of hypertension.

### Association of alcohol use after heart failure diagnosis with survival among older adults… [^113PFeH2]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the association of alcohol consumption after the diagnosis of heart failure with survival among older adults. Findings In this cohort study of 393 older adults with incident heart failure, consumption of 7 or fewer alcoholic drinks per week was significantly associated with increased survival compared with abstinence from alcohol, after controlling for other factors. After controlling for other factors, consumption of 7 or fewer alcoholic drinks per week was associated with additional mean survival of 383 days compared with abstinence from alcohol. Although the robustness was limited by the small number of individuals who consumed more than 7 drinks per week, a significant inverted U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and survival was observed. Consumption of 10 drinks per week was associated with the longest survival, a mean of 3381 days after heart failure diagnosis.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that limited alcohol consumption among older adults with incident heart failure is associated with survival benefit compared with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that older adults who develop heart failure may not need to abstain from moderate levels of alcohol consumption. After controlling for other factors, consumption of 7 or fewer drinks per week was associated with significantly longer survival following the diagnosis of HF compared with abstinence. Although robustness was limited by the small number of individuals who consumed more than 7 drinks per week, a significant inverted U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and survival was observed. Consumption of 10 drinks per week was associated with the longest survival, a mean of 3381 days after heart failure diagnosis.

Our findings of increased survival among community-dwelling older adults with HF and moderate alcohol consumption are consistent with observations reported in other studies in the population of patients without HF. 21–23 Moderate alcohol consumption appears to be protective against coronary atherosclerotic events, perhaps because of increases in high-density lipoprotein concentration, reductions in plasminogen activator, increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor activities, and improvement in insulin sensitivity. 24, 25 Moreover, polyphenols found in beer and wine increase nitric oxide concentration, which may have benefits in adults with HF. 25.
