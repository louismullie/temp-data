## Question

Management of restless leg syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of restless legs syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify iron status and other secondary causes. Next, I will consider nonpharmacologic measures and when they suffice. After that, I need to choose pharmacotherapy based on severity, comorbidities, and augmentation risk, aligning with the most current guidelines. Finally, I will plan monitoring, address special populations, and outline escalation strategies for refractory cases, making sure each step is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis using the four essential clinical criteria: an urge to move the legs with uncomfortable sensations, symptoms beginning or worsening during rest, relief with movement, and a circadian pattern with evening or nighttime predominance. I should double-check that no objective test confirms RLS, so diagnosis is purely clinical and relies on careful history, which means I must exclude mimics like nocturnal leg cramps, peripheral neuropathy, and akathisia before labeling RLS [^52ef03f6] [^8f55636d].

> Wait, let me verify iron status next because iron deficiency is a key modifiable driver. I should obtain ferritin and transferrin saturation, ideally in the morning and off iron for 24 hours to avoid assay interference, and treat if ferritin is 75 ng/mL or less or transferrin saturation is less than 20 percent. In children, the threshold is ferritin less than 50 ng/mL, and I need to remember that ferritin is an acute phase reactant, so I should interpret levels in clinical context and consider CRP when appropriate [^bf660d0c] [^8cc5946d] [^9016698b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications before addressing exacerbating factors. I should review and remove alcohol, caffeine, antihistamines, serotonergic and antidopaminergic drugs, and screen for untreated obstructive sleep apnea, since these can worsen RLS and correcting them may obviate pharmacotherapy. I need to ensure I also consider pregnancy-specific safety if applicable [^61dad8c4] [^8f5e9351].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic options for mild or intermittent symptoms. Exercise, leg massage, warm baths, and sleep hygiene can help, and I should confirm that evidence for some modalities is limited but supportive. For example, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, compression devices, counterstrain manipulation, infrared therapy, and acupuncture have shown signal for reducing RLS severity and improving some sleep outcomes, though heterogeneity and small trials temper certainty, so I should frame these as adjuncts rather than substitutes for evidence-based pharmacotherapy when symptoms are moderate to severe [^b01e7917] [^8f55636d].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy for moderate to severe or bothersome RLS. Given contemporary guidance prioritizing augmentation avoidance, gabapentinoids are preferred: gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, or pregabalin are strongly recommended and have moderate certainty evidence for improving RLS severity and sleep outcomes. I should confirm dosing ranges and titrate to effect while watching for sedation and dizziness, and I should remember that gabapentin enacarbil is the only FDA-approved agent among strongly recommended options in the latest AASM guideline, which underscores the shift away from dopamine agonists as routine first-line therapy [^4e645bad] [^8f5e9351] [^53ef53f2].

> But wait, what if dopaminergic therapy is still considered? I need to ensure I counsel on augmentation risk, which is dose- and time-dependent and can manifest as earlier daily onset, intensification, and spread to arms. The AASM suggests against routine use of pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, and levodopa, reserving them for patients who prioritize short-term symptom control and accept long-term augmentation risk; if used, I should keep doses as low as possible and monitor closely for augmentation, impulse control disorders, and sleep attacks [^d5fc4955] [^b6e53957] [^ca313017].

> Let me consider iron repletion as disease-modifying therapy when iron deficiency is present. Oral ferrous sulfate with vitamin C is reasonable for ferritin 75 ng/mL or less, and intravenous iron such as ferric carboxymaltose is strongly recommended when ferritin is 75–100 ng/mL or when oral iron is not tolerated or ineffective. I should double-check that IV iron shows moderate-certainty benefit for severity, sleep, and quality of life, with manageable adverse effects, and I must monitor for hypophosphatemia after ferric carboxymaltose [^8cc5946d] [^8c0baf46] [^dc09f031].

> For refractory or augmentation-prone cases, I should review second-line options. Extended-release oxycodone and other opioids are conditionally recommended with moderate certainty and can be particularly useful when withdrawing dopamine agonists or when symptoms are severe and refractory. I need to ensure careful selection, informed consent, and monitoring for misuse, constipation, and respiratory depression, and I should remember that dipyridamole has a conditional recommendation with low certainty and may be considered in selected adults [^128ed7da] [^7f6f3806] [^07f50514].

> I should confirm special population nuances. In end-stage renal disease, gabapentin and IV iron sucrose are conditionally suggested, and dopamine agonists should generally be avoided. In pregnancy, I need to prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and iron correction, reserving gabapentin or opioids for severe cases after discussing risks. In pediatrics, oral iron is the mainstay when ferritin is low, and evidence for other medications is limited, so I must monitor growth, sleep, and school performance closely [^a523fb4f] [^8f5e9351] [^7c9deaf3].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I need to check iron studies periodically, reassess symptom severity with IRLS or similar scales, and actively screen for augmentation at each visit, especially with dopaminergic therapy. I should also monitor for impulse control disorders and daytime sleepiness, and adjust therapy based on efficacy, tolerability, and patient preferences, documenting shared decision-making when using agents with augmentation risk [^b9bb23b8] [^b6e53957].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation strategies for inadequate response. If symptoms persist despite optimized gabapentinoid therapy, I can add or switch to a different class, consider IV iron if iron deficiency persists, or cautiously introduce low-dose dopamine agonists with explicit augmentation counseling. In severe, refractory cases, combination therapy and opioids may be justified, and I should remember that rotating drug classes can mitigate tolerance and augmentation, though evidence is largely observational and expert-opinion based [^8f55636d] [^afb6ed4c].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm diagnosis clinically and exclude mimics, correct iron deficiency and remove exacerbating factors, use nonpharmacologic measures for mild disease, and start gabapentinoids as first-line for moderate to severe RLS, reserving dopamine agonists for select scenarios with informed consent, while integrating iron therapy when indicated and escalating thoughtfully for refractory symptoms. This approach aligns with the 2025 AASM guideline and contemporary reviews emphasizing augmentation avoidance and patient-centered outcomes [^8f5e9351] [^bbccb8d4] [^8f55636d].

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) management centers on **confirming the diagnosis** with clinical criteria and excluding mimics [^52ef03f6], then **correcting iron deficiency** (ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%) with oral or IV iron as indicated [^8cc5946d] [^dc09f031]. For mild symptoms, start with sleep hygiene, exercise, and avoidance of triggers (caffeine, alcohol, antihistamines, SSRIs) [^61dad8c4]; for moderate-to-severe RLS, **gabapentinoids are first-line** (gabapentin, pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil) [^4e645bad] because they are effective and have low augmentation risk [^f0f26fa3]. Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) are now reserved for select cases due to augmentation risk; if used, keep doses low and monitor closely [^d5fc4955] [^b6e53957]. Opioids (e.g. extended-release oxycodone) are second-line for refractory cases [^128ed7da], and IV ferric carboxymaltose is recommended when iron deficiency persists or oral iron is not tolerated [^8c0baf46]. Regularly reassess for augmentation, impulse control disorders, and sleep quality, and tailor therapy to comorbidities and patient preference [^b9bb23b8].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and initial evaluation

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on four essential criteria — urge to move legs with uncomfortable sensations, symptoms worsen at rest, relief with movement, and evening/night predominance [^52ef03f6] [^8f55636d].

- **Exclude mimics**: Nocturnal leg cramps, peripheral neuropathy, akathisia, and periodic limb movement disorder [^notfound].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin and transferrin saturation to detect deficiency, which is common and treatable [^bf660d0c] [^8cc5946d].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacologic measures are **first-line for mild or intermittent symptoms** and as adjuncts in more severe cases:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Sleep hygiene | High | Strongly recommended |
| Regular exercise | Moderate | Strongly recommended |
| Avoid caffeine, alcohol, antihistamines, SSRIs | High | Strongly recommended |
| Iron supplementation (if deficient) | High | Strongly recommended |
| Acupuncture, yoga, compression devices | Low | Considered adjunctive |

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line pharmacotherapy

Gabapentinoids are **preferred first-line** for moderate-to-severe RLS due to efficacy and low augmentation risk [^4e645bad] [^f0f26fa3]:

- **Gabapentin**: Strong recommendation, moderate certainty [^4e645bad].

- **Pregabalin**: Strong recommendation, moderate certainty [^4e645bad].

- **Gabapentin enacarbil**: Strong recommendation, moderate certainty [^4e645bad].

---

### Second-line pharmacotherapy

Dopamine agonists are now **reserved for select cases** because of augmentation risk; if used, employ the lowest effective dose and monitor closely [^d5fc4955] [^b6e53957]:

- **Pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine**: Conditional recommendations against routine use; consider only if benefits outweigh augmentation risk [^d5fc4955].

- **Levodopa**: Conditional recommendation against standard use; consider short-term only [^85c7f938].

---

### Refractory RLS

For refractory cases, consider **opioids** (e.g. extended-release oxycodone) with caution and close monitoring [^128ed7da] [^7f6f3806], and **IV iron** (ferric carboxymaltose) when iron deficiency persists or oral iron is not tolerated [^8c0baf46] [^8cc5946d].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer non-pharmacologic measures; if needed, consider gabapentin or opioids after risk–benefit discussion [^8f5e9351].

- **End-stage renal disease**: Gabapentin and IV iron are options; avoid dopamine agonists [^a523fb4f].

- **Pediatrics**: Oral iron if ferritin < 50 ng/mL; evidence for other medications is limited [^34367aa6] [^7c9deaf3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly reassess for **augmentation**, impulse control disorders, and sleep quality, and adjust therapy based on comorbidities and patient preference [^b9bb23b8] [^dc37df43].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Clinical criteria and exclude mimics [^52ef03f6].

- **Correct iron deficiency**: Oral or IV iron as indicated [^8cc5946d].

- **Non-pharmacologic measures**: Sleep hygiene, exercise, avoid triggers [^61dad8c4].

- **First-line pharmacotherapy**: Gabapentinoids for moderate-to-severe RLS [^4e645bad].

- **Second-line pharmacotherapy**: Dopamine agonists only if benefits outweigh augmentation risk [^d5fc4955].

- **Refractory cases**: Opioids or IV iron as indicated [^128ed7da] [^8c0baf46].

- **Regular monitoring**: For augmentation, side effects, and sleep quality [^b9bb23b8].

---

Effective RLS management requires a **stepwise approach**: confirm the diagnosis, correct iron deficiency, use nonpharmacologic measures, and escalate to gabapentinoids for moderate-to-severe symptoms, reserving dopamine agonists for select cases and using opioids or IV iron for refractory disease, with ongoing monitoring for complications.

### Current guidelines and standards of practice for restless legs syndrome [^d602f52d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Algorithms for treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Patients with RLS are divided into 3 groups: (1) those with intermittent RLS symptoms; (2) those with daily RLS symptoms; and (3) those whose symptoms are refractory to standard treatments. Many patients do not require medication, and symptoms often can be relieved with good sleep hygiene and avoidance of medications and factors that provoke symptoms. Recent large-scale clinical trials have proved the efficacy of therapy for RLS when it is required. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly. The first step in managing RLS is to ensure that there is an adequate diagnosis; this involves discriminating RLS from other conditions that may share a number of features. Finally, it is important to tailor treatment to the needs of each individual patient.

### Restless legs syndrome: pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management [^9869a6e2]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a somatosensory network disorder that is clinically diagnosed according to four main criteria: an urge to move the legs, usually associated with unpleasant leg sensations; induction or exacerbation of symptoms by rest; symptom relief on activity; and diurnal fluctuations in symptoms with worsening in the evening and at night. Genetic variants in four chromosomal regions have been identified that increase the risk of RLS. In addition, various different lesions, ranging from peripheral neuropathies to spinal cord lesions or alterations of brain metabolism, are implicated in RLS. In most cases, sleep disorders with frequent sleep fragmentation and characteristic periodic limb movements during sleep can be identified during a polysomnographic recording. The first-line drugs for RLS are dopaminergic agents, which are effective in low to moderate doses. Alternative or additional treatments include opioids and anticonvulsants. Augmentation-paradoxical worsening of symptoms by dopaminergic treatment-is the main problem encountered in difficult-to-treat patients. Iron deficiency must be identified and treated by supplementation, both to improve RLS symptoms and to potentially lower the risk of augmentation. Here, we review the latest studies pertaining to the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of RLS.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in adults and pediatric patients.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RLS.

1. In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron binding capacity). Testing should ideally be administered in the morning avoiding all iron-containing supplements and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw. Analysis of iron studies greatly influences the decision to use oral or intravenous (IV) iron treatment. Consensus guidelines, which have not been empirically tested, suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or IV iron if serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL. In children, supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations. These iron supplementation guidelines are different than for the general population.

2. The first step in the management of RLS should be addressing exacerbating factors, such as alcohol, caffeine, antihistaminergic, serotonergic, antidopaminergic medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea.

3. RLS is common in pregnancy; prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for RLS and PLMD in adults and children. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. The recommendations listed below are ranked in the order of strength of recommendations and grouped by class of treatments within each PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) question. Some recommendations include remarks that provide additional context to guide clinicians with implementation of this recommendation.

### Quality measures for the care of adult patients with restless legs syndrome [^b9bb23b8]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned several Workgroups to develop quality measures for the care of patients with common sleep disorders, including adults with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Using the AASM process for quality measure development, the RLS Work-group developed three target outcomes for RLS management, including improving the accuracy of diagnosis, reducing symptom severity, and minimizing treatment complications. Seven processes were developed to support these outcomes. To achieve the outcome of improving accuracy of diagnosis, the use of accepted diagnostic criteria and assessment of iron stores are recommended. To realize the outcome of decreasing symptom severity, routine assessment of severity and provision of evidence-based treatment are recommended. To support the outcome of minimizing treatment complications, counseling about potential side effects and assessing for augmentation and impulse control disorders, when indicated, are recommended. Further research is needed to validate optimal practice processes to achieve best outcomes in adult patients with RLS.

### Latest guidelines and advances for treatment of restless legs syndrome [^1c5be48c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that can have a considerable impact on a patient's functioning and quality of life. The pharmacologic armamentarium for RLS contains dopamine agonists, a-2d ligands, and opioids, among other agents. Each of these types of drugs has strengths and limitations, and treatment selection should be based on the frequency of RLS symptoms and any accompanying pain. Dopaminergic augmentation, which exacerbates RLS symptoms, is the most common and challenging side effect of long-term RLS treatment with dopamine agonists and requires special clinical consideration. Iron status is also important to the effective management of RLS.

### European guidelines on management of restless legs syndrome: report of a joint task force by the European Federation of Neurological Societies, the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society [^8b1bc133]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Since the publication of the first European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines in 2005 on the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS; also known as Willis-Ekbom disease), there have been major therapeutic advances in the field. Furthermore, the management of RLS is now a part of routine neurological practice in Europe. New drugs have also become available, and further randomized controlled trials have been undertaken. These guidelines were undertaken by the EFNS in collaboration with the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society.

Objectives

To provide an evidence-based update of new treatments published since 2005 for the management of RLS.

Methods

First, we determined what the objectives of management of primary and secondary RLS should be. We developed the search strategy and conducted a review of the scientific literature up to 31 December 2011 (print and electronic publications) for the drug classes and interventions employed in RLS treatment. Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations made according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating.

Recommendations

Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. However, for the long-term treatment for RLS, rotigotine is considered effective, gabapentin enacarbil is probably effective, and ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin are considered possibly effective. Cabergoline has according to our criteria a level A recommendation, but the taskforce cannot recommend this drug because of its serious adverse events.

### Managing patients with restless legs [^5171a8f3]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Estimates suggest that around 10–15% of adults have restless legs, or Ekbom syndrome. This condition is characterised by a range of uncomfortable and sometimes distressing motor and sensory symptoms during quiet wakefulness and/or sleep, such as feelings of burning, tickling or crawling, pain, cramping, numbness or weakness in the lower limbs, and, sometimes, also in the trunk and arms. The problem can seriously affect quality of life, yet is frequently dismissed as trivial. Often, it is unrecognised, incorrectly regarded as a neurosis, or managed poorly or not at all. Here we review how people with restless legs can best be helped.

### Restless legs syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis and a practical approach to management [^8c5b5603]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic neurological disorder that interferes with rest and sleep. It has a wide spectrum of symptom severity, and treatment is started when symptoms become bothersome. Dopamine agonists and calcium channel apha-2-delta antagonists (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil and pregabalin) are first-line treatments; calcium channel alpha-2-deltas are preferred over dopamine agonists because they give less augmentation, a condition with symptom onset earlier in the day and intensification of RLS symptoms. Dopamine agonists can still be used as first-line therapy, but the dose should be kept as low as possible. Iron supplements are started when the serum ferritin concentration is ≤ 75µg/L, or if the transferrin saturation is less than 20%. For severe or resistant RLS, a combined treatment approach can be effective. Augmentation can be very challenging to treat and lacks evidenced-based guidelines.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for restless legs syndrome: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^b01e7917]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs. Management is primarily pharmacological. Effects for non-pharmacological, non-surgical options are published but lack systematic examination. Objectives: To synthesise results of non-pharmacological/non-surgical treatment compared to no-treatment controls or alternative treatment for RLS on any relevant outcome. Methods: Databases and reference lists of reviews were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-pharmacological treatment to alternative or no treatment controls for idiopathic RLS. Search results were independently screened for inclusion by two researchers; disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved with discussion. Outcomes were summarised, and pooled where possible in meta-analysis. Results: The search yielded 442 articles. Eleven trials met inclusion criteria. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, exercise, compression devices, counterstrain manipulation, infrared therapy, and standard acupuncture were significantly more effective for RLS severity than control conditions. Vibration pads, cryotherapy, and transcranial direct current stimulation were ineffective in reducing RLS severity. Vibration pads, cryotherapy, yoga, compression devices, and acupuncture significantly improved some sleep-related outcomes. Conclusions: Few studies were identified and quality of evidence was not high. Some non-pharmacological interventions may be beneficial for reducing RLS severity and enhancing sleep. Implications for Rehabilitation The current management of restless leg syndrome is primarily pharmacological, and medications can have unwanted side effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, exercise, compression devices, counterstrain manipulation, infrared therapy, and standard acupuncture may reduce restless leg syndrome severity. Vibration pads, cryotherapy, yoga, compression devices, and acupuncture may improve some sleep-related outcomes in restless leg syndrome. Non-pharmacological interventions for RLS may cause placebo effects and rehabilitation professionals should control for this possibility in future investigations.

### Getting the facts on restless legs… [^768adbfb]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

My experience with the Restless Legs Syndrome Working Group, which produced the document published in this issue of. Although many treatments were discussed, they were omitted from the report if the group agreed that the supportive evidence was weak. Because of the lack of scientific support for lifestyle modification and nonpharmacologic therapies, no suggestions relating to these measures were included in this document. 2 Only established facts found their way into the final draft, whereas any information without solid foundation was eliminated. Given the limitations of our medical knowledge and our fallibility in the real practice of medicine, a consensus among practitioners can be a powerful resource. It suggests that we do not know everything, but given what we know we can agree on a standard of care. In addition to the valuable summary that the Working Group document provides, this review enhances our awareness of a condition that we may have tended to underdiagnose.

3 In terms of differential diagnosis, however, few conditions resemble it. Nocturnal leg cramps, with their sudden, severe muscle contraction and relatively rapid resolution, are nothing like the almost mental, irritating discomfort of RLS. Remembering its place among sleep disturbances may be all that is required to identify it in susceptible patients. Another reason that RLS may elude our attention is that none of the medications used in its treatment are primarily indicated for RLS. RLS is essentially a stepchild of other neurologic disorders such as Parkinsonism and anxiety, conditions to which it is unrelated but whose pharmacologic treatments it has inherited. In addition, many common conditions, including pregnancy and iron deficiency anemia, may be associated with RLS. In our routine management of these familiar scenarios, we could easily fail to consider the possibility of RLS.

All of this leads to a final point, which is that RLS can be treated effectively by primary care physicians. First, as previously mentioned, it is diagnosed almost exclusively by history. Second, the differential diagnosis is, for the most part, limited to a few common, easily recognized conditions. Third, the treatment options include medications that family physicians often prescribe for other illnesses, except that lower dosages are used in RLS. Thus, the Working Group has provided an important service to patients suffering from this potentially debilitating condition. It also provides a service to family physicians by adding to the repertoire of ailments we can treat successfully on our own, without sub-specialty consultation or unnecessary diagnostic testing.

### Long-term management issues in restless legs syndrome [^ca313017]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a neurologic movement and sleep disorder with lifelong symptoms causing considerable morbidity. Several short-term and some long-term open-label and double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dopaminergic treatment in restless legs syndrome. Long-term treatment, however, is associated with the emergence of vexing long-term side effects that pose a challenge for physicians. These long-term complications can be broadly categorized as disease-related (impact on sleep and acute exacerbation of restless legs syndrome symptoms), and medication issues (augmentation, sleep attacks, impulse control disorders, addiction and dependence, site reaction, occasionally sleep apnea, fibrotic complications, and weight gain).

### Restless legs syndrome [^2c43eed2]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic movement disorder that affects approximately 10 percent of adults. Of those affected with this condition, approximately one third have symptoms severe enough to require medical therapy. Restless legs syndrome may be a primary condition, or it may be secondary to iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. The diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome causes sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs syndrome may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Currently, there is little information regarding the effects of lifestyle changes on the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. If medications are needed, dopamine agonists are the primary medications for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome. Other medications that may be effective include gabapentin, carbidopa/levodopa, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

### A survey-based approach on restless legs syndrome: practices and perspectives among Italian neurologists [^1fc183c2]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a widely prevalent and complex neurological disorder. Despite notable advancements in managing RLS, the disorder continues to face challenges related to its recognition and management.

Objective

This study seeks to gain comprehensive insights into the knowledge and clinical practices among Italian neurologists regarding RLS diagnosis, management, and treatment, comparing approaches among general neurologists, movement disorder specialists, and sleep experts.

Methods

Members of the Italian Society of Neurology, the Italian Society of Parkinson and Movement Disorders, and the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine were invited to participate in a 19-question online survey.

Results

Among the 343 surveyed neurologists, 60% categorized RLS as a "sleep-related movement disorder". Forty% indicated managing 5–15 RLS patients annually, with sleep specialists handling the highest patient volume. Of note, only 34% adhered strictly to all five essential diagnostic criteria. The majority (69%) favored low-dosage dopamine agonists as their first-line treatment, with movement disorder specialists predominantly endorsing this approach, while sleep experts preferred iron supplementation. Regular screening for iron levels was widespread (91%), with supplementation typically guided by serum iron alterations. In cases of ineffective initial treatments, escalating dopamine agonist dosage was the preferred strategy (40%).

Conclusions

These findings underscore a lack of a clear conceptualization of RLS, with a widespread misconception of the disorder as solely a movement disorder significantly influencing treatment approaches. Disparities in RLS understanding across neurology subspecialties underscore the necessity for improved diagnostic accuracy, targeted educational initiatives, and management guidelines to ensure consistent and effective RLS management.

Introduction

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for the accompanying clinical practice guideline on the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment to no treatment to improve patient-important outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical significance of using various interventions to treat restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults and children. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations.

Results

The literature search resulted in 3,631 studies out of which 148 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### Restless legs syndrome-current therapies and management of augmentation [^4d0da9da]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) can severely affect quality of life and disturb sleep, so that pharmacological treatment is necessary, especially for elderly patients. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole or the rotigotine transdermal patch, all approved in most countries) or α-2-δ ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, approved in the USA and Japan), depending on the country and availability. Where approved, opioids (prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone, approved in Europe) are also recommended as a second-line therapy for severe RLS. Several iron formulations can be effective but are not yet approved for RLS therapy, whereas benzodiazepines and other anticonvulsants are not recommended or approved. Less is known about effective management of RLS that is associated with other conditions, such as uraemia or pregnancy. Furthermore, very little data are available on the management of RLS when first-line treatment fails or patients experience augmentation. In this Review, we summarize state-of-the-art therapies for RLS in the context of the diagnostic criteria and available guidelines, based on knowledge ranging from Class I evidence for the treatment of idiopathic RLS to Class IV evidence for the treatment of complications such as augmentation. We consider therapies, including combination therapies, that are used in clinical practice for long-term management of RLS, despite a lack of trials and approval, and highlight the need for practical long-term evaluation of current trials.

### Restless legs syndrome: contemporary diagnosis and treatment [^8cfbb013]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs while at rest, relief upon movement or getting up to walk, and worsened symptom severity at night. RLS may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to pregnancy or a variety of systemic disorders, especially iron deficiency, and chronic renal insufficiency. Genetic predisposition with a family history is common. The pathogenesis of RLS remains unclear but is likely to involve central nervous system dopaminergic dysfunction, as well as other, undefined contributing mechanisms. Evaluation begins with a thorough history and examination, and iron measures, including ferritin and transferrin saturation, should be checked at presentation and with worsened symptoms, especially when augmentation develops. Augmentation is characterized by more intense symptom severity, earlier symptom occurrence, and often, symptom spread from the legs to the arms or other body regions. Some people with RLS have adequate symptom control with non-pharmacological measures such as massage or temperate baths. First-line management options include iron-replacement therapy in those with evidence for reduced body-iron stores or, alternatively, with prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin, and dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine. Second-line therapies include intravenous iron infusion in those who are intolerant of oral iron and/or those having augmentation with intense, severe RLS symptoms, and opioids including tramadol, oxycodone, and methadone. RLS significantly impacts patients' quality of life and remains a therapeutic area sorely in need of innovation and a further pipeline of new, biologically informed therapies.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^bf660d0c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) good practice statement — iron testing and management: In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron binding capacity), with testing ideally administered in the morning avoiding all iron-containing supplementation and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw. Consensus guidelines suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or intravenous (IV) iron if serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL; in children, supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations. The first step in the management of RLS should be addressing exacerbating factors, and RLS is common in pregnancy; prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

### Comorbidities, treatment, and pathophysiology in restless legs syndrome [^9374ef77]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common neurological condition whose manifestation is affected by complex environmental and genetic interactions. Restless legs syndrome can occur on its own, mostly at a young age, or with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arterial hypertension, making it a difficult condition to properly diagnose. However, the concept of restless legs syndrome as being two entities, primary or secondary to another condition, has been challenged with genetic data providing further insight into the pathophysiology of the condition. Although dopaminergic treatment was formerly the first-line therapy, prolonged use can result in a serious worsening of symptoms known as augmentation. Clinical studies on pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxycodone-naloxone, and iron preparations have provided new treatment options, but most patients still report inadequate long-term management of symptoms. Studies of the hypoxic pathway activation and iron deficiency have provided valuable information about the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome that should now be translated into new, more effective treatments for restless legs syndrome.

### Therapeutic advances in restless legs syndrome (RLS) [^3e265fd9]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Levodopa and dopamine agonists have been the main treatment for restless legs syndrome during the past decades. Although their efficacy has been well documented over the short term, long-term dopaminergic treatment is often complicated by augmentation, loss of efficacy, and other side effects. Recent large randomized controlled trials provide new evidence for the efficacy of high-potency opioids and α2δ ligands, and several post hoc analyses, meta-analyses, algorithms, and guidelines have been published, often with a specific focus, for example, on augmentation, or on management of restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. Several new contributions to understanding the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome have been published, but at this time, whether they will have an impact on treatment possibilities in the future cannot be estimated.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and quality of life issues in restless legs syndrome [^c9effff5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a generally underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. It is a common cause of sleep disturbance that can severely disrupt normal life functioning. However, because of the failure to recognize RLS as a distinct disorder, clinicians have minimized the significance of the morbidity experienced by some patients. A positive family history is present in > 50% of patients with RLS. Indeed, a person with RLS is 3 to 6 times more likely to have a positive family history of RLS than is an individual who does not have the disease. The differential diagnosis of RLS includes both movement and sleep disorders. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is crucial because effective treatment is available. In 2002, RLS experts revised diagnostic criteria and established 4 essential criteria for the diagnosis. Assessing the most bothersome symptoms and quantifying the severity of RLS are important because not all patients require medical therapy. Moreover, therapy may vary according to which symptom represents the major problem.

### Strategies for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^49496a50]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder of unknown etiology that is managed by therapy directed at relieving its symptoms. Treatment of patients with milder symptoms that occur intermittently may be treated with nonpharmacological therapy but when not successful, drug therapy should be chosen based on the timing of the symptoms and the needs of the patient. Patients with moderate to severe RLS typically require daily medication to control their symptoms. Although the dopamine agonists, ropinirole and pramipexole have been the drugs of choice for patients with moderate to severe RLS, drug emergent problems like augmentation may limit their use for long term therapy. Keeping the dopamine agonist dose as low as possible, using longer acting dopamine agonists such as the rotigotine patch and maintaining a high serum ferritin level may help prevent the development of augmentation. The α2δ anticonvulsants may now also be considered as drugs of choice for moderate to severe RLS patients. Opioids should be considered for RLS patients, especially for those who have failed other therapies since they are very effective for severe cases. When monitored appropriately, they can be very safe and durable for long term therapy. They should also be strongly considered for treating patients with augmentation as they are very effective for relieving the worsening symptoms that occur when decreasing or eliminating dopamine agonists.

### Restless legs syndrome [^373b3290]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the review period since February 2004 a number of papers have been published that make significant contributions to the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical assessment, pathophysiology and treatment of restless legs syndrome. Those with the most significant findings were selected and will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

Several epidemiological studies about restless legs syndrome have become available in the review period. A new susceptibility locus for restless legs syndrome has been reported. Neuropathological studies have provided profound insights into the key role of iron regulation in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome. Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that dopamine agonists are efficacious in the treatment of restless legs syndrome. A few pilot treatment studies with intravenous iron have been performed.

Summary

In this paper, recent advances in the field of restless legs syndrome are reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on pathophysiology and treatment. Restless legs syndrome is still an underdiagnosed disorder. The evidence basis for its treatment has been considerably increased in the review period.

### Restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease: epidemiology, pathogenetic overlaps, and clinical management [^3bcfe1e0]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this article, an attempt is made to summarize the current research progress of the incidence, clinical manifestations, mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment on Parkinson's disease (PD) with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). However, given the complexity of factors and predictors that contribute to the progression of RLS in PD, each of these areas requires further investigation.

The existing research in this field is still in its infancy and ongoing. This review notes that RLS in PD may be associated with iron deficiency, dysfunction of the dopamine system, and reduced connectivity of related neural pathways. Despite this, more in — depth research is required to explore whether the progression of RLS in PD is also linked to immune inflammation, gut microbiota, and other factors. Additionally, there is significant variation in prevalence studies. To accurately assess the prevalence of RLS in PD, there is a need for standardized research methods in the future. Furthermore, current treatments can only alleviate symptoms and fall short in preventing or reversing the disease's progression. Therefore, future research should focus on the pathogenesis of RLS in PD to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of more effective treatments. Until now, research on RLS in PD spans multiple disciplines, including neurology, neuroimaging, and genetics. In the future, interdisciplinary cooperation should be strengthened. By integrating resources and technical advantages, we can promote the in — depth development of RLS research in PD.

### Diagnosis and management of restless legs syndrome in children [^0dabddde]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Recent published evidence suggests that restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are common condition in children and adolescents. It is likely that if left untreated, RLS and PLMD may lead to adverse cardiovascular and neurocognitive consequences. However, the diagnosis of RLS and PLMD in children is challenging, particularly because children are relatively unable to describe typical RLS symptoms. The International Restless Legs Study Group has recently published consensus criteria for the diagnosis of RLS and PLMD in children. In addition to clinical description of RLS symptoms, supportive evidence including the presence of clinical sleep disturbances, documented periodic limb movements in sleep from overnight sleep study and family history of restless legs syndrome may be required. Few if any controlled studies have addressed the management of RLS and PLMD, which may involve both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. In this context, the importance of avoidance of aggravating factors and good sleep hygiene cannot be overemphasized. Children with evidence of low-iron storage, i.e., low-serum ferritin and/or iron levels may likely benefit from iron therapy. While there is overall limited experience regarding the use of dopaminergic agents in children with RLS and PLMD, published reports suggesting efficacy of compounds such as levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole and pergolide have emerged. Other medications including benzodiazepine, anti-convulsants, alpha-adrenergic and opioid medications have not been adequately studied in children. Children with RLS and PLMD should have regular follow-up visits to evaluate clinical improvement and to monitor adverse effects from the selected therapy. Based on aforementioned findings, it is clear that a substantial research effort is needed to evaluate the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment modalities, and overall long-term outcome of children with RLS and PLMD.

### Recent advances in the diagnosis, genetics and treatment of restless legs syndrome [^4d62e3db]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Knowledge of restless legs syndrome (RLS) has greatly increased in recent years due to the many advances that have been made in diagnosis, management and genetics. Tools have been developed that facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of RLS, in particular the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS have been refined, severity scales (IRLS, RLS-6, JHSS) have been developed, as have instruments that improve diagnostic accuracy and assess for specific aspects of RLS such as augmentation. These newly developed tools have been used in recent population-based studies, which have provided a greater understanding of the epidemiology of RLS, and also within patient-based trials. As far as the genetics of RLS is concerned, linkage studies in RLS families have revealed eight loci but no causally related sequence variant has yet been identified using this approach. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified variants within intronic or intergenic regions of MEIS1, BTBD9, and MAP2K5/LBXCOR1, and PTPRD, raising new pathological hypotheses for RLS. An overview on therapeutic options and recent trials is given based on evidence-based management strategies for this common disorder.

### New paradigms in the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^f04edac1]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder occurring in 3% to 15% of the general population, which contributes to poor quality of life. Many patients go undiagnosed for years after onset of symptoms, which delays or prevents effective treatment. Extensive research over the past decade has led to a better understanding of RLS and effective treatment options. This review encompasses the most recently published pathophysiology, epidemiology, criteria for diagnosis, and clinical drug efficacy trials to provide clinicians with the information to effectively manage RLS. A comprehensive review of the medical literature was conducted and original research articles pertaining to RLS were evaluated. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormal brain iron metabolism. Secondary RLS is most often a consequence of iron deficiency. The prevalence of primary RLS is twofold greater in women and increases with age in men and women, although onset of symptoms may occur in up to 45% of patients before age 20 years. Patients may present with a variety of complaints including sleep disruption. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose levodopa and dopamine agonists. Ropinirole is the most widely studied. Other drugs that may help control symptoms include gabapentin, opioids, and clonazepam. Clinicians must be aware of the high prevalence of RLS, the potential for onset before age 20, and the various clinical presentations. Dopamine agonists are first-line therapy and provide symptom relief in 70% to 100% of patients.

### Update in restless legs syndrome [^41735246]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder recognized in the medical literature since the 17th century, there have only recently been significant clinical and scientific advances in diagnosis, epidemiology and understanding the disorder, mainly due to the advent of dopaminergic treatment.

Recent Findings

Recent discoveries have uncovered the iron-dopamine connection in RLS and the basic dopaminergic pathology related to the RLS symptoms. These have led to new understanding of the morbidity of RLS and the many conditions associated with RLS, which have also supported new approaches to treatment. These developments are each briefly described here.

Summary

Although there has been progress in understanding, diagnosing and treating RLS, it remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition severely impairing functioning of patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Much work is needed to improve on current, as well as other novel therapies.

### Restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements in patients with movement disorders: specific considerations [^6d2b09f2]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with potentially serious and highly distressing treatment complications. The role and potential implications of periodic leg movements during sleep range from being a genetic risk marker for restless legs syndrome to being a cardiovascular risk factor. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome in patients with daytime movement disorders is challenging and restless legs syndrome needs to be differentiated from other sleep-related movement disorders. This article provides an update on the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome as an independent disorder and the role of periodic leg movements and reviews the association of restless legs syndrome with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Current trends in the management of uremic restless legs syndrome: a systematic review on aspects related to quality of life, cardiovascular mortality and survival [^cb6bcb1a]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects almost one out of three end-stage renal disease patients. This review assesses the current treatment options for uremic RLS and the potential benefits of those treatments on quality of life parameters, cardiovascular mortality and survival. A systematic review was conducted searching PubMed and Scopus by using the Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria in which the international RLS study group criteria were used as the primary diagnostic tool. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches were found to reduce the severity of uremic RLS symptoms. Only four studies reported changes on aspects related to quality of life while those changes were also associated with health benefits that resulted in reduced cardiovascular risk. The severity of uremic RLS symptoms can be ameliorated by using dopamine agonists and gabapentin, intravenous iron, exercise or supplementation with vitamins C and E, although some of those treatment benefits may be transient. There is a lack of strong evidence regarding the effects of the pharmacological approaches on quality of life and cardiovascular survival and mortality. In contrast exercise has been proven beneficial in both reducing the RLS symptoms' severity score and improving the quality of life.

### New concepts in the management of restless legs syndrome [^bbccb8d4]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is a neurological condition with an overall prevalence in adults of 5–10% in Europe and North America. It is characterised by strong feelings of restlessness and distressing paraesthesia-like sensations in the lower legs, particularly when at rest. The symptoms vary considerably in severity and frequency. RLS/WED has a variable clinical expression influenced by genetic, environmental, and medical factors. Research into the pathophysiology of RLS/WED has found that various genetic markers and existing dysfunctions in dopaminergic mechanisms and iron mechanisms play a central role. Until recently, the first line treatment of RLS/WED was with low dose dopamine agonists, with three drugs having been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. However, the occurrence of dopaminergic augmentation and an overall increase in severity of symptoms during long term treatment with dopamine agonists is leading to a shift towards non-dopaminergic alternatives as initial treatments, and particularly to α 2 δ ligands. Recent international guidelines recommend, whenever possible, to start treatment with these drugs (α 2 δ ligands) to avoid augmentation from the start. Other (eg, glutamatergic or adenosine) neurotransmitters might also play an important role in causing RLS/WED and might thus lead to new treatments.

### Restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease: epidemiology, pathogenetic overlaps, and clinical management [^201ee486]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both classified as neurological movement disorders, and they may be interconnected due to abnormalities in the dopaminergic system. The incidence of RLS in PD patients is higher than that in the general population. And PD patients with RLS exhibit a higher age of onset, more severe depression, worse nutritional status, lower quality of life, and a relatively lower frequency and severity of RLS symptom. The current research has unveiled several potential mechanisms underlying RLS in PD patients, such as iron deficiency, reduced function of the dopamine system in the A11 region, and decreased connectivity of related pathways and so on. By systematically summarizing the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of PD with RLS, this paper not only provides ideas for the precise diagnosis and treatment of PD with RLS, but also lays a theoretical foundation for clarifying the intricate relationship between PD and RLS.

### Clinical trials in restless legs syndrome – recommendations of the European RLS study group (EURLSSG) [^7d193eb1]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of the Study Group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all members have since contributed to many pivotal and nonpivotal drug trials for the treatment of RLS. The recommendations on clinical investigations of pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary endpoints for an evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations include the assessment of augmentation. Finally, general issues including the evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical companies in the design of optimized study protocols.

### Restless legs syndrome: causes and consequences [^6d797683]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) of a severity requiring medical attention has a prevalence of 2–3% in Caucasian populations. This significant cause of neurological morbidity is defined by an insistent urge to move the legs, and is often accompanied by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations deep in the legs themselves. Symptoms typically begin or worsen at rest, especially in the evening and night, and are often relieved by activities such as rubbing, stretching, or walking. There is a family history of RLS in approximately 50% of cases, suggesting genetic risk factors, and significant associations have been shown with low serum ferritin, uraemia, and pregnancy. In addition, individuals with various chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord disease, and neuropathy have been shown to have an increased risk of RLS although proving cause-and-effect is difficult. People with RLS have impaired sleep, often associated with periodic limb movements, and increased risk of depression and anxiety, all of which combine to reduce quality of life. Treatment of RLS involves lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise, and management of chronic comorbidities. Reversible causes such as low serum ferritin should be corrected. Effective medications include dopamine agonists (pramipexole or ropinirole), α2δ agonists (gabapentin or pregabalin), or opioids. RLS symptoms can paradoxically worsen with extended use of dopamine agonists ('augmentation') leading to a difficult clinical situation where dopamine agonist withdrawal is required, often with opioid cover.

This month's journal club examines three papers looking at the causes and consequences of RLS. The first is a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies that highlight genetic risk factors for RLS. The second and third papers demonstrate associations between RLS and suicide or self-harm and resistant hypertension, respectively, and highlight some of the significant morbidities linked to RLS.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) restless legs syndrome (RLS) guideline — good practice for iron evaluation and modifiers: In adult patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation, and testing should ideally be administered in the morning avoiding all iron-containing supplements and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw; consensus guidelines, which have not been empirically tested, suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or intravenous (IV) iron if serum ferritin is ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL, while in children supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations; the first step in management should be addressing exacerbating factors such as alcohol, caffeine, antihistaminergic, serotonergic, antidopaminergic medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders, and prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

### Restless legs syndrome [^8f55636d]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder characterized by an urge to move that appears during rest or is exacerbated by rest, that occurs in the evening or night and that disappears during movement or is improved by movement. Symptoms vary considerably in age at onset, frequency and severity, with severe forms affecting sleep, quality of life and mood. Patients with RLS often display periodic leg movements during sleep or resting wakefulness. RLS is considered to be a complex condition in which predisposing genetic factors, environmental factors and comorbidities contribute to the expression of the disorder. RLS occurs alone or with comorbidities, for example, iron deficiency and kidney disease, but also with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and neurological, rheumatological and respiratory disorders. The pathophysiology is still unclear, with the involvement of brain iron deficiency, dysfunction in the dopaminergic and nociceptive systems and altered adenosine and glutamatergic pathways as hypotheses being investigated. RLS is poorly recognized by physicians and it is accordingly often incorrectly diagnosed and managed. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with low doses of dopamine agonists or α 2 δ ligands in severe forms. Although dopaminergic treatment is initially highly effective, its long-term use can result in a serious worsening of symptoms known as augmentation. Other treatments include opioids and iron preparations.

### Ropinirole is effective in the long-term management of restless legs syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^2cf648b9]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy of ropinirole in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to assess the potential for relapse after the discontinuation of active treatment. Patients with primary RLS (n = 202) received single-blind ropinirole for 24 weeks. Patients meeting treatment continuation criteria were randomized to double-blind treatment with ropinirole or placebo for a further 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients relapsing during double-blind treatment. Additional efficacy measures included time to relapse, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, change in International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) score during double-blind treatment, and changes in sleep and quality of life (QoL) parameters. Significantly fewer patients relapsed on ropinirole than on placebo (32.6% vs. 57.8%; P = 0.0156). Time to relapse was longer with ropinirole and more patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy with placebo. Patients showed improvements in IRLS and CGI-I scores, sleep and QoL parameters with single-blind ropinirole, which were better maintained when ropinirole was continued during the double-blind phase, but reduced with placebo. Ropinirole was well tolerated; adverse events were typical for dopamine agonists. Ropinirole was highly effective and well tolerated in the long-term management of RLS, with pharmacological effect over 36 weeks.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^7c9deaf3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric restless legs syndrome — treatment stance and monitoring. There is very little published literature on pediatric RLS treatment, but evidence points to oral iron supplementation in iron deficiency as a low-risk, accessible treatment; important considerations include identifying potential side effects leading to discontinuation, most commonly constipation. The task force did not find evidence to support treating children with RLS with other medications commonly used in adults, and regularly monitoring RLS symptoms and the effect on the child's quality of life (QOL), sleep, and academic performance is necessary to assess treatment efficacy and identify adjustments.

### Restless legs syndrome: a clinical update [^59eb83d3]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and often disabling sensorimotor disorder. Epidemiologic studies suggest that RLS is an underrecognized and undertreated disorder affecting both children and adults. The diagnosis is based primarily on the following four essential criteria: (1) an urge to move, usually associated with paresthesias, (2) onset or exacerbation of symptoms at rest, (3) relief of symptoms with movement, and (4) symptoms manifesting in a circadian pattern. Supplemental workup including polysomnography, iron profile, and/or neuropathy screen can provide support for the diagnosis and aid in the treatment strategy. Behavioral techniques, dopaminergic agents, opiates, benzodiazepines, and antiepileptics all have potential value in treating this disorder. Dopaminergic agents continue to be the most effective RLS treatment. However, due to their potential long-term side effects, these agents should not be considered the sole treatment of choice. In the end, the therapeutic plan should be individualized to suit each patient's presentation and needs.

### Restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease: epidemiology, pathogenetic overlaps, and clinical management [^f957e3eb]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by both motor and nonmotor symptoms. A key feature is the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein, which can be found in the gut, brainstem, and higher brain regions. Clinically, PD presents with progressive, asymmetric bradykinesia, as well as tremor, rigidity, and gait disturbance. In addition to these motor symptoms, PD also involves nonmotor features, such as psychiatric disorders, olfactory dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and sleep disorders. The main sleep disorders in PD include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, circadian rhythm dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and restless legs syndrome. Notably, restless legs syndrome can cause patients to experience pain in their legs at night, which can significantly impair their sleep quality.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis–Ekbom disease (WED), is a common sensory-motor disorder of the nervous system characterized by an intense and almost irresistible desire to move the legs, usually accompanied by various sensory symptoms and unpleasant sensations in the ankle, knee, or entire lower limb. Most of them occur at night or in the evening, aggravate when quiet or at rest, and improve after activity. RLS can be idiopathic or secondary to many other diseases, such as polyneuropathy and multiple sclerosis, iron deficiency anemia, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension or cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disease, chronic liver disease, and pregnancy. Owing to the increased discomfort in the legs — such as restlessness, discomfort, stiffness, pain, tingling, burning, cold, heat, and spasms — RLS can lead to frequent nocturnal awakenings, which can severely impact patients' quality of life.

### Rethinking clinical trials in restless legs syndrome: a roadmap [^808db088]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The number of large clinical trials of restless legs syndrome (RLS) have decreased in recent years, this coincides with reduced interest in developing and testing novel pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) formed a task force of global experts to examine the causes of these trends and make recommendations to facilitate new clinical trials. In our article, we delve into potential complications linked to the diagnostic definition of RLS, identify subpopulations necessitating more attention, and highlight issues pertaining to endpoints and study frameworks. In particular, we recommend developing alternative scoring methods for more accurate RLS diagnosis, thereby improving clinical trial specificity. Furthermore, enhancing the precision of endpoints will increase study effect sizes and mitigate study costs. Suggestions to achieve this include developing online, real-time sleep diaries with high-frequency sampling of nightly sleep latency and the use of PLMs as surrogate markers. Furthermore, to reduce the placebo response, strategies should be adopted that include placebo run-in periods. As RLS is frequently a chronic condition, priority should be given to long-term studies, using a randomized, placebo-controlled, withdrawal design. Lastly, new populations should be investigated to develop targeted treatments such as mild RLS, pregnancy, hemodialysis, or iron-deficient anemia.

### Diagnosis and management of sleep apnea syndrome and restless legs syndrome in dialysis patients [^a2daf1cb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep complaints are very common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and contribute to their impaired quality of life. Both obstructive and central sleep apnea syndromes are reported more often in patients on dialysis than in the general population. Impaired daytime functioning, sleepiness, and fatigue, as well as cognitive problems, are well known in patients with sleep apnea. Increasing evidence supports the pathophysiological role of sleep apnea in cardiovascular disorders, which are the leading cause of death in ESRD patients. Uremic factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea in this patient population and optimal dialysis may reduce disease severity. Furthermore, treatment with continuous positive airway pressure may improve quality of life and may help to manage hypertension in these patients. Secondary restless legs syndrome is highly prevalent in patients on maintenance dialysis. The pathophysiology of the disorder may also involve uremia-related factors, iron deficiency, and anemia, but genetic and lifestyle factors might also play a role. The treatment of restless legs syndrome involves various pharmacologic approaches and might be challenging in severe cases. In this article we review the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome, with a focus on dialysis patients. We also briefly review current data regarding sleep problems after transplantation, since these studies may indirectly shed light on the possible pathophysiological role of uremia or dialysis in the etiology of sleep disorders. Considering the importance of sleep disorders, more awareness among professionals involved in the care of patients on dialysis is necessary. Appropriate management of sleep disorders could improve the quality of life and possibly even impact upon survival of renal patients.

### Long-term treatment of restless legs syndrome with dopamine agonists… [^9cd5ed24]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of DA for RLS and to evaluate factors that could predict the occurrence of augmentation. Methods We queried all subjects seen from 1996 to 2003 and followed up those initiated on any DA by the Baylor College of Medicine Movement Disorders Clinic, Houston, Tex. Patients with Parkinson disease, uremia, or medications that could affect RLS were excluded. Demographics, efficacy, dosing, adverse events, and augmentation were tracked across time. Statistical modeling was used to evaluate for factors that could predict augmentation. Adverse events were frequent but usually mild and seldom resulted in discontinuation. Augmentation was frequent but usually modest, and it was predicted by a positive family history for RLS and especially the lack of any neuropathy on electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity tests.

Conclusions Dopamine agonists continued to effectively treat RLS without long-term adverse events but often required adjustments across time. The higher rate of augmentation in familial and nonneuropathic RLS should be considered when initiating therapy. Restless legs syndrome, as defined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group criteria, 1 may occur in more than 10% of predominately Caucasian populations. 2–4 Historically, numerous treatments have been used with varying degrees of success, yet evidence-based medicine most consistently supports the efficacy of levodopa and dopamine agonists. 5 These studies, however, mostly involve short treatment periods. This is most notable with levodopa, which has the shortest half-life of any dopaminergic treatment. 9 Augmentation, however, is also reported with pergolide6, 10, 11 and pramipexole12, 13 but, to date, not with cabergoline.

14, 15 No report has ever evaluated the longitudinal use of multiple dopaminergic medications concurrently to make efficacy and tolerability comparisons. Furthermore, factors that might predict problems with continued DA treatment for RLS have not been systematically evaluated. Our results demonstrate that DA effectively treat RLS for more than 6 months. Efficacy is generally maintained across time but at the cost of a moderate but significant dose augmentation. The medications are very well tolerated, and adverse events are uncommon after the dose initiation. Modest augmentation, as defined by an earlier onset of symptoms, occurs frequently, but severe augmentation that increases symptom intensity is uncommon and usually managed by dose adjustments.

### Emerging concepts of the pathophysiology and adverse outcomes of restless legs syndrome [^e807306b]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), is a common neurological disorder affecting up to 5% to 10% of the population, but it remains an underdiagnosed condition. RLS/WED is characterized by uncomfortable sensations, mainly in the legs, which appear during inactivity and worsen in the evening or at night. The prevalence of RLS/WED and periodic leg movements (PLMs) is increased in patients with sleep-disordered breathing, particularly in those with OSA, the most common sleep disorder encountered in sleep centers. New advances in the pathophysiology of RLS/WED have shown important implications for various genetic markers, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and iron deficiency. A practical approach to RLS/WED management includes an accurate diagnosis, the identification of reversible contributing factors, and the use of nonpharmacological therapies, including iron substitution (oral or IV) therapy. Many pharmacological agents are effective for the treatment of RLS/WED. Until recently, the first-line treatment of RLS/WED consisted of low-dose dopamine agonists (DA). However, given the fact that DAs cause high rates of augmentation of symptoms, international guidelines recommend that whenever possible the initial treatment of choice should be an α2δ ligand, and avoidance of dopaminergic agents unless absolutely necessary. If necessary, the lowest effective dose should be used for only the shortest possible time. The symptoms of RLS/WED can disrupt the quality of sleep as well as the quality of life. IV iron therapy may be considered in patients with refractory RLS. A better understanding of RLS/WED pathophysiology will allow patients to receive tailored therapy, resulting in an improved quality of life.

### Pharmacologic therapy for primary restless legs syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f0f26fa3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS.

Evidence Acquisition

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, reporting efficacy outcomes and harms of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS of at least 4 weeks' duration. MEDLINE and other databases were searched through June 2012. Reviewers extracted outcomes and adverse events and rated the strength of evidence.

Results

We identified 29 eligible RCTs. We found high-strength evidence that the proportion of patients who had a clinically important response (International Restless Legs Syndrome [IRLS] responders), defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in mean IRLS symptom scale scores, was greater with dopamine agonist therapy compared with placebo (61% vs 41%) (risk ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.38–1.86]; 7 trials). Dopamine agonists also improved patient-reported sleep scale scores and quality-of-life measures. High-strength evidence demonstrated that calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands increased the proportion of IRLS responders compared with placebo (61% vs 37%) (risk ratio, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.33–2.09]; 3 trials). Adverse events associated with dopamine agonists included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. Alpha-2-delta ligands adverse events included somnolence and unsteadiness or dizziness.

Conclusions and Relevance

On the basis of short-term RCTs that enrolled highly selected populations with long-term high-moderate to very severe symptoms, dopamine agonists and calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands reduced RLS symptoms and improved sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life. Adverse effects and treatment withdrawals due to adverse effects were common.

### Iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^dc09f031]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random-effects meta-analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro.

Main Results

We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2–16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD -3.78, 95% CI -6.25 to -1.31; I² = 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.23; I² = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD -0.40, 95% CI -5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I² = 54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I² = 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.56; I² = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (-35.5 ± 92.0 versus -41.4 ± 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.32; I² = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS-6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference -1.5, 95% CI -2.5 to -0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I² = 45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole.

Authors' Conclusions

Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^b6e53957]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Treatment landscape and outcomes for RLS — prior guidance considered pramipexole and ropinirole STANDARD treatments; the AASM has modified its CPGs to include only 2 levels (STRONG or CONDITIONAL) for or against treatments; the guideline places special emphasis on augmentation with dopamine agonists, defined as a gradual worsening of RLS symptom intensity and duration over months to years with manifestations such as earlier symptom onset, reduced latency to symptom onset with sedentary activities, and/or extension to other areas, which is most common and aggressive at higher dopaminergic doses; additional large trials of pregabalin and ferric carboxymaltose have led to revisions of their status; and the most important clinical trial endpoint remains the International restless legs syndrome severity scale, including the self-administered International RLS Severity Scale.

### Medication tolerance and augmentation in restless legs syndrome: the need for drug class rotation [^afb6ed4c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterized by an unpleasant urge to move the legs that usually occurs at night and may interfere with sleep. The medications used most commonly to treat RLS include dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, dopamine agonists), benzodiazepines, and narcotic analgesics. We report the cases of 2 patients with RLS who illustrate the problems of tolerance (declining response over time) and augmentation (a worsening of symptoms due to ongoing treatment) that can complicate the pharmacotherapy of RLS. We discuss the optimal management of RLS and propose strategies to overcome tolerance and augmentation such as a rotational approach among agents from different classes.

### Restless legs syndrome: diagnostic assessment and the advantages and risks of dopaminergic treatment [^47dbf90b]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In the past few years, major advances have been made in the field of restless legs syndrome (RLS). New tools have been developed to assess the presence and severity of RLS and its complications. Furthermore new concepts of the phenotype are emerging. With a high likelihood a slight dopaminergic hypofunction contributes essentially to the pathophysiology of most phenotypes of RLS. Dopaminergic substitution either with L-DOPA or with dopamine agonists ameliorates symptoms in the large majority of patients. Too high of doses of either type of drug may be involved in the development of augmentation caused by treatment-induced alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopaminergic agents are currently the agents of first choice to treat RLS, and large multicenter trials support the evidence of efficacy. Very careful tailoring of the dose is required to avoid the development of treatment complications, specifically augmentation.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) restless legs syndrome (RLS) — Recommendation 4: In adults with RLS, the AASM recommends the use of IV ferric carboxymaltose over no IV ferric carboxymaltose in patients with appropriate iron status (see good practice statement for iron parameters) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). The TF identified 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with clinically significant improvements in disease severity, sleep quality, and quality of life (QOL) with a moderate effect size, and 4 RCTs reporting adverse events leading to withdrawal where the pooled estimate did not meet clinical significance; adverse effects included risk for hypophosphatemia and dizziness, and the undesirable effect size was deemed small. Overall certainty was moderate due to imprecision; cost was considered moderate; the treatment would probably reduce health equity; feasibility was probably achievable.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) restless legs syndrome (RLS) — Recommendation 7: In adults with RLS the AASM suggests the use of ferrous sulfate over no ferrous sulfate in patients with appropriate iron status (see good practice statement for iron parameters) (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). The TF identified 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating a potential improvement in disease severity with large effect size; 2 RCTs reported adverse events leading to withdrawal where the pooled estimate met clinical significance, and the undesirable effect size was deemed small. Overall certainty was moderate due to imprecision; cost was considered negligible; health equity would not be affected; feasibility was affirmed.
