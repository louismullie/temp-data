## Question

Primary care work up for elevated calcium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step primary care workup for elevated calcium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true and persistent hypercalcemia. Then, I should verify the focused history and physical exam elements that change pre-test probabilities. Next, I will check which laboratory tests are essential and how to interpret them to distinguish PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. After that, I must assess end-organ involvement and surgical indications, consider special populations like pregnancy, outline initial and urgent management, decide on referral pathways and surveillance, and finally highlight common pitfalls and a concise algorithm, all while cross-checking key guidelines and evidence as I go [^115mxSJ5] [^114vqPTs] [^112goaqb].

> Let me first confirm that hypercalcemia is real and persistent, because misclassification here derails everything downstream. I need to repeat the total calcium on at least two separate occasions, spaced by at least two weeks, and either correct for albumin or directly measure ionized calcium to rule out pseudohypercalcemia from binding protein changes or lab artifact, applying the correction formula if needed and confirming over time rather than acting on a single outlier result [^115mxSJ5] [^114vqPTs].

> Next, I should review the clinical context carefully. Wait, let me verify symptom burden and chronicity: many PHPT cases are asymptomatic, but I should still ask about fatigue, neurocognitive changes, thirst and polyuria, bone pain, nephrolithiasis, and fractures, while examining for dehydration and musculoskeletal tenderness. I need to check medications that raise calcium or confound interpretation, particularly thiazides, lithium, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and recent antiresorptives; I should also confirm diet, family history of stones or hypercalcemia, and any endocrine syndromic features that might suggest a genetic syndrome [^115u3zma] [^114guUzo].

> Now I will order essential labs, but hold on, I need to ensure preanalytical issues are minimized and that I use appropriate assays. Intact PTH using a second- or third-generation assay is the cornerstone to triage the differential. Alongside PTH, I should obtain adjusted total calcium or ionized calcium, phosphorus, creatinine with eGFR or preferably CrCl, 25-hydroxyvitamin D to detect deficiency that can elevate PTH, and consider magnesium because hypomagnesemia can perturb PTH dynamics. I should confirm abnormal results with repeat testing if the clinical picture is discordant before labeling the etiology [^113LrxeF] [^115mxSJ5].

> If the pattern is not immediately clear, I need to add conditional tests thoughtfully. I should double-check for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia with a urinary calcium/creatinine clearance ratio; a ratio less than 0.01 suggests FHH, but I must remember that up to 20% of PHPT can be in the 0.01–0.02 gray zone, so I should not overcall FHH without the full biochemical context or genetics when appropriate. If PTH is suppressed, I will consider PTHrP for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D for granulomatous disease or lymphoma, and other targeted tests such as TSH if clinical cues suggest thyrotoxicosis, being careful to align test selection with suspected mechanisms rather than broad panels [^115DeQBZ] [^114vqPTs] [^117UQjw1].

> I will now interpret the pattern to determine etiology. Elevated or inappropriately normal PTH in the setting of confirmed hypercalcemia strongly supports PHPT; physiologically, PTH should be suppressed with hypercalcemia, so any non-suppressed value is "inappropriately normal" and diagnostic when confirmed on two occasions. But wait, I should verify that secondary causes like vitamin D deficiency, CKD, or hypercalciuria are excluded if calcium is normal with elevated PTH, as that would shift the frame to normocalcemic PHPT only after 3–6 months of consistent findings. Conversely, suppressed PTH redirects me to PTH-independent causes such as malignancy, vitamin D–mediated mechanisms, granulomatous disease, milk-alkali syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis, guided by the targeted tests above and the clinical setting [^115mxSJ5] [^114KmBRe] [^115jPgSs] [^117UQjw1].

> Before rushing to localization studies, hold on, let me ensure I've assessed end-organ effects and determined whether the patient meets surgical criteria, since imaging is for localization after we decide to operate, not for diagnosis. I should obtain renal imaging to look for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, a DEXA scan at lumbar spine, total hip, and distal one-third radius, and vertebral imaging if indicated, while also checking a 24-hour urine calcium to characterize stone risk and hypercalciuria. Surgical indications include serum calcium persistently > 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, age under 50 years, creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, vertebral fracture, or high 24-hour urinary calcium with stone risk, and I should confirm these against current workshop guidance before counseling on parathyroidectomy [^115JXTye] [^111aZ7bs] [^111MsztM] [^112goaqb] [^115WdPx8].

> Let me consider special populations, particularly pregnancy, where I need to balance maternal and fetal risks. For mild disease, I should confirm that conservative management with hydration and close monitoring of maternal calcium is reasonable; for more severe disease, especially if calcium is ≥ 11 mg/dL, I should consider second-trimester parathyroidectomy when not contraindicated. If surgery is deferred, I must remember to monitor the neonate closely for hypocalcemia postpartum because maternal hypercalcemia can suppress fetal parathyroid function, and plan definitive surgery after delivery and before a subsequent pregnancy [^116eKQaq] [^116zsMrm] [^117J3Lao].

> While awaiting specialty input, I need to implement initial management appropriate to severity. For mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia, I should encourage oral hydration if not contraindicated, avoid thiazides and unnecessary calcium or vitamin D excess, and correct vitamin D deficiency cautiously to a 25-OHD above 30 ng/mL but below the upper lab limit, monitoring calcium as I replete. For moderate to severe hypercalcemia or symptomatic patients, urgent isotonic IV hydration is first-line while I reassess cardiac and renal status, and only after euvolemia should I consider loop diuretics to promote calciuresis; I should not delay escalation or hospitalization when clinically indicated [^116XPDL4] [^111H4sYr] [^1165qPtd] [^116SKEqF].

> I should confirm referral pathways next. All patients with confirmed PHPT warrant endocrinology referral, and surgical candidates should be referred to an experienced parathyroid surgeon; let me double-check that preoperative localization imaging is best ordered and interpreted by the operating team, not in primary care, to optimize concordance with local expertise. Even with negative or discordant imaging, referral is still appropriate because operative decision-making and advanced localization evolve at high-volume centers [^1136SaFb] [^114LkNyV] [^116cAxbj].

> If a patient declines surgery or is not a surgical candidate, I need to ensure a structured surveillance plan and evidence-based medical therapy. Annual serum calcium and 25-OHD with consideration of PTH as indicated, DEXA at three sites every 1–2 years, periodic renal assessment including CrCl and imaging if indicated, and 24-hour urine calcium when clinically relevant are appropriate. For medical therapy, I should confirm that cinacalcet lowers serum calcium into the normal range, whereas antiresorptives like bisphosphonates improve bone mineral density without lowering calcium; estrogen therapy can increase BMD in selected patients, though its effect on calcium is inconsistent, so I must tailor choices to skeletal versus calcemic targets and patient risk [^1145Xcuv] [^1152z3aX] [^112vY24W] [^112vNQVN].

> But wait, let me not jump to conclusions about etiology in PTH-suppressed hypercalcemia, because missed malignancy can be catastrophic. In suspected hypercalcemia of malignancy, I should prioritize stabilization with fluids and prompt antiresorptive therapy per Endocrine Society guidance, adjust bisphosphonate dosing in renal insufficiency, and consider calcitonin for rapid, short-term lowering while definitive therapies take effect, escalating to denosumab when appropriate; these steps should proceed in tandem with investigating the underlying cancer biology and mechanisms such as PTHrP or calcitriol excess [^1165qPtd] [^114bM9tf] [^115D7nUZ] [^111f3qBb].

> I should double-check common pitfalls that delay care and build safeguards against them. It is tempting to attribute a mild calcium elevation to thiazides or supplements and stop, but hold on, I must measure PTH in every patient with confirmed hypercalcemia, repeat abnormal calcium to ensure persistence, and remember to check the urine calcium/creatinine clearance ratio when PHPT and FHH are in the differential. Real-world data show that only about one-third of hypercalcemic patients get a PTH checked and that missed or delayed PHPT diagnoses are common, so I need to systematize these steps to avoid anchoring and omission errors [^112jCwYy] [^111Pk86F].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm in words so I can sanity-check the flow. First, confirm hypercalcemia on two occasions and correct for albumin or measure ionized calcium, then review medications and clinical context. Next, order PTH plus the core labs to anchor the differential. If PTH is elevated or inappropriately normal with hypercalcemia, treat as PHPT: assess end-organ effects and surgical indications, obtain DEXA and renal imaging, and refer to endocrinology and an experienced surgeon for management and localization. If PTH is suppressed, evaluate for malignancy, vitamin D–related mechanisms, granulomatous disease, and other PTH-independent causes while initiating supportive management, escalating care based on severity and the underlying diagnosis. Key principle: I need to ensure PTH is measured in every confirmed hypercalcemic patient, because this single decision bifurcates the evaluation and prevents the most common diagnostic error [^115mxSJ5] [^114vqPTs] [^115jPgSs].

---

The primary care workup for elevated calcium should start with **repeat calcium testing** to confirm true hypercalcemia and exclude lab error, then **measure PTH** to distinguish PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated causes [^115mxSJ5] [^113LrxeF]. Next, check **25-hydroxyvitamin D**, creatinine/eGFR [^111aZ7bs], and phosphorus; obtain a **24-hour urine calcium** to differentiate PHPT from FHH (CCCR < 0.01 suggests FHH) [^115DeQBZ]. If **PTH is low**, order **PTHrP**, 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)2D [^117UQjw1] to evaluate for malignancy [^116uRQtU] or granulomatous disease. Review medications, supplements, and family history [^115u3zma], and refer to endocrinology or oncology [^115jPgSs] if PHPT, malignancy, or other complex causes are suspected.

---

## Step 1: confirm true hypercalcemia

To confirm true hypercalcemia, **repeat testing** should verify the elevation by correcting total calcium for albumin or measuring ionized calcium to exclude lab error or pseudohypercalcemia [^113LrxeF] [^113jGG36]. Also, **exclude pseudohypercalcemia** by identifying elevated total calcium with normal ionized calcium in high protein states (e.g. multiple myeloma) [^114AsAaU].

---

## Step 2: initial laboratory evaluation

- **Parathyroid hormone (PTH)**: Measure intact PTH to distinguish PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated hypercalcemia [^115mxSJ5].

- **Vitamin D status**: Measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D to assess deficiency or excess [^113jGG36].

- **Renal function**: Check serum creatinine and eGFR to evaluate renal involvement or secondary hyperparathyroidism [^111aZ7bs] [^113LrxeF].

- **Phosphorus**: Measure serum phosphorus; low-normal or low phosphorus supports PHPT [^114guUzo] [^113LrxeF].

---

## Step 3: differentiate PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated hypercalcemia

| **PTH level** | **Likely etiology** | **Next steps** |
|-|-|-|
| Elevated or inappropriately normal | - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) [^113LrxeF] <br/> - Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) [^114vqPTs] <br/> - Tertiary hyperparathyroidism | - 24-hour urine calcium [^111aZ7bs] <br/> - Calcium-creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) [^115DeQBZ] <br/> - Parathyroid imaging if surgery considered [^115EuFiE] [^112goaqb] |
| Suppressed | - Malignancy (PTHrP-mediated) [^116uRQtU] <br/> - Vitamin D intoxication [^117UQjw1] <br/> - Granulomatous disease [^117UQjw1] <br/> - Medications (thiazides, lithium) | - PTHrP [^116uRQtU] <br/> - 25(OH)D [^113LrxeF] <br/> - 1,25(OH)2D [^117UQjw1] <br/> - Malignancy workup [^116uRQtU] <br/> - Medication review [^115u3zma] |

---

## Step 4: 24-hour urine calcium and calcium-creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR)

A **24-hour urine calcium** helps differentiate PHPT from FHH [^111aZ7bs]; PHPT usually shows elevated urine calcium, whereas FHH has low urine calcium. The **CCCR** is interpreted as follows: < 0.01 suggests FHH, 0.01–0.02 is indeterminate, and > 0.02 supports PHPT [^115DeQBZ].

---

## Step 5: medication and supplement review

As part of the medication and supplement review, **medications** to assess include thiazide diuretics, lithium [^114vqPTs], and calcium or vitamin D supplements, which can cause or worsen hypercalcemia [^113LrxeF].

---

## Step 6: imaging studies (if indicated)

- **Parathyroid imaging**: Use cervical ultrasound or sestamibi scan if PHPT is confirmed and surgery is considered; imaging is for localization, not diagnosis [^115EuFiE] [^112goaqb].

- **Renal imaging**: Obtain renal ultrasound or CT if nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis is suspected [^111MsztM].

- **Malignancy workup**: If malignancy is suspected, consider chest X-ray, CT, or PET-CT based on clinical context [^116uRQtU].

---

## Step 7: referral to specialists

- **Endocrinology**: Refer if PHPT, FHH, or other endocrine causes are suspected [^1136SaFb].

- **Oncology**: Refer if malignancy-related hypercalcemia is suspected [^115jPgSs].

- **Nephrology**: Refer if significant renal impairment or nephrolithiasis is present [^115JXTye].

---

## Step 8: follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, **monitoring** should include serum calcium, renal function, and bone density (DEXA) [^1145Xcuv] as indicated, with **patient education** on hypercalcemia symptoms and when to seek care [^115WdPx8].

---

In sum, **confirm hypercalcemia, assess PTH, and stratify by PTH status** [^113LrxeF], then complete vitamin D, renal/phosphorus labs, 24-hour urine calcium/CCCR [^111aZ7bs], and targeted imaging [^115EuFiE] or referrals as indicated.

### Failure to diagnose and treat hyperparathyroidism among patients with hypercalcemia: Opportunities for intervention at the patient and physician level to increase surgical referral [^111Pk86F]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, but the reasons for these deficiencies have not been fully described. This study aimed to identify reasons for the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hyperparathyroidism that could be addressed by targeted interventions.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 3,200 patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 10.5 mg/dL) who had parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels evaluated at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We randomly sampled 60 patients and divided them into three groups based on their PTH levels. Two independent reviewers examined clinical notes and diagnostic data to identify reasons for delayed diagnosis or referral for treatment.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 16.5 years; 68% were women, and 55% were white. Fifty percent of patients had at least one elevated calcium level that was missed by their primary care provider. Hypercalcemia was frequently attributed to causes other than hyperparathyroidism, including diuretics (12%), calcium supplements (12%), dehydration (5%), and renal dysfunction (3%). Even when calcium and PTH were both elevated, the diagnosis was missed or delayed in 40% of patients. For 7% of patients, a nonsurgeon stated that surgery offered no benefit; 22% of patients were offered medical treatment or observation, and 8% opted not to see a surgeon. Only 20% of patients were referred for surgical evaluation, and they waited a median of 16 months before seeing a surgeon.

- **Conclusion**: To address common causes for delayed diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism, we must implement effective interventions at both the patient and physician levels.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. During 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists, and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^116PPaUD]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients. This condition is most common in postmenopausal women, although it can occur in persons of all ages, including pregnant women. If symptoms are present, they are attributable to hypercalcemia and may include weakness, easy fatigability, anorexia, or anxiety. However, most people have no symptoms, and primary hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed after an elevated serum calcium level is found incidentally on multiphasic chemistry panel testing. Persistent hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone level are the diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism. Other causes of hypercalcemia are rare and usually are associated with low (or sometimes normal) parathyroid hormone levels. Malignancy is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients.

Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, the procedure has success rates of 90 to 95 percent and a low rate of complications. Asymptomatic patients who decline surgery and meet criteria for medical management must commit to conscientious long-term monitoring. Any unexplained elevation of the serum calcium level should be evaluated promptly to prevent complications from hypercalcemia.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend confirming the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism if serum calcium is elevated (total calcium corrected for albumin or elevated ionized calcium) in the presence of an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH. This should occur in the absence of conditions mimicking primary hyperparathyroidism, such as thiazide diuretics, lithium, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

### Clinical review: Rare causes of hypercalcemia [^114AsAaU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Although hypercalcemia is usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, a number of other conditions can be important to consider. This review considers unusual causes of hypercalcemia that are generally not found in reviews on this subject.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Articles describing rarely reported associations between hypercalcemia and unusual causes were identified through a computer search of the terms hypercalcemia/etiology and through the references listed in those articles. We grouped the 58 different reports into categories defined by a presumed etiology: increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or PTHrP, occult milk-alkali syndrome, and undefined mechanisms. Reports in infants and children are listed separately, as are reports of pseudohypercalcemia, situations that are not truly hypercalcemic because the ionized calcium is normal.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In some situations, as this review points out, a number of unusual causes of hypercalcemia are important to consider. The search for an elusive cause of hypercalcemia is best accomplished by the most likely potential mechanism. An orderly search in this manner is likely to reveal the underlying cause.

- **Conclusions**: That so many patients have been described with rare and usually poorly understood causes of hypercalcemia highlights our incomplete understanding of calcium metabolism in humans and suggests additional areas in which directed clinical investigation might improve our knowledge of the normal metabolism of calcium.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in a patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to specialists, despite the lack of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still had an imbalance of calcium and PTH. Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation. Thus, the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search. Articles published between 1930 and June 2014 were searched using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies.

Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1137a78P]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 82 patients with plausible pHPT were not referred to a specialist. Cases with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in calcium homeostasis were excluded stepwise after answering a survey and based on results of new blood tests and an assessment by an experienced endocrine surgeon.

A second sampling of serum PTH, ionized calcium, and creatinine was arranged for the remaining cohort of 45 patients. Ionized calcium was chosen for these tests to provide a more specific diagnosis of pHPT in a low-range hypercalcaemia compared to the formerly used albumin-corrected serum calcium values. Limits for exclusion were set at the same levels for PTH (≥ 4.3 pmol/L) and creatinine (< 175 mmol/L) as in the first inclusion criteria. The limit for ionized calcium was set at 1.26 mmol/L (reference range 1.13–1.30 mmol/L), corresponding to an albumin-corrected calcium of 2.40 mmol/L. All criteria had to be met before patients continued to be included in the study. Four patients declined further participation. Patients not fulfilling the criteria after this new blood sample (n = 12) were offered one repeated testing. Ten patients did not meet the criteria this second time or declined further samplings and had to be excluded. If they fulfilled the criteria at this second new sampling, they were included in the study (n = 2).

Patients in the final study cohort (n = 32) were given outpatient appointments at the Endocrine Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgery, Östersund Hospital. At this point, two patients declined further participation in the study.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114aSg3C]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

At the Östersund Hospital, and in most Swedish laboratories, normal values of albumin-corrected serum calcium range from 2.15 to 2.50 mmol/L and parathyroid hormone (PTH) from 1.9 to 6.9 pmol/L. The true ratio between PTH and calcium that correlates with histologically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is still to be established. There are studies including normocalcaemic cases (calcium ≥ 2.1 mmol/L and PTH ≥ 6.9 pmol/L) as well as normohormonal cases (calcium ≥ 2.78 mmol/L and PTH < 4.2 pmol/L). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that a significant disturbance of calcium homeostasis exists when calcium levels are in the upper part of the normal range together with non-suppressed PTH levels.

To reduce the number of false positive pHPT patients in the final cohort, we have tried to exclude all patients with a plausible other cause of the disturbed balance of serum calcium and PTH. In total, 156 patients were excluded due to possible differential diagnoses during the different steps of exclusion. A suspicion of a differential diagnosis derived from the patients' records or list of medications was deemed reason enough for exclusion. Of course, this approach causes a high risk of excluding patients with mild pHPT; on the other hand, false positive cases are more easily eliminated. The 82 patients not being cared for properly were all asked to voluntarily participate in the coming studies. Only seven patients declined further participation.

The most common differential diagnosis was secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) due to renal failure. This was expected, as renal failure is a common disorder, and the prevalence of sHPT increases with the degree.

### Calciphylaxis due to hyperparathyroidism [^111mvYdQ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to discuss the timing and methodology for working up calciphylaxis to allow for early diagnosis and to differentiate between medical and surgical management of the disease.

- **Methods**: A review of evidence-based medical literature on calciphylaxis related to primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism was conducted.

- **Results**: Calciphylaxis is typically associated with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Nevertheless, it can manifest in the absence of chronic renal failure and has been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, often due to a parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. The condition occurs when calcium and phosphate levels in the blood exceed their solubility, leading to deposits in the arteries that impair the vasculature. This process results in ischemic changes, forming plaque-like lesions that develop into painful nodules. Diagnosis relies on physical examination, laboratory tests, and histopathology. When medical treatment fails for secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism with calciphylaxis, a parathyroidectomy is recommended. In cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, early recognition and comprehensive wound care, including debridement, are crucial. Additionally, resecting the problematic parathyroid gland should be strongly considered.

- **Conclusions**: Early detection of calciphylaxis is vital for effective management. While medical therapy can be beneficial, the surgical removal of diseased parathyroid glands may be curative and potentially lifesaving. A multidisciplinary approach is essential.

### Vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia: Mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment [^117UQjw1]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia occurs in up to 4% of the population in association with malignancy, primary hyperparathyroidism, ingestion of excessive calcium and/or vitamin D, ectopic production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], and impaired degradation of 1,25(OH)₂D. The ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin D₃ (or vitamin D₂) results in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria due to the formation of supraphysiological amounts of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] that bind to the vitamin D receptor, albeit with lower affinity than the active form of the vitamin, 1,25(OH)₂D. Additionally, the formation of 5,6-trans 25(OH)D binds to the vitamin D receptor more tightly than 25(OH)D.

In patients with granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis and tumors such as lymphomas, hypercalcemia occurs due to the activity of ectopic 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) expressed in macrophages or tumor cells and the formation of excessive amounts of 1,25(OH)₂D. Recent work has identified a novel cause of non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia when the degradation of 1,25(OH)₂D is impaired as a result of mutations of the 1,25(OH)₂D-24-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (CYP24A1). Patients with biallelic and, in some instances, monoallelic mutations of the CYP24A1 gene have elevated serum calcium concentrations associated with elevated serum 1,25(OH)₂D, suppressed PTH concentrations, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and on occasion, reduced bone density. Of interest, first-time calcium renal stone formers have elevated 1,25(OH)₂D and evidence of impaired degradation.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1125F8xM]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A cohort of 82 patients was identified, all with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) according to preset criteria and with no other explanation for the disturbed calcium homeostasis. Of these 82 patients, 9 had been diagnosed with pHPT and/or had monitoring planned in a primary care center.

- **Distribution of serum markers**: Five patients had both serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and albumin-corrected serum calcium above the reference intervals. Conversely, a total of 27 patients had both PTH and albumin-corrected serum calcium within the reference ranges. Eight cases were normocalcaemic with high serum PTH, while 42 individuals were hypercalcaemic with PTH within the reference interval.

Data were collected during 2014, and none of the patients had been assessed by a specialist. The distribution of albumin-corrected serum calcium and PTH in the patient cohort was explored, and the reference intervals were indicated by black dotted lines representing the upper limits of normal albumin-corrected serum calcium (= 2.50 mmol/L) and serum PTH (= 6.9 pmol/L).

### High ionized calcium in the general population and risk of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115mX5fa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Although it is generally held that in otherwise healthy individuals, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely cause of persistent hypercalcemia, solid research supporting this assumption is absent. We aimed to examine the relative and absolute risk of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with an incidental high ionized calcium in the general population.

- **Methods**: We utilized the Danish Copenhagen General Population Study, a prospective cohort study with inclusion from 2003 to 2015, to investigate the association of ionized calcium on continuous and categorical scales with primary hyperparathyroidism using Cox regression and competing-risk regression. Hazard ratios and absolute 10-year risks of primary hyperparathyroidism were calculated.

- **Results**: Among 106,588 individuals, 2,497 (2.5%) had moderately high (1.33–1.40 mmol/L) or high (> 1.40 mmol/L) plasma ionized calcium at baseline, and 441 (0.4%) were diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism during follow-up. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for primary hyperparathyroidism for moderately high and high plasma ionized calcium versus low normal ionized calcium were 65 (95% CI: 46‒92) and 350 (251‒489). Stratified by sex, the corresponding hazard ratios were 63 (42‒95) and 326 (221‒482) for women and 73 (37‒145) and 490 (256‒935) for men. For women and men above 65 years, absolute risks of primary hyperparathyroidism were 7.9% and 3.3% in those with moderately high plasma ionized calcium, and 44% and 21% in those with high plasma ionized calcium.

- **Conclusions**: High ionized calcium is found in 1:40 in the general population, suggesting a notable prevalence of elevated levels.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, typically identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium and taking a thorough history to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of malabsorption syndrome. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and supplemented if necessary. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: An update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy; a limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Given the available data and the overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured.

In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both.

More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT, the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, and the risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Evaluation of the thiazide challenge test to differentiate primary from hypercalciuria-related hyperparathyroidism [^111bxVg2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to idiopathic hypercalciuria (SHPT-IH) is markedly different. Robust diagnostic tools to differentiate between both entities are, however, lacking.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the thiazide challenge test (TCT) in clinical practice, its aid in clinical decision-making, and to assess the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and potentially useful parameters of the TCT.

Methods involve a monocentric observational retrospective cohort study conducted from January 2017 to November 2023 in an outpatient Endocrinology department at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium. Twenty-five adult patients with hypercalciuria, elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), and high-normal or elevated serum calcium underwent a TCT. Outcome measures included serum and urinary biochemical parameters before and after testing, as well as clinical and imaging outcomes, treatment, and follow-up.

Results indicate that patients with a TCT-based working diagnosis of PHPT show greater increases in albumin-adjusted calcium and total serum calcium concentration than patients with SHPT-IH (+0.11 ± 0.10 vs +0.0071 ± 0.10 mmol/L, P = 0.025 and +0.14 ± 0.12 vs +0.012 ± 0.15 mmol/L, P = 0.024, respectively). The TCT-based working diagnosis of PHPT achieves a sensitivity of 81.8%, a specificity of 77.8%, and a likelihood ratio of 3.68 for estimating a correct final diagnosis. Urinary calcium excretion, PTH, calcium-phosphorous ratio, PTH inhibition rate, and the parathyroid function index do not differ significantly in patients with PHPT compared with those with SHPT-IH.

In conclusion, the TCT aids in distinguishing between PHPT and SHPT-IH, supporting its utility in clinical decision-making processes.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116DmzkM]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

The source of the increase in serum Ca²⁺ varies depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In mild-to-moderate disease, both an increase in bone resorption and postprandial calcitriol-mediated intestinal calcium hyperabsorption contribute to the hypercalcemia. Intestinal calcium transport, which largely takes place in the proximal intestine, occurs by both transcellular and paracellular pathways. The transcellular pathway is a tightly regulated pathway and is increased by 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D. The paracellular pathway can also be regulated by modulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin 2 and claudin 12. Expression of both claudins is increased by 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D, thereby augmenting paracellular calcium transport. The increase in distal tubular calcium reabsorption plays a greater role in sustaining the hypercalcemia than intestinal calcium absorption.

In the typical patient with mild to moderate PHPT, plasma calcium and PTH levels can remain stable for years, and when the hypercalcemia is mild (i.e. less than 11.0 mg/dL [2.75 mmol/L]), patients often have relatively few symptoms. When the hypercalcemia is more severe, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, muscle weakness, and impaired mentation can occur. Rarely, a patient may experience sudden worsening of PHPT, known as parathyroid storm or acute hyperparathyroidism. Although PTH lowers the renal phosphate threshold, frank hypophosphatemia is uncommon in most cases of PHPT. Low-normal phosphate values are commonly seen in PHPT, although it is not as reliable a finding as hypercalcemia.

### Parathyroid disorders [^111ct6Gh]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems. Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms, serum calcium and creatinine levels, and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol) replacement.

### Testing for primary hyperparathyroidism in 17,491 patients with hypercalcemia [^112jCwYy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). High credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is underdiagnosed and associated with many adverse health effects. Historically, many hypercalcemic patients have not received parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing; however, underlying reasons are uncertain. Our goals are to determine the PTH testing rate among hypercalcemic individuals at a large academic health system and to assess characteristics associated with testing versus not testing for PHPT to inform future strategies for closing testing gaps.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included adult patients with ≥ 1 elevated serum calcium result between 2018 and 2022. Based on the presence or absence of a serum PTH result, individuals were classified as "screened" versus "unscreened" for PHPT. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups were compared.

- **Results**: The sample comprised 17,491 patients: 6567 male (37.5%) and 10,924 female (62.5%), with a mean age of 59 years. PTH testing was performed in 6096 (34.9%). Characteristics independently associated with the greatest odds of screening included having 5+ elevated calcium results (odds ratio [OR] 5.02, P < 0.0001), serum calcium > 12.0 mg/dL (OR 2.48, P < 0.0001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.42, P < 0.0001). Characteristics associated with the lowest odds of screening were age < 35 years (OR 0.60, P < 0.0001), death during the study period (OR 0.68, P < 0.0001), age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.70, P = 0.0007), and depression (OR 0.84, P = 0.0081).

- **Conclusions**: Only 35% of hypercalcemic patients received PTH testing, indicating a significant gap in addressing PHPT-associated morbidity.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

- **Conclusions**: Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts and strategies for treatment and management.

### Hypercalcemia in the ED: Prevalence, etiology, and outcome [^114kKjXg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics, and etiologies of hypercalcemia in emergency department patients.

In this retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study, all patients admitted between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2011, to the emergency department of Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, were screened for the presence of hypercalcemia, defined as a serum calcium exceeding 2.55 mmol/L after correction for serum albumin. Demographic, laboratory, and outcome data were gathered. A detailed medical record review was performed to identify causes of hypercalcemia.

During the study period, 14,984 patients (19% of all admitted patients) received a measurement of serum calcium. Of these, 116 patients (0.7%) presented with hypercalcemia. Median serum calcium was 2.72 mmol/L (first quartile, 2.64; third quartile, 2.88), with 4.3 mmol/L being the maximum serum calcium value observed. Underlying malignancy in 44% of patients and hyperparathyroidism in 20% (12% secondary and 8% primary) were the leading causes of hypercalcemia. Twenty-six percent of patients presented with symptomatic hypercalcemia. Weakness was the most common symptom of hypercalcemia, followed by nausea and disorientation.

Hypercalcemia is a rare but harmful electrolyte disorder in emergency department patients. Unspecific symptoms such as a change in mental state, weakness, or gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt physicians to order serum calcium measurements, at least in patients with suspected hypercalcemia.

### Imaging features of hypercalcemia: A primer for emergency radiologists [^112iS33U]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a marker for a wide variety of underlying etiologies, and its presentation in the emergency setting may be asymptomatic, incidental, or a primary complaint with associated symptoms and physical exam findings. While the workup is initially driven through serum laboratory testing, imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up. This review covers multiple common and uncommon etiologies of hypercalcemia, details their underlying mechanisms, and identifies the most important associated imaging findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these etiologies and imaging findings, particularly in the emergency setting, since hypercalcemia may represent the only significant laboratory abnormality associated with the presenting condition. Furthermore, the radiologist's interpretation of a study may be directly influenced by knowing about a patient's hypercalcemia.

- **Fracture risk**: low trauma fracture.
- **Kidney health**: kidney stone.
- **Bone mineral density**: significant reduction in bone mineral density to a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site.
- **Kidney function**: significant reduction in CrCl.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage that progresses over time. Some patients with biochemically mild pHPT will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, yet there is no current method to predict which patients will benefit from surgery. Therefore, evaluating every indication for treatment is important, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia, although bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group of 52 patients with pHPT, who initially did not meet indications for treatment, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery normalized serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, as well as self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these findings, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of potential organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery. For those not meeting treatment indications, regular checks of serum calcium and monitoring for organ damage development should be provided.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

- **Methods**: The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

- **Results**: The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism — the skeleton and the kidneys — continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for, or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet these guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

- **Conclusions**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may deteriorate from a chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition known as hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause; humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms characterizing the crisis include oliguria and anuria, as well as somnolence and coma.

Once a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program must be followed either to confirm or exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. If primary hyperparathyroidism is confirmed, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid a fatal outcome. This diagnostic program should be conducted within hours, and during this time, serum calcium levels should be lowered. The treatment of choice is hemodialysis with a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates could be useful as adjuvant drugs.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically concerning follow-up without surgery, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining the following in the monitoring of patients who do not undergo parathyroidectomy:

- **Blood tests**: Serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D annually. Consider measuring PTH levels as clinically indicated.

- **Skeletal**: DEXA at three sites every 1 or 2 years unless bone mineral density is normal. Vertebral X-ray, vertebral fracture assessment, or trabecular bone score if clinically indicated.

- **Renal**: CrCl annually, as it is preferred over eGFR. Abdominal imaging, such as X-ray, CT, or ultrasound, if clinically indicated. A 24-hour urine test for calcium if clinically indicated.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, contributing to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild pHPT. However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms; a large portion of patients with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms if these are properly searched for. It is still unclear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcaemia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid, and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured — defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH — after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, medications, and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^113gWFLf]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data were collected from 92 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism identified in a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. This data collection took place during 2014, and all patients had been referred to or primarily managed by a specialist.

- **Comparison of patient groups and laboratory values**: Median laboratory values were compared between two groups of patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). These patients were identified in a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. The comparison was between patients who had been assessed by a specialist and those who had not been evaluated. The test of significance used was the Mann–Whitney U test.

Of the 82 patients not assessed by a specialist, a survey was conducted to investigate previous medication use, comorbidities, and body mass index. From this survey, 12 patients were identified and excluded due to medication use (thiazides, calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates) that could potentially influence serum calcium and PTH levels. Additionally, seven patients with a BMI ≥ 30 were excluded. Two individuals had passed away, and four cases were considered too severely ill with multiple diseases to be suitable for treatment or further investigation of their hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, three patients declined further participation, four patients did not reply to the invitation, and three patients had relocated to other parts of the country and were lost to follow-up. Another two patients had been diagnosed with pHPT and were consequently cared for. All these cases were excluded from the study cohort.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines and can present a challenge in diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high-volume centers.

### Rapid fire: Hypercalcemia [^116M4fpB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The two most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, the acuity of treatment will depend on the severity of calcium level and symptoms.

In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.
