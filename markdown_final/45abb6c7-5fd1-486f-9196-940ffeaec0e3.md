## Question

Is antifungal required after intraabdominal surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antifungal therapy is required after intra-abdominal surgery, in which patients it should be considered, and how to select an appropriate antifungal agent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification after intra-abdominal surgery. Then, I should distinguish prophylaxis from empiric therapy and from definitive treatment. Next, I will review the highest-quality guidelines and pivotal trials to anchor recommendations. After that, I should verify the role of diagnostics, including cultures and biomarkers like β-D-glucan. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach and state the bottom line clearly with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification, because not all postoperative patients have the same risk of invasive candidiasis. High-risk features include recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leak, recurrent gastrointestinal perforation, severe sepsis or septic shock, prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, Candida colonization, and ICU admission; critically ill patients with healthcare-associated infections and upper GI sources are particularly vulnerable, and mortality is high when source control is delayed or antifungal therapy is inappropriate [^117Vk1G7] [^117AXKZo] [^111QXTCt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about giving antifungals to everyone after abdominal surgery. I need to distinguish prophylaxis from empiric therapy and definitive treatment. Prophylaxis aims to prevent infection in very high-risk subgroups, empiric therapy treats suspected infection before microbiologic confirmation, and definitive therapy treats proven infection once cultures or biomarkers return; guidelines consistently advise against routine empiric antifungals for most patients, reserving therapy for those with significant risk factors and clinical deterioration despite adequate bacterial coverage [^117Vk1G7] [^115QAVWb] [^116CcfQq].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality guidance. The 2016 IDSA candidiasis guideline recommends considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors such as recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leak, or necrotizing pancreatitis, and it emphasizes source control as foundational therapy. The 2024 Surgical Infection Society update recommends against empiric antifungals in lower-risk patients and supports echinocandins for severely ill patients at risk for Candida. The 2025 ECMM/ISHAM/ASM global guideline recommends fluconazole prophylaxis for patients with recent abdominal surgery and recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leaks, with consideration of echinocandin prophylaxis if there was recent azole exposure or local epidemiology favors azole resistance [^117Vk1G7] [^115QAVWb] [^112wUjCq] [^117MkJFa] [^116wL56t].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized evidence to ensure these recommendations are evidence-based. The INTENSE trial tested preemptive micafungin versus placebo in high-risk surgical ICU patients after intra-abdominal infection surgery and found no reduction in invasive candidiasis, suggesting that broad preemptive echinocandin use in heterogeneous surgical ICU populations is not beneficial; by contrast, older and smaller studies in highly selected subgroups such as recurrent GI perforation or anastomotic leak suggested potential benefit from fluconazole prophylaxis, which aligns with the 2025 global guidance recommending prophylaxis in that narrow subgroup [^1163dVd4] [^117CyECS] [^117MkJFa].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach because treatment decisions hinge on distinguishing colonization from infection. Candida isolated from normally sterile intra-abdominal specimens obtained operatively or from drains placed within 24 hours, in the right clinical context, supports intra-abdominal candidiasis and warrants treatment; superficial wound swabs or long-standing drains are not reliable. Biomarkers like β-D-glucan can help risk stratify, but specificity is limited and postoperative elevations after open gut surgery can yield false positives, so I should interpret a positive β-D-glucan cautiously and integrate it with cultures and clinical course; nonetheless, in high-risk surgical cohorts, serial β-D-glucan has shown promise for anticipating IAC and guiding earlier therapy, though stewardship guardrails are essential to avoid overtreatment [^117FTPdc] [^117MkJFa].

> Let me think about empiric therapy choices and timing, because delays worsen outcomes in sepsis. In critically ill patients with risk factors and clinical deterioration, an echinocandin is preferred empirically due to activity against fluconazole-resistant non-albicans species and favorable PK in sepsis; fluconazole may be reasonable in hemodynamically stable, non-critically ill patients without recent azole exposure when local epidemiology suggests low resistance risk. I should confirm that source control with drainage or debridement is pursued urgently, as appropriate antifungal therapy plus source control independently reduce 30-day mortality in surgical IAC [^117Vk1G7] [^111E9BWy] [^117AXKZo].

> I should double-check pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations because underdosing is common in critical illness. Echinocandins are hydrophilic and exhibit variable peritoneal penetration, and standard doses may be insufficient at the site of infection in some critically ill patients; emerging PK/PD data suggest suboptimal peritoneal exposure with standard echinocandin dosing in a subset, reinforcing the need for early source control, attention to loading doses, and consideration of TDM where available, while acknowledging that definitive clinical PK/PD targets for IAC remain to be validated [^114GkMvQ] [^115Yt4wm] [^111iwPto].

> But wait, what if I overgeneralize prophylaxis to all postoperative patients; I need to ensure we avoid unnecessary antifungal exposure. Fluconazole prophylaxis in broader surgical ICU populations has been associated with a shift toward non-albicans species, particularly C. glabrata, raising concerns about selection pressure and breakthrough infections, which is why guidelines restrict prophylaxis to narrowly defined high-risk scenarios and prefer echinocandins when prophylaxis is used in patients with recent azole exposure or in settings with high azole resistance [^115aw2mC] [^112iKSEY] [^116wL56t].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most patients after intra-abdominal surgery, antifungals are not required. Monitor clinically and obtain appropriate cultures if infection is suspected. Consider empiric antifungal therapy when there is clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection plus significant risk factors such as recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leak, septic shock, or failure to improve on appropriate antibacterial therapy, using an echinocandin in critically ill patients and fluconazole only in carefully selected, stable patients without recent azole exposure. Provide prophylaxis only for the highest-risk subgroup with recent abdominal surgery and recurrent GI perforation or anastomotic leak, favoring fluconazole per the 2025 global guideline or an echinocandin if there was recent azole exposure or local resistance patterns warrant it. Always prioritize timely source control, reassess daily, and de-escalate or stop antifungals when cultures and clinical response do not support Candida infection [^117Vk1G7] [^117MkJFa] [^115QAVWb].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the answer clearly. Antifungal therapy is not routinely required after intra-abdominal surgery; it should be reserved for patients with clinical evidence of infection and significant risk factors, with echinocandins preferred in critically ill or high-risk patients, and prophylaxis limited to the narrow subgroup with recent abdominal surgery and recurrent GI perforation or anastomotic leak. Adequate source control and early, appropriate antifungal therapy when indicated are the key drivers of improved outcomes, and stewardship is essential to minimize overtreatment and resistance [^117Vk1G7] [^117MkJFa] [^117AXKZo].

---

Routine antifungal therapy is **not recommended after routine intra-abdominal surgery** [^115QAVWb]. Antifungals should be reserved for patients with **high-risk features** such as septic shock, anastomotic leak, recurrent GI perforation, severe pancreatitis, or heavy Candida colonization [^117Vk1G7] [^117MkJFa]. For these high-risk patients, **echinocandins are first-line** (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin) [^111E9BWy]; fluconazole is an alternative if the patient is stable and there is no prior azole exposure or resistance risk [^112yB5i7]. Duration is guided by clinical response and adequacy of source control, typically 7–14 days [^notfound]. Routine prophylaxis is not advised due to resistance risk and lack of benefit [^115aw2mC].

## Indications for antifungal therapy after intra-abdominal surgery

Antifungal therapy is **not routinely indicated** after intra-abdominal surgery; it should be reserved for specific high-risk scenarios:

- **Septic shock or multiple organ failure**: Especially with hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections (HA-IAI) or recent abdominal surgery/anastomotic leak [^116CcfQq] [^117Vk1G7].

- **Recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leaks**: Particularly with heavy Candida colonization or prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics [^117Vk1G7] [^113MmtHS].

- **Severe necrotizing pancreatitis**: With clinical deterioration or persistent infection despite bacterial therapy [^117Vk1G7] [^116CcfQq].

- **Heavy Candida colonization**: Multiple sites colonization or high Candida colonization index [^113MmtHS] [^113pSQ4F].

---

## Recommended antifungal agents

When antifungal therapy is indicated, **agent selection** depends on illness severity, prior azole exposure, and local epidemiology:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antifungal agent** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Severely ill patients (septic shock, ICU) | Echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin) | - Broad-spectrum activity <br/> - Including fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. <br/> - Preferred in critically ill patients [^111E9BWy] [^112yB5i7] |
| Stable patients without prior azole exposure | Fluconazole | - Effective against susceptible Candida spp. <br/> - Lower toxicity <br/> - Oral bioavailability [^112yB5i7] [^111eYQ1Q] |
| Fluconazole-resistant or non-albicans species | Echinocandins or voriconazole | - Coverage of resistant species <br/> - Including C. glabrata and C. krusei [^111E9BWy] [^112yB5i7] |

---

## Duration of antifungal therapy

Duration is **guided by clinical response and adequacy of source control** [^113d1v8V]. Typical durations include 7–14 days for most intra-abdominal candidiasis cases with adequate source control and clinical improvement, and 10–14 days or longer for severe infections, inadequate source control, or immunocompromised hosts, with therapy individualized to clinical response.

---

## Risks and benefits of antifungal therapy

Benefits include **reduced mortality and improved outcomes in high-risk patients** with invasive intra-abdominal candidiasis, particularly when combined with adequate source control [^117AXKZo]. Risks include **antifungal resistance** — particularly with fluconazole prophylaxis — adverse drug reactions, and increased healthcare costs; routine prophylaxis is not recommended due to resistance risk and lack of proven benefit [^115aw2mC] [^1161Jdmv] [^111iG6QT] [^115SghKN].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **selective antifungal use**:

- **IDSA 2016**: Empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors (recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, necrotizing pancreatitis) [^117Vk1G7].

- **SIS 2017**: Echinocandins for severely ill patients at risk for Candida; fluconazole for less severely ill patients or susceptible Candida spp [^111E9BWy].

- **Italian council 2024**: Empiric antifungal therapy for septic shock or multiple organ failure with hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections, especially with recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak [^116CcfQq].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with antifungal therapy

Appropriate antifungal therapy, particularly with **early source control**, significantly improves outcomes in high-risk patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis [^117AXKZo]. Delays in therapy or inadequate source control are associated with increased mortality and morbidity [^113qT8Lx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antifungal therapy is **not recommended after routine intra-abdominal surgery**. It should be reserved for high-risk patients with septic shock, anastomotic leak, recurrent GI perforation, severe pancreatitis, or heavy Candida colonization. Echinocandins are first-line for severely ill patients; fluconazole is an alternative for stable patients without prior azole exposure. Therapy duration is individualized based on clinical response and source control adequacy.

Purpose Of Review

The clinical spectrum of intra-abdominal fungal infections has not been systematically analyzed in the literature.

Recent Findings

Even though intra-abdominal fungal infections have been recognized with increasing frequency in the recent years, most clinical experience is limited to case reports or uncontrolled case series. These infections are more common than clinically recognized disease. The clinical presentation varies broadly depending on the organism and host's immune status, but it is frequently severe, difficult to treat, and associated with significant morbimortality. Predisposing factors, clinical characteristics, and advances in the management are discussed.

Summary

Intra-abdominal fungal infections are increasingly important in clinical practice. Early recognition and a combined treatment approach, usually consisting of surgical intervention and systemic antifungal therapy, are required for improved outcomes.

Key messages

- 	Prophylactic fluconazole was effective in reducing candidaemia in high-risk surgical patients and was associated with a trend towards a reduction in hospital mortality.

- 	Prophylactic fluconazole was not associated with a significant increase in adverse events or the proportion of patients colonised with or infected with fluconazole-resistant fungi within the time frame of the included studies.

Evidence shows that PCT monitoring can reduce antibiotic duration safely in critically ill patients. Furthermore, PCT can inform the duration of antibiotic therapy in cIAIs, and can be particularly useful for patients with ongoing inflammation, in that decreasing concentrations in the postoperative period can guide the cessation of therapy. Three studies show that a PCT-based algorithm may decrease antibiotic exposure in patients with cIAIs. Huang et al. conducted a prospective study to investigate whether a PCT algorithm could reduce antibiotic therapy duration in patients with cIAIs undergoing surgery. PCT concentrations were evaluated pre-operatively, serially for the first week post-operatively, and subsequently if needed. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued if [PCT] was < 1.0 ng/L or decreased by 80% versus day 1 with resolution of clinical signs. The PCT algorithm significantly reduced antibiotic therapy duration (PCT group, 3.4 days versus 6.1 days in the control group). Maseda et al. published a retrospective study of 121 consecutive critically ill surgical patients (ICU duration > 48 h) treated for cIAI. Treatment duration was reduced by 50% in the PCT group regardless of hemodynamics. Slieker et al. investigated whether PCT could tailor postoperative antibiotic therapy in surgical patients with cIAIs. In a subgroup of patients with GI perforation, duration of antibiotic therapy was 3 days shorter (7 d versus 10 d) in the PCT group.

Individual patient risk for presumed pathogens involved and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance

Accurate patient stratification is crucial to optimize empiric antibiotic therapy in this era of AMR.

Statement 11

Narrow-spectrum antibiotic regimens having activity against typical gram-negative Enterobacterales, gram-positive cocci, and obligate anaerobes should be used to treat patients with community-acquired cIAIs. In this setting, broad-spectrum or additional agents to provide anti-pseudomonal or anti-enterococcal coverage or antifungal therapy should not be used routinely (Low-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Statement 12

For patients with hospital-acquired IAIs, agent(s) with broad-spectrum activity are preferred (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Statement 13

Patients who have received recent broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, had prolonged hospitalizations, underwent multiple invasive interventions, or are known to have been colonized or infected with a resistant gram-negative organism should be considered at risk for infection from a resistant gram-negative pathogen (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Lessons learned from PK/PD studies conducted in critically ill patients with IAC

Table 3 provides a summary of retrieved PK/PD studies which have focused on the use of antifungal during IAC. Details regarding study selection are provided in the Additional file 1 with the ClinPK statement checklist for each included study (Additional file 1: Table S2). Overall, the studies fulfilled more than 80% of PK analysis checklist items (namely, use of valid quantitative bioanalytical methods, description of the PK modelling methods and software used, and adequate detail of the PK analysis performed). The main weakness across all studies was related to patient selection and follow-up from a clinical perspective.

Population consideration

All study investigators acknowledged the small size of their cohorts (between 3 and 31 patients) and highlighted a high inter-subject variability. Moreover, the case-mix of patients was mostly composed of secondary peritonitis, with IAC suspected rather than confirmed in most cases. Thus, the impact of PK/PD target attainment on mortality cannot be addressed due to the small sample sizes and the low number of confirmed cases of IAC. Echinocandin is the most evaluated antifungal class in IAC. Only one case-series addressed the PK of fluconazole in abdominal samples, in a non-ICU population.

Laboratory consideration

In all studies, only the total concentration was measured. However, from a tissue diffusion perspective, the unbound concentration should be assessed in further studies, especially in critically ill patients because of a high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and marked fluctuations in serum albumin concentrations during acute illness. Regarding peritoneal samples, most studies obtained samples from in situ abdominal drains and acknowledged less data compared to blood samples given these drains were usually removed after 72 h post-operatively. Therefore, peritoneal fluid samples obtained intra-operatively would allow for more accurate PK data describing antifungal abdominal diffusion.

Analysis of potential alternatives

Two important facts should make us move forward in response to the challenge that represents with a growing trend, invasive fungal infections: first, the unacceptable high mortality rate despite the compounds available as treatment; and second, the need to preserve the antifungal armamentarium, especially limited compared to the antibacterial one. Lessons learned from the emergence of bacterial resistance due to the incorrect use of antibiotics should guide us to optimise using antifungal compounds. It is a reality that the use of antifungals has increased in recent decades and with it the number of resistant strains. Likewise, there is a trend towards greater isolation of species that are resistant to older antifungals, indicating that non- albicans species find a growing niche. Although far from being common, multidrug-resistant C. auris isolates are increasingly detected worldwide. To avoid worrisome scenarios and to preserve current antifungals until new compounds are available, three actions could be considered.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy for the prevention of invasive candidiasis following gastrointestinal surgery for intra-abdominal infections [^1129X5Vx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgery for intra-abdominal infection are at risk of invasive candidiasis (IC) and candidates for preemptive antifungal therapy.

Methods

This exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed a preemptive antifungal approach with micafungin (100 mg/d) in intensive care unit patients requiring surgery for intra-abdominal infection. Coprimary efficacy variables were the incidence of IC and the time from baseline to first IC in the full analysis set; an independent data review board confirmed IC. An exploratory biomarker analysis was performed using logistic regression.

Results

The full analysis set comprised 124 placebo- and 117 micafungin-treated patients. The incidence of IC was 8.9% for placebo and 11.1% for micafungin (difference, 2.24%; [95% confidence interval, -5.52 to 10.20]). There was no difference between the arms in median time to IC. The estimated odds ratio showed that patients with a positive (1,3)-β-d-glucan (ßDG) result were 3.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–13.29) times more likely to have confirmed IC than those with a negative result.

Conclusions

This study was unable to provide evidence that preemptive administration of an echinocandin was effective in preventing IC in high-risk surgical intensive care unit patients with intra-abdominal infections. This may have been because the drug was administered too late to prevent IC coupled with an overall low number of IC events. It does provide some support for using ßDG to identify patients at high risk of IC.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112yB5i7]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal candidiasis — antifungal management recommendations: We do not recommend routine use of amphotericin B or its lipid formulations for empiric or pathogen-directed treatment of adults and children with intra-abdominal candidiasis (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of fluconazole for pre-emptive management of intra-abdominal infection (IAI) in non-critically ill adults and children who are at high risk for intra-abdominal candidiasis, and for pathogen-directed treatment of non-critically ill patients infected with susceptible strains of C. albicans (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of voriconazole for empiric or pathogen-directed management of IAI in non-critically ill adults and children older than one month who are suspected or proven to be infected with strains of Candida that are not susceptible to fluconazole (Grade 2-B). We recommend an echinocandin (anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin) for empiric or pathogen-directed management of IAI in severely ill adults and children older than one month who are suspected or proven to be infected with Candida spp. (Grade 1-B).

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^113oLcXp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Several meta-analyses of antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk surgical ICU patients have yielded conflicting results.

For the majority of ICU patients at high invasive candidiasis risk, a preemptive antifungal strategy, based on clinical risk factors and microbiologic evidence of substantial colonization, has been proposed.

A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed a preemptive antifungal approach with an echinocandin in intensive care unit patients requiring surgery for intra-abdominal infection.

The study was unable to provide evidence that preemptive administration of an echinocandin was effective in preventing IC in high-risk surgical intensive care unit patients with intra-abdominal infections.

Preferred empiric therapy in critically ill patients or those previously exposed to an azole is an echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose of 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; micafungin:100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose of 200 mg, then 100 mg daily). However, fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, should be still considered first-line antifungal therapy, in hemodynamically stable patients who are colonized with azole susceptible Candida species or who have no prior exposure to azoles.

The duration of therapy should be determined by adequacy of source control and clinical response.

A role for echinocandin in the management of critically ill patients is confirmed by the increasing incidence of fluconazole-resistant and susceptible-dose dependent strains that should be taken into account when selecting empiric therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^113R5Kcw]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

According to the literature, the percentage of reduction in echinocandin concentrations in peritoneum with respect to serum is approximately 33%. Our PK/PD analysis of published data showed that MIC 90 values of echinocandins are lower than breakpoints values except for anidulafungin against C. albicans and C. glabrata. However, these MIC 90 are far above the maximum MIC values covered by concentrations in peritoneal fluid. This implies that the percentage of isolates from sterile sites covered by anidulafungin would be < 10% considering the MIC distribution in a recent worldwide surveillance study. Suboptimal drug concentrations in peritoneal fluid represent a risk for emergence of antifungal resistance in intraabdominal Candida, making of intraabdominal microbiota a reservoir of non-susceptible isolates, as occurs with bacteria. Further studies determining concentrations of antifungals in peritoneal samples as the one planned or the recently published with voriconazole represent the first step to achieve the adequate dosing in this entity. A current opinion in the literature indicates that guidelines should be updated by separating the recommendations for candidemia and abdominal candidiasis with a revision of echinocandin doses and the inclusion of other antifungals such as liposomal amphotericin B. In the meantime, an algorithm is proposed considering, in addition to echinocandins, liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy facing sepsis and candidemia or prior antifungal treatment. To address C. auris, a combination therapy of liposomal amphotericin B and echinocandin is proposed. Once species and fungogram are known, antifungal stewardship is warranted to preserve as much as possible available antifungals.

In conclusion, while current guidelines provide valuable recommendations for the management of IAC, the evidence supporting these therapeutic approaches remains limited. To enhance patient care and optimise treatment outcomes, there is a critical need for more robust clinical trials, studies examining patient heterogeneity and surveillance of antifungal resistance. Such evidence will help refine the existing guidelines and contribute to a more personalised and effective approach in treating this serious medical condition. Investing in research and fostering collaborations among healthcare professionals and researchers can improve our understanding of IAC and advance the field of antifungal therapy for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Despite advances in diagnosis, surgery, and antimicrobial therapy, mortality rates associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections remain exceedingly high.

The effect of fungal involvement in IAI

Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis:
recent abdominal surgery;
anastomotic leaks;
necrotizing pancreatitis; and
failure of treatment for bacterial infections.

The epidemiological role of Candida spp. in IAI has not yet been conclusively defined. However, recent data suggest that some specific subpopulations are at higher risk of fungal involvement, (i.e. complicated cases of bariatric surgery). In a recent study, Zappella et al. reported 41% of candida-positive patients with postoperative peritonitis following bariatric surgery. Isolation of Candida spp. in samples from IAI is associated with poor outcomes. In an observational study, Montravers et al. showed that isolation of Candida spp. was an independent risk factor of mortality in nosocomial peritonitis patients (odds ratio, 3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–6.7, p < 0.001). Antifungal treatment did not improve survival. Recently, IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were developed and explicitly addressed candidal peritonitis. Clinical evidence supporting the use of antifungal therapy for patients with suspected intra-abdominal invasive candidiasis is limited. Most studies are small and uncontrolled, single-center, or performed in specific patient cohorts. IDSA guidelines suggested considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including those with recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^115SghKN]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Antifungal agents for health care–associated intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) due to Candida spp. most commonly include amphotericin B and its formulations, azoles (fluconazole, voriconazole), and echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin). Randomized controlled trials have enrolled primarily patients with candidemia with limited numbers of candidal IAI, and use of amphotericin B has fallen into disfavor because of toxicity. Two RCTs published since 2000 reported lower success rates in small numbers of adult patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis treated with amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B versus caspofungin or micafungin, and in a previously reviewed study, success rates in treating confirmed candidal IAI appeared higher with amphotericin B than with fluconazole, although only very small numbers of patients received either agent.

### Surgical pathology and the diagnosis of invasive visceral yeast infection: two case reports and literature review [^1148Nzdk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Invasive mycoses are important healthcare-associated infections, and have become an increasingly frequent problem in immunocompromised and severely ill patients. Medical progress, which has resulted in a growing number of invasive procedures, new dimensions in aggressive immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments and widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, is the main catalyst for this development.

Invasive fungal infections, Candida species in particular, are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality in critically-ill patients, particularly those who have recently undergone extensive gastro-abdominal surgery.

Several studies conducted over the last two decades have shown that gastrointestinal surgeries are associated with an increased risk of fungemia, and patients admitted to surgical intensive care units (ICUs) are considered to have a greater risk of developing it.

Candida spp. are the main fungal strains of gut flora. Gastrointestinal tract surgery might lead to mucosal disruption and cause Candida spp. to disseminate through the bloodstream.

Lastly, despite a strong index of suspicion in high-risk subjects such as patients who require surgical re-intervention, and international guidelines on the use of antifungal prophylaxis, the incidence and severity of candidiasis in post-surgical patients appears significant. Moreover, isolated species show virulence factors and exhibit varying levels of susceptibility to antifungal drugs.

In the present study, we report two cases of Candida albicans infection identified in abdominal specimens from patients who had undergone gastro-abdominal surgery.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^114TZS2e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 16

For adults with sepsis (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) or shock due to hospital-acquired cIAIs, empiric antifungal therapy for Candida spp. should be considered, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or gastrointestinal anastomotic leak. Empiric antifungal therapy may be considered for high-risk patients with community-acquired infections (Low-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Intra-abdominal candidiasis is a rare but serious infection with a high mortality rate, especially of critically ill patients. The most common risk factors are GI perforation, anastomotic leak, and previous exposure to antifungal or antibacterial agents. The challenge of intra-abdominal candidiasis is related partly to the diagnostic difficulty of differentiating between contamination and infection when Candida spp. is isolated. Invasive intra-abdominal candidiasis (as opposed to contamination) requires aggressive antifungal treatment, even though adequate source control is the most important factor in improving outcomes of these patients. Unfortunately, early diagnosis of intra-abdominal candidiasis remains a challenge. Numerous risk factors for intra-abdominal candidiasis have been identified. Some clinical prediction rules were developed and validated to identify ICU patients at high risk of intra-abdominal candidiasis. In 2006, a Spanish group, using the database of the Estudio de Prevalencia de CANdidiasis project, proposed the "Candida score" to identify patients with high risk of intra-abdominal candidiasis; this score was calculated as 1 × (total parenteral nutrition) + 1 × (surgery) + 1 × (multifocal Candida colonization) + 2 × (severe sepsis).

Source control

The first stage of open abdomen procedure in managing abdominal sepsis is an adequate and prompt source control. The primary objectives of surgical intervention include:
determining the cause of peritonitis;
draining fluid collections;
controlling the origin of the abdominal sepsis.

Once an OA strategy is decided, the optimal method chosen for laparostomy should allow an easy re-entry to the abdominal cavity, and allow for expansion in order to prevent ACS.

Resuscitation and antimicrobial therapy

The second stage of open abdomen procedures involves resuscitation, which should include fluid administration, vasopressive agents and adequate antimicrobial therapy.

Aggressive hemodynamic support can limit sepsis-induced tissue damage and prevent the over stimulation of endothelial activity. Current Surviving Sepsis guidelines emphasize the importance of traditional mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg, central venous pressure (CVP) of 8–12 mmHg in combination with a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) > 70% and Urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/h.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with severe sepsis with or without septic shock. An inadequate antimicrobial regimen is associated with unfavorable outcomes in critical ill patients. For these patients, a de-escalated approach may be the most appropriate strategy. A broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimen should be started in the initial stages of treatment. Subsequent modification (de-escalation) of the initial regimen becomes possible later, when culture results are available and clinical status can be better assessed. This is usually achieved 48–72 h after initiation of empiric therapy.

Antimicrobial therapy should be reassessed daily, because the pathophysiological changes may significantly affect antibiotics pharmacokinetics in the critically ill patients.

In these patients Candida species infection may be clinically significant and is usually associated with poor prognosis. Although appropriate antifungal therapy is essential for controlling invasive Candida infections and improving outcome, early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis remains a challenge because criteria for starting empirical antifungal therapy in critically ill patients are poorly defined.

Antifungal empirical treatment depends on the identification of patients at increased risk for invasive candidiasis such as patients with candida colonization and on the positive predictive value of risk assessment strategies, such as the colonization index, candida score, and predictive rules based on combinations of risk factors.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^1161Jdmv]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients, the use of prophylactic fluconazole is associated with a reduced incidence of candidaemia but with only a trend towards reduction in hospital mortality. A large randomised controlled trial would be needed to assess the cost-effectiveness and the risk of inducing fluconazole-resistant fungi before prophylactic fluconazole can be recommended in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients.

Introduction

Yeast colonisation is quite common in intensive care unit (ICU) populations. Up to 73% of patients have been reported to be colonised by yeast, predominantly by Candida albicans. Candida species are among the most commonly isolated microorganisms from the abdomen and urine in surgical patients with infections.

The development of fungal/yeast infections is a rapidly increasing health problem, especially in hospitalized patients and in patients with impaired host defences. In 1995, yeast was reported to be the fourth most common ICU-acquired infection in Europe, where it represented approximately 17% of all isolates. This percentage may be even higher now, although more recent data are lacking. Particularly in patients with peritonitis, Candida frequently can be cultured from the abdomen, with prevalences as high as 30% to 40%. Systemic yeast infections are associated with high mortality, often more than 50%, with C. albicans as the predominant species responsible. Systemic fungal/yeast infections have become more common over the past two decades. Candida is the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the US, accounting for up to 11% of all infections. As early as the 1980s, an increase in surgical yeast infections from 2.5/1,000 discharges to 5.6/1,000 discharges was observed. The incidence of candidemia increased to 9.8/1,000 ICU admissions among postoperative ICU patients in 1999. In another study, the incidence increased from 1.25/10,000 in 1999 to 3.06/10,000 patient-days per year in 2003. Invasive yeast infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and the cost of bloodstream Candida infection alone is already approaching $1 billion per year in the US.

### Operative management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery in the emergency setting: the OBA guidelines [^113EAsKE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations/5

We recommend administering early empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy in patients presenting with intra-abdominal infections, in addiction to adequate source control. After surgical management, short-term antimicrobial therapy is preferred even in critically ill patients (Strong recommendation based on moderate quality of evidence 1B).

We suggest administering antifungal therapy in frail, immunocompromised patients, presenting with biological and clinical signs of sepsis, and if fungal organisms are isolated in the intraperitoneal fluid (Weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence 2C).

Discussion of evidence

Severe intra-abdominal infections (IAI) could complicate bariatric procedures, due to peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses formation. In addition, cases of IAI are often classified as uncomplicated or complicated. "Complicated" describes extension of infection from their source into the peritoneal cavity.

An easier system classifies intra-abdominal infections according to their acquisition setting in community-acquired, healthcare-associated or early onset hospital-acquired, or late-onset hospital-acquired; the presence of anatomical disruption (either absent or present resulting in localized or diffuse peritonitis), and severity of disease expression (infection, sepsis, or septic shock). This classification defines different phenotypes of the same disease by covering aspects of (i) the extent of intra-abdominal contamination reflecting the complexity of source control, (ii) the level of associated organ disfunction/failure indicating sense of urgency and prognosis, and (iii) likelihood of the presence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms or otherwise important pathogens which may require broader antimicrobial coverage (enterococci, Candida spp.).

### Operative management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery in the emergency setting: the OBA guidelines [^113qMSD3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The STOP-IT study showed that obesity is not associated with antimicrobial treatment failure among patients with IAIs. This suggests that obesity may not independently influence the need for longer duration of antimicrobial therapy in treatment of IAI compared to non-obese patients.

The empiric implementation of antifungal therapy in marginal ulcer (ulceration located on the jejunal side of the anastomosis) or stomal ulcer (ulceration on the gastric side) is not supported by the literature in a community-acquired IAI.

The current evidence (one randomized multicenter trial evaluating outcomes for patients with intra-abdominal perforations, including perforated peptic ulcer; one single-center prospective series and three retrospective studies) comparing outcomes in patients with perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) treated with or without empiric antifungal therapy did not showed efficacy of antifungal agents in improving outcomes. Therefore, the routine empiric use of antifungal therapy in non-critically ill or non-immunocompromised patients presenting with gastrointestinal perforation should not be routinely recommended.

Fungal isolates from peritoneal fluid sampling in patients with PPU are not uncommon.

A retrospective study including 133 patients suffering community-acquired PPU-associated peritonitis with Candida species isolated from their peritoneal fluid showed that antifungal therapies do not improve outcomes, but it could be reserved for patients who are critically ill and/or severely immunocompromised.

Kwan et al. in a single-center retrospective study including adult patients with perforated gastric and duodenal ulcers over a 10-year period showed that old age (median age, 64; IQR 53–74) is a predictor of fungal growth (p < 0.001) but that fungal growth is not a predictor of adverse perioperative outcomes.

In addition, critically ill patients with IAI involving fungal organisms randomized to a shorter course of antimicrobial therapy had no difference in the rate of treatment failure. These results suggest that the presence of fungi in IAI may not independently indicate the need for longer course of antimicrobial therapy.

Q.6: HOW CAN WE DECREASE THE RISK OF THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS IN SURGICAL PATIENTS WITH A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF BARIATRIC PROCEDURES AFTER EMERGENCY SURGERY?

Statement 6.1

All patients needing an urgent surgical procedure should be risk stratified for venous thromboembolism (QoE: moderate).

Statement 6.2

In the emergency setting, venous thromboembolism pharmacologic prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible, if there are no signs of active bleeding, to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (QoE: moderate).

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^117TMkkP]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society revised IAI guidelines — antifungal therapy and risk identification: Identify patients with HA-IAI because of upper gastrointestinal perforations, recurrent bowel perforations, surgically treated pancreatitis, prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, or heavy Candida colonization as being at increased risk for infection from Candida spp. (Grade 2-B), and consider patients found to have yeast from a smear of peritoneal fluid or tissue as having infection with Candida spp. (Grade 2-B). Use an echinocandin (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin) for empiric therapy of severely ill patients at risk for infection with Candida spp. (Grade 1-B), and consider use of fluconazole for antifungal therapy of less severely ill patients at risk for infection with Candida spp. (Grade 2-B).

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^115aw2mC]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Controversy remains regarding antifungal prophylaxis among intra-abdominal surgery patients. Research efforts to resolve these questions are impeded by the need for large sample sizes to demonstrate adjusted differences in clinical outcomes. Changing Candida epidemiology further complicates research and renders some prior studies obsolete. While shown effectively to decrease the incidence of fungal infection in high-risk, critically ill surgical patients, fluconazole prophylaxis does not appear to improve their survival. These studies indicate that the benefit to the patient of the decision to use prophylaxis may not exceed the risk of driving the escalation of resistance to existing antifungal treatments. Our data indicate that although only a small proportion of this surgical population received prophylaxis, their risk of a resistant candidal species was high.

While earlier studies reported that non- C. albicans species accounted for one-half or fewer of isolated organisms, later research uncovered an increase in cases of candidemia involving non- C. albicans. We observed a similarly increased proportion of non- C. albicans isolates, most pronounced among patients receiving prophylaxis with fluconazole. This switch in species is concerning, since non- C. albicans species, and in particular C. glabrata, exhibit greater resistance to fluconazole and are associated with worse outcomes when compared with C. albicans.

The association of increasingly resistant candidal species causing candidemia and their associated worsened outcomes may be explained by the difficulty of targeting initial empiric therapy amidst the shifting landscape of antifungal susceptibility. Many studies in both candidemia and other serious infections have noted a significant and clinically important rise in the risk of death when the patient does not receive prompt empiric treatment with an agent that covers the culprit pathogen. Guidelines for patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections recommend antifungal prophylaxis for healthcare-associated infection and those with severe community-acquired infection, leading with fluconazole. An echinocandin is recommended as initial therapy for critically ill patients, although no guidance is provided with respect to recent fluconazole prophylaxis. The Infectious Disease Society of America Expert Panel favors echinocandins for treating suspected invasive candidiasis in non-neutropenic patients who are moderately or severely ill or had recent azole exposure. Guidelines recommend antifungal agents based on the Candida isolate or suspected isolate, but delaying appropriate selection until culture results are available or until the patient is critically ill may be too late.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^115hWEsd]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) empiric therapy in higher-risk patients — this guideline recommends use of empiric anti-enterococcal and antifungal therapy in many such patients and recommends empiric agents with broader-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. It cautions that overuse of broad-spectrum agents may lead to even greater resistance problems. It further states that whether broader-spectrum empiric therapy (including anti-enterococcal, anti-MRSA, and antifungal agents) improves outcomes in severely ill patients should be evaluated prospectively, and that RCTs of new agents active against resistant microorganisms should include adequate numbers of severely ill patients.

### Updated guideline on diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal… [^112BHugS]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Therapy Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as intra-abdominal infection is diagnosed or suspected. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible in patients with septic shock. Those who do not have septic shock should begin antimicrobial therapy in the emergency department. Adequate drug levels should be maintained during the source control procedure, which may necessitate additional administration of antimicrobials. Table 1). A combination of aztreonam and metronidazole is an alternative, but the addition of an agent effective against gram-positive cocci is recommended. The routine use of aminoglycosides is not recommended unless there is evidence that the patient harbors resistant organisms. The use of agents effective against methicillin-resistant. ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY Antifungal therapy for patients with severe community-acquired or health care–associated infection is recommended if.

Candida is isolated from intra-abdominal cultures. If Candida albicans is isolated, fluconazole is an appropriate treatment option. For fluconazole-resistant Candida species, an echinocandin is appropriate. In newborns, empiric antifungal therapy should be initiated if Candida is suspected. An echinocandin should be the initial treatment in critically ill patients. Amphotericin B is not recommended as initial therapy because of its toxicity. ANTI-ENTEROCOCCAL THERAPY Antimicrobial therapy for enterococci should be given when enterococci are recovered from patients with health care–associated infection. Empiric anti-enterococcal therapy is recommended in patients with health care–associated intra-abdominal infection, particularly those with postoperative infection; in patients who have previously taken cephalosporins or other antimicrobial agents selecting for.

Antimicrobial therapy with agents effective against facultative and aerobic gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms should be initiated in all patients diagnosed with appendicitis. In patients with suspected appendicitis who have equivocal imaging findings, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated in combination with pain medication and antipyretics, if indicated. Antimicrobial therapy should continue for at least three days in adults, until clinical symptoms and signs of infection resolve or a definitive diagnosis is made.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115mY5nG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Candida species are frequent colonizers of mucosal and cutaneous surfaces of healthy individuals; however, when there is breakdown of mechanical or immunologic defenses, invasion can occur. This may manifest as deep-seated IC and/or candidemia, and the latter can lead to metastatic complications, including but not limited to endophthalmitis, bone and joint infections, endovascular infections, and hepatosplenic abscesses. In critically ill patients, the incidence of candidemia varies from 3.5 to 16.5 episodes per 1,000 ICU admissions; however, the incidence of deep-seated IC without concomitant candidemia is less clear because of challenges associated with confirming the diagnosis. Outcomes associated with IC are poor with a crude mortality of 40–55%. Host risk factors for IC in critically ill patients include diabetes, systemic immunosuppression, organ failure, total parenteral nutrition, malignancy, Candida colonization, and genetic polymorphisms. Clinical risk factors encompass breaches in barrier of defense because of surgery, loss of mucosal integrity (e.g. of an abdominal viscus), burns, indwelling vascular access catheters, and hemodialysis.

Candida colonization logically precedes infection, and in critically ill patients, the presence and density of Candida colonization is predictive of development of IC. Deep-seated IC, particularly intraabdominal IC, occurs in critically ill patients and, because of limitations of available diagnostics, is likely underdiagnosed. Nonetheless, IC complicates a minority of ICU admissions. The use of antifungal therapy in the ICU, whether as prophylaxis or empiric therapy, is of great interest to providers treating critically ill patients. To our knowledge, no clear recommendations on the subject have been published.

### 2023 WSES guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management of iatrogenic urinary tract injuries (IUTIs) during emergency digestive surgery [^116Q2xza]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The WSES recommends administering empirical antifungal therapy in two scenarios: septic shock in community-acquired infections and postoperative infections and significant risk factors for candidiasis (e.g. recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leak, necrotizing pancreatitis). Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is also recommended for patients with hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections, especially those with significant risk factors for candidiasis, such as recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, empirical antifungal therapy should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis (e.g. Candida colonization, recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, recent abdominal surgery, necrotizing pancreatitis, central venous catheters, parenteral nutrition, and corticosteroids) and unidentifiable etiology of clinical deterioration or fever. A retrospective study evaluated mortality and other clinical outcomes (length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and length of hospital stay) among 18,496 septic patients, of whom 18.8% with positive yeast cultures, and analyzed the impact of initial empiric antifungal in this cohort. Positive yeast cultures were significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes (i.e. higher in-hospital and 60-day all-cause mortality and longer ICU and hospital stays). However, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that empiric antifungal therapy did not improve outcomes in ICU patients with positive yeast cultures and urinary tract infection (OR = 3.24, 95% CI: 1.48–7.11, p = 0.003), resulting as a risk factor for in-hospital all-cause mortality. An Italian retrospective study enrolled 319 patients with post-surgical abscesses, of whom 46 (14.4%) received empiric antifungals and 34 (10.7%) had an abdominal positive culture for Candida (always in association with bacteria). In this study, only 11 out of 46 (23.9%) patients receiving empirical antifungals had a positive abdominal culture for Candida and 11 out of 34 (32.3%) patients with abdominal candidiasis received empiric antifungal therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that only upper gastrointestinal surgery (OR = 4.76, 95% CI 1.95–11.65, p = 0.001), ICU stay in previous 90 days (OR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.63–15.33, p = 0.005), and 30-day reintervention (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.24–5.13, p = 0.011) were favoring factors for empiric antifungal therapy, despite only biliopancreatic surgery was associated with fungal isolation (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.03–4.91, p = 0.042) at univariate analysis.

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^113uc4go]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our study provides further evidence of the microbiologic shifts in candidemia among a population of patients who are at particular risk for this infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association of fluconazole prophylaxis with the candidal species distribution among intra-abdominal surgery patients. The result of this examination points to a likely role for selection pressures in such prophylaxis patients. In turn, the high prevalence of inappropriate treatment detected in our study is an important reminder for clinicians to consider candidemia in a fitting clinical setting, and to be aware of the factors that drive antifungal resistance. Most importantly, in the era of a widening gap between evolving microbial defenses and our abilities to address them, antifungal prophylaxis practices among intra-abdominal surgical patients require a measured re-evaluation.

### Peritonitis-the Western experience [^114oiK6p]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

It has been recognized for some time that patients who have intraabdominal infections and are treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy have a greater rate of treatment failure when resistant organisms are cultured. The influence of Candida cultured from the peritoneal fluid has been controversial, since this organism is not routinely treated by most empiric therapy regimens. Montravers and coworkers have demonstrated that the isolation of Candida from peritoneal cultures of patients with nosocomial peritonitis appears to be an independent risk factor for mortality. In contrast, patients with community-acquired infections who have growth of Candida on culture were not at greater risk for death.

There has not been a consensus about the appropriate duration of treatment for intraabdominal infections. Some believe that antibiotics can be stopped once fever and leukocytosis have resolved, and gastrointestinal function has returned, while others recommend a specific duration of therapy. The development of effective oral antimicrobials for the treatment of intraabdominal infections has led to a number of prospective randomized trials that have advocated switching to oral antibiotics once patients can tolerate a diet. This has been advocated as a cost saving measure without clear data defining the duration of treatment. Taylor and colleagues have demonstrated that the use of postoperative oral antibiotics once intravenous antibiotics were stopped did not improve outcomes in patients with complicated appendicitis. This study questions whether continued antibiotics are needed in patients once gastrointestinal function has returned.

### Diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis in the ICU: an updated approach to an old enemy [^112JVdnh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Management

Antifungal treatment can be considered as prophylactic (in patients at high risk of fungal infection), empiric (triggered by clinical signs of fungal infection, e.g. persistent fever in the presence of risk factors), preemptive (triggered by microbiological or biomarker evidence of fungus without actual infection), and definitive (after positive microbiological confirmation of strain and sensitivity of fungus).

Prophylactic antifungal agents are recommended in just a few specific situations and most treatments are given on an empiric basis. Although use of preemptive therapy is gaining interest, more studies are needed to better define which patients may benefit from this approach and whether more widespread use of antifungal agents may negatively influence fungal ecology. In a recent study of 241 ICU patients requiring emergency gastrointestinal surgery for intraabdominal infection, preemptive therapy with micafungin was not effective at reducing the development of invasive candidiasis compared with placebo, although there was some suggestion that this may have been the result of the preemptive therapy being administered too late.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^117FxbaC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Candida

In the last years there has been a significant increase in the incidence of invasive infections due to Candida species. Candida intra-abdominal infections are associated with poor prognosis. Thirty to forty percent of patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforation/anastomotic leakage develop intra-abdominal invasive candidiasis.

The most frequently implicated risk factors include the use of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, use of central venous catheters, receipt of parenteral nutrition, receipt of renal replacement therapy by patients in ICUs, neutropenia, and receipt of immunosuppressive agents (including glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators). Patients with health care-associated intra-abdominal infection are at higher risk of Candida peritonitis, particularly patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations and surgically treated pancreatic infection.

Empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole may decrease the incidence of Candida peritonitis in high-risk patients.

Fluconazole, is recommended as initial therapy. An echinocandin (Caspofungin, Anidulafungin, or Micafungin) is preferred for patients with recent azole exposure, patients with moderately severe to severe illness, or patients who are at high risk of infection due to C. glabrata or C. krusei.

Avoiding unnecessary antibiotics and optimizing the administration of antimicrobial agents will help to improve patient outcomes and minimize further pressures for resistance.

Several strategies aim at achieving optimal use of antimicrobial agents, such as guidelines or protocols, restricting the hospital formulary, combining antibiotic therapy, antibiotic rotation, area-specific antimicrobial therapy, antimicrobial de-escalation and infections controls, but it is important that surgeons know antibiotic administration minimal requirements, such as antibiotics spectrum of activity and drug effective dosing. Without these minimal requirements surgeons will increase the likelihood of treatment failures and antibiotic resistance.

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^1131xFqU]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study has confirmed that C. albicans was the most common species isolate among patients with intra-abdominal surgery and candidemia (39.6%), followed closely by C. glabrata (35.7%). Overall, non- C. albicans species accounted for more than one-half of all isolates and three-quarters of isolates among those who had fluconazole prophylaxis. Most alarmingly, based on timing and selection of empiric coverage, 63% of candidemia patients received treatment categorized as inappropriate based on conservative criteria.

There are several implications to the distribution of non- C. albicans species found among patients with prophylaxis. Admittedly, patients with prophylaxis who developed non- C. albicans candidemia were more severely ill than those without prophylaxis, as evidenced by their need for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, as well as by their higher likelihood of having bacteremia. One could hypothesize that such patients are more likely to have had prior treatment, and not just prophylaxis, with fluconazole, which may have served as the stimulus for development of resistant species. Our data did not allow us to explore their prior exposure to fluconazole as treatment, an important question to address in future studies. However, the increase in resistant species among patients with prophylaxis also probably points to the selection pressures inherent in antimicrobial prophylaxis in this surgical cohort of patients with intra-abdominal infections, which is not well documented in prior studies. The risks and benefits of fluconazole prophylaxis in this group, although controversial, thus need to continue to be evaluated carefully, given its propensity to drive a switch to resistant species in this deadly disease. Importantly, when faced with a patient who has received prophylaxis, a clinician must consider that such a patient's risk for a resistant candidemia may be considerably elevated and factor this information into his/her empiric treatment decisions.

Higher-risk CA-IAI — empiric antifungal therapy: One RCT, which included critically ill patients with both CA-IAI and HA-IAI, did not find empiric use of fluconazole associated with any improvement in outcome, and retrospective studies have also failed to document a benefit to routine use of empiric antifungal therapy in patients with CA-IAI; thus, the task force believes that routine antifungal therapy is unnecessary for most higher-risk patients with CA-IAI.

Therefore, although resistance containment interventions in healthcare structures have mostly been implemented in high-income countries, there is a pressing need to intervene in the resistance pandemic also in LMIC.

In the setting of HA-IAIs, post-operative peritonitis (PP) is a life-threatening hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infection with high rates of mortality and high risk for MDR infections and invasive candidiasis. Antimicrobial therapy between initial intervention and reoperation seems to be a significant risk factor for emergence of MDRO in patients with PP. A study by Augustin et al. included all consecutive adult patients with a diagnosis of post-operative peritonitis requiring admission to a surgical intensive care unit from January 2001 to December 2004. A total of 269 bacteria were cultured in 100 patients including 41 episodes with MDRO. According to logistic regression analysis, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics between the initial intervention and reoperation was a significant risk factor for emergence of MDRO.

In 2015, a retrospective review of patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery, reported the use of antibiotics for more than 5 days before diagnosis of anastomosis site leakage, and diabetes mellitus were identified as independent risk factors for MDRO acquisition by multivariate analysis.

In critically ill patients antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible.

In these patients to ensure timely and effective administration of antibiotics, clinicians should always consider the pathophysiological status of the patient as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of the employed antibiotics (Recommendation 1B).

An ineffective or otherwise inadequate antimicrobial regimen is one of the variables more strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in critical ill patients.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with organ dysfunction and septic shock.

However, apart from early timing of administration, selection of a pharmacological agent with penetration to the site of presumed infection, is necessary. Furthermore, the pathophysiological and immunological status of the patient and the pharmacokinetic properties of the chosen drugs warrant consideration. In the event of abdominal sepsis, clinicians must be aware that drug pharmacokinetics may be altered significantly in critically ill patients due to the pathophysiology of sepsis. For example, in critically ill patients, higher than standard loading doses of hydrophilic antimicrobials such as beta-lactams should be administered to ensure optimal exposure at the infection site independently of the patient's renal function because of the dilution effect.

### A research agenda on the management of intra-abdominal candidiasis: results from a consensus of multinational experts [^117271yu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) may include Candida involvement of peritoneum or intra-abdominal abscess and is burdened by high morbidity and mortality rates in surgical patients. Unfortunately, international guidelines do not specifically address this particular clinical setting due to heterogeneity of definitions and scant direct evidence. In order to cover this unmet clinical need, the Italian Society of Intensive Care and the International Society of Chemotherapy endorsed a project aimed at producing practice recommendations for the management of immune-competent adult patients with IAC.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert panel of 22 members (surgeons, infectious disease and intensive care physicians) was convened and assisted by a methodologist between April 2012 and May 2013. Evidence supporting each statement was graded according to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Diseases (ESCMID) grading system.

Results

Only a few of the numerous recommendations can be summarized in the Abstract. Direct microscopy examination for yeast detection from purulent and necrotic intra-abdominal specimens during surgery or by percutaneous aspiration is recommended in all patients with nonappendicular abdominal infections including secondary and tertiary peritonitis. Samples obtained from drainage tubes are not valuable except for evaluation of colonization. Prophylactic usage of fluconazole should be adopted in patients with recent abdominal surgery and recurrent gastrointestinal perforation or anastomotic leakage. Empirical antifungal treatment with echinocandins or lipid formulations of amphotericin B should be strongly considered in critically ill patients or those with previous exposure to azoles and suspected intra-abdominal infection with at least one specific risk factor for Candida infection. In patients with nonspecific risk factors, a positive mannan/antimannan or (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result should be present to start empirical therapy. Fluconazole can be adopted for the empirical and targeted therapy of non-critically ill patients without previous exposure to azoles unless they are known to be colonized with a Candida strain with reduced susceptibility to azoles. Treatment can be simplified by stepping down to an azole (fluconazole or voriconazole) after at least 5–7 days of treatment with echinocandins or lipid formulations of amphotericin B, if the species is susceptible and the patient has clinically improved.

Conclusions

Specific recommendations were elaborated on IAC management based on the best direct and indirect evidence and on the expertise of a multinational panel.

### Contemporary strategies in the prevention and management of fungal infections [^117Vx1bd]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Major patient groups at risk for invasive fungal infection are found in hematology, intensive care, and abdominal surgery units. The vast majority of invasive fungal infections are candidemia, pulmonary aspergillosis, and pulmonary or sinunasal mucormycosis, the latter typically in the context of diabetes. Clinical presentation is highly variable and depends on host, fungus, and organs involved. Symptoms are unspecific and, outside of fungemia, diagnosis is established by radiographic imaging combined with microbiological, serologic, and histopathological workup. Complex prevention and management strategies have been developed, and it is recommended to follow institutional pathways to standardize diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113d1v8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal candidiasis — treatment recommendations and diagnostic considerations: Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Treatment should include source control, with appropriate drainage and/or debridement (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). The choice of antifungal therapy is the same as for the treatment of candidemia or empiric therapy for nonneutropenic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), and the duration of therapy should be determined by adequacy of source control and clinical response (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Infections are often polymicrobial, with yeast noted in as high as 20% of all cases and 40% in patients with a recent gastroduodenal perforation. For sampling, swabs of superficial wounds and specimens from intra-abdominal catheters in place for > 24 hours do not provide useful information and should not be performed, whereas yeast from normally sterile intra-abdominal specimens (operatively obtained and/or drains placed within 24 hours) in patients with clinical evidence for infection should be considered indicative of intra-abdominal candidiasis. Biomarker data include a study in which β-D-glucan had a 72% positive predictive value and an 80% negative predictive value for distinguishing colonization from intra-abdominal invasive candidiasis. Patients who have Candida species isolated from normally sterile abdominal cultures or drains placed within 24 hours and who have clinical evidence of infection should be treated for intra-abdominal candidiasis; source control with adequate drainage and/or debridement is an important part of therapy, the antifungal agent should be guided by the Candida species and local epidemiology, and duration should be guided by clinical response and adequacy of source control.

### Clinical overview of invasive candidiasis… [^111QXTCt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk factors Common risk factors for invasive candidiasis include:

- Critical illness with a prolonged intensive care unit stay.
- Presence of central venous catheters.
- Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or total parenteral nutrition.
- Hematologic or solid organ malignancy, or neutropenia.
- Stem cell transplantation.
- Abdominal surgery.
- Pre-term infancy with a very low birth weight.
- Renal failure or hemodialysis
- Injection drug use. Prevention In healthcare settings, these measures are important to prevent invasive candidiasis:

- Adhering to hand hygiene recommendations
- Following recommendations for placement and maintenance of central venous catheters
- Practicing antimicrobial stewardship Some groups of patients may benefit from antifungal prophylaxis:

- Some solid organ transplant recipients
- High-risk ICU patients
- Patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia
- Stem cell transplant recipients with neutropenia.

Diagnosis Invasive candidiasis is primarily diagnosed with blood culture. Newer culture-independent diagnostic methods are promising but are not yet widely used. The Beta-D-glucan assay is approved as an adjunctive diagnostic tool but is not a very specific test for Candida. Determining the species of Candida causing the infection is important to guide appropriate antifungal treatment. Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis Initial treatment For most adult patients with candidemia, an echinocandin is recommended as initial therapy. Fluconazole is an alternative initial treatment in patients who are not critically ill when fluconazole-resistance is considered unlikely. Other treatments include voriconazole and amphotericin B formulations. Transitional treatment The infectious Diseases Society of America recommends retesting patients every day or every other day. Once blood cultures clear transition to fluconazole if susceptible to azoles.

Duration of treatment In general, treatment should continue for two weeks after clearance of Candida and resolution of symptoms. Intravenous catheter removal is recommended for non-neutropenic patients and can be considered for neutropenic patients. For neonatal candidiasis, the recommended primary treatment is amphotericin B deoxycholate or fluconazole. The treatment duration is two weeks after clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and symptom resolution. Treatment for invasive candidiasis including candidemia vary by type of infection.

### (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan-guided antifungal therapy in adults with sepsis: the candiSep randomized clinical trial [^117FTPdc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Specificity of BDG was low in our study. Various factors have been discussed for triggering false positive BDG results including administration of antimicrobials, blood products including albumin, and immunoglobulins, all of which may be applied in the care of sepsis patients. However, significance of these factors is not undisputed. Previous abdominal surgery was the most prevalent risk factor predisposing for ICI in our trial. However, open gut surgery results in elevated serum BDG concentrations for up to 5 days which might have impacted our BDG-measurements. Although BDG was eliminated within 4 days in pediatric patients, animal experiments described a BDG-clearance of 9 days. The most recent Cochrane analysis concluded that it remains unclear whether BDG can identify ICI early. This lack of specificity likely caused an overuse of antifungals in the BDG-group as many patients without microbiological proof of ICI were treated without having a benefit. We aimed to improve BDG-specificity by excluding patients treated with immunoglobulins or cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and by requiring two positive BDG measurements from two consecutive days. Although a BDG cut-off of 80 pg/mL has been successfully used to diagnose candidemia and intraabdominal candidiasis, a higher cut-off such as 200 pg/mL has been suggested to increase specificity. Sensitivity was only 54.3% in our study. A sensitivity as low as 20% has been observed in several studies and may be associated with a low pathogen load. Current data rather suggest that BDG can be used as a surrogate for withdrawal of empirically started antifungal treatment rather than early initiation.

### Appropriate source control and antifungal therapy are associated with improved survival in critically ill surgical patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis [^117AXKZo]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) is the predominant type of invasive candidiasis with high mortality in surgical intensive care patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of appropriate source control and antifungal therapy on the outcomes of critically ill surgical patients with IAC.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-center cohort study. Adult surgical patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit and diagnosed with IAC from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2016, were enrolled. The patients' data including risk factors of IAC, infection-related information, antifungal treatment and 30-day outcomes were collected. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. A COX proportional hazards model was used to analyze the association between appropriate treatment and 30-day survival.

Results

A total of 82 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 45 (54.9%) were complicated with septic shock at IAC diagnosis. Types of IAC included peritonitis (61.0%), intra-abdominal abscesses (23.2%) and biliary tract infections (15.9%). Of the included patients, 53 (64.6%) received appropriate source control and 44 (53.7%) appropriate antifungal therapy. Compared with patients with neither of these treatments, appropriate source control (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02–0.30; P < 0.001), appropriate antifungal therapy (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04–0.55; P = 0.005), and a combination of these treatments (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00–0.08; P < 0.001) were associated with reduced risk of death within 30 days after IAC diagnosis.

Conclusion

For critically ill surgical patients with IAC, both appropriate source control and appropriate antifungal therapy were associated with reduced risk of 30-day mortality, and the protective effects of the two appropriate treatments were additive.

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^111yRtcJ]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAIs) are severe infections, which is challenging for clinicians. An intraabdominal infectious focus could be detected in two-thirds of all surgical patients presenting with sepsis, and epidemiological data show that cIAIs are the second most common source in patients where sepsis was the immediate cause of death. cIAIs are generally polymicrobial, and treatment is based on effective source control as the main objective to reduce mortality and appropriate therapy. However, regardless of continuous efforts, the mortality of this entity continues to be high, ranging from 20 to 60%.

Appropriate therapy should be considered to provide the best antimicrobial efficacy against the infecting pathogens and the greatest minimisation of the possibility of developing resistance. The polymicrobial nature of the indigenous intestinal microbiota complicates this goal of appropriateness; the project AGORA, an international task force from 79 countries, is a good example of the scientific community's efforts to optimise the rational use of antimicrobials for patients with cIAIs. The intestinal tract is an important reservoir for antibiotic-resistant bacteria; a recent study in distinct European regions showed that antimicrobial resistance is common in isolates from critically ill patients with cIAIs.

Of importance, the volume of distribution can be significantly increased in the presence of intraabdominal disease, especially in critically ill patients where several pharmacokinetic (PK) alterations can lead to drug underdosing. All these could lead to insufficient intraabdominal levels of the drug to attaint values of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters predicting efficacy and avoiding emergence of resistant variants.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^116CcfQq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

What is the optimal antifungal treatment in patients with IAIs?

23. In patients with septic shock and multi-organ failure, empiric antifungal therapy for Candida species should be considered for patients with hospital-acquired cIAIs, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or proximal gastrointestinal anastomotic leak or for patients with community-acquired infections at high risk (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

The epidemiological role of Candida spp. in patients with IAIs has not yet been conclusively defined. Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida spp. is typically not recommended for patients with CA-IAIs, with the exceptions of critically ill patients with septic shock, multiple organ failure and risk factors for Candida spp. infections or immunocompromised patients (due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators). In 2016, the IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were developed and addressed intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC). IDSA guidelines suggest considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of IAIs and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections. While patients with abdominal sepsis may not in general benefit from empiric antifungal agents, some patients with particular risk factors for fungal infection who fail to improve after some days of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy are at increased risk of having invasive candidiasis. The most recent ESICM/ESCMID guidelines recommendations state that empiric antifungal treatment may be considered in patients with sepsis or septic shock at high risk for Candida spp. infections. These recommendations are mainly based on the results of several observational studies, in which an early antifungal therapy was associated with a better outcome. However, no evidence favouring an early empirical antifungal therapy comes from prospective studies.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations for antifungal therapy optimisation in the treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis [^114GkMvQ]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical course of IAC consideration

All studies analysed the PK/PD targets based on antifungal concentrations obtained from the post-operative period, often two to three days after surgery to evaluate steady-state concentrations. In our opinion, except perhaps for tertiary peritonitis (poorly studied thus far), the post-operative period has lower impact on mortality compared to the surgical period. Indeed, mortality increases with delay in source control and commencement of antifungal therapy. Thus, if a PK/PD study aims to evaluate the impact of PK/PD target attainment on mortality, intra-operative sampling must be considered because: (i) this is the phase where inoculum is potentially the highest, (ii) the PK alterations from sepsis, surgery, and resuscitation therapeutics are maximized, and (iii) source control is ongoing.

However, there is still a risk of unpredictable antifungal concentrations during the post-operative period. Indeed, because of all other sources of PK variability in critically ill patients such as renal failure or extracorporeal support, the risk of suboptimal exposure can persist throughout the course of therapy. Therefore, in cases of either candidemia, tertiary peritonitis or inadequate source control, ensuring optimal antifungal exposure is crucial, knowing that these situations require longer antifungal duration.

Implementation of BDG testing in ICU may be beneficial if integrated in antifungal stewardship strategies including testing indications/interpretation of results and constant monitoring of practices. Studies assessing the overall impact and cost-effectiveness of BDG testing in ICU are needed.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^1159p5qd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings worldwide. The cornerstones of IAI management include rapid, accurate diagnostics; timely, adequate source control; appropriate, short-duration antimicrobial therapy administered according to the principles of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and antimicrobial stewardship; and hemodynamic and organ functional support with intravenous fluid and adjunctive vasopressor agents for critical illness (sepsis/organ dysfunction or septic shock after correction of hypovolemia). In patients with IAIs, a personalized approach is crucial to optimize outcomes and should be based on multiple aspects that require careful clinical assessment. The anatomic extent of infection, the presumed pathogens involved and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance, the origin and extent of the infection, the patient's clinical condition, and the host's immune status should be assessed continuously to optimize the management of patients with complicated IAIs.

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^112iKSEY]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Historically, Candida albicans has represented the most common cause of candidemia. However, the proportion of bloodstream infections due to non-albicans Candida species has increased. Because of the risk for candidemia in intra-abdominal surgical patients, some experts advocate the use of fluconazole prophylaxis. The impact of this practice on the distribution of Candida species isolated in breakthrough fungal infections in this population is unknown. We examined the association of fluconazole prophylaxis with the distribution of Candida species in intra-abdominal surgery patients.

Methods

We retrospectively identified cases with a positive blood culture (BCx) for Candida among hospitalized adult intra-abdominal surgery patients between July 2005 and October 2012. Distribution of Candida species isolated represented our primary endpoint. Qualifying surgical cases were determined based on a review of discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Patients receiving low-dose fluconazole prior to the positive BCx with a known indication for prophylaxis including neutropenia, ICU exposure or history of organ transplantation were classified as prophylaxis. Appropriateness of fungal treatment was determined by the timing and selection of antifungal agent based on fungal isolate.

Results

Among 10,839 intra-abdominal surgery patients, 227 had candidemia. The most common Candida species isolated was C. albicans (n = 90, 39.6%) followed by C. glabrata (n = 81, 35.7%) and C. parapsilosis (n = 38, 16.7%). Non-albicans Candida accounted for 57.7% of isolates among the 194 non-prophylaxis patients and 75.8% among the 33 prophylaxis patients (P = 0.001). C. glabrata, the most common non-C. albicans species, was more prevalent than C. albicans in persons given prophylaxis, but not in those without prophylaxis. A total of 63% of those with candidemia were treated inappropriately based on the timing and selection of antifungal administration.

Conclusions

Selection pressure from fluconazole prophylaxis in at-risk surgical patients may be associated with a drift toward fluconazole-resistant species in subsequent candidemia. Tools are needed to guide appropriate treatment through the prompt recognition and characterization of candidemia.

Preferred empiric therapy in critically ill patients or those previously exposed to an azole is an echinocandin (Caspofungin: loading dose of 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; Micafungin:100 mg daily; Anidulafungin: loading dose of 200 mg, then 100 mg daily). However, fluconazole, 600 mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, should be still considered first-line antifungal therapy, in hemodynamically stable patients who are colonized with azole susceptible Candida species or who have no prior exposure to azoles.

### Surgical pathology and the diagnosis of invasive visceral yeast infection: two case reports and literature review [^114TyYPF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Invasive mycoses are life-threatening opportunistic infections that have recently emerged as a cause of morbidity and mortality following general and gastrointestinal surgery. Candida species are the main fungal strains of gut flora. Gastrointestinal tract surgery might lead to mucosal disruption and cause Candida spp. to disseminate in the bloodstream. Here we report and discuss the peculiar clinical and morphological presentation of two cases of gastrointestinal Candida albicans lesions in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. Although in the majority of cases reported in the literature, diagnosis was made on the basis of microbiological criteria, we suggest that morphological features of fungi in histological sections of appropriate surgical specimens could help to detect the degree of yeast colonization and identify patients at risk of developing severe abdominal Candida infection. Better prevention and early antifungal treatments are highlighted, and relevant scientific literature is reviewed.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^111YjBji]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Below, we report 13 practices in an appropriate antibiotic therapy across the surgical pathway:
The source of infection should always be identified and controlled as soon as possible.
Antibiotic empiric therapy should be initiated after a treatable surgical infection has been recognized, since microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) may not be available for up to 48–72 h to guide targeted therapy.
In critically ill patients, empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens should be initiated as soon as possible after a surgical infection has been recognized. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be narrowed once culture and susceptibility results are available and/or adequate clinical improvement is noted.
Empirical therapy should be chosen on the basis of local epidemiology, individual patient risk factors for MDR bacteria and Candida spp. clinical severity, and infection source.
Specimens for microbiological evaluation from the site of infection are always recommended for patients with hospital-acquired or with community-acquired infections at risk for resistant pathogens (e.g. previous antimicrobial therapy, prior infection or colonization with a multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and pan-drug-resistant pathogens) and in critically ill patients. Blood cultures should be performed before the administration of antibiotics in critically ill patients.
Antibiotics dose should be optimized to ensure that pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets are achieved. This involves prescribing of an adequate dose, according to the most appropriate and right method and schedule to maximize the probability of target attainment.
The appropriateness and need for antimicrobial treatment should be reassessed daily.
Once source control is established, short courses of antibiotic therapy are as effective as longer courses regardless of signs of inflammation. Intra-abdominal infection: 4 days are as effective as 8 days in moderately ill patients. Bloodstream infection: 5–7 days are as effective as 7–21 days for most patients. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: 8 days are as effective as 15 days.
Failure of antibiotic therapy in patients having continued evidence of active infection may require a re-operation for a second source control intervention.
Biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide duration and/or cessation of antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients.
Clinicians with advanced training and clinical experience in surgical infections should be included in the care of patients with severe infections.
IPC measures, combined with ASPs, should be implemented in surgical departments. These interventions and programs require regular, systematic monitoring to assess compliance and efficacy.
Monitoring of antibiotic consumption should be implemented and feedback provided to all ASP team members regularly (e.g. every 3–6 months) along with resistance surveillance data and outcome measures.

The numerical MIC number, expressed as micrograms/ml, is usually reported by microbiology laboratories as a categorical guide for clinicians, i.e. as "susceptible", "resistant", or "intermediate", according to Clinical or Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria in the USA or the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria in Europe.

Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics into bile may be helpful in designing the optimal therapeutic regimen for patients with biliary-related intra-abdominal infections (Recommendation 1C).

Organisms most often isolated in biliary infections are those isolated in intra-abdominal infections including the gram-negative aerobes, E. coli and K. pneumonia and anaerobes, especially B. fragilis. The role of enterococci in biliary tract infections remains unclear, and specific coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely suggested for community-acquired biliary infections.

Although there are no clinical data to support the use of antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections may depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations too. Obviously in patients with obstructed bile ducts, the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and effective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minority of patients.

Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability are illustrated in Table 5.

Table 5
Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability

Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is recommended for patients with hospital-acquired IAIs, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak (Recommendation 1C).

The epidemiological profile of Candida spp in the context of nosocomial peritonitis is incompletely defined. Its clinical presence is usually associated with poor prognosis. Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida spp is typically not recommended for patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, with the notable exceptions of critically ill patients or immunocompromised patients (due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators). Recently, IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were developed and addressed Candida peritonitis. IDSA guidelines suggested considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections.

### Decreasing candidaemia rate in abdominal surgery patients after introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis* [^114LeNCo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Although abdominal surgery is an established risk factor for invasive candidiasis, the precise role of antifungal prophylaxis in these patients is not agreed upon. In 2007, fluconazole was added to the prophylactic antibiotic treatment for patients with gastrointestinal tract perforations or reoperation after colorectal surgery in two university hospitals in Copenhagen. Changes in candidaemia rates associated with this intervention were examined and potential interfering factors evaluated. Rates and clinical characteristics of candidaemias and other blood stream infections (BSIs) in abdominal surgery patients were compared before (1 January 2006 to 30 June 2007) and after the intervention (1 January 2008 to 30 June 2009). The departments' activity was assessed by number of bed-days, admissions and surgical procedures, and the consumption of antifungals was analysed. The candidaemia rate decreased from 1.5/1000 admissions in the pre-intervention to 0.3/1000 admissions in the post-intervention period (p 0.002). Numbers of BSIs and bed-days remained stable, and numbers of admissions and surgical procedures performed increased during the study period. Fluconazole consumption in the two abdominal surgery departments increased from 4.6 to 12.2 defined daily doses per 100 bed-days (p < 0.001), and 3.2 to 5.0 (p 0.01), respectively, but remained unchanged in the intensive care units. We could not detect any increase in fluconazole-resistant strains (14/29 pre- and 2/7 post-intervention, p 0.43). The introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis was followed by a significantly decreased candidaemia rate. However, the observational study design does not allow conclusions regarding causality. No increase in resistance was detected, but follow-up was short and continuing surveillance is needed.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^112PAyxY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Data from 13 hospitals in Italy, Spain, Brazil, and Greece over a 3-year period (2011–2013) including patients from ICU, medical, and surgical wards with intra-abdominal candidiasis was published in 2015. A total of 481 patients were included in the study. Of these, 27% were hospitalized in ICU. The mean age was 63 years, and 57% of patients were male. Multivariate logistic analysis regression showed that age, increments in 1-point APACHE II scores, secondary peritonitis, septic shock, and non-adequate abdominal source control were significantly associated with mortality. In patients with septic shock, absence of source control resulted in mortality rates above 60% irrespective of administration of an adequate antifungal therapy.

Moreover, a prospective observational study involving 180 consecutive patients with secondary generalized peritonitis (community-acquired and post-operative) at a single center was published by Riché et al. Septic shock complicating intra-abdominal candidiasis was associated with high mortality rates. Yeast in the peritoneal fluid of post-operative peritonitis were an independent risk factor for death in patients with septic shock.

Statement 33

Two situations justify an empirical antifungal therapy: patients with septic shock in community-acquired infections or patients with post-operative infections (Recommendation 2 C).

No study has specifically evaluated the efficacy of antifungal therapy in IAIs. In recent randomized trials focusing on antifungal therapy of invasive candidiasis, the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of abdominal candidiasis was low. The need for an early adequate systemic antifungal therapy in candida peritonitis is based on the assumption that delayed antifungal therapy initiation is associated to poorer outcome, particularly among those with candidaemia. However, a deleterious impact of delayed systemic antifungal therapy initiation has never been demonstrated in candida intra-abdominal infection.

Two situations justify an empirical antifungal therapy: patients with septic shock in community-acquired infections or patients with post-operative infections where the presence of yeast is associated with a poor prognosis.

### Predictors of choice of initial antifungal treatment in intraabdominal candidiasis [^117F6pvb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Intraabdominal candidiasis (IAC) is the second most frequent form of invasive candidiasis, and is associated with high mortality rates. This study aims to identify current practices in initial antifungal treatment (IAT) in a real-world scenario and to define the predictors of the choice of echinocandins or azoles in IAC episodes. Secondary analysis was performed of a multinational retrospective cohort at 13 teaching hospitals in four countries (Italy, Greece, Spain and Brazil), over a 3-year period (2011–2013). IAC was identified in 481 patients, 323 of whom received antifungal therapy (classified as the treatment group). After excluding 13 patients given amphotericin B, the treatment group was further divided into the echinocandin group (209 patients; 64.7%) and the azole group (101 patients; 32.3%). Median APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the echinocandin group (p 0.013), but IAT did not differ significantly with regard to the Candida species involved. Logistic multivariate stepwise regression analysis, adjusted for centre effect, identified septic shock (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.54), APACHE II > 15 (aOR 1.16) and presence in surgical ward at diagnosis (aOR 1.16) as the top three independent variables associated with an empirical echinocandin regimen. No differences in 30-day mortality were observed between groups. Echinocandin regimen was the first choice for IAT in patients with IAC. No statistical differences in mortality were observed between regimens, but echinocandins were administered to patients with more severe disease. Some disagreements were identified between current clinical guidelines and prescription of antifungals for IAC at the bedside, so further educational measures are required to optimize therapies.

### Candida colonization index and subsequent infection in critically ill surgical patients: 20 years later [^113pSQ4F]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients recovering from abdominal surgery

Additional factors should be considered in patients after abdominal surgery. Any perforation or opening of the digestive tract results in contamination of the peritoneum by bowel flora. In most cases, surgical cleaning of the abdominal cavity, eventually combined with antibiotics, is sufficient to allow full recovery. Except for patients presenting with nosocomial peritonitis and some of those presenting with septic shock and multiple organ failure, the identification of Candida spp. has no clinical significance under these conditions. Recurrent peritonitis following anastomotic leakage or persistent inflammation may be required for the progression of Candida spp. colonization to invasive candidiasis. However, the development of invasive candidiasis requires concomitant exposure to additional factors, such as an increasing amount of Candida spp. in a non-functioning bowel, prolonged antibiotic treatment, and/or requirement for organ support. In contrast to nonsurgical patients, these particularities explain why a high proportion of invasive candidiasis cases do not manifest with candidemia and develop only late in the course of the disease.

Non-candidemic invasive candidiasis includes intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis defined by one of the following culture results from specimens obtained at surgery: (1) monomicrobial growth of Candida spp.; (2) any amount of Candida spp. growth within a mixed-flora abscess; or (3) moderate or heavy growth of Candida spp. in mixed-flora peritonitis treated with appropriate antibacterial therapy according to susceptibility testing.

Two small prospective studies, including one placebo-controlled, suggested that antifungal prophylaxis in patients presenting with anastomotic leakage after abdominal surgery may prevent the development of invasive candidiasis.

In patients with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis, invasive candidiasis develops with similar pathophysiological characteristics. Progressive colonization of the bowel within the first 2 weeks of the disease results in translocation into necrotic tissues, and fungal infections have been documented in up to 10% of patients not exposed to antibiotics.

Critically ill patients with Candida isolated from the respiratory tract

Candida spp. colonization of the airway is frequently reported in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, and its clinical significance is difficult to evaluate. Candida has a low affinity for alveolar pneumocytes and histologically documented pneumonia has been rarely reported. Hematogenous dissemination in the context of candidemia may be responsible for multiple pulmonary abscesses and should be viewed as a distinct entity. Hence the existence of true candidal pneumonia is doubtful and recovery of Candida spp. from the respiratory tract should generally be considered as colonization and does not justify antifungal therapy.

Despite advances in diagnosis, surgery, and antimicrobial therapy, mortality rates associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections remain exceedingly high.

The 2013 update of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for the management of intra-abdominal infections contains evidence-based recommendations for management of patients with intra-abdominal infections.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy for the prevention of invasive candidiasis following gastrointestinal surgery for intra-abdominal infections [^117CyECS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Candida species are the most common fungal pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU), and invasive candidiasis (IC) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Early antifungal treatment reduces mortality rates in patients with documented IC, but a swift definitive diagnosis is difficult. Although prophylaxis or preemptive treatment strategies should be used in patients at high risk for IC, their identification is clinically challenging, because preemptive intervention markers have not been fully defined.

Risk factors for IC in critically ill patients include broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, cancer chemotherapy, fungal colonization, indwelling vascular catheters, total parenteral nutrition, surgery, renal failure, hemodialysis, and prolonged ICU stay. Although these factors can be present in patients who do not have IC and individually are not sufficiently discriminatory, together they can still be used to identify high-risk patients. Risk identification strategies, such as Candida colonization index, clinical predictive rules and a Candida score have been proposed to aid in deciding when to initiate early antifungal therapy.

Antifungal prophylaxis in patients at high risk for IC has been investigated in several randomized, controlled trials. Trials in homogenous populations, such as surgical patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakages and severe acute pancreatitis, showed prophylaxis to be an effective strategy, because infection rates were high with placebo and significantly lower with active antifungal therapy. Studies with heterogeneous ICU patients, however had low incidences of infections in the placebo arms, and treatment differences between placebo and active therapy were not shown. Therefore, antifungal prophylaxis should be used only in specific subgroups where there is clear evidence of benefit. For the majority of ICU patients at high IC risk, a preemptive antifungal strategy, based on clinical risk factors and microbiologic evidence of substantial colonization, is proposed.

Patients requiring ICU management after emergency surgery for intra-abdominal infection have a high IC risk. As a commensal of the digestive tract, Candida may leak into the peritoneal cavity after perforation or during surgical resection of the intestine. Peritoneal seeding can result in intra-abdominal Candida infection with risk of dissemination to the bloodstream and extra-abdominal tissue and organs. The INTENSE (Invasive Candidiasis – Pre-emptive Treatment in High Risk Surgical Subjects) study assessed the strategy of preemptive antifungal therapy versus placebo in hospitalized patients requiring surgery for intra-abdominal infection. Micafungin was used as the active therapy, and the efficacy and safety of its use in that setting was assessed.

What is the impact of intra-abdominal candidiasis? When and how do you treat intra-abdominal candidiasis?

Statement 32

The presence of Candida spp. in the peritoneal samples is a factor of poor prognosis (Recommendation 1C).

The epidemiological role of Candida spp. in IAI has not yet been conclusively defined.

Colonizing strains of C. albicans are normally present in small or moderate numbers and they are only regarded as part of the resident gastrointestinal microflora.

However, isolation of Candida spp. in samples from IAIs is associated with poor outcomes.

In community-acquired infections, the role of Candida spp. in the prognosis is difficult to demonstrate. In healthcare-associated (mainly post-operative) peritonitis, intra-abdominal candidiasis is associated with increased mortality.

In an observational study, Montravers et al. showed that isolation of Candida spp. was an independent risk factor of mortality in nosocomial peritonitis patients. However, antifungal treatment did not improve survival.

Several criteria have been considered as factors of poor prognosis for patients with Candida isolation in peritoneal fluid.

In a retrospective review of a prospective surgical ICU database of patients, Dupont et al. demonstrated that four variables were independently associated with mortality in polymicrobial peritonitis with Candida isolation in peritoneal fluid in critically ill patients. These were (1) APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score on admission of at least 17, (2) respiratory failure on admission, (3) upper gastrointestinal tract origin of peritonitis, and (4) results of direct examination of peritoneal fluid that were positive for Candida.

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^111iG6QT]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the emergence of antifungal resistance has become a growing concern in treating Candida infections, including IAC. Monitoring and understanding the patterns of antifungal resistance are critical to ensure the effectiveness of recommended therapies. Large-scale surveillance studies are necessary to assess the prevalence and trends of antifungal resistance among Candida isolates from intraabdominal infections.

The financial burden associated with antifungal therapy for IAC should not be overlooked. Novel antifungal agents can be costly, and prolonged therapy may lead to increased healthcare expenses. Comparative effectiveness research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment options and provide valuable insights for healthcare policymakers.

Three drug classes, azoles, echinocandins and polyenes, represent the main antifungal armamentarium against Candida infections. C. albicans continues to be the most frequent species isolated from IACs, but others, some less susceptible to antifungals, begin to gain weight. In the SENTRY antifungal surveillance programme, the frequency of C. albicans decreased from 57.4% in 1997–2001 to 46.4% in 2015–2016. In parallel, this study also reported a gradual and global increase of C. glabrata as a causative agent of invasive candidiasis since 1997, with the highest rates of resistance to fluconazole in North America and Asia–Pacific (10.6% and 6.8%, respectively). The emergence of azole resistance in Candida species as well as their interaction with cytochrome P450 leading to drug–drug interactions represents major inconveniences to treatment in critically ill patients.

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^114TnDpt]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Intraabdominal candidiasis (IAC)

IAC is caused by the overgrowth of Candida species within the abdominal cavity. It primarily affects critically ill patients, those undergoing major abdominal surgeries or individuals with compromised immune systems. Timely and effective treatment is essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. While guidelines exist for the management of IAC, there remains a crucial need to gather more evidence to support the recommended therapy.

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at the highest risk for invasive candidiasis. After ICU admission, the rapid colonisation of mucocutaneous surfaces of patients represents an important risk factor for candidemia, an entity with a mortality rate as high as 45% in a recently published multicentre European study. In turn, alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome precede IAC. Candida peritonitis is the predominant invasive candidiasis after candidemia in the ICU. Five species account for 92% of cases of invasive candidiasis: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei.

Candida spp. are temporary or permanent parts of the normal endogenous flora in the gut in 40–50% of humans. It is normally controlled by nearby bacteria and the host immune system. However, when the gastrointestinal microflora within the host is altered by multiple possible factors (surgery, antibiotic treatments, immunosuppression, etc.), Candida invasion and dissemination within the abdominal cavity may occur. IAC is not always accompanied by candidemia; in fact, a recent study reported that only 6.9% patients with IAC had concomitant blood cultures positive for Candida spp. Thus, diagnosis of IAC in the absence of bloodstream infection represents a challenge, partly due to the lack of a non-culture-based gold standard method. In addition, when Candida is present in intraabdominal samples, the differentiation between contamination, colonisation and infection is not simple since mixed infections with bacteria are frequent and up to 80% of patients with peritonitis are colonised with Candida spp.

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^116CrBPn]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

With crude mortality approaching 40%, candidemia continues to take a high toll among certain groups of hospitalized patients. In the past, the species most frequently responsible for candidemia and invasive Candida infections was Candida albicans. Over time, however, there has been a shift in the epidemiology of invasive Candida infection, with an increasing proportion being due to species other than C. albicans.

Invasive Candida is of particular concern in specific populations. Intra-abdominal surgery is a well-recognized risk factor for invasive fungal infection. The initial choice of an antifungal is critical in the setting of suspected candidemia, as it is strongly associated with the outcomes. Although well-established evidence-based clinical guidelines help in making correct choices, efforts to ensure appropriate and timely initial antifungal therapy have been complicated by the shifting microbiology and antifungal susceptibility patterns. To address this uncertainty, the guidelines recommend empiric therapy with an echinocandin to treat suspected candidemia in the setting of critical illness, as well as in neutropenia with fluconazole prophylaxis, where non- C. albicans isolates are more likely. Unfortunately, candidal microbiology and thus initial coverage decisions are less clear in the setting of intra-abdominal surgery. One factor that may be driving shifts in candidal populations and antifungal susceptibility among these patients is fluconazole prophylaxis, which although controversial is used nevertheless. The concern stems from several studies in nonsurgical cohorts that have detected an association between fluconazole prophylaxis and increased infection with Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, reflecting the impact of selection pressure with fluconazole prophylaxis. However, it is unclear whether such selection pressure with a drift toward azole-resistant species is a factor among patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery who develop candidemia.

The primary aim of our study was to examine whether there is an association between fluconazole prophylaxis and the distribution of Candida species found in subsequent breakthrough candidemia among intra-abdominal surgery patients. We also assessed the appropriateness of empiric antifungal therapy among this group of patients with candidemia based on timing, dose, and susceptibility.

### Combination of serum and peritoneal 1.3-β-D-glucan can rule out intra-abdominal candidiasis in surgical critically ill patients: a multicenter prospective study [^113XqJJQ]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic exposure for more than 72 h prior to surgery and a peritonitis score ≥ 3 were significantly more common in the IAC group (P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively). One-third of the cohort was considered immunocompromised, mainly due to active solid tumors (n = 52/77). Two-thirds of the patients were admitted to the ICU for urgent intra-abdominal infection, with secondary peritonitis accounting for 96% of cases (n = 192), originating primarily from the colon (n = 71/36%) and small bowel (n = 67/33%). Surgery was predominantly performed by laparotomy (n = 184/92%). Approximately 64% (n = 123) of cases received antibiotic therapy before surgical incision. Eight patients received antifungal treatment before surgery.

During and after surgery, an antifungal treatment was started for 127 patients (64%) primarily empirically (74% of cases). In the IAC group, 30 patients (35%) received antifungal treatment after Candida documentation. Regarding the non-IAC group, 42 patients (37%) received unnecessary antifungal therapy. All patients received an echinocandin as empirical therapy, which was de-escalated to fluconazole in 47% of cases. The overall median duration of antifungal therapy was 8 days in the IAC group versus 5 days in the non-IAC group (P < 0.0001). The median ICU length of stay was 8 days, and the ICU mortality rate was 14% (n = 27).

Primary objective

The prevalence of IAC was 44% (n = 87/199; 95% CI [37–51]). There was no statistically significant difference in Candida risk factors between the two groups except for prior antibiotic exposure longer than 72 h (Table 1). A total of 101 Candida -positive species were recovered from the 87 PF samples: 65 C. albicans, 19 C. glabrata, 7 C. tropicalis, 4 C. kefyr, 3 C. krusei, and 2 C. parapsilosis. The IAC was polymicrobial in 72% (n = 63) of cases. The most encountered bacteria were Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for the whole bacterial documentation). Direct examination for yeast was positive for 34 patients (17%). There were only 3 cases of candidemia (3%).

Analysis Sets

Baseline characteristics, incidence and time to IDRB-confirmed IC, and biomarker data are reported for the full analysis set (FAS), which comprised all randomized patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study medication and did not have an IDRB-confirmed IC at baseline. For the investigator-confirmed IC, a modified FAS was used, which took into account investigator-confirmed IC at baseline. Similarly for any-confirmed IC (confirmed by the IDRB or investigator), a modified FAS was used, which took into account the any-confirmed IC at baseline. The incidence and time to IDRB-confirmed IC were further assessed in the per-protocol set (PPS), defined as all FAS patients (1) who had an assessment of IC, as confirmed by the IDRB at EOT; (2) received ≥ 3 days of study medication; (3) had no confirmed IC before baseline, according to the IDRB; and (4) had no major protocol violations. Prior and concomitant medication use and safety assessments are described for the safety analysis set, which included all randomized patients who received study medication at least once.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^1165Vx3f]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines on intra-abdominal infection — empiric therapy for higher-risk community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI) emphasizes broad-spectrum coverage and selective antifungal use. We suggest treatment of CA-IAI in higher-risk patients with broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial agents to ensure coverage of less common gram-negative pathogens potentially involved in these infections (Grade 2-C). Preferred agents are piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime plus metronidazole (Grade 2-A), with ceftriaxone plus metronidazole as an alternative regimen (Grade 2-B); for patients with a severe reaction to β-lactam agents, we suggest aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin (Grade 2-B). We do not recommend addition of an adjunctive aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone to a β-lactam agent for empiric management of CA-IAI in higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B). Regarding antifungal therapy, we do not recommend routine addition of empiric antifungal therapy for management of CA-IAI in higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B), but we suggest empiric use of antifungal therapy for management of CA-IAI in critically ill patients with an upper gastrointestinal source (Grade 2-B), aligning with the note that empiric antifungal therapy be considered for critically ill patients with CA-IAI because of upper gastrointestinal perforations.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy for the prevention of invasive candidiasis following gastrointestinal surgery for intra-abdominal infections [^1171auww]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

METHODS

Patients and Study Design

INTENSE (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01122368) was an exploratory, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy in adults (aged ≥ 18 years), who presented with a generalized or localized intra-abdominal infection requiring surgery and an ICU stay. Patients were included if they had a community-acquired (CAI) or nosocomially acquired (NAI) intra-abdominal infection. Patients with CAI were those who presented with intra-abdominal infection before or within 48 hours after hospital admission. Patients with NAI were those who developed intra-abdominal infection > 48 hours after hospital admission and were hospitalized for reasons other than infection. Key exclusion criteria were acute pancreatitis, infected intra-peritoneal dialysis, solid organ transplantation, severe liver disease, or neutropenia at randomization. Exclusion criteria included receipt of a systemic antifungal within 14 days before study drug, documented IC at randomization, or expected survival < 48 hours. The study was conducted from 13 July 2010 to 15 December 2011.

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to intravenous micafungin (100 mg/d) or saline solution as a placebo. Patients were included within 48 hours (NAI) or 72–120 hours (CAI) after surgery providing they had an expected minimum ICU stay of 48 hours. Patients were treated for 6 weeks unless they experienced an end of treatment (EOT) event: confirmed IC, improvement in surgical condition (as indicated by recovery of gastrointestinal function allowing enteral feeding of up to 50% of daily calorie requirement), alternative antifungal treatment, or death. If IC was confirmed, study medication was discontinued and alternative antifungal medication was given. The type of surgery and antibiotic required for the treatment of the intra-abdominal infection were prescribed according to center policy. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written or witnessed informed consent was obtained for all patients.

### Significance of Candida recovered from intraoperative specimens in patients with intra-abdominal perforations [^111dvEHP]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Determine the significance of recovering yeasts from intraoperative specimens from the abdominal cavity and to evaluate the effect of a single intraoperative dose of fluconazole on clinical outcome in patients with intra-abdominal perforations.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

Multicenter study from 13 hospitals in Norway.

Patients

One hundred nine patients with intra-abdominal perforations.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either a single 400-mg fluconazole dose or placebo during the operation.

Measurements and Main Results

An intra-abdominal specimen for microbiological culture was obtained at the time of the operation. The primary response variable in the study was death. Secondary response variables were three parameters indicating a complicated postoperative period: mechanical ventilation for ≥ 5 days, intensive care treatment for ≥ 10 days, and use of a central venous catheter for ≥ 10 days. Yeasts were recovered from a intraoperative intra-abdominal specimen from only 1 (3.5%) of 28 patients with perforated appendicitis and from 32 (39.5%) of 81 nonappendicitis patients. Excluding the appendicitis patients, the yeast recovery rate was high both for patients hospitalized at the time of the perforation (45%) and for nonhospitalized patients (32%). The overall mortality was 11% (12 patients). Single-dose intraoperative fluconazole prophylaxis did not reach a statistically significant effect on mortality (4 of 53 patients in the fluconazole group and 8 of 56 patients in the placebo group died [p = .059]). The only two explanatory variables significantly related to death were a intraoperative finding of yeast from an intra-abdominal specimen and the occurrence of a spontaneous perforation in a patient already hospitalized for nonsurgical cancer treatment. Detection of yeast was also a significant explanatory variable for a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, intensive care treatment, and prolonged use of a central venous catheter.

Conclusions

Single-dose intraoperative fluconazole prophylaxis did not have a statistically significant effect on overall mortality (odds ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–1.06; p = .059) in patients with intra-abdominal perforation. The recovery rate of yeast from intraoperative specimens from the abdominal cavity was high (> 30%) and was associated with death and a complicated postoperative course.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^116nangc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Empiric antifungal therapy for Candida spp. is typically not recommended for patients with IAIs, with the exceptions of immunocompromised patients, those with multiple risk factors, and critically ill patients. The guidelines of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and the Critically Ill Patients Study Group of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) suggest empiric antifungal therapy in patients with septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. By contrast, the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) suggest empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of IAI and multiple risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leak, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infection.

Guidelines recommend echinocandins as first-line treatment in for invasive candidiasis. However, their role has been debated. Antifungal resistance is a growing concern in Candida spp. Moreover, echinocandin exposure has been reported to be suboptimal in critically ill patients. Dose adjustments supported by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) (if available) are suggested in treating patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis. The PK and antifungal activity of the three echinocandins: anidulafungin, micafungin, and caspofungin were assessed in ascites fluid and plasma of critically ill adults treated for suspected or proved invasive candidiasis, showing that standard daily doses of anidulafungin, micafungin, and caspofungin may result in ascites fluid concentrations that inhibit proliferation of C. albicans and C. glabrata, but are not fungicidal.

### Β-glucan antigenemia anticipates diagnosis of blood culture-negative intraabdominal candidiasis [^1163K3Z9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

Life-threatening intraabdominal candidiasis (IAC) occurs in 30 to 40% of high-risk surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Although early IAC diagnosis is crucial, blood cultures are negative, and the role of Candida score/colonization indexes is not established.

Objectives

The aim of this prospective Fungal Infection Network of Switzerland (FUNGINOS) cohort study was to assess accuracy of 1,3-β-d-glucan (BG) antigenemia for diagnosis of IAC.

Methods

Four hundred thirty-four consecutive adults with abdominal surgery or acute pancreatitis and ICU stay 72 hours or longer were screened: 89 (20.5%) at high risk for IAC were studied (68 recurrent gastrointestinal tract perforation, 21 acute necrotizing pancreatitis). Diagnostic accuracy of serum BG (Fungitell), Candida score, and colonization indexes was compared.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifty-eight of 89 (65%) patients were colonized by Candida; 29 of 89 (33%) presented IAC (27 of 29 with negative blood cultures). Nine hundred twenty-one sera were analyzed (9/patient): median BG was 253 pg/ml (46–9,557) in IAC versus 99 pg/ml (8–440) in colonization (P < 0.01). Sensitivity and specificity of two consecutive BG measurements greater than or equal to 80 pg/ml were 65 and 78%, respectively. In recurrent gastrointestinal tract perforation it was 75 and 77% versus 90 and 38% (Candida score ≥ 3), 79 and 34% (colonization index ≥ 0.5), and 54 and 63% (corrected colonization index ≥ 0.4), respectively. BG positivity anticipated IAC diagnosis (5 d) and antifungal therapy (6 d). Severe sepsis/septic shock and death occurred in 10 of 11 (91%) and 4 of 11 (36%) patients with BG 400 pg/ml or more versus 5 of 18 (28%, P = 0.002) and 1 of 18 (6%, P = 0.05) with BG measurement less than 400 pg/ml. β-Glucan decreased in IAC responding to therapy and increased in nonresponse.

Conclusions

BG antigenemia is superior to Candida score and colonization indexes and anticipates diagnosis of blood culture-negative IAC. This proof-of-concept observation in strictly selected high-risk surgical ICU patients deserves investigation of BG-driven preemptive therapy.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^112Van1w]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with nosocomial intra-abdominal infections should not be treated empirically for MRSA unless the patient has a history of infections by this organism or there is reason to believe that the infection is associated with MRSA.

Appendices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 list recommended antimicrobial regimens.

Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is recommended for patients with nosocomial infections and for critically ill patients with community-acquired infections. An echinocandin regimen is recommended for critically ill patients with nosocomial infections (Recommendation 1B).

Although the epidemiological profile of Candida species has not yet been defined in the context of nosocomial peritonitis, its presence is clinically significant and is usually associated with poor prognoses.

Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is typically not recommended for patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, with the notable exceptions of patients recently exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobials and immunocompromised patients (due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators).

However, considering the high mortality rate of Candida-related peritonitis, and given the poor outcome that could result from inadequate antimicrobial therapy for critically ill patients, antifungal coverage is recommended for these patients

In 2006, Montravers et al. published a retrospective, case–control study involving critically ill patients admitted to 17 French intensive care units (ICUs).

The study demonstrated an increased mortality rate in cases of nosocomial peritonitis in which fungal isolates had been identified (48% and 28% mortality rates for fungal peritonitis and control groups, respectively p < 0.01). Upper gastrointestinal tract sites and positive identification of Candida species were found to be independent variables predictive of mortality for patients with nosocomial peritonitis.

More recently, Montravers et al. published the results of a prospective, non-interventional study involving 271 adult ICU patients with invasive Candida infections who received systemic antifungal therapy; the authors reported a mortality rate of 38% in a prospective cohort of 93 patients admitted to the ICU with candidal peritonitis.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations for antifungal therapy optimisation in the treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis [^113qT8Lx]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) is one of the most common of invasive candidiasis observed in critically ill patients. It is associated with high mortality, with up to 50% of deaths attributable to delays in source control and/or the introduction of antifungal therapy. Currently, there is no comprehensive guidance on optimising antifungal dosing in the treatment of IAC among the critically ill. However, this form of abdominal sepsis presents specific pharmacokinetic (PK) alterations and pharmacodynamic (PD) challenges that risk suboptimal antifungal exposure at the site of infection in critically ill patients. This review aims to describe the peculiarities of IAC from both PK and PD perspectives, advocating an individualized approach to antifungal dosing. Additionally, all current PK/PD studies relating to IAC are reviewed in terms of strength and limitations, so that core elements for the basis of future research can be provided.

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^115kNLhB]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Regardless of the available antifungals, intraabdominal candidiasis (IAC) mortality continues to be high and represents a challenge for clinicians.

Main body

This opinion paper discusses alternative antifungal options for treating IAC. This clinical entity should be addressed separately from candidemia due to the peculiarity of the required penetration of antifungals into the peritoneal cavity. Intraabdominal concentrations may be further restricted in critically ill patients where pathophysiological facts alter normal drug distribution. Echinocandins are recommended as first-line treatment in guidelines for invasive candidiasis. However, considering published data, our pharmacodynamic analysis suggests the required increase of doses, postulated by some authors, to attain adequate pharmacokinetic (PK) levels in peritoneal fluid. Given the limited evidence in the literature on PK/PD-based treatments of IAC, an algorithm is proposed to guide antifungal treatment. Liposomal amphotericin B is advocated as first-line therapy in patients with sepsis/septic shock presenting candidemia or endophthalmitis, or with prior exposure to echinocandins and/or fluconazole, or with infections by Candida glabrata. Other situations and alternatives, such as new compounds or combination therapy, are also analysed.

Conclusion

There is a critical need for more robust clinical trials, studies examining patient heterogeneity and surveillance of antifungal resistance to enhance patient care and optimise treatment outcomes. Such evidence will help refine the existing guidelines and contribute to a more personalised and effective approach to treating this serious medical condition. Meanwhile, it is suggested to broaden the consideration of other options, such as liposomal amphotericin B, as first-line treatment until the results of the fungogram are available and antifungal stewardship could be implemented to prevent the development of resistance.

HA-IAI empiric antifungal therapy — We recommend an echinocandin (anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin) for empiric antifungal therapy of HA-IAI in severely ill patients considered at risk for infection from Candida spp. (Grade 1-B). We suggest fluconazole can be used for empiric antifungal therapy in less severely ill patients with HA-IAI considered at risk for infections from Candida spp. (Grade 2-B). We suggest an echinocandin or voriconazole for empiric antifungal therapy of patients with HA-IAI considered at risk for infection because of a fluconazole-resistant non-C. albicans strain (Grade 2-B).

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^112Hkq1n]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

C. albicans was the most common fungal isolate among intra-abdominal surgery patients with candidemia, followed closely by C. glabrata.
The percentage of nonalbicans Candida species was disproportionately high among intra-abdominal surgery patients treated with fluconazole prophylaxis.
The shifting epidemiology of fungal species in intra-abdominal infections and the potential for selection pressure has significant implications to prophylaxis therapy and the empiric treatment of those with suspected infection.
More than 60% of patients did not receive appropriate antifungal therapy based on timing and selection of antifungal agent.

PK/PD principles for optimisation of IAC treatment

The management of IAC is a complex scenario where conditions other than the antifungal treatment (the patient's condition, age, infection site, an early and adequate control of the infectious source, etc.) are determining factors for the outcome. A recent study analysing the real-life management of this entity showed that not all patients with Candida peritonitis received antifungal treatment in real clinical practice. This review does not intend to analyse when antifungal treatment should be initiated based on the risk factors for invasive candidiasis or diagnostic methods, as have been addressed in other published articles. Rather, it aims to focus on, once the decision to initiate an antifungal treatment has been made, what criteria should be followed to ensure the best treatment option.

To maximise antimicrobial efficacy and minimise the emergence of resistance, the treating drug should attain adequate concentrations in the site of infection. This simple concept limits the inference of the information obtained in bloodstream infections to the intraabdominal site. Being the central compartment, the bloodstream represents the easiest site for drug monitoring and PK/PD assessment of drug efficacy. Nevertheless, PK variability is frequent in critically ill patients due to different factors. In the critically ill patient, there is great variability in pharmacokinetic parameters, and there may be an increase in the volume of distribution and renal clearance in the initial phases of the patient with cIAIs. These changes may particularly affect hydrophilic drugs such as beta-lactams and echinocandins. If dosing is not readjusted in the presence of these changes, drug concentrations will not be sufficient to cover pathogens exhibiting less susceptibility to the treating drug, thus favouring the emergence of resistant mutants. To further complicate dosing, in cIAIs there is an impaired tissue penetration which, together with the presence of indwelling surgical drains, may alter drug PK. Other important covariates in altering effective drug concentrations are body weight, serum albumin concentrations and application of extracorporeal treatments.

Critical patients with fungal infections are at the highest need for optimal therapy since a deficient state of the immune system is an underlying condition for infection. Thus, in critically ill patients with IAC, where all the above-mentioned risk factors for suboptimal treatment and elevated mortality are frequently present, the main target to ensure an adequate coverage of the infecting species is to attain optimal antifungal concentrations in peritoneal fluid.

### Combination of serum and peritoneal 1.3-β-D-glucan can rule out intra-abdominal candidiasis in surgical critically ill patients: a multicenter prospective study [^117RxemB]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

Critically ill patients with nosocomial secondary peritonitis and a peritonitis score ≥ 3 are a population of interest for intra-abdominal candidiasis studies, with a prevalence of 44%.
The combination of serum and peritoneal 1.3-beta-d-glucan with the peritonitis score emerged as a potent strategy for effectively excluding intra-abdominal candidiasis and thereby minimizing unnecessary exposure to antifungal agents.

Regarding preventative measures for invasive candidiasis, more specifically with respect to prophylaxis after abdominal surgery, ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend to administer fluconazole prophylaxis with a 12 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg once daily in patients with recent abdominal surgery and recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakages.

### Clinical trials of antifungal prophylaxis among patients undergoing surgery [^116PzXTV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Invasive mycoses have emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological studies have shown that surgery services have the highest rate of Candida infections in the hospital. In addition to classical risk factors, heavy Candida colonization, recurrent gastrointestinal perforations, and acute pancreatitis are frequently associated with invasive candidiasis. Because prompt initiation of antifungal therapy is critical for cure but difficult to accomplish, prevention of fungal infections may play an important role in this clinical setting; however, few prophylactic or preemptive studies have been done to date. The choice, route of administration, and dose of the antifungal and comparator regimens and the use of clinically relevant and robust study end points are critical for the trial design. Various criteria have been used to identify patients at risk of candidiasis: surgical condition, presence of multiple risk factors, colonization indexes, or expected length of stay in the intensive care unit. Some are not selective enough, and others are time consuming and expensive. Rigorous selection of high-risk patients is crucial to optimize the risk-benefit ratio of preventive antifungal strategies. The aim is to maximize chances of reducing morbidity and mortality while minimizing treatment costs, exposure of low-risk patients to adverse events, and emergence of resistant fungal strains.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^1163dVd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

There was a good overall consistency in the results, without significant heterogeneity. The use of prophylactic fluconazole was associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with candidaemia (RR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.06–0.72, P = 0.01; I² = 0%) and fungal infections other than lower urinary tract infection (RR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.24–0.65, P = 0.0003; I² = 0%), but was associated with no significant difference in hospital mortality (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.62–1.08, P = 0.15; I² = 7%) (Figures 2, 3, 4). The proportion of patients requiring systemic amphotericin B as a rescue therapy for systemic fungal infection was lower after prophylactic use of fluconazole (RR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.17–0.72, P = 0.004; I² = 0%). The proportion of patients colonised with or infected with fluconazole-resistant fungi (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.22–1.96, P = 0.46; I² = 0%) (Figure 5) and the proportion of patients with adverse events leading to cessation of the study drug (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.22–2.58, P = 0.65; I² = 0%) were not different between the fluconazole group and the placebo group. The total length of hospital stay was no different between the fluconazole group and the placebo group (weight mean difference = -0.4 days, 95% CI = -10.35 to 9.54, P = 0.94; I² = 52.4%).

Excluding one study with unclear allocation concealment and one study that recruited some medical patients did not affect the magnitude and significance of the results. None of the studies included a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Five studies received financial grant or drug support from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – of which three studies stated explicitly that the funding agency was not involved in the collection and analyses of the data.

Intra-abdominal infections

Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) — which refers to the extension of the disease process beyond the initial focus of infection, e.g. diffuse peritonitis after diverticulitis — are typically diagnosed before ICU admission but may also develop during ICU stay, often after surgery (80). cIAI is typically polymicrobial, with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Among gram-negative pathogens, Enterobacterales are most common, and non-fermenting pathogens such as Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter spp. are not as frequent as in respiratory or bloodstream infections. Enterococci are particularly prevalent in critically ill patients with cIAI — they represent roughly half of the gram-positive isolates. However, anaerobic bacteria may be difficult to culture.

While sampling the source of infection is only done at a later stage during a procedure to control the source of infection (either percutaneous drainage or open surgical approach), empirical antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed. Blood cultures should be taken, but the relevance of sampling abdominal drains is limited. Empiric therapy should cover a wide spectrum of pathogens, e.g. a broad-spectrum beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination or a carbapenem, adapted to the local ecology. However, in the therapy of Enterococci, some strains may not be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, particularly after recent exposure to drugs from this class, and empirical therapy with glycopeptides or oxazolidinones should be considered. When using empiric carbapenem treatment, it is essential to confirm enterococcus susceptibility.

Critically patients with cIAI often have multiple risk factors for invasive candidiasis, and empirical antifungal therapy is generally recommended for the most severely ill. In a recent global study, fungi were involved in 13% of the patients, with Candida albicans isolated in two-thirds of those patients. Either azoles or echinocandins can be used empirically, based on the severity of illness, local epidemiology and previous exposure to antifungal drugs.

Controlling the source of the infection is essential, and should be pursued as soon as logistically possible. Percutaneous drainage is preferred if the infection is localized and no ongoing contamination of the abdomen is present.

### What's new in the clinical and diagnostic management of invasive candidiasis in critically ill patients [^113nyT1z]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a severe complication in the ICU setting. A high proportion of ICU patients become colonized with Candida species, but only 5–30% develop IC. Progressive colonization and major abdominal surgery are well-known risk factors for Candida infection. IC is difficult to predict and early diagnosis remains a major challenge. In addition, microbiological documentation often occurs late in the course of infection. Delays in initiating appropriate treatment have been associated with increased mortality. In an attempt to decrease Candida-related mortality, an increasing number of critically ill patients without documented IC receive empirical systemic antifungal therapy, leading to concern for antifungal overuse. Scores/predictive rules permit the stratification and selection of IC high-risk patients who may benefit from early antifungal therapy. However, they have a far better negative predictive value than positive predictive value. New IC biomarkers [mannan, anti-mannan, (1,3)-β-D-glucan, and polymerase chain reaction] are being increasingly used to enable earlier diagnosis and, ideally, to provide prognostic information and/or therapeutic monitoring. Although reasonably sensitive and specific, these techniques remain largely investigational, and their clinical usefulness has yet to be established.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy for the prevention of invasive candidiasis following gastrointestinal surgery for intra-abdominal infections [^115tbti3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy

In the FAS, the IDRB-confirmed IC incidence at EOT was 8.9% (n = 11) for placebo and 11.1% (n = 13) for micafungin, for an estimated difference of 2.24% (95% CI, −5.52 to 10.20) (Table 2). The Candida species are listed in Table 3. Most infections occurred in NAI patients; 9 of 11 in the placebo arm and 11 of 13 in the micafungin arm. There was no difference between treatment groups in the median time to IDRB-confirmed IC; the time ratio of micafungin relative to placebo was 0.69 (95% CI,.34–1.38). The Kaplan–Meier failure curves are displayed in Figure 2. For patients without an IDRB-confirmed IC, the most common EOT event was sufficient improvement in surgical condition (Table 4). The results obtained in the PPS for incidence (Table 2) and time to IDRB-confirmed IC (time ratio of micafungin relative to placebo, 0.80, 95% CI,.26–2.50) were consistent with those in the FAS.

### Recent developments in the surgical management of complex intra-abdominal infection [^115cAanp]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidance on the management of sepsis often applies to infection originating from abdominal or pelvic sources, which presents specific challenges and opportunities for efficient and rapid source control. Advances made in the past decade are presented in this article.

Methods

A qualitative systematic review was undertaken by searching standard literature databases for English-language studies presenting original data on the clinical management of abdominal and pelvic complex infection in adults over the past 10 years. High-quality studies relevant to five topical themes that emerged during review were included.

Results

Important developments and promising preliminary work are presented, relating to: imaging and other diagnostic modalities; antimicrobial therapy and the importance of antimicrobial stewardship; the particular challenges posed by fungal sepsis; novel techniques in percutaneous and endoscopic source control; and current issues relating to surgical source control and managing the abdominal wound. Logistical challenges relating to rapid access to cross-sectional imaging, interventional radiology and operating theatres need to be addressed so that international benchmarks can be met.

Conclusion

Important advances have been made in the diagnosis, non-operative and surgical control of abdominal or pelvic sources, which may improve outcomes in the future. Important areas for continued research include the diagnosis and therapy of fungal infection and the challenges of managing the open abdomen.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^116hMzcm]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society revised guidelines — antifungal therapy for intra-abdominal candidiasis: Do not use amphotericin B or its lipid formulations routinely for empiric or pathogen-directed management of intra-abdominal candidiasis in adults or children (Grade 2-B). Consider use of fluconazole for preemptive and pathogen-directed therapy of susceptible strains of Candida albicans in non-critically ill adults and children (Grade 2-B). Consider use of voriconazole for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of fluconazole-non-susceptible strains of Candida in non-critically ill adults and in children older than one month of age (Grade 2-B). Use an echinocandin (anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin) for empiric or pathogen-directed treatment of infections from Candida spp. in severely ill adults and children (Grade 1-B).

### Therapeutic dilemma of fluconazole prophylaxis in intensive care [^112F6QVB]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the data concerning the use of prophylactic fluconazole in intensive care patients who are not immunocompromised.

Data Source

Literature identified through MEDLINE (1966-March 2001) and recent abstracts of data presented at scientific meetings.

Data Synthesis

The use of fluconazole as a prophylactic antifungal agent is well documented in patients who are immunocompromised or undergoing bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, with supportive results. Recently published data suggest that the use of fluconazole in high-risk surgical patients can be safe and effective for preventing certain candida infections. However, there is growing evidence that the use of fluconazole may be contributing to the higher prevalence of fluconazole-resistant fungal infections.

Conclusions

The use of prophylactic fluconazole in nonneutropenic patients is controversial. Retrospective and surveillance studies of nosocomial fungal infections suggest that the use of fluconazole may be contributing to the shift in fungal flora causing these infections and that the isolates are more fluconazole resistant. Fluconazole prophylaxis in surgical patients may be justified in patients who are at the greatest risk of developing fungal infections, those requiring multiple intraabdominal surgeries, or those with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakages, but there is a lack of randomized controlled trials to recommend its widespread use at this time.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations for antifungal therapy optimisation in the treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis [^115Yt4wm]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Due to the specific pathophysiology and associated interventions, IAC must be considered differently compared to other forms of invasive candidiasis such as candidemia. High-quality PK/PD studies are required to better describe the rate of antifungal target attainment in both plasma and peritoneal fluid, during and after the surgery, and when the patient is transferred to the ICU. The lack of intra-operative data is a current weakness. Proposed PK/PD targets, derived mostly from animal models, have yet to be validated in the critically ill population. To study the impact of antifungal PK/PD target attainment on clinical outcomes, larger sample sizes and multicentre studies are needed. In the meantime, antifungal TDM in critically ill patients with IAC should be considered, especially in cases of high prevalence of non- albicans species or when fluconazole is prescribed. Regarding the interest in new antifungals, studies involving critically ill patients coupled with rigorous PK/PD analysis are warranted before a more widespread use.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^1123V5L4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Azole antifungal agents are not recommended as empiric therapy because activity against non- albicans Candida spp. is not universal. Isavuconazole penetration into ascites fluid is variable. Overall success of treatment with isavuconazole in cases of intra-abdominal candidiasis depends on the interplay of the susceptibility of the isolate, the immune status of the host, and possibly other factors yet to be elucidated. Whereas azoles are not considered first-choice therapy due to the possibility of resistance and numerous drug-drug interactions (especially with fluconazole), an alternative may be lipid formulations of amphotericin B. The IDSA guidelines recommend the use of a standard-dose echinocandin as initial therapy, and a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3–5 mg/kg daily) for patients with suspected azole- and echinocandin-resistant Candida infections. The ESICM/ESCMID guidelines make a "strong" recommendation for the use of echinocandins and a "moderate" strength recommendation for lipid-formulation amphotericin B (L-amB). Recently, a single 5 mg/kg/kg administration of L-amB whilst waiting for the result of 1,3-beta-D-glucan testing was reported to be safe and cost-effective in a single-center experience.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgical-site infections… [^1154nKSp]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The National Surgical Infection Prevention Project aims to reduce mortality and morbidity from surgical-site infections by promoting appropriate use of prophylactic antimicrobials in surgical practice. National experts have developed performance measures to monitor the appropriate initiation, selection, and discontinuation of prophylactic antimicrobials in surgery. The project monitors Medicare patients undergoing procedures for which antimicrobials are clearly indicated, such as open-chest and vascular surgery, abdominal and colorectal procedures, hip and knee arthroplasty, and vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy. The project's initial recommendations recently have been revised by an expert panel. After reviewing the timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis, the panel recommends that the agent be administered as near as possible to the time of incision.

The infusion of the first dose should begin 60 minutes or less before the incision, with the exception of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin; with these agents, the infusion should be initiated 120 minutes before incision to minimize antibiotic-associated reactions. Administration at the time of anesthesia induction appears to result in safe and adequate drug levels in tissues. If a tourniquet is required, the antimicrobial infusion should be completed before the tourniquet is inflated. The choice of antimicrobial agent is based on drug effectiveness and patient-related factors, particularly potential adverse effects. Drug allergies may be poorly documented. The patient's medical history should identify true allergy or severe adverse drug reaction to avoid denying a patient the agent of choice because of false evidence of adverse reaction. Skin testing may be necessary to establish allergic status.

Whenever possible, a single antimicrobial agent is recommended, with the choice based on the type of surgery. The use of vancomycin has not been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of methicillin-resistant. Staphylococcus aureus. Nasal mupirocin can reduce nasal carriage of S. aureus but has not been shown to reduce rates of surgery-related infection. Postoperative antibiotic use for more than 24 hours and discharge to a long-term care facility are the only factors associated with development of MRSA infection at the surgical site. Vancomycin is indicated, however, for surgical prophylaxis in patients already colonized with MRSA.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^113MmtHS]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Healthcare-associated intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) with Candida — risk stratification and empiric antifungal therapy are described as follows: Studies that have more closely examined specific risk factors for Candida peritonitis have identified recurrent gastrointestinal perforations, upper gastrointestinal perforations, surgically treated pancreatitis, and previous receipt of antimicrobial therapy as predisposing factors for HA-IAI from Candida spp., and colonization with Candida at multiple sites has been used to identify patients at high risk of an invasive candidal infection. Mortality rates of 20%–64% have been recorded in patients with HA-IAI from Candida spp. Given these data, echinocandins are generally recommended for empiric therapy in patients with HA-IAI considered to be at high risk for an infection with Candida spp. that risks progression, whereas for patients who are less critically ill, the task force suggests that empiric fluconazole should suffice in most patients; historically, amphotericin B was the primary antifungal agent used to treat patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis; however, use of this agent has fallen into disfavor because of its toxicity. It is not currently recommended except when other, less toxic, agents cannot be used to manage the infection. Thus, voriconazole or an echinocandin are options in patients at risk for or known to be colonized or infected with a fluconazole-resistant species of Candida. We suggest that patients with HA-IAI because of upper gastrointestinal perforations, recurrent bowel perforations, or surgically treated pancreatitis, those who have received prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and those who are known to be heavily colonized with Candida be considered at increased risk for infection from Candida spp. (Grade 2-B), and we suggest that patients with HA-IAI found to have yeast on a Gram stain of infected peritoneal fluid or tissue be considered to have a candidal infection (Grade 2-B).
