## Question

what is superior for cardiovascular prevent statins or repatha

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statins or Repatha (evolocumab) is superior for cardiovascular prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are comparing monotherapy head-to-head or add-on therapy to statins. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for statins across primary and secondary prevention. Next, I will examine the magnitude of LDL-C lowering and outcomes with evolocumab in FOURIER and related analyses. After that, I need to check guideline positions and where PCSK9 inhibitors fit in the treatment pathway. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety, cost, and synthesize a practical recommendation anchored to absolute risk reduction and patient-specific factors [^116RRBuT].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Statins are first-line therapy for LDL-C lowering and ASCVD risk reduction, whereas evolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor typically used as add-on therapy when LDL-C remains above guideline thresholds on maximally tolerated statins, or in selected statin-intolerant patients; there are no large head-to-head monotherapy trials comparing evolocumab versus statins, so most outcome data for evolocumab are on a background of statin therapy, which I should keep in mind as I interpret benefits and limitations [^113gfXPX] [^111AMhSt] [^113PiZJb].

> I will now examine the statin evidence base. Statins have decades of randomized data showing consistent relative risk reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events of about 20–30% in secondary prevention and meaningful absolute risk reductions in primary prevention, with favorable safety profiles and mortality benefits in secondary prevention; this is why guidelines position statins as foundational therapy across risk strata, and I should confirm that this remains the benchmark before considering add-on therapy [^113puV6h] [^1173F1By] [^115ie6CG].

> Next, I should review evolocumab's LDL-C lowering and outcomes. In FOURIER, evolocumab added to statins reduced LDL-C by about 59% to a median of 30 mg/dL and reduced the composite primary endpoint by 15% and the key secondary endpoint of CV death/MI/stroke by 20% over a median 2.2 years; importantly, total cardiovascular events fell by 18%, and benefits accrued over time with a legacy effect seen in FOURIER-OLE, including a 23% reduction in cardiovascular death with longer follow-up, which strengthens confidence in durable clinical benefit despite modest absolute risk reduction in the parent trial [^1134zV2k] [^116wMssM] [^112b7vFF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality. I initially thought FOURIER showed a significant mortality reduction, but wait, let me verify the original trial results; the NEJM FOURIER publication reported significant reductions in MACE without a statistically significant reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality during the randomized phase, whereas the mortality signal emerged in the open-label extension, so I should correct that interpretation and emphasize that the mortality benefit is supported by longer-term follow-up rather than the initial 2.2-year randomized period [^1134zV2k] [^112b7vFF].

> I need to check subgroup effects that might shift the risk–benefit balance. Benefits with evolocumab appear greater in patients with higher baseline LDL-C, in those with recent myocardial infarction, and in older adults, with FOURIER-OLE showing a larger absolute risk reduction in patients aged 75 and older; conversely, in patients with lower baseline LDL-C on statins, absolute risk reductions are smaller, which aligns with the principle that the magnitude of LDL-C lowering tracks with event reduction and that earlier initiation in very high-risk patients yields greater absolute benefit [^114JKVzm] [^115ENj8T] [^111JopTj].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my interpretation aligns with standards of care. Contemporary ACC/AHA and ESC guidance endorse a stepwise approach: maximize statin therapy, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains above threshold, and then add a PCSK9 inhibitor for very high-risk ASCVD patients who are still above LDL-C thresholds; specifically, thresholds of ≥ 70 mg/dL in ASCVD and ≥ 55 mg/dL in very high-risk ASCVD trigger consideration of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, and this sequencing reflects both efficacy and cost-effectiveness considerations [^1168xKwM] [^111AMhSt] [^11694MBQ].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability. Evolocumab has a favorable safety profile without excess neurocognitive events, hemorrhagic stroke, or new-onset diabetes in long-term follow-up, with injection-site reactions being the most common adverse effect; importantly, achieving very low LDL-C levels down to 30 mg/dL or even lower has not been associated with harm in these trials, which supports aggressive LDL-C lowering in appropriate patients [^112b7vFF] [^113DKmHK] [^113PiZJb].

> But wait, what about primary prevention and cost. There are no large dedicated primary prevention outcomes trials for PCSK9 inhibitors, and current primary prevention guidance does not recommend routine PCSK9 inhibitor use; cost remains a major barrier, with estimates suggesting very high cost per event prevented in low-risk populations, so PCSK9 inhibitors are generally reserved for secondary prevention or very high-risk primary prevention scenarios such as familial hypercholesterolemia where LDL-C remains markedly elevated despite maximally tolerated therapy [^115EMi9w] [^114wAGUh] [^115Tzbbe].

> Let me synthesize the comparative answer carefully. Statins remain superior as first-line therapy because of their broad, guideline-supported evidence base, mortality benefit in secondary prevention, oral administration, low cost, and decades of safety data; evolocumab is not "superior" to statins in isolation, but when added to statins in appropriately selected high-risk patients, it achieves greater LDL-C lowering and provides incremental reductions in cardiovascular events, with the clearest benefits in those with higher baseline LDL-C, recent ACS or MI, and very high-risk ASCVD phenotypes [^113gfXPX] [^1134zV2k] [^111AMhSt].

> Practically, I should double-check the treatment pathway. Start with high-intensity statin, reassess lipids in 4–12 weeks, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains above threshold, and then consider evolocumab for patients who remain above LDL-C thresholds or who are statin-intolerant and at very high risk; this stepwise approach balances efficacy, safety, and cost while targeting the patients most likely to realize meaningful absolute risk reductions from PCSK9 inhibition [^11694MBQ] [^111AMhSt].

> In conclusion, statins are superior as foundational therapy for cardiovascular prevention, and evolocumab is a valuable add-on for high-risk patients who fail to reach LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins, with the greatest absolute benefit in those with higher baseline LDL-C, recent cardiovascular events, or very high-risk ASCVD; there is no head-to-head evidence that evolocumab monotherapy outperforms statins, and guideline-concordant sequencing remains the most evidence-based strategy [^1168xKwM] [^1134zV2k] [^111AMhSt].

Statins remain the **cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention** because of their proven mortality benefit, long-term safety, and cost-effectiveness [^113puV6h] [^1157jmu3]. Repatha (evolocumab) is reserved as **add-on therapy** for patients who cannot achieve LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins or are statin-intolerant, providing additional LDL-C lowering and event reduction but without proven mortality benefit in randomized trials [^1134zV2k] [^113Mad8F]. Repatha is not superior to statins for primary prevention and should not replace them; it is best used as adjunctive therapy in high-risk or statin-intolerant patients [^111AMhSt] [^116BNDXU].

## Mechanisms of action and lipid-lowering efficacy

### Statins

Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, increasing LDL receptors and lowering LDL-C by 30–50% on average. They also provide modest triglyceride reductions and modest HDL increases.

---

### Repatha (evolocumab)

Evolocumab is a human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9 that increases LDL receptor recycling and lowers LDL-C by ~60% on average, with additional reductions in apoB and Lp(a) [^1163nGa1] [^1168xKwM].

---

## Clinical evidence for cardiovascular outcomes

### Statins

Extensive evidence shows statins reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in both primary and secondary prevention [^113puV6h] [^111odpo2]. Meta-analyses show a consistent ~20–30% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [^111E4MJq].

---

### Repatha (evolocumab)

- The FOURIER trial showed evolocumab reduced MACE by 15% (HR 0.85) in ASCVD patients on statins, but **no significant reduction in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality** [^1134zV2k] [^116JSRhf].
- The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial showed alirocumab reduced MACE by 15% and **reduced all-cause mortality**, but this does not establish mortality benefit for evolocumab [^111AMhSt].
- Long-term FOURIER-OLE suggested lower cardiovascular death with earlier evolocumab, but this was not a prespecified mortality trial [^112b7vFF].

---

## Safety profiles

### Statins

Statins are generally well tolerated; muscle symptoms occur in ~5–10% and serious adverse events are rare. They have a long-standing safety record in diverse populations [^notfound].

---

### Repatha (evolocumab)

Repatha is well tolerated; common adverse effects are injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory infections. Serious adverse events are uncommon and rates are similar to placebo in trials [^1134zV2k].

## Patient populations and clinical guidelines

| **Patient population** | **Statins** | **Repatha (evolocumab)** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary prevention | First-line therapy; strong evidence for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality [^113puV6h] | Not recommended as first-line; limited evidence for primary prevention [^116RRBuT] |
| Secondary prevention | First-line therapy; strong evidence for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality [^111odpo2] | Recommended as add-on therapy for patients not achieving LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins or who are statin-intolerant [^114mdBNZ] |
| Statin intolerance | Alternative therapies (e.g. ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) may be considered [^112n4atM] | Effective alternative for patients unable to tolerate statins [^115wFYD8] |
| Very high-risk patients (e.g. recent ACS, familial hypercholesterolemia) | First-line therapy; consider early addition of non-statin therapies if LDL-C goals are not met [^11694MBQ] | Recommended as add-on therapy to achieve aggressive LDL-C lowering targets [^1168xKwM] |

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Statins are highly cost-effective and available as low-cost generics. Repatha is significantly more expensive, which limits routine use; cost-effectiveness improves in very high-risk patients who cannot achieve LDL-C goals with statins alone [^116hPLWh].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Parameter** | **Statins** | **Repatha (evolocumab)** |
|-|-|-|
| LDL-C reduction | 30–50% | ~60% |
| Cardiovascular events | Significant reduction | Significant reduction |
| Mortality benefit | Yes | No (except in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES with alirocumab) |
| Safety | Well established | Well tolerated |
| Cost-effectiveness | High | Limited |
| Clinical guidelines | First-line therapy | Add-on therapy |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- Statins remain the cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention due to proven mortality benefit, long-term safety, and cost-effectiveness [^1157jmu3].
- Repatha is recommended as add-on therapy for patients who cannot achieve LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins or are statin-intolerant [^111AMhSt].
- Repatha is not recommended as a replacement for statins in primary prevention due to limited evidence and cost considerations [^116RRBuT].
- The choice between statins and Repatha should be individualized based on patient risk, LDL-C levels, tolerance, and cost.

### Efficacy and safety of evolocumab in statin-treated patients with cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jBkmN]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of evolocumab in statin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk, focusing on changes in LDL-C, TG, ApoB, HDL-C, and Lp(a) after 12weeks.

Methods

A comprehensive search identified randomized controlled trials comparing evolocumab to placebo in adults on statin therapy. Studies reporting baseline and 12-week lipid and safety data were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Random-effects models were used to calculate mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Five trials with 4,009 participants were analyzed. Evolocumab significantly reduced LDL-C (MD: -64.67; 95% CI: -66.72 to -62.61), TG, ApoB, and Lp(a), and increased HDL-C. No significant difference was observed in total TEAEs (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.14) or serious TEAEs (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.89) versus placebo.

Conclusions

Evolocumab offers robust lipid-lowering benefits with a safety profile comparable to placebo in statin-treated patients. Limitations include short follow-up and variable statin regimens. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm cardiovascular outcome benefits.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab in high-risk patients receiving a statin: secondary analysis of patients with low LDL cholesterol levels and in those already receiving a maximal-potency statin in a randomized clinical trial [^114GnPmP]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease focus on high-intensity statins and targeting or using a threshold low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of less than 70 mg/dL for the highest-risk patients. Whether further reduction of LDL-C beyond these boundaries would be beneficial is unknown.

Objective

To compare outcomes of evolocumab vs placebo in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL and in those receiving background treatment with a maximal-potency statin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary ad hoc analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial compared randomized treatments in 2 subgroups of patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently receiving statin. Patients were classified by a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and by statin intensity (maximal: atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg/d, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d; submaximal: all other dosages). Patients with baseline LDL of less than 70 mg/dL either had a final screening LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL or a final screening non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg/dL. Data were retrieved from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed in 2017 based on intention to treat.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety outcomes included adverse events and events of interest identified in the FOURIER trial. Interaction testing was used to assess the consistency of results in patients who did vs did not satisfy the above criteria.

Results

A total of 27 564 patients (75.4% men and 24.6% women; mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years) were included in the analysis. Of 2034 patients (7.4%) who had a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL, evolocumab reduced the risk for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60–1.07) to a similar degree as in the 25 529 patients who had baseline LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92; p = 0.65 for interaction; 1 patient was missing baseline LDL-C data). Of 7533 patients (27.3%) receiving maximal-potency statins, evolocumab significantly reduced the primary endpoint (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98) to a similar degree as in the 20 031 patients not receiving a maximal-potency statin (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93; p = 0.88 for interaction). The key secondary endpoint was reduced to a similar degree in both analyses. No major safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evolocumab was equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease regardless of whether the baseline LDL-C was less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and whether the background statin was of maximal or submaximal potency.

### Emerging innovative therapeutic approaches targeting PCSK9 to lower lipids [^117Unybz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Statins are established therapies for cardiovascular disease prevention and ezetimibe has recently been shown to modestly reduce cardiovascular events when added to background statin therapy. Yet here remains a clear unmet need for additional therapies aimed at lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to further reduce cardiovascular risk. Multiple strategies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition have emerged as effective modalities for LDL-C lowering. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are the farthest along in clinical development and alirocumab and evolocumab were approved for clinical use by regulatory agencies in 2015. In addition to robust LDL-C lowering (nearly 50–65% from baseline), they improve other lipid parameters as well. Adverse events associated with these medications are minimal. Importantly, they improve clinical cardiovascular disease outcomes, although long-term study results are awaited. Cost may be an important limiting factor in their use and we propose two possible solutions which can potentially curtail cost.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and cardiovascular outcomes [^115yiyoW]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Dyslipidemia, particularly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a key risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and lipid-lowering drugs are beneficial for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. While statins are clear first-line drugs, new drug developments such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes when added to statins. Evolocumab reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ASCVD when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy (± ezetimibe), and recent data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial indicate that alirocumab added to maximally tolerated statin therapy (± other lipid-lowering drugs) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. In this article the authors review the available data on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes. Areas covered: This article reviews the available data on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on CV outcomes. Relevant papers were identified from a search of PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Expert opinion: The authors conclude that PCSK9 inhibitors provide substantial and durable reductions in LDL-C levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials [^113Lr7s1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lipid‐lowering therapy with statins is highly beneficial for prevention of secondary and high‐risk primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, some patients cannot tolerate recommended statin doses 1; a high proportion of patients do not achieve adequate reduction of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), despite high‐intensity statin therapy 2; and even patients who achieve guideline recommended reductions may have high residual ASCVD risk. 3 Consequently, alternative therapies designed to lower LDL‐C and improve outcomes are needed. Improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were observed recently with combination treatment with ezetimibe; however, these improvements were modest, and outcome data on monotherapy with ezetimibe are limited. 4 The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab have been associated with reduction of LDL‐C levels and recently with improved cardiovascular outcomes in the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial. 5 However, questions remain about the patients who are most likely to derive the greatest clinical benefits and the safety profile of this class of drugs. We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the cumulative evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors, with an emphasis on cardiovascular outcomes.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^114qnsoK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels with statins reduces the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 The IMPROVE‐IT trial 7 substantiates that LDL‐C reduction with nonstatin therapy further reduces risk of CVD, although the absolute reduction in cardiovascular events was small because of modest LDL‐C lowering with ezetimibe on top of a statin. 8 There remains, however, a population of high‐risk patients who have elevated LDL‐C despite statin therapy and who have residual risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. 9 As a result, there is an unmet need for new therapies to provide this high‐risk population with incremental LDL‐C reduction beyond that which can be achieved by statins and other oral lipid‐lowering therapies. Moreover, there is evidence that the lower LDL‐C achieved provides further risk reduction. 10, 11

Produced mostly in the liver, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in plasma binds to hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface and targets them for degradation, thereby decreasing the number of LDL receptors and increasing LDL‐C levels. PCSK9 was identified as a target when people with variants that upregulated or downregulated this protein led to, respectively, greater and lesser risk of cardiovascular events. 6 The PCSK9 inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab were recently approved for LDL‐C reduction when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

To date there are no head‐to‐head studies comparing the LDL‐C–lowering capacity of PCSK9 inhibitors to each other. In the absence of such trials indirect treatment comparisons and network meta‐analyses based on a robust systematic literature review can inform evidence‐based healthcare decision making. 12 Within network meta‐analyses, indirect treatment comparison allows the comparison of 2 therapies that share a common comparator, 13 whereas mixed treatment comparison allows a combination of direct and indirect evidence. 14, 15

### Cost-effectiveness of LDL-C lowering with evolocumab in patients with high cardiovascular risk in the United States [^111E4MJq]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 86 million people in the United States have cardiovascular disease (CVD); it accounts for 1 out of every 3 deaths and remains the leading cause of death. 1 Despite the widespread use of statins, the economic burden associated with CVD is onerous, with > US$650 billion spent on CVD‐related costs annually in the United States. 1, 2 These costs are projected to nearly double by 2030. 1 The cost‐effectiveness of new therapies has become increasingly important as healthcare costs continue to rise and information about making tradeoffs becomes critical.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) has been established as a modifiable risk factor for CVD. A meta‐analysis conducted by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) found that every 38.67‐mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in LDL‐C with statin therapy results in a 21% (statins vs control) and 28% (more vs less statins) reduction in rates of any major CVD event across 26 randomized trials. 3 Results from the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE‐IT) evaluating ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, in reducing major CVD events suggested the CTTC findings that lowering LDL‐C with a nonstatin reduces the risk for a CVD event. 4

Many high‐risk patients cannot adequately reduce LDL‐C levels despite intensive statin therapy. For these patients, addition of available treatment options to the standard of care (SOC) is reasonable. 5 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition has emerged as a new therapy for lowering LDL‐C. The results of the phase 3 trials conducted on evolocumab, a recently approved PCSK9 inhibitor, showed that the addition of evolocumab to SOC led to average reductions in LDL‐C levels of 50% to 70% in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD), 6, 7 as well as statin intolerance. 8 A cardiovascular outcomes trial of evolocumab is ongoing (NCT01764633), but exploratory data from 2 open‐label studies suggest a clinically significant reduction in cardiovascular risk with evolocumab. 9

It is important to assess the economic value of evolocumab to payers in the United States. Economic modeling can provide US payers with information about the value of LDL‐C lowering with evolocumab. We used an economic model to assess the cost‐effectiveness of evolocumab added to SOC vs SOC alone in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Evolocumab for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia [^116hPLWh]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 directed against human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). It is administered by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks or once monthly. Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss the rationale for inhibiting PCSK9 and describe the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and clinical trials with evolocumab. Evolocumab reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 50 to 60% in most patients with and without background treatment with statins or other lipid lowering agents. The safety profile appears satisfactory from the completed clinical studies and concerns regarding the risk of neurocognitive events have largely been dispelled. Expert opinion: The reduction of LDL-C with evolocumab to previously unattainable levels has resulted in a reduction in the composite cardiovascular event endpoint in the FOURIER trial and this is likely to impact on future lipid management guidelines. The clinical outcome data and excellent tolerability profile clearly support the use of evolocumab in patients at high cardiovascular risk, including those with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who are unable to achieve LDL-C targets with statins with or without other lipid-lowering drugs. The high cost of evolocumab will restrict its use, however.

### PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113QaMpz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of effective drug therapies that reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, additional LDL-C reduction may be warranted, especially for patients who are unresponsive to, or unable to take, existing LDL-C-reducing therapies. By inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme, monoclonal antibodies (PCSK9 inhibitors) may further reduce LDL-C, potentially reducing CVD risk as well.

Objectives

Primary To quantify short-term (24 weeks), medium-term (one year), and long-term (five years) effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipid parameters and on the incidence of CVD. Secondary To quantify the safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, with specific focus on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, cognitive function, and cancer. Additionally, to determine if specific patient subgroups were more or less likely to benefit from the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

Search Methods

We identified studies by systematically searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. We also searched Clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and screened the reference lists of included studies. We identified the studies included in this review through electronic literature searches conducted up to May 2016, and added three large trials published in March 2017.

Selection Criteria

All parallel-group and factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up time of at least 24 weeks were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data. When data were available, we calculated pooled effect estimates.

Main Results

We included 20 studies with data on 67,237 participants (median age 61 years; range 52 to 64 years). Twelve trials randomised participants to alirocumab, three trials to bococizumab, one to RG7652, and four to evolocumab. Owing to the small number of trials using agents other than alirocumab, we did not differentiate between types of PCSK9 inhibitors used. We compared PCSK9 inhibitors with placebo (thirteen RCTs), ezetimibe (two RCTs) or ezetimibe and statins (five RCTs). Compared with placebo, PCSK9 inhibitors decreased LDL-C by 53.86% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58.64 to 49.08; eight studies; 4782 participants; GRADE: moderate) at 24 weeks; compared with ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors decreased LDL-C by 30.20% (95% CI 34.18 to 26.23; two studies; 823 participants; GRADE: moderate), and compared with ezetimibe and statins, PCSK9 inhibitors decreased LDL-C by 39.20% (95% CI 56.15 to 22.26; five studies; 5376 participants; GRADE: moderate). Compared with placebo, PCSK9 inhibitors decreased the risk of CVD events, with a risk difference (RD) of 0.91% (odds ratio (OR) of 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.92; eight studies; 59,294 participants; GRADE: moderate). Compared with ezetimibe and statins, PCSK9 inhibitors appeared to have a stronger protective effect on CVD risk, although with considerable uncertainty (RD 1.06%, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; three studies; 4770 participants; GRADE: very low). No data were available for the ezetimibe only comparison. Compared with placebo, PCSK9 probably had little or no effect on mortality (RD 0.03%, OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 12 studies; 60,684 participants; GRADE: moderate). Compared with placebo, PCSK9 inhibitors increased the risk of any adverse events (RD 1.54%, OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.12; 13 studies; 54,204 participants; GRADE: low). Similar effects were observed for the comparison of ezetimibe and statins: RD 3.70%, OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34; four studies; 5376 participants; GRADE: low. Clinical event data were unavailable for the ezetimibe only comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Over short-term to medium-term follow-up, PCSK9 inhibitors reduced LDL-C. Studies with medium-term follow-up time (longest median follow-up recorded was 26 months) reported that PCSK9 inhibitors (compared with placebo) decreased CVD risk but may have increased the risk of any adverse events (driven by SPIRE-1 and -2 trials). Available evidence suggests that PCSK9 inhibitor use probably leads to little or no difference in mortality. Evidence on relative efficacy and safety when PCSK9 inhibitors were compared with active treatments was of low to very low quality (GRADE); follow-up times were short and events were few. Large trials with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate PCSK9 inhibitors versus active treatments as well as placebo. Owing to the predominant inclusion of high-risk patients in these studies, applicability of results to primary prevention is limited. Finally, estimated risk differences indicate that PCSK9 inhibitors only modestly change absolute risks (often to less than 1%).

### 2017 focused update of the 2016 ACC Expert consensus decision pathway on the role of non-statin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on expert consensus decision pathways [^115Da8wV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology published the first expert consensus decision pathway (ECDP) on the role of non-statin therapies for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Since the publication of that document, additional evidence and perspectives have emerged from randomized clinical trials and other sources, particularly considering the longer-term efficacy and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in secondary prevention of ASCVD. Most notably, the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial and SPIRE-1 and -2 (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events), assessing evolocumab and bococizumab, respectively, have published final results of cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with clinical ASCVD and in a smaller number of high-risk primary prevention patients. In addition, further evidence on the types of patients most likely to benefit from the use of ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome has been published. Based on results from these important analyses, the ECDP writing committee judged that it would be desirable to provide a focused update to help guide clinicians more clearly on decision making regarding the use of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities. In the following summary table, changes from the 2016 ECDP to the 2017 ECDP Focused Update are highlighted, and a brief rationale is provided. The content of the full document has been changed accordingly, with more extensive and detailed guidance regarding decision making provided both in the text and in the updated algorithms. Revised recommendations are provided for patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities on statin therapy for secondary prevention. The ECDP writing committee judged that these new data did not warrant changes to the decision pathways and algorithms regarding the use of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in primary prevention patients with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL with or without diabetes mellitus or patients without ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL not due to secondary causes. Based on feedback and further deliberation, the ECDP writing committee down-graded recommendations regarding bile acid sequestrant use, recommending bile acid sequestrants only as optional secondary agents for consideration in patients intolerant to ezetimibe. For clarification, the writing committee has also included new information on diagnostic categories of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, based on clinical criteria with and without genetic testing. Other changes to the original document were kept to a minimum to provide consistent guidance to clinicians, unless there was a compelling reason or new evidence, in which case justification is provided.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^112hpHmd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Based on network meta‐analyses, the PCSK9 inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab were associated with reductions in LDL‐C of 54% to 74% versus placebo and 26% to 46% versus ezetimibe in patients not adequately controlled by statins alone. Recognizing the limitations of indirect comparison, our synthesis of the available data shows a greater reduction with evolocumab in LDL‐C versus alirocumab 75 mg Q2W with evidence also suggesting more intense LDL‐C reduction versus alirocumab 150 mg Q2W. There was some evidence to suggest that evolocumab may also significantly increase HDL‐C and decrease non‐HDL‐C, ApoB, and Lp(a) levels in comparison to alirocumab and other treatments. Further research is needed into the effects of evolocumab and alirocumab on the risk of cardiovascular events.

### Sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes and cholesterol-lowering efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146u7UZ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is a principal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a primary target for preventive therapies. Although statins are the first-line lipid-lowering agents for reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high residual risk remains a concern in many statin-treated patients. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are highlighted in the 2022 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway as adjunctive therapies to statins to be used sooner in high-risk patients to help achieve lower LDL-C goals. Alirocumab and evolocumab are monoclonal antibody PCSK9is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015. In addition to statins, these agents led to dose-dependent reductions in LDL-C levels by up to 60% in clinical trials. For high-risk patients on maximum statin therapy or who are statin intolerant, these agents also reduce nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. What is unclear is if there are differences in PCSK9i efficacy between sex and type of agent. Moreover, females remain consistently underrepresented in lipid-lowering therapy trials. Thus, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was done to assess for any differences in the efficacy of LDL-C lowering and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) reduction with PCSK9i between males and females and by type of PCSK9i.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States (US). 1 The costs of CVD are rising, driven by high‐risk patients, and are expected to nearly double to $1 trillion from 2015 to 2035. 2 Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is a well‐established causal risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). 3, 4 Accordingly, reduction of LDL‐C significantly reduces the risk of major CV events, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and it is now recognized that lower LDL‐C is better, with a progressive reduction in major CV events and no increase in safety events even at very low LDL‐C levels of < 7.7 mg/dL (< 0.2 mmol/L). 13

The 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Multisociety blood cholesterol guideline introduced the stratification of "very high‐risk" (VHR) ASCVD patients, defined as those with a history of multiple major ASCVD events (ie, recent acute coronary syndrome [ACS], history of myocardial infarction [MI], history of ischemic stroke [IS], or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) or a single major ASCVD event and multiple high‐risk conditions. 14 For patients with VHR ASCVD, the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline recommends using an LDL‐C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to initiate the addition of nonstatins (ie, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to maximally tolerated statin therapy. 14 The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines recommend a ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), with a lower goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) for patients who experience a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. 15 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) now recommend LDL‐C goals of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) and < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) for VHR and extreme‐risk patients, respectively. 16

Are Low Levels ofHarmful?

Observational studies have raised questions about the safety of low levels of LDL‐C achieved through intensive lipid lowering; however, there does not appear to be a "too low" level of LDL‐C. Populations with naturally occurring low levels of LDL‐C exist, and studies of individuals with genetic mutations leading to reduced LDL‐C levels reveal no safety issues and have shown an association with reduced ASCVD risk. This notion is recognized by the lower LDL‐C goals in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which recommend target LDL‐C levels as low as < 55 and < 40 mg/dL, the latter for patients who have had multiple ASCVD events within 2 years.

Achievement of very low LDL‐C levels in clinical trials of lipid‐lowering therapies has not been associated with an increased prevalence of adverse events. In the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, 42% of patients achieved LDL‐C levels ≤ 25 mg/dL at 48 weeks with no significant difference between the evolocumab and placebo groups in terms of adverse events beyond injection‐site reactions. In a prespecified analysis of IMPROVE‐IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), patients who achieved very low LDL‐C levels (< 30 mg/dL) at 1 month after acute coronary syndrome had a similar safety profile over a period of 6 years compared with patients who achieved LDL‐C concentrations ≥ 30 mg/dL; furthermore, the very low LDL‐C group had the numerically lowest rate of cardiovascular events. In addition, the EBBINGHAUS (Evaluating PCSK9 Binding Antibody Influence on Cognitive Health in High Cardiovascular Risk Subjects) trial of patients who received evolocumab or placebo added to statins showed no significant between‐group difference in cognitive function, even among patients who achieved very low levels of LDL‐C (< 25 mg/dL).

Systematic reviews with subsequent meta‐analyses have been conducted using clinical studies of PCSK9 inhibitors. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 However, such studies have either pooled PCSK9 inhibitors together as a class 16, 17, 18, 19 or provided pooled efficacy estimates for evolocumab versus control and alirocumab versus control without making any formal indirect comparisons. 20 Finally, none of the meta‐analyses specifically focused on patients whose hypercholesterolemia was not controlled with statin therapy alone, the primary populations for which evolocumab and alirocumab are indicated. 21, 22, 23, 24

We therefore conducted a systematic review and network meta‐analysis to compare LDL‐C reduction with evolocumab to other lipid‐lowering therapies (including alirocumab) in patients receiving statin background therapy.

PCSK9 inhibitors for primary prevention — secondary prevention trials with evolocumab and alirocumab suggest similar benefits and safety of PCSK9 inhibition in older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger individuals, but to date there are no large randomized controlled outcomes trials using PCSK9 inhibition for primary prevention of ASCVD, and current data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for the treatment of adults aged 75 or older without ASCVD.

### Effect of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on total cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease: a prespecified analysis from the FOURIER trial [^116wMssM]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and first cardiovascular events in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, but patients remain at high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of evolocumab on total cardiovascular events, given the importance of total number of cardiovascular events to patients, clinicians, and health economists.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The FOURIER trial compared evolocumab or matching placebo and followed up patients for a median of 2.2 years. The study included 27 564 patients with stable atherosclerotic disease receiving statin therapy. Data were analyzed between May 2017 and February 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point (PEP) was time to first cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization; the key secondary end point was time to first cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In a prespecified analysis, total cardiovascular events were evaluated between treatment arms.

Results

The mean age of patients was 63 years, 69% of patients were taking high-intensity statin therapy, and the median LDL-C at baseline was 92 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There were 2907 first PEP events and 4906 total PEP events during the trial. Evolocumab reduced total PEP events by 18% (incidence rate ratio [RR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.90; P < .001) including both first events (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92; P < .001) and subsequent events (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.85). There were 2192 total primary events in the evolocumab group and 2714 total events in the placebo group. For every 1000 patients treated for 3 years, evolocumab prevented 22 first PEP events and 52 total PEP events. Reductions in total events were driven by fewer total myocardial infarctions (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.84; P < .001), strokes (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93; p = 0.007), and coronary revascularizations (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71–0.87; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

The addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab to statin therapy improved clinical outcomes, with significant reductions in total PEP events, driven by decreases in myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization. More than double the number of events were prevented with evolocumab vs placebo as compared with the analysis of only first events. These data provide further support for the benefit of continuing aggressive lipid-lowering therapy to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Evolocumab and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease [^1134zV2k]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study FOURIER was published by Marc S Sabatine and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Dyslipidemia. In the FOURIER study, the trial question was: what is the role of evolocumab in patients with ASCVD and LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 70 mg/dL who were receiving statin therapy? In the FOURIER study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FOURIER study, the population was: 27564 patients (6769 female, 20795 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ASCVD and LDL cholesterol ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) who were receiving statin therapy. The key exclusion criteria were known hemorrhagic stroke; uncontrolled or recurrent VT; uncontrolled hypertension; planned or expected cardiac surgery or revascularization within 3 months; severe renal dysfunction; pregnancy or lactation. In the FOURIER study, the interventions were: n = 13784 evolocumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly SC) n = 13780 placebo (subcutaneous injections). In the FOURIER study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in major cardiovascular events (9.8% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92). In the FOURIER study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (5.9% vs. 7.4%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88). In the FOURIER study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in overall adverse events, with the exception of injection-site reactions, which were more common with evolocumab (2.1% vs. 1.6%). In the FOURIER study, the conclusion was: in patients with ASCVD and LDL cholesterol ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) who were receiving statin therapy, evolocumab was superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular events.

Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies that target PCSK9 (alirocumab and evolocumab) have been shown to reduce LDL‐C levels by ≈60% when added to statin therapy, with few adverse events. In cardiovascular outcome trials of patients at very high risk for ASCVD, anti‐PCSK9 antibodies have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

In the FOURIER trial of patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL, evolocumab added to background statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe) lowered LDL‐C levels to a median of 30 mg/dL at 48 weeks and reduced the risk of MACE by 15% versus statins plus placebo (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79–0.92]). Clinical benefit was demonstrated across baseline LDL‐C subgroups, and the magnitude of risk reduction for the primary and secondary end points increased over time. Furthermore, evolocumab conferred even greater absolute and relative risk reduction among higher‐risk patients, such as those with recent myocardial infarction, more extensive coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial disease. In addition, during the open‐label extension follow‐up period of the FOURIER trial, patients who were originally randomized to evolocumab had a 15% to 20% lower risk of MACE and a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular death than those randomized to placebo. Similarly, in the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial of patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL, the addition of alirocumab to maximally tolerated statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 15% versus placebo (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78–0.93]; P < 0.001) after a median follow‐up of 2.8 years.

### How much should LDL cholesterol be lowered in secondary prevention? Clinical efficacy and safety in the era of PCSK9 inhibitors [^116k6Jam]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a strong evidence that more marked lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) leads to progressively lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The evidence on validity of this hypothesis comes from epidemiological, genetic and clinical studies. The hypothesis "the lower the better" has been recently strongly supported by the results of secondary prevention trials with PCSK9 inhibitors. The combination of PCSK9 inhibitors and statins has resulted in achieving extremely low LDL-C levels with additional reduction of CVD events in secondary prevention. However, despite large clinical benefits, the safety of aggressive LDL-C lowering should be always taken into consideration, and there is still an ongoing discussion on whether very low LDL-C might result in some non-CVD adverse events. However, based on the available knowledge, so far the serious adverse events associated with achieving of very low LDL-C levels or intensive drug therapy have not been noted. These positive clinical effects were reflected in current ESC/EAS Guidelines (2019) for dyslipidaemia management. The experts strongly recommended the LDL-C lowering to levels that have been achieved in trials of PCSK9 inhibitors. In this state of the art review, we aimed to finally justify the critical need for LDL-C reduction to very low levels in secondary prevention patients in order to be as low as possible, as early as possible, and preferably lifelong.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1168xKwM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to lowering LDL‐C, anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to reduce plasma lipoprotein(a) by up to ≈25%. In the FOURIER trial, evolocumab significantly reduced lipoprotein(a) levels by a median of 26.9% (interquartile range, 6.2%–46.7%), and in patients with higher baseline lipoprotein(a) levels, it reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 23% versus placebo (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67–0.88]), which was greater than the reduction in events among individuals with lower levels of lipoprotein(a). Lipoprotein(a) lowering by alirocumab in the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial independently predicted a lower risk of cardiovascular events, suggesting that lipoprotein(a) may represent an independent treatment target in ASCVD. Importantly, these clinical trials were not enriched for patients with elevated lipoprotein(a); therefore, the absolute reductions observed in lipoprotein(a) levels were fairly modest.

Both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines recommend the addition of evolocumab or alirocumab to statins and ezetimibe in patients at very high risk of ASCVD events who remain above LDL‐C thresholds (≥ 70 and ≥ 55 mg/dL, respectively), as well as in primary prevention patients with FH who remain above an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 100 mg/dL.

### Reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and cardiovascular events with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and statins: an analysis of FOURIER, SPIRE, and the cholesterol treatment trialists collaboration [^1173F1By]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 45–60%, whether used alone or in combination with a statin. Two large cardiovascular outcomes trials have now reported that lowering LDL-C with a PCSK9 inhibitor when added to treatment with a statin reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events. We sought to compare the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors and statins for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by comparing the results of the FOURIER and SPIRE trials with the results of the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) meta-analysis of statin trials.

In the FOURIER trial, 27 564 patients with cardiovascular disease and LDL-C levels above 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) on statin therapy were randomized to either 140 mg every 2 weeks (or 420 mg monthly) of evolocumab subcutaneously or matching placebo. At 48 weeks, treatment with evoloculmab reduced LDL-C by 59%, from a baseline level of 2.4 mmol/L (92 mg/dL) to 0.78 mmol/L (30 mg/dL). Using the CTT method of imputation for missing values, this translated into a 1.4 mmol/L (53.4 mg/dL) absolute difference in LDL-C between the two treatment groups. After a median follow-up of 26 months (2.2 years), treatment with evolocumab reduced the incidence of the composite primary cardiovascular endpoint of cardiovascular death (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina by 15%, from 11.3 to 9.8% (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79–0.92, P < 0.001). The key secondary endpoint of CVD, MI, or stroke was reduced by 20%, from 7.4 to 5.9% (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73–0.88, P < 0.001). When measured per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, treatment with evolocumab reduced the risk of the primary outcome by 11.0% (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84–0.94) per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, and reduced the key secondary endpoint by 14.7% (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80–0.91) per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C. The magnitude of this effect appears to be slightly less than the 22% reduction in risk (HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.76–0.80) per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C during treatment with a statin as reported by CTT collaboration (P for difference = 1.6 × 10 −5 for primary outcome; P = 0.015 for secondary outcome).

### Transiently achieved very low LDL-cholesterol levels by statin and alirocumab after acute coronary syndrome are associated with cardiovascular risk reduction: the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial [^1148VoWZ]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In most trials of cholesterol-lowering therapies, the clinical benefit evolves over time, with a smaller reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events during the first year of treatment than that in subsequent years. Once fully established, the clinical benefit of lipid-lowering therapy may be long-lasting. For example, after the completion of several years of randomized treatment in placebo-controlled trials of statins, a persistent reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed, in some cases for more than 10 years, and even when the majority of patients did not receive on-going statin treatment. This is known as a legacy effect.

When added to statins, inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have the potential to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to levels not achievable with oral lipid-lowering therapies alone. Two large, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits of this approach. The Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial demonstrated a reduction in non-fatal, but not fatal cardiovascular events with the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab, compared with placebo, over a median follow-up of 2.2 years. A legacy effect of randomized treatment with evolocumab was demonstrated when patients from both arms of the trial received open-label treatment with evolocumab for 5 additional years and fewer cardiovascular deaths occurred in the original evolocumab group.

Nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering — introduction and evidence timeline — In 2013 the ACC and American Heart Association published the cholesterol treatment guideline; the ACC published the 2016 ACC nonstatin ECDP to address newer information on ezetimibe therapy as an adjunct to statin therapy; in 2017 cardiovascular outcomes data from FOURIER demonstrated that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition with evolocumab on a background of statin therapy was efficacious in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with additional high-risk features; a 2017 Focused Update provided more evidence-based guidance for incorporation of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies into clinical practice; the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial demonstrating the benefits of alirocumab in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was not published until 2018; and the page notes U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of alirocumab and evolocumab for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116izRHx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreases major cardiovascular events and is recommended for patients at elevated cardiovascular risk. However, appropriate doses of statin therapy are often insufficient to reduce LDL-C in accordance with current guidelines. In such cases, treatment could be supplemented with nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy. Methods and Results A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy added to maximally tolerated statins, including statin-intolerant patients. The primary objective was to assess relative efficacy of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy in reducing LDL-C levels at week 12. Secondary objectives included the following: LDL-C level reduction at week 24 and change in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B at week 12. There were 48 randomized controlled trials included in the primary network meta-analysis. All nonstatin agents significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline versus placebo, regardless of background therapy. At week 12, evolocumab, 140mg every 2weeks (Q2W)/420mg once a month, and alirocumab, 150mg Q2W, were the most efficacious regimens, followed by alirocumab, 75mg Q2W, alirocumab, 300mg once a month, inclisiran, bempedoic acid/ezetimibe fixed-dose combination, and ezetimibe and bempedoic acid used as monotherapies. Primary end point results were generally consistent at week 24, and for other lipid end points at week 12. Conclusions Evolocumab, 140mg Q2W/420mg once a month, and alirocumab, 150mg Q2W, were consistently the most efficacious nonstatin regimens when added to maximally tolerated statins to lower LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels and facilitate attainment of guideline-recommended risk-stratified lipoprotein levels.

### Rationale and design of the further cardiovascular OUtcomes research with PCSK9 inhibition in subjects with elevated risk trial [^1163nGa1]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite current therapies, patients with vascular disease remain at high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is a well-established modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by approximately 60% across various populations.

Study Design

FOURIER is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multinational trial testing the hypothesis that adding evolocumab to statin therapy will reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident vascular disease. The study population consists of 27,564 patients who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), an ischemic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and have a low-density lipoprotein ≥ 70 mg/dL or a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL on an optimized statin regimen. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either evolocumab (either 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks or 420 mg subcutaneously every month, according to patient preference) or matching placebo injections. The primary end point is major cardiovascular events defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point is the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke. The trial is planned to continue until at least 1,630 patients experience the secondary end point, thereby providing 90% power to detect a relative reduction of ≥ 15% in this end point.

Conclusions

FOURIER will determine whether the addition of evolocumab to statin therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with vascular disease.

### Effect of evolocumab or ezetimibe added to moderate-or high-intensity statin therapy on LDL-C lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia: the LAPLACE-2 randomized clinical trial [^116oACdb]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab when used in combination with a moderate- vs high-intensity statin.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled study conducted between January and December of 2013 in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia at 198 sites in 17 countries.

Interventions

Patients (n = 2067) were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity (atorvastatin [10 mg], simvastatin [40 mg], or rosuvastatin [5 mg]) or high-intensity (atorvastatin [80 mg], rosuvastatin [40 mg]) statin. After a 4-week lipid-stabilization period, patients (n = 1899) were randomized to compare evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) with placebo (every 2 weeks or monthly) or ezetimibe (10 mg or placebo daily; atorvastatin patients only) when added to statin therapies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and at week 12.

Results

Evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 66% (95% CI, 58% to 73%) to 75% (95% CI, 65% to 84%) (every 2 weeks) and by 63% (95% CI, 54% to 71%) to 75% (95% CI, 67% to 83%) (monthly) vs placebo at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 in the moderate- and high-intensity statin-treated groups; the LDL-C reductions at week 12 were comparable. For moderate-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 115 to 124 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 39 to 49 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 123 to 126 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 43 to 48 mg/dL. For high-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 35 to 38 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 33 to 35 mg/dL. Adverse events were reported in 36%, 40%, and 39% of evolocumab-, ezetimibe-, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients were back pain, arthralgia, headache, muscle spasms, and pain in extremity (all < 2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 12-week trial conducted among patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, evolocumab added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy resulted in additional LDL-C lowering. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term clinical outcomes and safety of this approach for LDL-C lowering.

### Reductions in atherogenic lipids and major cardiovascular events: a pooled analysis of 10 ODYSSEY trials comparing alirocumab with control [^113gfXPX]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

At present, all global guidelines for ASCVD risk reduction focus on optimization of statin therapy as the first option for reducing LDL-C for those at high risk. The therapeutic limits of statins and the clinical scenarios in which they have been tested have therefore established the boundaries of contemporary clinical guidelines and the recommendations they have set, whether an LDL-C goal or a percentage reduction in LDL-C. On the basis of randomized, clinical trial data of intensive versus standard statin therapy, knowledge of the distribution of LDL-C levels in general populations, and what is achievable on average with the most potent statins, guidelines such as the updated Adult Treatment Panel III and those from the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society recommended pragmatic goals for LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL for those at highest ASCVD risk.

In adults without ASCVD who may tolerate other lipid-lowering medications, AACE suggests against the use of evolocumab or alirocumab in addition to usual care (Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^1145Z1mD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review of lipid‐lowering therapies added to medium‐ to high‐intensity statin therapy and subsequent network meta‐analysis confirms the substantial LDL‐C reductions of PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe in individual trials. Among the PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab appeared to have a greater reduction than alirocumab (75 mg Q2W, ≈20%; 150 mg Q2W, ≈10%; 300 mg QM, ≈20%). These treatment differences were directionally consistent in the various analyses we conducted (ie, exclusion of studies leading to heterogeneity, variation of dosing amount and interval, broader background therapy spectrum). There was also some evidence of proportional treatment differences between evolocumab and other therapies in HDL‐C, non‐HDL‐C, ApoB, and Lp(a). The incidence of AEs was similar between individual therapies and placebo except for significantly higher treatment‐related AEs for evolocumab and alirocumab QM versus placebo.

Our work provides information on PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe added to statin therapy in those requiring further LDL‐C reduction. The trials generally evaluated patients either with CVD or at high risk of a CVD event, which is the expected target population for PCSK9 inhibitors both now and after cardiovascular outcomes trials for these medications are completed. 50, 51 We also characterized the reductions observed for PCSK9 inhibitors in other parameters including non‐HDL‐C and Lp(a). Non‐HDL‐C is emerging as a meaningful measure of CVD event risk, 52 and Lp(a) is associated with CVD event risk but is not reduced by statins. 53, 54

Finally, we analyzed dose‐specific LDL‐C reductions between PCSK9 inhibitors, which have not been a focus of published meta‐analyses. 16, 17, 18 The classwide reduction of LDL‐C with PCSK9 inhibitors observed in these meta‐analyses 16, 17, 18 is consistent with what we observed in the comparison of individual PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe.

### Role of dual lipid-lowering therapy in coronary atherosclerosis regression: evidence from recent studies [^112wGZTM]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, there is an unmet need in cardiovascular disease prevention. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have established that LDL-C lowering, particularly by statin therapy, reduces the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the risk of coronary events. Insufficient LDL-C reduction and high residual risk in a significant proportion of statin-treated patients signify that additional therapies are required to deliver more effective coronary care. Pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol absorption (with ezetimibe) and PCSK9 activity (with evolocumab or alirocumab) provides potentially useful approaches for the therapeutic modulation of LDL-C metabolism in statin-treated patients. In recent trials, combination strategies involving a statin and non-statin agent (ezetimibe or evolocumab) have been shown to promote coronary atherosclerosis regression and improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with moderate-to-high cardiovascular risk. This review summarizes recent evidence on the effects of dual lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to PCSK9 inhibitors, CCS 2021 guidelines recommend to intensify lipid-lowering therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor (evolocumab or alirocumab) with or without the additional use of ezetimibe for secondary prevention in patients with CVD shown to derive the largest benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, if LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L) while receiving the maximally tolerated statin dose.

### Efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with metabolic syndrome receiving statin therapy: secondary analysis from the FOURIER randomized clinical trial [^115e7asm]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER randomized clinical trial. Patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) are at increased cardiovascular risk.

Objective

To investigate outcomes with evolocumab in patients with and without MetS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The FOURIER trial randomized patients worldwide with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease receiving statin to evolocumab vs placebo with follow-up for a median of 2.2 years. Data were collected February 2013 to November 2016. For this prespecified analysis, patients with the requisite data were stratified based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III MetS criteria; in secondary analyses, patients were further substratified by diabetes at baseline. Analysis was intention to treat. Analysis began March 2018 and ended April 2020.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to evolocumab or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

Results

Of 27 342 patients (mean [SD] age, 63 [9] years; 20 623 men [75.4%]) included in this analysis, 16 361 (59.8%) with baseline MetS were, when compared with patients without MetS, at higher risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.31 [1.18–1.46]; P < .001 for the primary and 1.38 [1.20–1.57]; P < .001 for the key secondary end point). Evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol similarly in patients with MetS (median [interquartile range], 92 [79–109] mg/dL vs 30 [19–48] mg/dL; P < .001) and without MetS (median [interquartile range], 92 [81–108] mg/dL vs 29 [18–44] mg/dl; P < .001). For the primary end point, the hazard ratios (95% CI) with evolocumab vs placebo were 0.83 (0.76–0.91) and 0.89 (0.79–1.01) in patients with and without MetS (P for interaction = .39). For the key secondary end point, the corresponding hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 0.76 (0.68–0.86) and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) (P for interaction = .23), respectively. Evolocumab did not increase the risk of new-onset diabetes or other major safety outcomes including worsening glycemic control, compared with placebo in patients with MetS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and MetS have substantial residual risk of cardiovascular events despite statin therapy. Evolocumab significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular risk in patients with MetS without increasing new-onset diabetes, worsening glycemic control, or other major safety events. These data suggest the addition of evolocumab to statin therapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and MetS is safe and efficacious to reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

### Challenges in the choice of nonstatin medications for low-density lipoprotein-C lowering for cardiovascular risk reduction [^1157jmu3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases continue to be a leading cause of death globally. Although statin medications remain the cornerstone of treatment for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk, there is a proportion of patients in whom treatment with statins may not achieve the guideline recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets despite using maximally tolerated doses, or for various reasons, patients are unable or unwilling to intensify or continue statins. In these instances, use of nonstatin medications like ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab, inclisiran) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy can lead to additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and beneficial reductions in cardiovascular events. This review provides an overview of the evidence supporting the use of nonstatin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering medications for cardiovascular risk reduction and practical considerations for the use of these agents.

### The importance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and control as performance measures: a joint clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^11694MBQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety update and 2022 pathway — The 2018 guideline incorporated RCT evidence that nonstatin therapies including ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (alirocumab and evolocumab) significantly lowered LDL-C and non-HDL-C and ASCVD events when added to statins. It continued to recommend measurement of lipids as a Class IA recommendation 4–12 weeks after LDL-C–lowering medication or dose adjustment and every 3–12 months thereafter to monitor adherence. It introduced an LDL-C value of ≥ 70 mg/dL and a non-HDL-C value of ≥ 100 mg/dL in patients with ASCVD as a threshold for intensification of lipid treatment with initiation of nonstatin therapy if needed, necessitating LDL-C measurement to determine whether LDL-C remains above 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin. Further, the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on nonstatin therapies made a recommendation to consider additional lipid-lowering agents for an LDL-C threshold of ≥ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 85 mg/dL) in ASCVD patients at very high risk (about 50% of ASCVD patients).

### Choosing the optimal nonstatin lipid lowering therapies for statin-intolerant patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115wFYD8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Statin intolerance presents a considerable challenge in managing patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases, as it limits patients' access to standard lipid-lowering therapies.

Objective

This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of various nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are intolerant to statins.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and EBSCO open dissertations through September 2023 for randomized controlled trials in statin-intolerant patients comparing nonstatin lipid-lowering agents. The primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). A random-effects model estimated comparative effects using mean differences (MDs) for LDL-C reduction and relative risks (RRs) for safety outcomes, specifically trial withdrawal due to adverse events. Results were reported with 95% CIs, and therapies ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Evidence certainty was assessed with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) platform.

Results

Of 1533 articles, 6 studies (1326 patients) met inclusion criteria. Evolocumab combined with ezetimibe achieved the greatest LDL-C reduction (MD: 48.98%; 95% CI: 59.19, -38.77) vs ezetimibe alone, with moderate evidence certainty. Evolocumab, alirocumab, and the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, also showed significant reductions in LDL-C compared to ezetimibe monotherapy, though the magnitude of their effects was smaller than that of the evolocumab and ezetimibe combination. The SUCRA of evolocumab and ezetimibe (99.7%) aligns with its highest comparative efficacy. No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed across treatments.

Conclusion

Evolocumab combined with ezetimibe is the most effective regimen for LDL-C reduction, with a safety profile comparable to other treatments, making it a viable alternative for patients with statin intolerance.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^112DNaBk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab substantially reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) when added to statin therapy in patients who need additional LDL-C reduction.

Methods and Results

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials of lipid-lowering therapies from database inception through August 2016 (45 058 records retrieved). We found 69 trials of lipid-lowering therapies that enrolled patients requiring further LDL-C reduction while on maximally tolerated medium- or high-intensity statin, of which 15 could be relevant for inclusion in LDL-C reduction networks with evolocumab, alirocumab, ezetimibe, and placebo as treatment arms. PCSK9 inhibitors significantly reduced LDL-C by 54% to 74% versus placebo and 26% to 46% versus ezetimibe. There were significant treatment differences for evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 versus placebo (-74.1%; 95% credible interval -79.81% to -68.58%), alirocumab 75 mg (-20.03%; 95% credible interval -27.32% to -12.96%), and alirocumab 150 mg (-13.63%; 95% credible interval -22.43% to -5.33%) at ≥ 12 weeks. Treatment differences were similar in direction and magnitude for PCSK9 inhibitor monthly dosing. Adverse events were similar between PCSK9 inhibitors and control. Rates of adverse events were similar between PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe.

Conclusions

PCSK9 inhibitors added to medium- to high-intensity statin therapy significantly reduce LDL-C in patients requiring further LDL-C reduction. The network meta-analysis showed a significant treatment difference in LDL-C reduction for evolocumab versus alirocumab.

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^114JKVzm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Baseline LDL-C thresholds and estimating benefit for outcome modeling: The point estimates for the relative risk reductions were somewhat attenuated in the trials overall; however, in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, the relative risk reduction point estimate when baseline LDL-C was ≥ 100 mg/dL was similar to that observed in the CTT meta-analysis, and a meta-analysis suggests loss of cardiovascular and total mortality benefits when LDL-C levels are < 100 mg/dL in statin-treated patients. Therefore, when LDL-C levels are < 100 mg/dL, the relative ASCVD risk reductions from evolocumab observed in FOURIER, where the mean baseline LDL-C level on maximal statin therapy was 92 mg/dL, may be preferred for estimating NNTs over the long term when LDL-C levels are < 100 mg/dL.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Systematic review for the 2018 AHA / ACC / AACVPR / AAPA / ABC / ACPM / ADA / AGS / APhA / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115z1Fkn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of blood cholesterol found little evidence to support the use of nonstatin lipid-modifying medications to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Since publication of these guidelines, multiple randomized controlled trials evaluating nonstatin lipid-modifying medications have been published.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to assess the magnitude of benefit and/or harm from additional lipid-modifying therapies compared with statins alone in individuals with known ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD. We included data from randomized controlled trials with a sample size of > 1,000 patients and designed for follow-up > 1 year. We performed a comprehensive literature search and identified 10 randomized controlled trials for intensive review, including trials evaluating ezetimibe, niacin, cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors, and PCSK9 inhibitors. The prespecified primary outcome for this review was a composite of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.

Results

The cardiovascular benefit of nonstatin lipid-modifying therapies varied significantly according to the class of medication. There was evidence for reduced ASCVD morbidity with ezetimibe and 2 PSCK9 inhibitors. Reduced ASCVD mortality rate was reported for 1 PCSK9 inhibitor. The use of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) reduced the primary outcome by 1.8% over 7 years (hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84–0.96], 7-year number needed to treat: 56). The PSCK9 inhibitor evolocumab in the FOURIER study (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) decreased the primary outcome by 1.5% over 2.2 years (hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73–0.88; 2.2 = year number needed to treat: 67). In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab), alirocumab reduced the primary outcome by 1.6% over 2.8 years (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79–0.93; 2.8-year number needed to treat: 63). For ezetimibe and the PSCK9 inhibitors, rates of musculoskeletal, neurocognitive, gastrointestinal, or other adverse event risks did not differ between the treatment and control groups. For patients at high risk of ASCVD already on background statin therapy, there was minimal evidence for improved ASCVD risk or adverse events with cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors. There was no evidence of benefit for the addition of niacin to statin therapy. Direct comparisons of the results of the 10 randomized controlled trials were limited by significant differences in sample size, duration of follow-up, and reported primary outcomes.

Conclusions

In a systematic review of the evidence for adding nonstatin lipid-modifying therapies to statins to reduce ASCVD risk, we found evidence of benefit for ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors but not for niacin or cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^113rgPEj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

All nonstatin agents significantly reduced LDL‐C levels compared with placebo. However, evolocumab, 140 mg Q2W/420 mg QM, and alirocumab, 150 mg Q2W (mAb PCSK9 inhibitors also shown to reduce MACEs in patients with ASCVD and acute coronary syndrome), were consistently the most efficacious nonstatin agents/regimens, potentially allowing more patients to achieve an LDL‐C consistent with the current guidelines.

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1148bky7]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

An elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including ischemic stroke. For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, an elevated LDL-C level is associated with an increased risk of subsequent major cardiovascular events. More intensive compared with less intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies are associated with reduced major cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, the results of LDL lowering with statins in secondary stroke prevention trials are inconsistent. An initial meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials showed that intensive LDL-C reduction with statins was associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke. A subsequent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials showed that statins were associated with a reduction in the risk of ischemic strokes and cardiovascular events, but the reduction of recurrent stroke did not reach statistical significance. In addition to their LDL-C–lowering effects, statins may exhibit cardiovascular protection via their pleiotropic effects. The antithrombotic effect of statins may provide additional reduction in ischemic events but may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with ischemic stroke.

Statins plus cholesterol absorption inhibitors (eg, ezetimibe) or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab) compared with statins alone were associated with reduced major cardiovascular events and strokes for patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in clinical trials. However, whether those medications (ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors) are beneficial as add-on therapy to statins for patients with prior stroke has not been definitively established, to our knowledge.

To properly elucidate the association of LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies with secondary stroke prevention, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the benefits and risks associated with more intensive vs less intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies for patients with ischemic stroke.

### Long-term evolocumab in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115KnS4r]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The study FOURIER-OLE was published by Michelle L O'Donoghue and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Dyslipidemia. In the FOURIER-OLE study, the trial question was: what is the role of long-term use of evolocumab in patients with established ASCVD? In the FOURIER-OLE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FOURIER-OLE study, the population was: 6635 patients (1549 female, 5086 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a history of established ASCVD and a fasting LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL while on statin. The key exclusion criteria were permanent medication discontinual due to adverse effects in the parent study; participation in another study; not being able to complete follow-up for the duration of the extension program; pregnancy. In the FOURIER-OLE study, the interventions were: n = 3355 evolocumab (continuous receipt, from FOURIER study, of subcutaneous injections of either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg every month) n = 3280 placebo in parent study (receipt of placebo in parent study and evolocumab in this extension study). In the FOURIER-OLE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization (3.36% vs. 3.96%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96). In the FOURIER-OLE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke (2.05% vs. 2.58%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93) Significant decrease in cardiovascular death (0.68% vs. 0.9%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.99) Significant decrease in coronary artery disease death or myocardial infarction (1.3% vs. 1.82%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.86). In the FOURIER-OLE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in LDL-C levels, adverse events. significant difference in injection site reactions (0.81% vs. 0.65%). In the FOURIER-OLE study, the conclusion was: in patients with a history of established ASCVD and a fasting LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL while on statin, evolocumab was superior to placebo in parent study with respect to the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization.

### Evolocumab safety and efficacy in hypercholesteremia patients with or without diabetes: a retrospective real-world analysis [^114GYa1K]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypercholesterolemia or elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established, strong, and independent modifiable risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in adults. Interventions aimed at aggressively curbing the consequences that LDL-C has on cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality are of great importance.

The three mainstays of LDL-C-lowering therapy are high-intensity statin therapy, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors. Current guidelines advocate for stringent LDL-C targets with > 50% LDL-C reductions for those at high cardiovascular risk and those with established ASCVD. To achieve the desired LDL-C levels, a sequential approach is recommended, beginning with high-intensity statins, followed by ezetimibe and, potentially, PCSK9 inhibitors.

PCSK9 inhibitors, such as evolocumab, were FDA-approved in 2015 for patients with ASCVD who need additional LDL-C reduction despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. Administered subcutaneously every two or four weeks, these monoclonal antibodies target PCSK9, a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism. By preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors on liver cells, these inhibitors protect the receptors from degradation, enhancing the liver's ability to remove LDL-C from the bloodstream. This mechanism leads to significant LDL-C reductions of about 60%.

Furthermore, PCSK9 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in high-risk patients with ASCVD. The FOURIER trial, involving 27,564 patients, found that evolocumab added to statin therapy reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 15%. Similarly, the ODYSSEY trial, with 18,924 patients who had recent ACS, showed that alirocumab plus statin led to a 15% reduction in MACE and all-cause mortality. Both trials reported no significant side effects or safety concerns. However, it should be noted that the duration of these trials was relatively short, with a median follow-up of approximately 78 weeks, which is not adequate to prove long-term safety.

### Future of stroke prevention: 7 updates in the 2024 AHA / ASA primary prevention of stroke guideline [^115CxaLV]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipid-lowering therapy

Similar to the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Primary Prevention of CVD Guideline, the 2024 Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline recommends (Class 1) primary prevention statin therapy across 4 statin eligibility groups (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C] ≥ 190 mg/dL, type 2 diabetes, 10-year CVD risk ≥ 20%, and 10-year CVD risk between 7.5% and 19.9% with at least one risk enhancer). However, the classification for intermediate and high risk may change when guideline updates use the 2023 PREVENT (Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events) calculator, which generally provides a risk estimate 30% to 50% lower compared to the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations owing to its derivation in a much larger and more contemporary sample.

Utilization of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for statin-eligible individuals who are statin intolerant or require further LDL-C lowering on maximally tolerated statin therapy was given a 2b recommendation (uncertain benefit). This recommendation is made based on the fact that: 1) no dedicated primary prevention trials involving PCSK9 mAbs (evolocumab, alirocumab) have been performed; and 2) one meta-analysis identified 21% to 27% risk reduction (95% CI: 6%-42%) in stroke for PCSK9 mAbs when compared to placebo but did not specify whether individuals had prevalent stroke at baseline, thereby making recommendations for primary prevention of stroke unclear.

In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment with Alirocumab) trial, alirocumab conferred a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke in secondary outcome analysis (27% relative risk reduction, 1.2% vs 1.6%) over nearly 3 years among persons with acute coronary syndrome within the last 12 months. Approximately 3% of individuals in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES had prevalent stroke and all were on maximally tolerated statin therapy. However, evidence from the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial did not show a significant risk reduction in stroke with evolocumab within secondary outcome analysis.

### PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular diseases: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115tijRU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who have had established cardiovascular diseases remain at elevated risks of recurrent cardiovascular events, leading to an increased risk of death. Therefore, secondary preventions targeting the established risk factors for this group of patients represent a high priority. For decades, statins have been regarded as the first-line drugs for lowering cholesterol levels and prevention of potential cardiovascular events. But a considerable proportion of high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients do not achieve adequate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) despite of the intensive statin therapy. According to the latest US and European guidelines, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in combination with statin and ezetimibe therapy are recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.

PCSK9 accelerates degradation of LDL receptors, thereby inhibiting the removal of LDL from the circulation. Thereafter, by controlling the expression of LDL receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, modulators that inhibit PCSK9 could reduce LDL-C and subsequently major cardiovascular events. This therapy may be more effective in reducing LDL-C and other atherogenic lipids in high-risk patients treated with the maximum tolerated dose of statins, as well as those who are intolerant to statins. Although there are safety concerns such as the potential risk of new-onset diabetes, several meta-analyses have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors showed better effects in reducing LDL-C levels and improving clinical benefits than other lipid-lowering agents for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, due to the lack of direct comparisons between different medications, the optimal agent targeting PCSK9 to reduce the risk of death after cardiovascular events remains undetermined. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of different PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^113XbzhY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Our analysis of the effect of additional nonstatin agents on the change from baseline in other lipid end points (ApoB and non–HDL‐C), compared with placebo at week 12, found broadly similar findings to that of the primary analysis, except for inclisiran. Inclisiran was more efficacious than alirocumab, 300 mg QM, at reducing ApoB levels and more efficacious than alirocumab, 75 mg Q2W and 300 mg QM, at reducing non–HDL‐C levels, compared with placebo at week 12.

At present, mAb PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab) and ezetimibe have been shown to reduce risk of MACEs in patients with ASCVD or acute coronary syndrome; however, bempedoic acid (NCT02993406 and NCT04579367) and inclisiran (NCT03705234) are currently under investigation for their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events. Our NMA did not include a comparison of cardiovascular outcomes, even where data are available for individual interventions, because of differing trial designs and populations. Focusing on LDL‐C reduction is therefore currently the best method of comparing the efficacy of LLTs because it is largely unaffected by treatment effect modifiers. In contrast, cardiovascular outcomes are impacted by the duration of follow‐up, and the type and recency of qualifying events, as well as the cardiovascular risk of the trial populations. Definition of outcome measures can also complicate comparison between agents.

There are limitations associated with this review and NMA. First, the NMA is limited by the quantity and quality of data available from included trials. Our NMA concentrates on efficacy estimates and does not consider adherence and economic value implications. There are relatively few head‐to‐head trials of nonstatin agents or regimens; therefore, most comparisons within the network are largely indirect. However, given that LDL‐C reductions have been shown to be similar across multiple characteristics, we believe that this limitation does not undermine the analysis. The NMA focuses on week 12 follow‐up, which provides the richest data source but could be considered as relatively short‐term. However, for most agents, there is evidence that week 12 data are generalizable to the long‐term.

Evolocumab compared with usual care in adults with dyslipidemia shows small reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke but no clinically meaningful decreases in mortality or coronary revascularization and no increase in discontinuation due to adverse events; peripheral vascular disease (PVD) events are not meaningfully reduced. Evolocumab does not result in a clinically meaningful decrease in all-cause mortality and CV-related mortality. Evolocumab results in a small reduction in myocardial infarction and probably does not result in a clinically meaningful decrease in stroke. Evolocumab does not result in a clinically meaningful decrease in coronary revascularization and does not result in a clinically meaningful increase in discontinuation due to adverse events. Evolocumab does not result in a clinically meaningful reduction in PVD events. Quantitatively: all-cause mortality — 39 381 (17 RCTs), RR 1.03 (0.90–1.17), 24 per 1000 vs 1 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 4 more); CV-related mortality — 38 413 (15 RCTs), RR 1.04 (0.87–1.23), 14 per 1000 vs 1 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 3 more); myocardial infarction — 36 229 (10 RCTs), RR 0.73 (0.66–0.82), 39 per 1000 vs 11 fewer per 1000 (13 to 7 fewer); stroke — 35 575 (9 RCTs), RR 0.79 (0.66–0.94), 16 per 1000 vs 3 fewer per 1000 (5 to 1 fewer); coronary revascularization — 35 635 (10 RCTs), RR 0.78 (0.71–0.85), 63 per 1000 vs 14 fewer per 1000 (18 to 9 fewer); discontinuation due to adverse events — 33 909 (14 RCTs), RR 1.03 (0.90–1.17), 16 per 1000 vs 0 fewer per 1000 (2 fewer to 4 more); PVD events (median follow-up 2.2 years) — 27 564 (1 RCT), HR 0.58 (0.38–0.88), 4 per 1000 vs 2 fewer per 1000.

### Is there enough evidence with evolocumab and alirocumab (antibodies to proprotein convertase substilisin-kexin type, PCSK9) on cardiovascular outcomes to use them widely?

N engl J med 2015; 372: 1488–99 [^116qgedx]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins alone often do not reduce LDL cholesterol levels sufficiently to given maximum cardiovascular benefit. Thus, additional drugs are required to reduce the levels of LDL cholesterol. Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have recently been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol, but it is not known whether they improve cardiovascular outcomes.

Areas Covered

We evaluated two clinical trials reporting cardiovascular outcomes with antibodies to PCSK9, the OSLER extension with evolocumab, and the ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial with alirocumab.

Expert Opinion

In OSLER and ODYSSEY LONG TERM, there were very few cardiovascular outcomes, but the trials do suggest that evolocumab and alirocumab may reduce these outcomes. However, there are also some safety concerns with both of these antibodies. Large clinical outcome trials are underway with both evolocumab and alirocumab, which will probably clarify both the safety concerns and any cardiovascular benefits with these antibodies. In our opinion, these antibodies may be suitable for use in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, who are uncontrolled with their present medications, provided intensive safety and cardiovascular monitoring is being undertaken. However, evolocumab and alirocumab should be used with caution in other subjects, until outcome studies in higher numbers of subjects have shown acceptable safety and cardiovascular profiles.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^113esMsu]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) trials — achieved apolipoprotein B (apoB) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and relative risk reductions are reported for IMPROVE-IT, FOURIER, and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES. In IMPROVE-IT, adding ezetimibe to simvastatin reduced apoB by an additional 15% with median achieved apoB 67 mg/dL and LDL-C 54 mg/dL, producing a 6.4% relative risk reduction for major adverse cardiovascular events over a median follow-up period of 6 years. Results from IMPROVE-IT have supported a recommended LDL-C treatment intensification threshold of 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients. With evolocumab or alirocumab added to moderate- to high-intensity statin ± ezetimibe, there was a > 40% reduction in apoB; in FOURIER at 48 weeks the median apoB was 38 mg/dL with median LDL-C 30 mg/dL, and in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES at 12 months the mean apoB was 49 mg/dL with mean LDL-C 48 mg/dL. Across FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, a 15% relative risk reduction in MACE was observed with median follow-up of 2.2 years and 2.8 years, respectively.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Adult Patients with Established Cardiovascular Disease

Study 1 (FOURIER, NCT01764633) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial in 27,564 (13,784 REPATHA, 13,780 placebo) adult patients with established cardiovascular disease and with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL and/or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite high- or moderate-intensity statin therapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous injections of REPATHA (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg once monthly) or placebo; 86% used the every-2-week regimen throughout the trial. The median follow-up duration was 26 months. Overall, 99.2% of patients were followed until the end of the trial or death.

The mean (SD) age at baseline was 63 (9) years, with 45% being at least 65 years old; 25% were women. The trial population was 85% White, 2% Black, and 10% Asian; 8% identified as Hispanic ethnicity. Regarding prior diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, 81% had prior myocardial infarction, 19% prior non-hemorrhagic stroke, and 13% had symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Selected additional baseline risk factors included hypertension (80%), diabetes mellitus (1% type 1; 36% type 2), current daily cigarette smoking (28%), New York Heart Association class I or II congestive heart failure (23%), and eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2(6%). Most patients were on a high- (69%) or moderate-intensity (30%) statin therapy at baseline, and 5% were also taking ezetimibe. Most patients were taking at least one other cardiovascular medication including anti-platelet agents (93%), beta blockers (76%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (56%), or angiotensin receptor blockers (23%). On stable background lipid-lowering therapy, the median [Q1, Q3] LDL-C at baseline was 92 [80, 109] mg/dL; the mean (SD) was 98 (28) mg/dL.

### Trials in "True" dyslipidemic patients are urged to reconsider comprehensive lipid management as a means to reduce residual cardiovascular risk [^115ie6CG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Instead, early randomized controlled trials (e.g. 4S, CARE) 10, 11 demonstrated that lowering LDL‐C with statins in high‐risk patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia (i.e. LDL‐C 140–190 mg/dL), largely of polygenic plus dietary basis, reduces events and mortality. In the studies where an analysis of subgroups according to baseline LDL‐C was performed, such as in the CARE study, baseline LDL‐C had a clear influence on the impact on clinical outcomes. Later studies showed that a more intensive LDL‐C lowering through statins further reduces cardiovascular morbidity, but not mortality, compared with less intensive schemes. 12 The addition of ezetimibe to a background of statin therapy was also effective in reducing the residual risk. 13 Thereafter, the concept "the lower, the better" pervaded the scientific and clinical communities.

Anti–PCSK‐9 monoclonal antibodies show an exceptionally potent LDL‐C lowering action and good tolerability. Evolocumab and alirocumab, the two compounds that reached the market, were tested in full programs of phase III studies (PROFICIO and ODYSSEY, respectively) focusing on changes in the lipid profile and tolerability in candidates suitable for this type of medicine (i.e. high‐risk statin‐intolerant patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and patients with heterozygous FH inadequately controlled by standard therapy) (Table 1). However, the two main cardiovascular outcome trials using anti–PCSK‐9 antibodies (FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, respectively) 14, 15 did not target these "challenging" patients but rather broad categories of high‐risk patients with LDL‐C levels perhaps not "optimal" but acceptably controlled through statins (baseline LDL‐C 92 mg/dL in FOURIER and 87 mg/dL in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES). These values are substantially lower than those of most studies with surrogate outcomes that provided backing to regulatory filing (Table 1). This might account, at least in part, for the discrepancy between the impressive results of exploratory analyses of extension studies with evolocumab (OSLER 1‐2) 16 and alirocumab (ODYSSEY LONG TERM) 17 in patients with "true" hypercholesterolemia and those of the FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES studies, respectively.

### Reductions in atherogenic lipids and major cardiovascular events: a pooled analysis of 10 ODYSSEY trials comparing alirocumab with control [^1145A2cx]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

These analyses provide further reassurance about the safety and cardiovascular benefit of achieving even further reductions in LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB beyond what was previously achieved with statins alone. The results of the large cardiovascular outcomes studies with PCSK9 inhibitors such as ODYSSEY OUTCOMES are assessing whether PCSK9 inhibition with alirocumab on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy reduces MACE. If these trials demonstrate the effectiveness of further LDL-C reduction, then guideline committees may investigate lower targets or a larger reduction in LDL-C from untreated baseline for those at highest risk of MACE.

PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab) — dosing, evidence limits, subgroup effects, and conditional recommendations: Evolocumab is administered as 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg once monthly subcutaneously, and alirocumab as 75 to 150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg once per month subcutaneously. Cardiovascular outcomes trials had a median < 3 years of follow-up. In FOURIER-OLE, 6635 participants were followed for a median of 5 additional years, and with > 8 years of follow-up on evolocumab investigators did not identify concerns in an increased risk of new-onset DM, hemorrhagic stroke, or neurocognitive impairment. A sensitivity analysis by baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) showed larger relative risk reduction for LDL-C > 100 mg/dL versus LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. A 2021 network meta-analysis found a reduction in the relative risk for all-cause mortality with alirocumab compared with evolocumab, with no differences in relative risk for CV-related mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or treatment discontinuation. The task force issued a conditional recommendation for use of either antibody in addition to usual care for individuals with dyslipidemia who are not at goal (LDL-C < 70 mg/dL), and also issued a conditional recommendation against the use of evolocumab and alirocumab in individuals who do not have ASCVD and who may tolerate other lipid-lowering medications.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab and evolocumab: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Mad8F]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy with alirocumab or evolocumab on individual clinical efficacy and safety endpoints remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab and evolocumab in patients with dyslipidaemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Methods and Results

We performed a review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment with alirocumab or evolocumab vs. placebo or other lipid-lowering therapies up to March 2018. Primary efficacy endpoints were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. We estimated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random effect models. We included 39 RCTs comprising 66 478 patients of whom 35 896 were treated with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (14 639 with alirocumab and 21 257 with evolocumab) and 30 582 with controls. Mean weighted follow-up time across trials was 2.3years with an exposure time of 150 617 patient-years. Overall, the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on all-cause death and cardiovascular death were not statistically significant (P = 0.15 and P = 0.34, respectively). Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors were associated with lower risk of MI (1.49 vs. 1.93 per 100 patient-year; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.86; I² = 0%; P < 0.0001), ischaemic stroke (0.44 vs. 0.58 per 100 patient-year; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.89; I² = 0%; P = 0.0005), and coronary revascularization (2.16 vs. 2.64 per 100 patient-year; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78–0.89; I² = 0%; P < 0.0001), compared with the control group. Use of these PCSK9 inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of neurocognitive adverse events (P = 0.91), liver enzymes elevations (P = 0.34), rhabdomyolysis (P = 0.58), or new-onset diabetes mellitus (P = 0.97).

Conclusion

Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibition with alirocumab or evolocumab was associated with lower risk of MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization, with favourable safety profile.

### Design of the randomized, placebo-controlled evolocumab for early reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes (EVOPACS) trial [^115tRCVx]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Statins lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and improve clinical outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) often do not achieve LDL-C targets despite potent statin treatment, and have a particularly high risk of early recurrent events. Evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9)-inhibitor resulting in rapid, marked LDL-C reduction, has been studied in hypercholesterolemic subjects without CVD and stabilized patients with CVD; the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this treatment initiated in the acute phase of ACS remain unknown. We report the design of evolocumab for early reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with ACS (EVOPACS), a phase-3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the feasibility, safety, and LDL-C-lowering efficacy of evolocumab on top of atorvastatin 40mg in patients with ACS. The primary endpoint is percent change in LDL-C from baseline to 8weeks. Secondary endpoints are adverse events and serious adverse events. Against a background of beneficial cardiovascular effects of statins beyond LDL-C lowering and in view of preclinical evidence of similar effects of PCSK9 inhibition, the study will also address a variety of exploratory endpoints including the change in C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers; platelet reactivity; and occurrence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury and myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. An intracoronary imaging sub-study will investigate the change from baseline in the lipid core burden index in non-culprit lesions, as assessed by serial near-infrared spectroscopy. Recruitment began in January 2018 and enrollment of 308 patients is planned.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of alirocumab after acute coronary syndrome according to achieved level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a propensity score-matched analysis of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial [^113PkUqp]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

In their 1985 Nobel Prize lecture, Brown and Goldstein suggested that a physiological concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for humans may be in the range of 25 to 60 mg/dL. In fact, levels in that range are present at birth or in adulthood in hunter-gatherer populations with a very low prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. – In contrast, the mean LDL-C concentration among US adults who are untreated with cholesterol-lowering medication is ≈120 mg/dL, accompanied by a high population risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Lipid lowering with statins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors reduces LDL-C concentration and MACE across a broad range of populations at risk. –

An important unresolved question is what concentration of LDL-C achieved with lipid-lowering therapy is optimal to reduce MACE with acceptable safety. Analysis of statin trials suggests that lower achieved LDL-C is associated with a lower risk of MACE, down to LDL-C levels of 30 to 50 mg/dL. PCSK9 inhibitors often reduce LDL-C to even lower levels. In the FOURIER

trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk), which compared evolocumab with placebo in 27 564 statin-treated patients, progressively lower levels of LDL-C on assigned treatment were associated with lower risk of MACE, down to a category of patients with levels < 20 mg/dL. In part on the basis of these analyses, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society issued guidelinesrecommending lipid-lowering therapy that achieves an LDL-C level < 55 mg/dL in patients at very high risk for MACE and < 40 mg/dL in those who have had recurrent MACE within the previous 2 years.

Clinical trials, such as IMPROVE‐IT (The Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), demonstrated that patients randomized to a combination of simvastatin and ezetemibe achieved a modest 6.4% relative improvement in composite cardiovascular outcomes of death from cardiovascular disease, a major coronary event, or non‐fatal stroke, compared with those randomized to simvastatin alone although mortality rates did not differ between the 2 groups. Such outcome improvements were thought to be attributable to variations in LDL cholesterol levels between the 2 groups (ie, average LDL cholesterol of 53.7 mg/dL versus 69.5 mg/dL) 1 — LDL cholesterol levels similar to the targets examined in our study.

PCSK‐9 inhibitors have emerged as a potent LDL cholesterol lowering therapy, which may serve as an adjunctive (or alternate) therapy to statins among high‐risk populations. The recently published FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular OUTcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibitors in Subjects with Elevated risk) trial, a phase 3 double‐blind randomized placebo controlled trial, enrolled 27 500 high‐risk patients on optimal statin therapy whose LDL cholesterol levels were 70 mg/dL or greater (or a non HDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL or greater). 6 The study demonstrated a 15% relative risk reduction of the composite cardiovascular end point among patients randomized to evolocumab as compared with placebo. Improvement of evolocumabs in outcomes was attributed to the 59% reduction in mean LDL cholesterol as compared with placebo (mean LDL cholesterols: 30.2 mg/dL versus 92 mg/dL in evolocumab versus placebo, respectively). Outcome benefits associated with evolocumab were driven predominantly by a reduction in non‐fatal rather than fatal vascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization), and were considered modest in magnitude relative to the large decreases in LDL levels achieved.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^117XoeLQ]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The evidence that 'lower is better' for LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in terms of secondary CVD prevention is well supported by evidence, and the recent advent of PCSK9 inhibitors further supports this notion. The issue at hand is how to use this information clinically to support a testing regimen. In this regard, the use of cholesterol targets for therapy is contentious, in part because the evidence for their use is less strong. While research has shown that achieving targets is associated with better outcomes, no specific randomised controlled trial has shown that randomising patients to a target improves adherence or event rates. Indeed, it might be argued that the maximally tolerated statin should be initiated as the default, and therefore a hard target may be moot. Clearly, other lipid-lowering medications could be added to therapy. Despite the lack of strong evidence, many guidelines recommended specific lipid targets, with many choosing similar values, suggesting that guideline committees are likely to be examining the same evidence. However, one of the most recently published guidelines, the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias (ESCEAS) advised the lowest cholesterol targets of all the included guidelines (LDL < 1.4 mmol/L), with further lower levels for those with multiple recent cardiovascular events (LDL < 1.0 mmol/L). This was rated as being supported by strong and moderate levels of evidence, although the guidelines acknowledged that both targets are based on the LDL levels achieved in the trials for PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Effect of statins and non-statin LDL-lowering medications on cardiovascular outcomes in secondary prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111odpo2]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Current evidence on dyslipidaemia management has expanded to novel treatments and very low achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We sought to compare the clinical impact of more-intensive vs. less-intensive LDL-C lowering by means of statins and currently recommended non-statin medications in secondary prevention.

Methods and Results

We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials of statins, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, or bile acid sequestrants with > 500 patients followed for ≥ 1year. We employed random-effects models using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare outcomes. We included 19 trials (15 of statins, 3 of PCSK9 inhibitors, and 1 of ezetimibe) with 152507 patients randomly assigned to more-intensive (n = 76678) or less-intensive treatment (n = 75829). More-intensive treatment was associated with 19% relative risk reduction for the primary outcome, major vascular events (MVEs; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77–0.86). Risk reduction was greater across higher baseline levels and greater achieved reductions of LDL-C. The clinical benefit was significant across varying types of more-intensive treatment and was consistent for statins (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.86) and non-statin agents (PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94) as active (more-intensive) intervention (P-interaction = 0.38). Each 1.0mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was associated with 19% relative decrease in MVE. Death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization also favoured more-intensive treatment.

Conclusion

Reduction of MVE is proportional to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering across a broad spectrum of on-treatment levels in secondary prevention. Statin intensification and add-on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe are associated with significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in this very high-risk population.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence from meta‐analyses and well‐controlled randomized trials of statin therapy show that reducing LDL‐C is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CV events and mortality. 1, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Despite the availability of statins and other LLTs, many patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CV risk are not achieving LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients tend to be initiated on low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin therapy (a daily dose that provides an approximate < 30% to 30% to 50% LDL‐C reduction, respectively), with up‐titration or switching to a higher‐intensity statin regimen (a daily dose that provides an approximate ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction) as necessary for individuals not achieving LDL‐C targets or the expected therapeutic response from the initial dose of statin. 12, 13

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116WWDyS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The highest proportion (> 70%) of LDL‐C values achieved the 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society LDL‐C guideline goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) with either evolocumab, 140 mg Q2W/420 mg QM, or alirocumab, 150 mg Q2W, treatment, in a simulated population. These 2 treatments also reduced LDL‐C levels by the greatest amount. Studies that also looked at the impact of treatment on whether LDL‐C met guidelines looked at the sequential addition of treatment. One study ran a simulation on a population of patients following a myocardial infarction, where the following treatment pathway was used: maximized high‐intensity statins, followed by ezetimibe, then an additional mAb PCSK9 inhibitor. In those who had yet to achieve an LDL‐C of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and who already received high‐intensity statins (78.3%), the addition of ezetimibe resulted in a further 27.5% achieving the goal. The addition of evolocumab, 140 mg Q2W/420 mg QM, or alirocumab, 75 mg Q2W, to the previous statin and ezetimibe therapy resulted in a further 42.7% and 39.2% of patients achieving an LDL‐C of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), respectively. Another study looked at the achievement of an LDL‐C of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) using a simulated population with ASCVD, and the following treatments steps sequentially applied with LDL‐C measured after each to identify whether LDL‐C of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) had been achieved: statin, statin up titration, add‐on ezetimibe, add‐on alirocumab, 75 mg, and up titration to alirocumab, 150 mg (base‐case scenario). The base‐case scenario identified that 16.7% people required an ezetimibe add‐on therapy, 14% people required an additional add‐on alirocumab, 75 mg, therapy or further 150 mg up titration to achieve an LDL‐C of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). A related study found that when 10% full and 10% partial statin intolerance were assumed in the simulated population, ezetimibe use was 38.5% and PCSK9 inhibitor use was 21.1% to achieve LDL‐C of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). These studies are a sample of those that show the benefits of add‐on LLT therapies to achieve an LDL‐C consistent with guideline recommendations.

Evaluation of LDL‐C between 4 and 12 weeks following dose titration is recommended to rapidly adjust dose as needed. Regular lipid assessment promotes adherence to the prescribed regimen, identifies patients who may need more aggressive treatment, and mitigates the risks of treatment delays. Patients failing to reach targeted LDL‐C levels require combination lipid‐lowering strategies up front or early. The Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease (PCSK9) Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) study illustrated that adding evolocumab to statins decreased cardiovascular events and significantly reduced LDL‐C levels, with The FOURIER Open‐Label Extension (FOURIER‐OLE) study confirming the sustained safety and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors. Furthermore, the Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment with Alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) trial evaluated alirocumab use in patients with a recent 1–12 months history of ACS, who were already on maximum doses of statins, with or without ezetimibe. The trial reported a 15% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events among patients treated with alirocumab, with the most notable benefits observed in those with additional high‐risk clinical factors.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^113upF5W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Within the network meta‐analysis, we reviewed assumptions of homogeneity based on the I 2 statistic from the direct meta‐analyses, similarity using the baseline characteristics and designs of the included studies, and consistency using the IFPLOT command in Stata in comparisons with both direct and indirect comparisons. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore any heterogeneity by excluding individual studies or those in different populations. We also conducted sensitivity analyses combining both evolocumab dosing groups and including studies with all background therapies.

We excluded on a post hoc basis nodes in the networks that included fenofibrate or anacetrapib from this article. The anacetrapib arm was excluded because this cholesterylester transfer protein inhibitor's cardiovascular outcomes trial is ongoing, and all of the prior trials in this drug class have been neutral or negative in risk reduction. 32 Moreover, a recent meta‐analysis of lipid‐lowering therapy found that therapies that upregulated LDL receptor function were linearly associated with reductions in cardiovascular events per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL‐C. This relationship was less consistent with fibrates and cholesterylester transfer protein inhibitors, and statin‐era trials in particular were negative or neutral in reducing cardiovascular events. 5 We also excluded bococizumab after Pfizer announced they were halting clinical and commercial development of this PCSK9 inhibitor. 33 Pfizer noted in its press release that studies of bococizumab showed reduced efficacy over time and more injection‐site reactions than evolocumab and alirocumab. 33

Future directions

To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the effect of RC reduction on CMD for primary prevention. Observational studies illuminated that high RC levels persist in patients treated with statins, and interventional studies have shown that statins combined with evolocumab or pemafibrate is effective in reducing the RC levels. However, the PROMINENT study suggested that pemafibrate failed to improved cardiovascular outcomes despite reductions in RC in patients with T2D, hypertriglyceridemia, and below-average HDL-C. Additionally, cohort studies from the United Kingdom and Finland have shown that statin use is effective in reducing RC, and the combination of metabolomics with genetic substitutes for drug targets has confirmed the pharmacological effects of statins. The conflicting results from clinical studies make it more difficult to assess the therapeutic effects when take RC level as a biomarker of lipid-lowering treatment. Basically, drug-target MR analyses for pharmaceutical development and effect prediction can provide compelling genetic evidence and identify potential druggable targets and target-off effects. Drugs with a known genetic basis of the mechanism of action are more likely to be succeed in clinical trials or help estimate the effects of long-term drug exposure.

### PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114zoPsJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

The discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) and the development of inhibitors of PCSK9 function appear to mark an epochal advance in clinical lipidology. PCSK9 is a circulating protein that binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and facilitates their lysosomal degradation following internalization in cells. Blocking PCSK9 thus increases the recycling of LDL receptors and results in more receptors on the cell surface, particularly in the liver, thereby lowering LDL levels. In this Roundtable, we discuss the recent large cardiovascular outcomes trials in which evolocumab and alirocumab, monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9, successfully reduced major cardiovascular events. We discuss the safety of these drugs as well as the safety of maintaining very low LDL cholesterol levels. Finally, we address pragmatic considerations affecting the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in clinical practice.

PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies — benefits and harms versus usual care: Based on summary estimates from randomized controlled trials, the task force determined that evolocumab does not result in a clinically meaningful difference in the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV)-related mortality, stroke, coronary revascularization, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) events, or discontinuation due to adverse events compared with usual care, while the addition of evolocumab to usual care leads to a small decrease in risk of myocardial infarction (MI). For alirocumab, the certainty of evidence was moderate across all outcomes, and the task force determined that it does not result in a clinically meaningful difference in the risk of CV-related mortality, stroke, coronary revascularization, or discontinuation due to adverse effects but does lead to a small decrease in the risk of MI and trivial reductions in PVD events and all-cause mortality when compared with usual care.

PCSK9 monoclonal antibody outcomes in very high-risk ASCVD — The FOURIER trial evaluated evolocumab among those with established ASCVD with an LDL-C level of ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C level of ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximal statin with or without ezetimibe. Cardiovascular events were significantly reduced by 15% with evolocumab, and no increased risk of neurocognitive adverse effects was observed. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial evaluated alirocumab use in patients with an ACS event 1 to 12 months earlier on maximal statin with or without ezetimibe, and cardiovascular events were significantly reduced by 15% with alirocumab. The absolute risk reduction was relatively modest (1.5% and 0.6%, respectively) in both trials.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^112iRGMA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Among PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab had a greater LDL‐C reduction than alirocumab. For evolocumab 140 mg Q2W at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 versus comparators at ≥ 12 weeks, the treatment difference versus alirocumab 75 mg was −20.03% (95% CrI −27.32% to −12.96%) and −13.63% (95% CrI −22.43% to −5.33%) compared with alirocumab 150 mg. The treatment difference between evolocumab 420 mg QM and alirocumab 300 mg QM was −19.21% (95% CrI −28.52% to −10.35%) for evolocumab at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and comparators at ≥ 12 weeks. Treatment differences were similar for evolocumab at week 12 versus comparators at ≥ 12 weeks (Figure S1).

We also conducted a post hoc analysis of evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM combined as 1 treatment arm at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 versus alirocumab 75 mg (−18.32%, 95% CrI −24.30% to −12.40%) or 150 mg (−11.06%, 95% CrI −18.72% to −3.73%) Q2W at ≥ 12 weeks (Figures S4A and S5A). Another post hoc analysis included all studies that met inclusion criteria, regardless of the background therapy (eg, ezetimibe, other lipid‐lowering therapies, low‐intensity/no statin) (Figures S4B and S5B): evolocumab 140 mg Q2W at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 versus alirocumab at weeks ≥ 12 was −16.76% (95% CrI, −22.54% to −11.02%) for 75 mg Q2W and −9.88% (95% CrI, −17.60% to −2.29%) for 150 mg Q2W.

### Bridging the racial disparity gap in lipid-lowering therapy [^11162jYE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

With this background in mind, it is pertinent that in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Daviglus et al now report the efficacy of the commercially available PCSK9 inhibitor, evolocumab, in LDL lowering in different ethnic/racial groups in > 7500 patients. 16 They compiled pooled data from 15 randomized controlled trials of evolocumab versus placebo in 4 different minorities: Black, Asian, Hispanic, and non‐White (American Indian, Hawaiian, mixed race) patients. The individual study designs and populations enrolled were heterogeneous, with ≈25% having known atherosclerotic CVD (ie, secondary prevention) and the remainder being primary prevention but with diabetes mellitus, familial hypercholesterolemia, or statin intolerance, or those not optimally controlled on statins. Study duration ranged from 12 weeks to 5 years; some studies had an open‐label extension, in which after 1 year, all patients previously receiving placebo were transitioned to evolocumab. The placebo arm included either true placebo or ezetimibe comparator. The main result was that there were no significant differences in percentage LDL‐C lowering, those with > 50% LDL‐C lowering, or percentage of patients who achieved LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL. There were also favorable accompanying changes in other lipid parameters, as expected from prior randomized controlled trial data, in White individuals (reductions in apolipoprotein B and non–high‐density lipoprotein of ≈50% were seen, lipoprotein[a] ≈20%, triglycerides ≈8%, and an increase in high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol of ≈7%). Treatment effects were directionally consistent and not statistically different across various patient characteristics, including race, sex, dosing schedules (weeks versus monthly injections), and statin intolerance status. Interestingly, patients with diabetes mellitus had a greater LDL‐C reduction, especially among the Asian subgroup (LDL‐C lowering of 69.6 ± 20.2% occurred in 305 Asian patients versus 51.5 ± 25.6% in 440 White patients; P < 0.001). These results are thus reminiscent of the higher statin potency that has also been observed in Asian subjects. Furthermore, prior statin trials have shown that the effectiveness on cardiovascular outcomes is preserved across different races; in the Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention ‐ an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of rosuvastatin in primary prevention, the degree of patient risk determined statin benefit, not ethnicity or sex. 17

### Efficacy of evolocumab on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with recent myocardial infarction: a prespecified secondary analysis from the FOURIER trial [^115ENj8T]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Multisociety Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol identified patients with recent (past 12 months) myocardial infarction (MI) as very high risk, in whom a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable to add to maximally tolerated statin combined with ezetimibe if their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or greater or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 100 mg/dL or greater.

Objective

To examine the clinical efficacy of evolocumab in patients with recent MI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, in which 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease treated with a statin were randomized to evolocumab vs placebo. Patients with prior MI with a known date (n = 22 320) were stratified as having a recent MI (within 12 months of randomization) or a remote MI (more than 12 months prior to randomization). Per protocol, patients with MI within 4 weeks prior to randomization were excluded from the FOURIER trial. Data were collected from February 2013 to November 2016, and data were analyzed from May 2019 to February 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary composite end point was cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke.

Results

Of 22 320 included patients, 17 516 (78.5%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 62.2 (9.0) years. Compared with 16 609 patients with a remote MI, 5711 patients with a recent MI were younger and more likely to be treated with high-intensity statin (77.3% [4415] vs 69.3% [11 506]). In the placebo arm, the 3-year Kaplan-Meier rate for the primary end point was 17.2% in patients with recent MI compared with 14.4% in those with remote MI (adjusted HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.29–1.64; P < .001). Similarly, the 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates for the key secondary end point was also higher in those with recent MI (10.9% vs 9.5%; adjusted HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.24–1.69; P < .001). In patients with a recent MI, evolocumab reduced the risk of the primary and key secondary end points by 19% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93) and 25% (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62–0.91), respectively. In patients with a remote MI, evolocumab reduced the risk of the primary and key secondary end points by 8% (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84–1.01; P for interaction = .13) and 15% (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.96; P for interaction = .24), respectively. Given the higher event rates in patients with a recent MI, the absolute risk reductions over 3 years with evolocumab were 3.7% in those with recent MI vs 1.1% in those with remote MI for the primary end point and 3.2% vs 1.3%, respectively, for the key secondary end point.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with a recent MI were at higher risk of cardiovascular events and tended to experience greater absolute risk reductions with evolocumab than those with remote MIs. These findings support the concept in US and European guidelines to aggressively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in very high-risk patients, such as those with a recent MI.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Nonstatin lipid‑modifying therapies — systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in individuals with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk — found eligible RCTs with a sample size of > 1000 and follow‑up > 1 year, identifying 10 trials, with a prespecified composite primary outcome of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. There was evidence for reduced ASCVD morbidity with ezetimibe and 2 PCSK9 inhibitors and a reduced ASCVD mortality rate was reported for 1 PCSK9 inhibitor; in IMPROVE‑IT, ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin reduced the primary outcome by 1.8% over 7 years (hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84–0.96; 7‑year number needed to treat: 56), in FOURIER evolocumab decreased the primary outcome by 1.5% over 2.2 years (hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73–0.88; 2.2‑year number needed to treat: 67), and in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES alirocumab reduced the primary outcome by 1.6% over 2.8 years (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79–0.93; 2.8‑year number needed to treat: 63). For ezetimibe and the PCSK9 inhibitors, adverse event risks did not differ between treatment and control; in patients at high risk of ASCVD on background statin therapy there was minimal evidence for improved ASCVD risk or adverse events with cholesterol‑ester transfer protein inhibitors, and no evidence of benefit for addition of niacin to statins; direct between‑trial comparisons were limited by differences in sample size, follow‑up duration, and primary outcomes.

### PCSK9 inhibition and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: does reality match the hype? [^116ykmbP]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Within this review we look at whether the potential provided by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease matches the excitement generated. Two fully human monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 are currently licenced for clinical use both in the United States and the European Union: evolocumab and alirocumab. These reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by over 50% across a range of populations and were generally found to have a safety profile comparable with placebo. The development programme for a third humanised monoclonal antibody, bococizumab, was terminated early due to the presence of neutralising antibodies reducing its efficacy over time. Results from the first cardiovascular outcomes trial, FOURIER, have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events in a population with stable cardiovascular disease over a 2-year period. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial comparing alirocumab to placebo is expected to report in 2018 and provide cardiovascular outcome data in a post acute coronary syndrome population. Monoclonal antibodies have an injection burden of 12–26 injections per year. An alternative approach to reducing PCSK9 is to inhibit translation of the messenger RNA for PCSK9. The phase II ORION-1 study using inclisiran, a small interference RNA to PCSK9, suggested that two doses of inclisiran produced time averaged reductions in LDL cholesterol of 50% over 9 months. The ORION-4 cardiovascular outcome trial will assess the cardiovascular benefits of two injections per year using inclisiran. With further outcome trials expected, appropriate patient selection will be key considering the higher drug costs of these therapies.

PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab) — efficacy, safety, and interactions: Cardiovascular outcomes trials reported benefit with add-on therapy; in ODYSSEY Outcomes, 18,600 post-ACS (4–52 weeks) patients on evidence-based statin therapy had a reduction in the primary endpoint of CHD death, MI, ischemic stroke, or hospitalization for UA with addition of alirocumab, and in FOURIER, 27,564 patients with prior MI, stroke, or PAD on atorvastatin ≥ 20 mg or equivalent had a reduction in the primary endpoint of CV death, MI, stroke, revascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina with addition of evolocumab. Contraindication is history of hypersensitivity to the medication, hypersensitivity reactions occurred during clinical trials with instruction to discontinue and treat if serious reactions occur, there are no clinically significant drug-drug interactions identified, use during pregnancy/lactation has no safety data in humans and to avoid use, and for evolocumab patients with latex sensitivity should be advised that the needle covers on the products contain latex.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116M6uEC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

There are limited head‐to‐head comparative trial data for nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies (LLTs) (focused on PCSK9 inhibitors versus other nonstatin LLTs, including newer agents); therefore, indirect treatment comparisons through network meta‐analysis (NMA) may inform evidence‐based treatment decisions. We previously used NMA to compare LDL‐C reduction in nonstatin LLTs, including evolocumab, alirocumab, and ezetimibe, in patients receiving statin background therapy.

Since this earlier publication, new studies of the approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab have been published, and 2 new LLTs have emerged: bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administrationand the European Medicines Agency; and inclisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) PCSK9 inhibitor that has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, and the US Food and Drug Administration. This systematic review and NMA sought to provide a detailed assessment of the relative efficacy of nonstatin agents in reducing LDL‐C.

### 2018 AHA / ACC / AACVPR / AAPA / ABC / ACPM / ADA / AGS / APhA / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task Force on Clinical practice guidelines [^114EEYBq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Limitations and knowledge gaps — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) priorities: The guideline notes that it is based largely on RCT outcomes and that most RCT data are from statin therapy, with limited nonstatin add-on data; more data are needed and several questions remain for additional RCTs, including in secondary prevention whether a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exists beyond which incremental benefit is not worth risks or cost; what indications justify adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy; in patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects whether PCSK9 inhibitors are an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins; in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what incremental risk reduction high-intensity statins provide versus moderate-intensity statins; and in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what the value is of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^116RRBuT]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence and provide updated and new recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These recommendations are intended for use by clinicians, health care team members, patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders.

Methods

This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary task force of content experts and guideline methodologists based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or cohort studies from database inception to November 7, 2023. An updated literature search was completed for any additional articles published by May 31, 2024. Clinical questions addressing nonstatin medications and patient-important outcomes were prioritized. The task force assessed the certainty of the evidence and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. All recommendations were based on the consideration of the certainty of the evidence across patient-important outcomes, in addition to issues of feasibility, acceptability, equity, and patient preferences and values.

Results

This guideline update includes 13 evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia focused on patient-important outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction. The task force issued a good practice statement to assess the risk of ASCVD events for primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia. The task force suggested the use of alirocumab, evolocumab, or bempedoic acid for adults who have ASCVD or who are at increased risk for ASCVD in addition to standard care. The task force suggested against the use of these medications in adults without ASCVD. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the addition of inclisiran. For adults with hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD, the task force suggested the use of eicosapentaenoic acid but not eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid and strongly recommended against the use of niacin. There was insufficient evidence for recommendations regarding pharmacologic management in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). The task force suggested a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goal of < 70 mg/dL in adults with dyslipidemia and ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD.

Conclusions

Pharmacotherapy is recommended in adults with dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of ASCVD events. There are several effective and safe treatment options for adults with dyslipidemia who have ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD who need additional lipid-lowering medications. Shared decision-making discussions are essential to determine the best option for each individual.

### Effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials [^116JSRhf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The recently released results of the FOURIER trial, a cardiovascular outcomes study that randomized 27 564 adults aged 40 to 85 years with clinical ASCVD and baseline LDL‐C > 70 mg/dL on background statin therapy to evolocumab or placebo, demonstrated a 15% reduction in the primary end point of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization and a 20% reduction in the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke. However, no benefit was observed in all‐cause mortality (P = 0.54) or cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.62). 5

These findings are corroborated by our meta‐analysis of 45 539 participants of all available phase 2 and 3 trials of evolocumab and alirocumab. Importantly, although we found significant relative improvement in the risk of MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization, the absolute risk reduction was relatively small, especially for stroke (absolute risk reduction: 0.4%; number needed to treat: 255). No statistically significant differences were identified in study‐level subgroup analyses including patients on or off treatment with a background statin and patients with FH. In contrast with a previous meta‐analysis from lipid‐lowering trials, 47 we found no benefit in all‐cause mortality with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. This finding may be attributable to the fact that our analysis included 2 large trials of populations with a baseline LDL‐C of < 100 mg/dL, 5, 20 contributing to an overall baseline LDL‐C of 106 mg/dL in our pooled sample. Taken in the context of this relatively low baseline LDL‐C, this lack of benefit in mortality is concordant with prior studies examining further LDL‐C reduction with high‐intensity statins 49, 50 or ezetimibe. 4 Notably, using random‐effects metaregression at the study level, we found that there was a significant association between higher baseline LDL‐C levels and all‐cause mortality benefit derived. This generates the hypothesis that reduction in all‐cause mortality may be possible with PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with higher baseline LDL‐C, such as patients with FH or patients with high LDL‐C levels who are intolerant to statins. Further research is needed to determine whether there is an LDL‐C cutoff at which PCSK9 inhibitors are associated with a mortality benefit.

### Reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and cardiovascular events with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and statins: an analysis of FOURIER, SPIRE, and the cholesterol treatment trialists collaboration [^114b1NLJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The fact that the clinical benefit of both PCSK9 inhibitors and statins depends on the absolute magnitude of the achieved LDL-C reduction and the total duration of treatment has important implications for the on-going ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial. This trial randomized 18 600 patients to biweekly injections of alirocumab (initially 75 mg adjusted to 150 mg in a blinded fashion to achieve an LDL-C value of between 15 and 50 mg/dL with dose adjustment for patients with LDL-C below 15 mg/dL) or matching placebo beginning 1 to 12 months after an index hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Assuming that the tailored-dose approach will lead to a 50% reduction in LDL-C, treatment with alirocumab should reduce LDL-C by approximately 1.1 mmol/L (43.2 mg/dL) from a baseline LDL-C level of 2.2 mmol/L (86.4 mg/dL). Importantly, in the CTT meta-analysis, treatment with a statin reduced major cardiovascular events by 17% after 2 years of treatment and by 20% after 3 years of treatment (Table 1). Therefore, based on an expected median follow-up of 33 months (2.75 years), reducing LDL-C by 1.1 mmol/L with alirocumab should reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 18–22% in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial.

### Effect of evolocumab on progression of coronary disease in statin-treated patients: the GLAGOV randomized clinical trial [^115Ls1sH]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with intensive statin therapy reduces progression of coronary atherosclerosis in proportion to achieved LDL-C levels. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors produce incremental LDL-C lowering in statin-treated patients; however, the effects of these drugs on coronary atherosclerosis have not been evaluated.

Objective

To determine the effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in statin-treated patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The GLAGOV multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (enrollment May 3, 2013, to January 12, 2015) conducted at 197 academic and community hospitals in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, and South Africa and enrolling 968 patients presenting for coronary angiography.

Interventions

Participants with angiographic coronary disease were randomized to receive monthly evolocumab (420 mg) (n = 484) or placebo (n = 484) via subcutaneous injection for 76 weeks, in addition to statins.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy measure was the nominal change in percent atheroma volume (PAV) from baseline to week 78, measured by serial intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) imaging. Secondary efficacy measures were nominal change in normalized total atheroma volume (TAV) and percentage of patients demonstrating plaque regression. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

Among the 968 treated patients (mean age, 59.8 years [SD, 9.2]; 269 [27.8%] women; mean LDL-C level, 92.5 mg/dL [SD, 27.2]), 846 had evaluable imaging at follow-up. Compared with placebo, the evolocumab group achieved lower mean, time-weighted LDL-C levels (93.0 vs 36.6 mg/dL; difference, -56.5 mg/dL [95% CI, -59.7 to -53.4]; P < .001). The primary efficacy parameter, PAV, increased 0.05% with placebo and decreased 0.95% with evolocumab (difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -1.8% to -0.64%]; P < .001). The secondary efficacy parameter, normalized TAV, decreased 0.9 mm3 with placebo and 5.8 mm3 with evolocumab (difference, -4.9 mm3 [95% CI, -7.3 to -2.5]; P < .001). Evolocumab induced plaque regression in a greater percentage of patients than placebo (64.3% vs 47.3%; difference, 17.0% [95% CI, 10.4% to 23.6%]; P < .001 for PAV and 61.5% vs 48.9%; difference, 12.5% [95% CI, 5.9% to 19.2%]; P < .001 for TAV).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with angiographic coronary disease treated with statins, addition of evolocumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a greater decrease in PAV after 76 weeks of treatment. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on clinical outcomes.

Impact of Each Intervention on theLevels of a Simulated Population

Of the 10 000 simulated LDL‐C values ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) and thus requiring additional LLT, the proportion of values that achieved the 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society guideline LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) was highest for treatment with evolocumab, at 78.41%, followed by alirocumab, 150 mg Q2W, at 74.68% (Figure 7). Alirocumab, 75 mg Q2W, alirocumab, 300 mg QM, and inclisiran achieved proportions of 63.03%, 61.30%, and 60.25%, respectively. This was followed by bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FDC with 49.45%, and each monotherapy at 21.87% and 20.75%, respectively.

### Prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in south Asians in the US: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^114qCkQD]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) show quantified benefits on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and outcomes, with guidance for South Asian US (SAUS) patients aligned to general recommendations. In IMPROVE-IT, combination therapy with simvastatin and ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 24% versus simvastatin alone and produced a 2% absolute reduction (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99; p = 0.016) in a composite of cardiovascular death, major coronary event, or stroke after 7 years. The 2018 AHA/ACC/MS Cholesterol Management Guideline endorsed adding ezetimibe for ASCVD patients with persistent LDL-C elevation despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, and for SAUS patients, specific data are unavailable but, given safety and tolerability, "its use is recommended in line with existing guidelines for the general US population". In FOURIER, adding evolocumab to background statins resulted in a 59% decrease in LDL-C, a 15% relative reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization, and a 20% reduction in cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke at a median follow-up of 26 months. In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, 18,924 post–acute coronary syndrome patients on high-intensity or maximally tolerated statins were randomized; alirocumab yielded a 15% reduction in the primary composite endpoint at a median follow-up of 2.8 years, with larger reductions among those with baseline LDL-C > 100 mg/dL. Across both PCSK9 inhibitor trials, there did not appear to be adverse effects associated with very low LDL-C levels including neurocognitive effects.

### Long-term evolocumab in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^112b7vFF]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk), the proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and risk of cardiovascular events and was safe and well tolerated over a median of 2.2 years of follow-up. However, large-scale, long-term data are lacking.

Methods

The parent FOURIER trial randomized 27564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin to evolocumab versus placebo. Patients completing FOURIER at participating sites were eligible to receive evolocumab in 2 open-label extension studies (FOURIER-OLE [FOURIER Open-Label Extension]) in the United States and Europe; primary analyses were pooled across studies. The primary end point was the incidence of adverse events. Lipid values and major adverse cardiovascular events were prospectively collected.

Results

A total of 6635 patients were enrolled in FOURIER-OLE (3355 randomized to evolocumab and 3280 to placebo in the parent study). Median follow-up in FOURIER-OLE was 5.0 years; maximum exposure to evolocumab in parent plus FOURIER-OLE was 8.4 years. At 12 weeks in FOURIER-OLE, median LDL-C was 30 mg/dL, and 63.2% of patients achieved LDL-C < 40 mg/dL on evolocumab. Incidences of serious adverse events, muscle-related events, new-onset diabetes, hemorrhagic stroke, and neurocognitive events with evolocumab long term did not exceed those for placebo-treated patients during the parent study and did not increase over time. During the FOURIER-OLE follow-up period, patients originally randomized in the parent trial to evolocumab versus placebo had a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]; P = 0.008); a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68–0.93]; P = 0.003); and a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.99]; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Long-term LDL-C lowering with evolocumab was associated with persistently low rates of adverse events for > 8 years that did not exceed those observed in the original placebo arm during the parent study and led to further reductions in cardiovascular events compared with delayed treatment initiation.

### Long-term lipid lowering with evolocumab in older individuals [^111JopTj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns about the efficacy and safety of intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in older patients have led to weaker recommendations in the U.S. guidelines for patients ≥ 75 years of age compared to younger patients. Data are sparse on long-term benefits of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition in older patients.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the long-term benefit of evolocumab among patients aged ≥ 75 years.

Methods

The FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial randomized 27,564 patients who were 18 to 85 years of age with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to evolocumab vs placebo with 2.2 years of median follow-up. In the open-label extension (FOURIER-OLE), 6,635 participants were transitioned to open-label evolocumab for an additional 5-year median follow-up. The primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) was compared based on the original allocation to evolocumab vs placebo stratified by age (< 75 vs ≥ 75 years). Analyses were underpowered for individual components of the composite endpoint. The annualized incidence rates for adverse events of interest were calculated for the OLE population across age groups during the parent FOURIER trial by randomized treatment arm and during the combined parent and FOURIER-OLE studies for patients originally allocated to evolocumab.

Results

Of 27,564 patients, 2,526 (9%) were ≥ 75 years of age at entry into FOURIER (median age: 77 years [Q1-Q3: 76–79 years]). The median follow-up in FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE was 7.1 years (Q1-Q3: 6.7–7.6 years), with a maximum of 8.7 years. Earlier initiation of evolocumab reduced the rate of the primary endpoint at least as well in older (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64–0.97) as in younger patients (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80–0.92; P interaction = 0.43). The absolute risk reductions were 5.4% (95% CI: -2.0% to 12.8%) in older and 2.3% (95% CI: 0.1%-4.5%) in younger patients, leading to numbers needed to treat of 19 and 44, respectively. The annualized incidence rates of safety events generally appeared similar across treatment arms in both age groups.

Conclusions

Early initiation of long-term evolocumab provides older patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cardiovascular benefits at least as good as those observed in younger patients, with a more favorable number needed to treat in older patients for reducing a composite endpoint and no significant safety concerns. These findings may be helpful in guiding future recommendations.

### In very-high-risk patients with vascular disease, evolocumab… [^114wAGUh]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease who are already taking a statin. Bottom Line In an extremely high-risk group of patients with known vascular disease, taking evolocumab instead of placebo in addition to standard statin therapy for slightly more than two years will prevent one myocardial infarction for every 83 persons treated and prevent one stroke for every 250 persons treated. At the current cost of the drug in the United States, that amounts to approximately $2. 5 million per nonfatal MI prevented. This was an extremely high-risk group, which is important to keep in mind. All patients had to be taking a high-intensity statin yet still have a fasting LDL level of at least 70 mg per dL.

The mean age of participants was 62 years, 75% were men, 85% were white, and most came from Europe. The most common type of vascular disease was a history of previous MI. The patients were randomized to receive evolocumab injections or placebo injection. The groups were balanced at the start of the study, and analysis was by intention to treat. The drug certainly lowers the LDL level, from a median of 92 mg per dL at baseline to approximately 30 mg per dL within one month. After a median follow-up of just over two years, the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or revascularization occurred less often in the evolocumab group. As always, it is important to look at individual outcomes.

There was no difference in the likelihood of cardiovascular death or all-cause mortality. The bulk of the benefit came from fewer nonfatal MIs (3. 4% vs.
4. 6%;.

### Evolocumab (PCSK9 inhibitor) for cholesterol lowering… [^116NnChy]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Evolocumab, a subcutaneously injected PCSK9 inhibitor, has been approved by the FDA as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-cholesterol. It was also approved as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who require additional lowering of LDL-C. Evolocumab is the second PCSK9 inhibitor to be approved in the US; alirocumab was approved earlier.

### Effectiveness… [^114Fykkx]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Evolocumab is an injectable human monoclonal antibody labeled for decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Evolocumab is the second approved inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, which prevents the PCSK9 protein from degrading LDL receptors, thereby increasing LDL clearance and reducing serum cholesterol. 3 The 2% discontinuation rate is similar to that of lipid-lowering medication combinations, such as a statin plus ezetimibe.
4. EFFECTIVENESS In patients with atherosclerotic disease or familial hypercholesterolemia who are already taking standard lipid-lowering agents such as statin medications, evolocumab significantly reduces serum LDL cholesterol values by 50% to 75% when compared with standard therapy alone at three months to one year.

4–6 Although evolocumab is highly effective at numeric reduction of LDL cholesterol, most trials have not investigated clinically important patient-centered outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or premature death from cardiovascular disease. Although evolocumab is not labeled for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events, a single study that preliminarily explored composite cardiovascular outcomes showed that there may be fewer cardiovascular events with evolocumab compared with lipid-lowering therapy. To prevent one additional cardiovascular event, 81 patients must use evolocumab for one year. 6 It is unknown whether these effects persist beyond one year.

Bottom Line Evolocumab is generally safe and effective at lowering serum LDL cholesterol levels for select patients who need marked cholesterol reduction and can tolerate injections. However, it remains unknown whether evolocumab prevents premature death from cardiovascular events. The role of evolocumab may be limited to use by subspecialists seeing patients with specific conditions requiring dramatic reduction in LDL cholesterol levels.
