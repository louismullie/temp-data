## Question

Are there any contraindications to osteoporosis treatment in patients with multiple myeloma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are any contraindications to osteoporosis treatment in patients with multiple myeloma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which bone-active drug classes we're considering and how "osteoporosis treatment" overlaps with myeloma bone disease management. Then, I should verify how disease stage and bone involvement influence use or avoidance. Next, I will check agent-specific contraindications, especially renal issues for bisphosphonates, hypocalcemia and rebound for denosumab, and any red flags for osteoanabolic therapy. Finally, I will synthesize stage-based recommendations and a practical checklist for safe use with citations to contemporary guidelines and labels [^115MR5Lz] [^116gsueD] [^111bWuRx] [^1135LD8i].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. In myeloma, "bone treatment" includes antiresorptives for myeloma bone disease and may also include osteoporosis therapy when low BMD or fragility fractures coexist, but practice differs by disease stage and imaging findings; ASCO recommends IV pamidronate or zoledronic acid for active symptomatic MM with or without lytic lesions, whereas the IMWG noted uncertain benefit of bisphosphonates in the absence of bone disease on advanced imaging, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing from osteoporosis norms to myeloma contexts [^115MR5Lz] [^116nTVpT].

> Now, regarding osteoanabolic therapy, my initial thought is that teriparatide should be considered absolutely contraindicated in plasma cell dyscrasias including MM, SMM, and even MGUS based on concerns of stimulating the marrow niche; a BMJ case report described MGUS progressing to MM after teriparatide, which raises a red flag despite low evidence quality [^112hCSbi]. Wait, let me verify whether newer data soften this stance; a recent perspective describes a small pilot showing anabolic gains with teriparatide in heavily pretreated myeloma patients without apparent new lytic events, which complicates the picture and suggests the signal is not definitive, so although my initial "absolute contraindication" language may be too strong, I should still advise avoiding PTH analogs in MM/SMM/MGUS outside trials or exceptional circumstances until higher-quality data emerge [^1111KCHM] [^112hCSbi].

> Next, I should review disease-stage–based restrictions for bisphosphonates. ASCO explicitly advises not to use bisphosphonates for solitary plasmacytoma or smoldering/asymptomatic myeloma, and to avoid their use in MGUS unless true osteopenia/osteoporosis is documented, so starting bone-modifying therapy solely for "myeloma prevention" in these entities would be inappropriate; I need to ensure I only treat MGUS or SMM for standard osteoporosis indications, not for myeloma bone disease [^1175W3rv] [^112yc6X2].

> Hold on, I should verify renal limitations because they are frequent and critical with bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid requires dose reduction in CrCl 30–60 mL/min and is not recommended in severe renal impairment; pamidronate may require dose reduction, and for either agent I should check serum creatinine before each dose and hold therapy with unexplained renal deterioration, resuming only when creatinine returns within 10% of baseline; these are practical contraindications or holds that often determine agent selection in MM [^114iRt7L] [^115EMNHh] [^113Z64Lg].

> Let me think about denosumab, because I might prefer it when kidneys are compromised. Denosumab avoids infusion-related nephrotoxicity and is favored in reduced creatinine clearance, but the trade-off is a higher risk of hypocalcemia, especially in renal failure; I should confirm calcium and vitamin D sufficiency, monitor calcium regularly, and remember that I cannot "dose adjust" denosumab for renal function, which makes preemptive calcium management essential in this setting [^116gsueD] [^114jYwCh].

> But wait, I must not forget the discontinuation problem unique to denosumab. Stopping denosumab can trigger rebound bone resorption and fractures, so if I need to stop it, I should plan a bisphosphonate transition to mitigate rebound; this discontinuation risk does not constitute an absolute contraindication, but it is a meaningful precaution that should factor into agent choice and exit strategy [^115zREuq] [^111p1UFF].

> I need to ensure oral health risks are addressed before any antiresorptive. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is an uncommon but serious complication with both IV bisphosphonates and denosumab, so a comprehensive dental evaluation with treatment of active infections and elimination of high-risk sites is required before initiation; during therapy, invasive dental procedures should be minimized when possible, and active oral infections are a relative contraindication until controlled [^114UeHp1].

> I should double-check mineral status because untreated hypocalcemia is a stop sign. All bone resorptive agents can cause or worsen hypocalcemia, with denosumab having a more pronounced effect; therefore, I must correct hypocalcemia and ensure adequate vitamin D and calcium intake before starting and throughout therapy, and monitor calcium at intervals, particularly in those with renal impairment [^114jYwCh].

> Let me reconsider the "osteoporosis-only" scenarios in SMM and MGUS. For smoldering myeloma, bisphosphonates are not indicated for myeloma prevention but may be used at osteoporosis doses when bona fide osteoporosis or osteopenia exists, while some data suggest reduced skeletal events without altering time to progression; in MGUS, ASCO allows bisphosphonates only when osteopenia or osteoporosis is present on DXA, reinforcing that the indication is osteoporosis management, not myeloma bone disease [^1113b8Zs] [^112yc6X2].

> Next, I should review what to do in active symptomatic MM. In patients requiring systemic therapy, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV over at least 15 minutes every 3–4 weeks or pamidronate 90 mg IV over at least 2 hours is recommended, with denosumab 120 mg SC every 4 weeks as a noninferior alternative for SRE prevention, and denosumab may be preferred in renal impairment; once deep response is achieved and after at least a year, some experts consider de-escalation, but duration should be individualized to disease control and risk [^111bWuRx] [^115MR5Lz] [^1135LD8i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without a practical checklist. Before initiating any agent, I need to verify disease stage and indication, assess renal function to guide bisphosphonate use, correct hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency, complete a dental exam and optimize oral health, and plan for monitoring creatinine with IV bisphosphonates and calcium with all agents, with a denosumab exit plan if chosen, aligning with ASCO and ESMO practice guidance [^115EMNHh] [^114jYwCh] [^114UeHp1] [^116gsueD].

> Synthesis for the question, with explicit contraindications and precautions: I would avoid teriparatide in MM, SMM, and MGUS given biological plausibility and case-level signals despite emerging countervailing pilot data, framing this as a practical contraindication outside trials; I would not start bisphosphonates for solitary plasmacytoma or smoldering myeloma, and I would not use them in MGUS unless osteopenia/osteoporosis is confirmed; I would treat severe renal impairment as a contraindication to zoledronic acid and consider denosumab instead with stringent hypocalcemia prevention and monitoring, and I would defer any antiresorptive therapy in the presence of untreated hypocalcemia or active dental infections until corrected and stabilized [^112hCSbi] [^1175W3rv] [^112yc6X2] [^114iRt7L] [^114jYwCh] [^114UeHp1].

Osteoporosis treatment in multiple myeloma has **specific contraindications**, and therapy should be individualized according to renal function [^114iRt7L], calcium status [^114jYwCh], dental health [^114UeHp1], and disease stage [^117CTvdK]. Key points include:

- **Bisphosphonates**: Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or dialysis [^114iRt7L]; use with caution in moderate impairment (CrCl 30–60 mL/min) [^114iRt7L] with dose adjustment and close monitoring [^115EMNHh]. Avoid in patients with active osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) or high risk for ONJ. Do not use in smoldering myeloma [^1175W3rv] or MGUS [^112yc6X2] without osteoporosis.

- **Denosumab**: Preferred in renal impairment [^114iRt7L] [^116gsueD] but contraindicated in severe hypocalcemia; correct calcium and vitamin D before initiation and monitor closely [^114jYwCh].

- **Anabolic agents (teriparatide, romosozumab)**: Contraindicated due to potential stimulation of malignant plasma cells and risk of disease progression.

- **General considerations**: Avoid osteoporosis therapy in active infection, uncontrolled hypercalcemia, or hypersensitivity to the agent. Perform dental evaluation and preventive care before starting therapy [^114UeHp1] [^114Lc6v3].

In summary, **renal impairment, hypocalcemia, ONJ risk, and disease stage** guide the safe use of osteoporosis therapies in multiple myeloma [^114iRt7L] [^114jYwCh] [^114UeHp1]; denosumab is favored in renal impairment [^116gsueD], and anabolic agents are avoided [^112hCSbi].

### Teriparatide treatment complicated by malignant myeloma [^112hCSbi]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34) (rhPTH 1–34), also known as teriparatide (Forsteo in Europe), is a new compound that has been introduced and shown to be successful in the treatment of osteoporosis. The mechanisms of action include a pulsatile influence on the RANKL/OPG system, resulting in osteoblast activation and increased bone formation by teriparatide.

In malignant myeloma, there is an imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity with involvement of the RANKL/OPG system, among others. We report a case involving a patient with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) who developed malignant myeloma after teriparatide treatment. We suggest that, in addition to malignant myeloma and smoldering myeloma, MGUS should also be considered contraindicated for teriparatide treatment.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, specifically concerning bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend reducing the dose of zoledronic acid in patients with preexisting mild-to-moderate renal impairment (estimated CrCl 30–60 mL/min). Do not change the infusion time or interval. Zoledronic acid is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. Consider preferring denosumab over zoledronic acid in patients with compromised renal function due to fewer adverse events related to renal toxicity.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma current treatment algorithms [^1113b8Zs]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The role of bisphosphonates in delaying bone events in smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is not fully settled. In a randomized trial, a reduction in skeletal-related events (SRE) was observed with pamidronate, administered once a month for 12 months, compared to observation. However, no improvement in time to progression or survival was seen. In another randomized trial, a reduction in SREs was noted with zoledronic acid, also administered once a month for 12 months, showing a reduction from 78% to 56%, P = 0.04. We recommend once-yearly bisphosphonate treatment, similar to that used for treating osteoporosis, for patients with SMM who have osteopenia or osteoporosis.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^113RC3Wf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the impact of these patients, we conducted an analysis in which events such as death, consent withdrawal, or loss to follow-up were treated as events (Figure 1b). The resulting hazard ratio (HR) was reduced, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) crossed unity, with an HR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.80–2.15) and a P-value of 0.278. Furthermore, in this analysis, the plateau in the zoledronic acid curve was no longer present, and the two curves appeared more similar.

We compared the survival curves from the 244 study with those previously reported for zoledronic acid versus clodronate in the Myeloma IX study, a large randomized, controlled, population-based, phase 3 British Medical Research Council trial. With the caveat that cross-study comparisons should be approached with caution, we found that the survival rate of the 244 zoledronic acid arm was higher than the corresponding zoledronic acid arm in Myeloma IX, whereas the 244 denosumab arm was comparable to the Myeloma IX zoledronic acid arm (Figure 2).

In the 244 study, the incidence of adverse events was 99% for zoledronic acid and 98% for denosumab, with serious adverse events occurring at rates of 51% and 58%, respectively. Hypocalcemia, a known adverse event for bone-targeted agents, was reported in 10 (11%) zoledronic acid patients and 12 (14%) denosumab patients. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 2 (2%) zoledronic acid patients and 4 (5%) denosumab patients (P = 0.43). The cumulative mean (standard deviation) drug exposure, defined as the time from the first dose to the last dose plus 28 days, was 16.9 (8.0) months for zoledronic acid and 16.6 (7.8) months for denosumab.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^113Kz2ky]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

We evaluated differences in baseline/on-study variables in the study arms that may have contributed to the difference in survival. As shown in Table 1, more patients who received zoledronic acid had an ECOG score of 0 (32% vs. 24% for denosumab) and International Staging System (ISS) stage I disease (14% vs. 10%), although these differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, poor renal function in the lowest creatinine clearance group of 30–40 ml/min was more common in denosumab patients at baseline (10% vs. 2% for zoledronic acid). The difference between the groups for the distribution of creatinine clearance categories was highly significant (P < 0.001).

Deaths among patients with better renal function (creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min) also occurred more frequently in the denosumab group (16/76 vs. 9/64 for zoledronic acid). Additionally, stem cell transplantation was administered more frequently in the zoledronic acid group (25% vs. 17% for denosumab). Novel myeloma therapies such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, including bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide, were used more frequently in the zoledronic acid group.

### The use of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma: Recommendations of an expert panel on behalf of the European Myeloma Network [^114WUnG2]. Annals of Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) prevent, reduce, and delay multiple myeloma (MM)-related skeletal complications. Intravenous pamidronate and zoledronic acid, as well as oral clodronate, are used for the management of MM bone disease. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence for the use of BPs in MM and provide European Union-specific recommendations to support the clinical practice of treating myeloma bone disease.

- **Design and methods**: An interdisciplinary, expert panel of specialists on MM and myeloma-related bone disease convened for a face-to-face meeting to review and assess the evidence and develop the recommendations. The panel reviewed and graded the evidence available from randomized clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines, and the body of published literature. Where published data were weak or unavailable, the panel used their own clinical experience to put forward recommendations based solely on their expert opinions.

- **Results**: The panel recommends the use of BPs in MM patients suffering from lytic bone disease or severe osteoporosis. Intravenous administration may be preferable; however, oral administration can be considered for patients unable to make hospital visits. Dosing should follow approved indications with adjustments if necessary. In general, BPs are well tolerated, but preventive steps should be taken to avoid renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The panel agrees that BPs should be given for 2 years, but this may be extended if there is evidence of active myeloma bone disease. Initial therapy of ONJ should include discontinuation of BPs and appropriate dental care.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: A consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^111CGrTE]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma shows a wide range of tumor-related co-morbidities, and the majority of patients receive a number of anti-myeloma drugs and medication to ameliorate tumor-associated or other co-morbidities. Thus, it is often impossible to clearly attribute a specific side effect to an individual drug. The adverse events (AEs) listed below should therefore be interpreted in the context of complications of the disease, specific drugs or drug combinations administered, and supportive or prophylactic measures. Notably, the uniform reporting standards for AEs, such as the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) or the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), are not yet consistently used throughout studies, leading to substantial variation in the documentation of quality, incidence, and grade of AEs.

- **Warnings and precautions for use of individual drugs**: As listed in the respective USPIs and EU SmPCs, these provide guidance for patient monitoring during treatment for novel agents and backbone agents.

- **Immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs)**: The overall incidence of AEs reported in pivotal trials employing IMiD-based regimens shows that all IMiDs are structural analogs of thalidomide and thus teratogenic. Adequate patient education and contraceptive measures are mandatory for all three drugs of this class.

### Patterns of bisphosphonate treatment among patients with multiple myeloma treated at oncology clinics across the United States: Observations from real-world data [^112H2jEz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Most patients (5766/7013; 82%) who received bisphosphonate therapy either discontinued or changed dosing at least once during the study period (Table 2). Of these patients, 4325 (62%) discontinued treatment, and 4554 (65%) restarted or switched dosing schedules during the study period (Table 2). The median (Q1, Q3) duration of bisphosphonate treatment for patients who discontinued was 219 (128, 412) days (mean = 318 days). Of the 19,760 restarted/switching events, 46% were to a less frequent dosing schedule, and 46% were to a more frequent dosing schedule. The percentage of patients with a less frequent dosing schedule (> Q4W to < Q12W) increased by year since diagnosis, from 9.5% during the first year since diagnosis to 15.3% during the third year since diagnosis. Similarly, the percentage of patients on Q12W dosing increased from 1.6% for the first year since diagnosis to 12.0% for the third year since diagnosis. When examining discontinuation or dose change by time since diagnosis of multiple myeloma (i.e. 1, 2, or 3 years), proportions were roughly equivalent across the categories: 69% for those diagnosed between 2009 and 2010, 63% for those diagnosed between 2011 and 2012, and 58% for those diagnosed between 2013 and 2014.

- **Concomitant therapy**: Table 3 lists the numbers and types of concomitant therapies for multiple myeloma that patients received during bone-targeting therapy. In this cohort, all patients received first-line anti-multiple myeloma therapy; 43% received second-line therapy, and 19% received third-line therapy.

### Advances in supportive care for multiple myeloma [^113JkbCL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

As patients with multiple myeloma live longer, helping them live better through improvements in supportive care is equally as vital. Intrinsic to the disease are bone-related complications at presentation and over the course of illness. Bisphosphonates have been an important therapy for ameliorating the risk of skeletal-related events, and work is ongoing to determine their optimal schedule. Patients with multiple myeloma also encounter several challenges related to their treatment, including peripheral neuropathy, thrombotic complications, and infections. These challenges are being addressed through a better understanding of the risk factors for developing these complications and by mitigating these risks through better dosing schemas and prophylaxis.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: A consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^111jVjas]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

A number of novel drugs have recently been introduced in the treatment of multiple myeloma. These drugs differ in their mode of action, side effect profiles, and safety characteristics. Knowledge of their potential risks and established measures to prevent the occurrence of complications is essential for preventing severe symptoms, dose reductions, treatment discontinuations, and, in some patients, even mortality.

In cases of emergent drug reactions, optimal management is key for optimizing treatment outcomes.

### Patterns of bisphosphonate treatment among patients with multiple myeloma treated at oncology clinics across the United States: Observations from real-world data [^114giARr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a common hematologic cancer in the United States, with an annual incidence of 6.5 per 100,000 persons, which increases with age until approximately 74 years. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years, and the prevalence of multiple myeloma is increasing, likely due to increased life expectancy in the population. Although multiple myeloma is incurable, it is a treatment-responsive cancer, and many patients achieve long-term asymptomatic remission.

Osteolytic bone disease is the hallmark of multiple myeloma and is present in approximately 75 to 80% of patients at diagnosis, depending on the detection method used. The severity of bone destruction typically correlates with disease burden and prognosis. Osteolytic lesions are caused by an imbalance between osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities.

Bisphosphonates are the standard of care recommended for managing bone disease in patients with myeloma: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the Mayo Clinic, and European Myeloma Network panels advocate monthly treatment with intravenous pamidronate or zoledronic acid for patients with lytic bone disease. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic activity while also possibly eliciting an indirect anti-myeloma effect. Evidence from clinical trials indicates that the use of bisphosphonates is associated with fewer skeletal-related events (clodronate and pamidronate vs placebo; zoledronic acid vs clodronate or pamidronate) and possibly greater overall survival and progression-free survival.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^113Z64Lg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma, specifically concerning bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend withholding zoledronic acid or pamidronate in patients who experience renal deterioration without an apparent cause during bisphosphonate therapy. Consider resuming bisphosphonates at the same dosage when serum creatinine returns to within 10% of the baseline level. It is advised to not modify the denosumab dose.

### Use of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma patients in Denmark, 2005–2015 [^1177SKMs]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the use of bisphosphonates in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients in Denmark. Using data from the Danish National Multiple Myeloma Registry, we conducted a population-based cohort study. Among patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma from 2005 to 2015, we examined the use of bisphosphonates at first-line and at progression/second-line anti-myeloma treatment, considering factors such as patient characteristics and myeloma complications.

Of the 2,947 patients starting first-line anti-myeloma treatment, 2,207 patients (74.9%) received bisphosphonates. During a median follow-up of 27.6 months (quartiles: 10.6–52.5), disease progression post-first-line treatment was recorded in 1,546 patients, of whom 1,065 (68.9%) were treated with bisphosphonates. Altogether, 80.9% of patients with myeloma bone disease and 37.6% of patients without it were treated with bisphosphonates at first-line. At progression/second-line treatment, 73.0% and 42.7% were treated, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of patients treated with bisphosphonates decreased with increasing severity of renal impairment at both first and at progression/second-line treatment.

In conclusion, the proportion of patients treated with bisphosphonates as part of first- and second-line anti-myeloma treatment increased with the presence of myeloma bone disease and decreased with the presence and severity of renal impairment. Overall, 25% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients had no record of bisphosphonate treatment, potentially indicating an unmet need.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^1178JxpV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

In this international, double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trial (NCT00330759; the '244 study'), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 120 mg subcutaneous denosumab or 4 mg (dose adjusted for renal function) intravenous zoledronic acid every 4 weeks. Eligible patients were adults with biopsy-confirmed advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma with prior radiographic evidence of at least one bone metastasis (or lytic bone lesion from myeloma) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Randomization was stratified by tumor type (non-small-cell lung cancer, limited to 60% of total; multiple myeloma, limited to 10% of total; or other), systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or other), and previous SRE (yes or no). Patients were followed for survival for 2 years after the last dose of the investigational product.

The present post hoc analysis includes all patients in the myeloma subset (n = 180). Descriptive analyses were performed for baseline/on-study variables and adverse events. Kaplan–Meier estimates for overall survival were presented graphically, and HRs with two-sided 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. To account for differences between the groups for early withdrawals due to 'consent withdrawn' and 'lost to follow-up', an additional post hoc analysis was conducted, treating these withdrawals as events. A p-value was calculated using Fisher's exact test for the difference between groups for osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: A consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^113P7SB8]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Modifiable risk factors should be minimized if possible. Patients with one patient-specific risk factor for thromboembolism should receive thromboprophylaxis with aspirin at a dose of 81–325 mg, while those with two patient-specific or one treatment-specific risk factors should be treated either with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or warfarin, (see Table 2). However, there is currently no robust evidence on the optimal duration of thromboprophylaxis, especially in active uncontrolled disease as well as in lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or other drugs known to increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution.

If a patient experiences thromboembolic complications, anti-myeloma treatment may temporarily be discontinued and anticoagulation therapy started using adjusted dose warfarin or LMWH, with appropriate monitoring. The appropriate initial therapy in the outpatient setting is therapeutic doses of LMWH. In hospitalized patients, unfractionated heparin for a minimum of 5 days may be preferred. Treatment with LMWH or coumarin should be continued for several months with lower doses of LMWH. In patients started on intravenous heparin, therapy should be resumed until the patient's partial thromboplastin time (PPT) has increased by 1.5–2.0-fold compared to control for two consecutive days, and then switched to oral warfarin or coumarin. Once the acute thromboembolic event has stabilized, anti-myeloma therapy can be restarted depending on the patient's condition.

### A rational approach to evidence gaps in the management of osteoporosis [^111jx3WD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Major advancements in the treatment of osteoporosis have occurred over the last decade. Therapies, including anti-resorptive drugs such as alendronate and risedronate, have been shown in randomized placebo-controlled trials to increase bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk. Anabolic therapy in the form of parathyroid hormone has been introduced as the first treatment to build bone mass. However, gaps in our knowledge about specific management issues frequently arise among primary care providers. In this paper, three common clinical scenarios are discussed: a postmenopausal woman with only slightly reduced bone mineral density; an osteoporotic woman on anti-resorptive therapy for more than 5 years; and a woman who continues to fracture despite treatment. Evidence gaps in each treatment scenario are presented, and rational approaches to management are suggested.

- **Methods**: For the 2007 update, an Update Committee composed of members from the full panel completed a review and analysis of data published since 2002. Searches of Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library databases were performed.

- **Recommendations**: For multiple myeloma patients who exhibit, on plain radiographs or imaging studies, lytic destruction of bone or spine compression fracture from osteopenia, intravenous pamidronate 90 mg administered over at least 2 hours or zoledronic acid 4 mg delivered over at least 15 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended. Clodronate is an alternative bisphosphonate approved worldwide, except in the United States, for oral or intravenous administration. New dosing guidelines for patients with pre-existing renal impairment were added to the zoledronic acid package insert. Although no similar dosing guidelines are available for pamidronate, the Update Committee recommends that clinicians consider reducing the initial pamidronate dose in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Zoledronic acid has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment and is not recommended in this setting. The Update Committee suggests that bisphosphonate treatment continue for a period of 2 years. At 2 years, physicians should seriously consider discontinuing bisphosphonates in patients with responsive or stable disease.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^111bWuRx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma with respect to bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend administering intravenous pamidronate 90 mg over at least 2 hours or zoledronic acid 4 mg over at least 15 minutes every 3–4 weeks. These treatments are advised for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) having lytic destruction of the bone or a compression fracture of the spine from osteopenia visible on plain radiographs or other imaging studies, such as MRI or CT. As an alternative option, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, may also be administered.

### Pamidronate disodium [^113nqrWx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 392 patients with advanced multiple myeloma were enrolled to receive pamidronate disodium or a placebo in addition to their underlying antimyeloma therapy. The trial aimed to determine the effect of pamidronate disodium on the occurrence of skeletal-related events (SREs). SREs were defined as episodes of pathologic fractures, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression.

Patients received either 90 mg of pamidronate disodium or placebo as a monthly 4-hour intravenous infusion for 9 months. Of the 392 patients, 377 were evaluable for efficacy (196 pamidronate disodium, 181 placebo). The proportion of patients developing any SRE was significantly smaller in the pamidronate disodium group: 24% versus 41% (P < 0.001), and the mean skeletal morbidity rate (#SRE/year) was significantly smaller for pamidronate disodium patients than for placebo patients: mean 1.1 versus 2.1 (p < 0.02).

The times to the first SRE occurrence, pathologic fracture, and radiation to bone were significantly longer in the pamidronate disodium group (P = 0.001, .006, and .046, respectively). Moreover, fewer pamidronate disodium patients suffered any pathologic fracture (17% vs 30%, P = 0.004) or needed radiation to bone (14% vs 22%, P = 0.049).

### Risk factors in multiple myeloma: Is it time for a revision [^111qKoQx]. Blood (2021). High credibility.

Although therapeutic strategies have been adapted to age and comorbidities for a long time, almost all multiple myeloma (MM) patients currently receive similar treatment, regardless of their disease risk category. However, high-risk MM patients still constitute an unmet medical need and should benefit from the most efficient drug combinations. Herein, we review and discuss how to optimally define risk and why a revision of the definition is urgently needed.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma-related bone disease: Recommendations from the Bone Working Group of the International Myeloma Working Group [^117CTvdK]. The Lancet Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

In this policy review, the Bone Working Group of the International Myeloma Working Group updates its clinical practice recommendations for the management of multiple myeloma-related bone disease. After assessing the available literature and grading recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method, experts from the working group recommend zoledronic acid as the preferred bone-targeted agent for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, with or without multiple myeloma-related bone disease.

Once patients achieve a very good partial response or better after receiving monthly zoledronic acid for at least 12 months, the treating physician can consider decreasing the frequency of or discontinuing zoledronic acid treatment. Denosumab can also be considered for the treatment of multiple myeloma-related bone disease, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Denosumab might prolong progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have multiple myeloma-related bone disease and who are eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. However, denosumab discontinuation is challenging due to the rebound effect.

- **Cement augmentation**: Found to be effective for painful vertebral compression fractures.
- **Radiotherapy**: Recommended for uncontrolled pain, impeding or symptomatic spinal cord compression, or pathological fractures.
- **Surgery**: Should be used for the prevention and restoration of long-bone pathological fractures.

### Denosumab compared with zoledronic acid on PFS in multiple myeloma: Exploratory results of an international phase 3 study [^112DCxZb]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

An exploratory end point from a recent trial in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma showed that median progression-free survival (PFS) was increased by 10.7 months with denosumab compared to zoledronic acid. We performed additional analyses to identify factors that may have contributed to the favorable PFS with denosumab.

- **Ad hoc analyses**: These were performed for patients intending to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT; ASCT intent), not intending to undergo ASCT (ASCT no intent), and intent-to-treat according to age and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (> 60 mL/min). Of 1,718 patients, 930 (54.1%) were in the ASCT-intent subgroup, and 788 (45.9%) were in the ASCT-no-intent subgroup.
	- **In the ASCT-intent subgroup**: Frontline triplet (median PFS, not estimable vs. 35.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.65 [0.47–0.90]; descriptive P = 0.009) or bortezomib-only (median PFS, not estimable vs. not estimable; HR [95% CI], 0.61 [0.39–0.95]; descriptive P = 0.029) induction regimens demonstrated the strongest PFS benefit favoring denosumab compared to zoledronic acid.
	- **In the ASCT-no-intent subgroup**: No benefit with denosumab compared to zoledronic acid was observed.

PFS favored denosumab over zoledronic acid in patients with CrCl > 60 mL/min and in patients < 70 years old, but no difference was observed in patients with CrCl ≤ 60 mL/min or patients ≥ 70 years old. The PFS difference observed with denosumab is one of the notable benefits reported in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and was most pronounced in patients intending to undergo ASCT.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^116Fxt63]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The patient incidence of death as of the primary analysis cutoff date for the multiple myeloma subset was 8 (9%) for zoledronic acid and 19 (22%) for denosumab (P = 0.02). The overall survival curve for the multiple myeloma patients in this study is shown in Figure 1a. Between months 3 and 15, there were no deaths in the zoledronic acid group, as indicated by the plateau in the survival curve. During this period, withdrawals from the study due to consent withdrawn or being lost to follow-up were higher in the zoledronic acid group, with 14% (13 patients) for zoledronic acid and 7% (6 patients) for denosumab, although the difference was not statistically significant. Since there was no survival follow-up for patients who withdrew for these reasons, they have the potential to confound the survival results, particularly as the overall number of deaths was very small.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^1152YK7m]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced cancer and bone metastases frequently experience skeletal-related events (SREs), defined as spinal cord compression, pathologic fracture, and surgery or radiation to bone (hypercalcemia may also be included as an SRE, though this was not the case in the present work). Bone-targeted agents, including bisphosphonates and the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand) inhibitor, denosumab, are used to prevent SREs in patients with bone metastases. In three phase 3 trials conducted in patients with bone metastases, denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid for the primary endpoint of time to first on-study SRE in patients with prostate cancer (n = 1904) and breast cancer (n = 2046), and noninferior in patients with solid tumors (other than prostate or breast) or multiple myeloma (n = 1776; hazard ratio (HR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71–0.98; P = 0.0007).

No differences in overall survival between treatment groups were observed in any of the phase 3 studies, or in a prespecified integrated analysis. However, in an ad hoc subset analysis, overall survival favored denosumab (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67–0.95; P = 0.01) in patients with lung cancer (n = 811) and favored zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma (n = 180; HR 2.26; 95% CI 1.13–4.50; P = 0.014). An evaluation of the lung cancer data has been reported separately.

Multiple myeloma patients were included in this trial based on preclinical evidence for a role for RANKL inhibition in decreasing osteolytic bone lesions and tumor burden in murine myeloma models.

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^114QJzJu]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

- **Research in context**: In addition to the experience obtained from previous MRC myeloma trials of clodronic acid, a review of the reports of clinical trials of a wide variety of combination chemotherapy regimens and bisphosphonates was undertaken and used to develop the 2×2 factorial trial design for the Myeloma IX trial. At the time that the Myeloma IX trial was initiated, most patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma in the UK were treated long-term with bisphosphonates; however, there was no consensus for the optimum timing and duration of treatment with bisphosphonates, or the efficacy for prevention of skeletal-related events of all the available bisphosphonates and their potential to affect disease outcomes and survival variables in patients with multiple myeloma. In the Myeloma IX trial, we assessed the possible enhanced effects on disease-related bone changes and survival of a third-generation bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in comparison with a standard older-generation oral agent (clodronic acid).

- **Interpretation**: The results of the Myeloma IX trial showed significant benefits with zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on progression-free survival, overall survival, and several variables for skeletal-related events, and, to our knowledge, for the first time established the superiority of one bisphosphonate over another in patients with multiple myeloma. Moreover, exploratory analyses have shown significant benefits with treatment before the onset of bone lesions and also with long-term treatment (e.g. during maintenance therapy).

### Use of bisphosphonates in elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^113bgx8D]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates reduce skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and, in some studies, improve survival. Since 2011, bisphosphonate use has been recommended by NCCN for all patients with newly diagnosed MM receiving antineoplastic therapy, independent of the presence of bone disease. This study investigated their use after these guidelines were established.

- **Methods**: We identified patients aged ≥ 65 years in the SEER-Medicare database with newly diagnosed MM between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, who received antineoplastic therapy, had ≥ 6 months of follow-up, and did not receive prior bisphosphonates. The presence of SREs at diagnosis was identified, including pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery to bone. The use of bisphosphonates was defined as having ≥ 1 claim for an intravenous or oral bisphosphonate within 6 months after the start of antineoplastic therapy. We used multivariable modeling to compare users with nonusers, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. We compared overall survival between users and nonusers using proportional hazards analysis.

- **Results**: Of 1,309 patients identified, 720 (55%) used a bisphosphonate. Factors associated with use included SRE at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.60; 95% CI, 1.98–3.40), hypercalcemia (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.41), and use of proteasome inhibitor + immunomodulatory imide therapy (AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21–2.39). Chronic kidney disease (AOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35–0.66) was associated with decreased use. Bisphosphonate use was associated with improved outcomes; however, the data was incomplete.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^115MR5Lz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide recommendations on the role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma. An update panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review by searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines, and observational studies. Thirty-five relevant studies were identified, supporting the updated evidence and recommendations.

For patients with active symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires systemic therapy, with or without evidence of lytic bone destruction or compression fracture of the spine from osteopenia on plain radiographs or other imaging studies, intravenous administration of pamidronate 90 mg over at least 2 hours or zoledronic acid 4 mg over at least 15 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended. Denosumab has been shown to be noninferior to zoledronic acid for preventing skeletal-related events and provides an alternative. Fewer adverse events related to renal toxicity have been noted with denosumab compared to zoledronic acid and may be preferred in this setting.

The update panel recommends that clinicians consider reducing the initial pamidronate dose in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Zoledronic acid has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment and is not recommended in this setting. The update panel suggests that bone-modifying treatment continue for up to 2 years. Less frequent dosing has been evaluated and should be considered in patients with responsive or stable disease.

### An open-label, phase 2 trial of denosumab in the treatment of relapsed or plateau-phase multiple myeloma [^11238srx]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

RANKL is a key mediator of osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival. Preclinical data suggest that aberrant production and activation of osteoclasts may influence the proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow. Reports have also shown that inhibiting RANKL may have a direct effect on RANK-expressing myeloma cells and a therapeutic role in treating the disease. In mouse myeloma models, inhibition of RANKL led to reduced serum paraprotein levels and tumor burden.

Based on this hypothesis, this proof-of-concept, single-arm study investigated whether RANKL inhibition with denosumab could reduce serum M-protein levels in relapsed or plateau-phase myeloma subjects. All subjects received denosumab monthly, with loading doses on days 8 and 15 of month one, until disease progression or subject discontinuation. Results of this ongoing study demonstrated that no subjects in either cohort met the protocol-defined objective response criteria of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). However, denosumab effectively inhibited the RANKL pathway regardless of previous exposure to bisphosphonates, as evidenced by suppressed levels of the bone turnover marker, serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (sCTx).

Eleven (21%) subjects who relapsed within 3 months before study entry maintained stable disease for up to 16.5 months. Nineteen (46%) subjects with plateau-phase myeloma maintained stable disease for up to 18.3 months. The adverse event (AE) profile for denosumab and its dosing schedule in these populations was consistent with that for advanced therapies.

### Multiple myeloma: Diagnosis and treatment [^112huLv9]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, the most common bone malignancy, is occurring with increasing frequency in older persons. Typical symptoms include bone pain, malaise, anemia, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia. Incidental discovery on comprehensive laboratory panels is common. The disease is diagnosed with serum or urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation and bone marrow aspirate analysis.

Skeletal radiographs are important in staging multiple myeloma and revealing lytic lesions, vertebral compression fractures, and osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography or computed tomography are emerging as useful tools in the evaluation of patients with myeloma; magnetic resonance imaging is preferred for evaluating acute spinal compression. Nuclear bone scans and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry have no role in the diagnosis and staging of myeloma.

The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies includes monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, smoldering (asymptomatic) and symptomatic multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and rare plasma cell leukemia and heavy chain diseases. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or smoldering multiple myeloma should be followed closely, but not treated.

Symptomatic multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, if possible. Melphalan, prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have been used successfully.

### Denosumab versus zoledronic acid in bone disease treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: an international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study [^1135LD8i]. The Lancet Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is characterized by monoclonal paraprotein production and osteolytic lesions, commonly leading to skeletal-related events such as spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, or surgeries or radiotherapy to affected bone. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, reduces skeletal-related events associated with bone lesions or metastases in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

- **Methods**: In this international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled, phase 3 study, patients from 259 centers across 29 countries, aged 18 years or older with symptomatic newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had at least one documented lytic bone lesion, were randomly assigned (1:1; centrally, by interactive voice response system using a fixed stratified permuted block randomization list with a block size of four) to subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg plus intravenous placebo every 4 weeks or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg plus subcutaneous placebo every 4 weeks. Both groups also received investigators' choice of first-line antimyeloma therapy. Stratification was based on intent to undergo autologous transplantation, antimyeloma therapy, International Staging System stage, previous skeletal-related events, and region. The clinical study team and patients were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the non-inferiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid with respect to…

### Sotatercept in patients with osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma [^111Z7fxN]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the third most common haematological malignancy worldwide, with an estimated 114,251 new cases diagnosed and 80,015 deaths in 2012. Although new treatments based on immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors have prolonged life expectancy, the prognosis is still typically a sequence of ongoing relapses. MM is characterized by the development of bone disease associated with impaired bone remodelling. Skeletal abnormalities and bone pain are among the most common clinical symptoms and significantly impact patient quality of life (QoL).

Standard treatment for patients with bone disease includes adjunctive therapy with bisphosphonates. However, bisphosphonates are associated with common, minor, transient side-effects and occasionally with more serious longer-term sequelae. Guidelines suggest discontinuing bisphosphonates after two years' use in patients with stable or responsive disease, and then reinstituting treatment with the occurrence of new-onset skeletal-related events (SREs). A clear need thus exists for the development of new adjuvant therapy to prevent bone loss in patients, as a significant number of patients also experience SREs despite bisphosphonate therapy. In the recent UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Myeloma IX trial, 27–35% of patients receiving bisphosphonates experienced SREs during therapy.

### Fractures and survival in multiple myeloma: Results from a population-based study [^114UU87P]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

The strengths of our study include the large population-based study design, encompassing almost all patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) in Sweden over more than 20 years. Using these real-world data, all MM patients are included, and the results therefore reflect the actual patient population. Because of the unique identification numbers assigned to every individual in Sweden, we have extensive and accurate follow-up for the majority of this large group of patients. Furthermore, the high number of MM patients and fractures yields the study high statistical power to analyze the effect of different subgroups of fractures.

The limitations of our study include the fact that we do not have information on clinical stage, other prognostic factors, or on what treatment the MM patients received. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from our data whether fracture is an independent risk factor for death in MM. Because the fractures occurred after the MM diagnosis, there is a risk of immortal time bias in our survival analysis. To address this, we used both the method of time-dependent covariates and landmark analysis to accurately analyze the difference in survival between the fractured and unfractured groups. In addition, we do not have access to radiographic images or individual patient records; therefore, fractures, especially asymptomatic ones, might be relatively under-reported. In our study, a smaller proportion of patients were diagnosed with a fracture after MM diagnosis than had been previously reported. The difference between these results might be explained by the study design and factors not accounted for in our analysis.

### Controversies in the use of new bone-modifying therapies in multiple myeloma [^115zREuq]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Bone-modifying therapies are essential in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid is preferred over other bisphosphonates due to its superiority in reducing the incidence of skeletal-related events and improving survival. The anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ ligand (RANKL)-targeted agent, denosumab, has shown its non-inferiority compared to bisphosphonates in preventing skeletal-related events among newly diagnosed patients with myeloma bone disease. Denosumab may confer a survival benefit in patients eligible for autologous transplantation and may present a safer profile for patients with renal impairment.

Discontinuation of bone-directed therapies can be considered for patients with deep responses and after an adequate time period on treatment; however, a rebound effect may become evident, especially in the case of denosumab. Three-monthly infusions of zoledronic acid or at-home denosumab administration should be considered during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Measures to prevent hypocalcaemia, renal toxicity, and osteonecrosis of the jaw are important for all bone-modifying agents.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^115GJCzh]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

In this post hoc analysis of a phase 3 trial of denosumab vs. zoledronic acid for the delay or prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases, we examined possible reasons for the favorable survival in the subset of patients with multiple myeloma in the zoledronic acid group. As multiple myeloma patients represented only 10% of the sample and this trial was designed to examine the endpoint of SREs, not survival, the study design had not included randomization stratification for myeloma-specific prognostic factors.

We found imbalances between the study arms, including a higher proportion of patients in the zoledronic acid arm with positive prognostic characteristics such as ECOG score 0 and ISS stage 1, whereas the denosumab arm contained a higher proportion of patients with poor renal function, a well-established negative prognostic factor. Furthermore, effective myeloma treatments, including transplantation and novel myeloma therapies such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, were more commonly used in the zoledronic acid group. As the use of these drugs has been shown to double overall survival in multiple myeloma, imbalances between the study arms could have affected the survival results.

These individual differences were not statistically significant (except for the distribution of creatinine clearance categories) likely because of the small sample size; however, a covariate analysis adjusting for these factors together substantially reduced the HR for overall survival, with a 95% CI that crossed unity.

### Bone health in cancer: Perspective on the use of osteoanabolic agents [^1111KCHM]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The standard of care for the treatment of myeloma bone disease is antiresorptive therapy, which includes bisphosphonates or Dmab. Intravenous bisphosphonates reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and skeletal-related events (SREs) by 26% compared with placebo in patients with multiple myeloma. The drug of choice is determined based on side effects, cost, and route of administration. Antiresorptive agents are effective in reducing bone resorption and ultimately also reduce bone formation. Cancer patients who continue to experience SREs despite treatment with antiresorptive agents present a significant clinical challenge.

Diamond and colleagues conducted a 12-month open-label pilot study in 12 myeloma patients who received subcutaneous teriparatide daily (20 mcg) in combination with anti-myeloma therapy and previous intravenous bisphosphonates. The subjects had severe osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The serum bone formation marker, propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), increased by 4.8-fold, and lumbar spine quantitative tomography bone mineral density increased by 43.8%. No new fractures or lytic lesions were observed, suggesting favorable anabolic effects of teriparatide in patients with myeloma and severe osteoporosis.

Furthermore, sclerostin antibody treatment in preclinical models protects bone from multiple myeloma-induced bone destruction, maintains bone mass, and lowers the number of osteolytic lesions. These encouraging preclinical results have prompted an ongoing pilot clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center using romosozumab in patients with myeloma.

### The role of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma: mechanisms, side effects, and the future [^116DXkEU]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Zoledronic acid and pamidronate are two potent anticatabolic nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (BPs) used extensively in diseases with high bone turnover such as multiple myeloma (MM). In this review, we focus on their biology, future use in MM, and highlight some of the most common and emerging side effects. Although the primary target cells for BPs are osteoclasts, new insights suggest other cell types of the bone microenvironment as possible targets, including osteoblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and cancer cells.

- **Guidelines for BP use in MM**: We address side effects such as renal toxicity, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and low-energy fractures. Finally, we approach the future of BP use in MM in the context of other bone-targeted agents. We evaluate ongoing clinical trials addressing alternate dosing and schedules of BP administration in MM patients.

Regarding medical management of multiple myeloma, particularly in the context of relapsed/refractory disease, the NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend several systemic therapy options for the management of relapsed/refractory disease after 1–3 prior therapies in certain circumstances:

- **Bortezomib and dexamethasone**: A commonly suggested combination.

- **Bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin, and dexamethasone**: Another effective regimen.

- **Lenalidomide and dexamethasone**: Frequently utilized in specific cases.

- **Carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone**: Suitable for some patients.

- **Carfilzomib weekly and dexamethasone**: Offers a weekly administration schedule.

- **Selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone**: An option for those with progressive disease.

- **Selinexor, daratumumab, and dexamethasone**: Provides an additional alternative.

- **Venetoclax and dexamethasone with or without daratumumab or proteasome inhibitor**: To be used only for patients with 11;14 translocation.

- **Pomalidomide and dexamethasone**: Recommended after specific prior therapies.

- **Selinexor, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone**: For those with disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.

- **Dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin or dexamethasone, thalidomide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide with or without bortezomib**: For the treatment of aggressive multiple myeloma.

- **Daratumumab**: Administered after at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD or in cases where the patient is double-refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD.

### Evaluating results from the multiple myeloma patient subset treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid in a randomized phase 3 trial [^115RFASD]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

In a phase 3 trial of denosumab vs. zoledronic acid in patients (n = 1776) with bone metastases and solid tumors or multiple myeloma, denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid for the primary endpoint of prevention of skeletal-related events. There was no difference in overall survival between the two groups; however, an ad hoc overall survival analysis in the multiple myeloma subset of patients (n = 180) favored zoledronic acid (hazard ratio (HR) 2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–4.50; P = 0.014).

In the present analysis, we found imbalances between the groups with respect to baseline risk characteristics. HRs with two-sided 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox model. After adjustment in a covariate analysis, the CI crossed unity (HR 1.86; 95% CI 0.90–3.84; P = 0.0954). Furthermore, we found a higher rate of early withdrawals due to loss to follow-up and withdrawal of consent in the zoledronic acid group; after accounting for these, the HR was 1.31 (95% CI 0.80–2.15; P = 0.278). In conclusion, the survival results in multiple myeloma patients in this trial were confounded and will eventually be resolved by an ongoing phase 3 trial.

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^113QkN8p]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

In patients with multiple myeloma, renal adverse events and osteonecrosis of the jaw are causes for concern and should be monitored and managed appropriately. In the Myeloma IX trial, adverse events were consistent with the established tolerability profiles of zoledronic acid and clodronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma. Overall, renal adverse events occurred at a similar rate for both bisphosphonates; although clodronic acid is an oral bisphosphonate and not typically associated with renal toxicity.

Monitoring the concentrations of creatinine in the serum was less frequent for the clodronic acid group compared to the zoledronic acid group (i.e. every 3 months vs. monthly, respectively), suggesting any observation bias would favor clodronic acid. This bias suggests that the renal adverse events reported in the Myeloma IX trial were most likely a result of the disease, antimyeloma treatments, non-myeloma-related drugs, or other comorbidities, rather than toxicity associated with bisphosphonates, validating the renal safety protocols for zoledronic acid.

Although osteonecrosis of the jaw arose at a higher rate in patients in the zoledronic acid group, most events were low grade (as defined by Weitzman and colleagues) and manageable. Recommendations for the prevention and management of osteonecrosis of the jaw were implemented in Myeloma IX from June 2006 onwards, but further reductions in the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw might be possible with prevention strategies that were reported subsequently. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw could be further reduced with these updated strategies.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: A consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^112Mo7m6]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

During the last few years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, which have significantly improved treatment outcomes. All of these novel substances differ, at least in part, in their mode of action compared to similar drugs of the same class or are representatives of new drug classes. As such, they present with very specific side effect profiles. In this review, we summarize these adverse events, provide information on their prevention, and give practical guidance for monitoring patients and managing adverse events.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: a consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^111gDPPo]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

In multiple myeloma, it is not always possible to discriminate whether complications occur as a consequence of drug treatment, of the disease itself, or due to a combination of both. Furthermore, a combination of drugs is usually administered. Adverse events (AEs) therefore need to be considered in the context of this complex situation. Nevertheless, it is critical to carefully monitor patients regarding possible side effects to avoid early complications that may compromise therapeutic outcome. Hematological toxicities are commonly observed with most novel agents, but as their prevention and management is quite similar regardless of the drugs used, we will not discuss this in detail here.

- **Thromboembolic complications**: Treatment-, patient-, and myeloma-specific risk factors for thromboembolic complications, which are quite frequent in multiple myeloma, are shown in the risk assessment model (adapted from Palumbo 2008). Thromboembolic events occur more frequently during the initial phase of treatment and less commonly during episodes of well-controlled disease, in remission, or at relapse. Immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) alone, and particularly in combination with dexamethasone and other drugs such as carfilzomib, erythropoietin, or adriamycin, are associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

### Lifestyle considerations in multiple myeloma [^113R4mFx]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Lytic lesions develop in approximately 80% of MM patients, raising concerns for clinicians and patients regarding incorporating and encouraging exercise as a critical therapy during an MM diagnosis. Skeletal injuries, the ongoing risk of pathological fractures, chronic bone pain, and sarcopenia make this patient population particularly challenging candidates for exercise interventions. Fear of fractures is a widespread concern and causes many MM patients to give up sports and other leisure activities. However, research, although limited for MM, points to the many potential physiological and psychological benefits of safely incorporating exercise with cancer care, such as improved quality of life (QOL), blood cell counts, body composition, strength, mood, and fatigue.

Educating and training clinicians to engage in conversations about exercise will encourage MM patients to feel more comfortable and confident participating in physical activity. Jones et al. (n = 311) found that most cancer patients prefer that their oncologist initiate discussions about exercise. Despite this, only 28.4% of the study participants reported that their oncologist initiated a conversation about exercise during a treatment consultation, and almost 60% reported that exercise was not discussed at all. Oncologist-initiated conversations not only resulted in a stronger belief in exercise (p < 0.001) among the cancer patients but also in longer (p < 0.07) and more frequent (p < 0.001) physical activity participation. Oncologists may also need guidance in terms of appropriate exercises.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely [^111p1UFF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Mitigating the risk of discontinuing denosumab

Regardless of the underlying reason for denosumab discontinuation, whether it is a clinical decision or a patient factor, it is clear that many patients will ultimately discontinue therapy. It is important that evidence-based guidance is developed in order to minimize the risk of harm when discontinuing denosumab. An evidence gap exists regarding subsequent management; at the time of writing, the potential strategies to reduce the rebound effect of stopping denosumab have not been conclusively adjudicated. Suggested therapies include oral or intravenous bisphosphonates before or after denosumab, with or without reference to bone turnover markers, or SERM after denosumab.

### International myeloma working group recommendations for the treatment of multiple myeloma-related bone disease [^116nTVpT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the International Myeloma Working Group was to develop practice recommendations for the management of multiple myeloma (MM)-related bone disease.

- **Methodology**: An interdisciplinary panel of clinical experts on MM and myeloma bone disease developed recommendations based on published data through August 2012. Expert consensus was used to propose additional recommendations in situations where there were insufficient published data. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendations were assigned and approved by panel members.

- **Recommendations**: Bisphosphonates (BPs) should be considered in all patients with MM receiving first-line antimyeloma therapy, regardless of the presence of osteolytic bone lesions on conventional radiography. However, it is unknown if BPs offer any advantage in patients with no bone disease assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid (ZOL) or pamidronate (PAM) is recommended for preventing skeletal-related events in patients with MM. ZOL is preferred over oral clodronate in newly diagnosed patients with MM because of its potential antimyeloma effects and survival benefits. BPs should be administered every 3 to 4 weeks IV during initial therapy. ZOL or PAM should be continued in patients with active disease and should be resumed after disease relapse if discontinued in patients achieving complete or very good partial response. BPs are well tolerated, but preventive strategies must be instituted to avoid renal toxicity or osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### Zoledronic acid [^1115b4gH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Zoledronic acid injection is a bisphosphonate indicated for several treatment purposes:

- **Indications and usage**: It is used for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy. This includes patients with multiple myeloma and those with documented bone metastases from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Prostate cancer should have shown progression after treatment with at least one hormonal therapy.

- **Limitations of use**: The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid injection have not been established for use in hyperparathyroidism or non-tumor-related hypercalcemia.

- **Hypercalcemia of malignancy**: Zoledronic acid injection is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy, which is defined as an albumin-corrected calcium (cCa) level of greater than or equal to 12 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L]. This is calculated using the formula: cCa in mg/dL = Ca in mg/dL + 0.8 (4.0 g/dL - patient albumin [g/dL]).

- **Multiple myeloma and bone metastases of solid tumors**: The injection is indicated for patients with multiple myeloma and those with documented bone metastases from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Prostate cancer should have progressed after at least one hormonal therapy.

- **Limitation of use**: The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid injection in treating hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or other non-tumor-related conditions have not been established.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^111mA57a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, especially in relation to bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend administering IV pamidronate or zoledronic acid to patients experiencing pain due to osteolytic disease. These agents should also be used as adjunctive treatment in patients undergoing radiotherapy, receiving analgesics, or undergoing surgical interventions to stabilize fractures or impending fractures. Consider offering denosumab as an additional option.

### Therapy insight: The risks and benefits of bisphosphonates for the treatment of tumor-induced bone disease [^114Lc6v3]. Nature Clinical Practice. Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are a valuable class of drugs with potent anti-resorptive actions that make them ideal for skeletal protection in osteoporosis, cancer bone metastasis, multiple myeloma, and Paget's disease of bone. It has become apparent, however, that these drugs also have the potential to cause a number of adverse effects. While these do not limit bisphosphonate use, the incidence of these adverse events can be minimized if appropriate care is taken with their administration, and by maintaining appropriate surveillance and patient care.

We review the range of adverse reactions to bisphosphonate therapy with a particular emphasis on the recently identified association between long-term bisphosphonate treatment and osteonecrosis of the jaw. This is a potentially serious side effect seen mostly in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer bone metastases who receive intravenous bisphosphonate treatment. While the etiology is uncertain, a strong association with dental pathology and interventions highlights the need for close attention to dental health in this patient group.

### Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma [^116KRHbY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of a clone of plasma cells that can lead to bone destruction. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity, providing a pharmacological basis for their use in multiple myeloma. However, the exact clinical role of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma remains unclear.

- **Objectives**:
	- **Primary**: To determine whether adding bisphosphonates to standard therapy in multiple myeloma decreases skeletal-related morbidity (pathological fractures), skeletal-related mortality, and overall mortality.
	- **Secondary**: To assess the effects of bisphosphonates on pain, quality of life, and incidence of hypercalcemia.

- **Search strategy**:
	- We searched MEDLINE (1966 - June 2001), LILACS (1982 - June 2001), EMBASE (1974 - December 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (all years, latest Issue 03/2001) to identify all randomized trials in multiple myeloma. All references were accessed to identify trials related to the use of bisphosphonates in myeloma, with relevant references in each article being scanned. Additionally, we conducted a handsearch of relevant meeting proceedings from 1993 to 2000, and contacted manufacturers of bisphosphonates and researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- Randomized trials with a parallel design on the use of bisphosphonate in myeloma compared with placebo or no treatment as a control group.

- **Data collection and analysis**:
	- Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and abstracted data.

### Advances in imaging and the management of myeloma bone disease [^1112ztiv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Osteolytic disease is a major complication of multiple myeloma that may lead to devastating skeletal-related events (SREs). Conventional radiography remains the gold standard for evaluating bone disease in patients with myeloma. However, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended in patients with normal conventional radiography and should be performed as part of staging in all patients with a solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Urgent MRI is also the diagnostic procedure of choice to assess suspected cord compression, whereas computed tomography can guide tissue biopsy. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography can provide complementary information to MRI, but its use in multiple myeloma must be better defined by further studies. The incorporation of abnormal MRI findings into the definition of symptomatic myeloma also needs to be clarified.

Bisphosphonates remain the cornerstone for the management of myeloma bone disease. Intravenous pamidronate and zoledronic acid are equally effective in reducing SREs, whereas zoledronic acid seems to offer survival benefits in symptomatic patients. Caution is needed to avoid adverse events, such as renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Novel antiresorptive agents, such as denosumab, have yielded encouraging results, but further studies are needed before their approval for managing myeloma bone disease. Combination approaches with novel antimyeloma agents, such as bortezomib, which has anabolic effects on bone, with bisphosphonates or with drugs that enhance osteoblast function, such as antidickkopf-1, are promising strategies.

### Myeloma bone disease: from biology findings to treatment approaches [^112BMAFq]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

Bone disease is a cardinal complication of multiple myeloma that affects quality of life and survival. Osteocytes have emerged as key players in the development of myeloma-related bone disease. Along with other factors, they participate in increased osteoclast activity, decreased osteoblast function, and an immunosuppressed marrow microenvironment, which deregulate bone turnover and result in bone loss and skeletal-related events. Denosumab is a novel alternative to bisphosphonates against myeloma bone disease. Special considerations in this constantly evolving field are thoroughly discussed.
