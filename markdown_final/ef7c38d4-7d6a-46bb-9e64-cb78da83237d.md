## Question

Acute renal failure workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step workup for acute kidney injury (AKI), preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging using KDIGO criteria. Then, I should verify the baseline creatinine and the pitfalls of urine output thresholds. Next, I will review the focused history and examination to frame pre-renal, intrinsic, and post-renal causes. After that, I need to check the core laboratory and urine studies, including urinalysis and sediment. Then, I will consider imaging, especially ultrasound, and when to escalate to CT/MRI. I should also evaluate when to pursue serologic testing and biopsy. I will now examine the role and limitations of novel biomarkers. Finally, I need to ensure management principles, nephrology consultation triggers, and follow-up plans are aligned with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage AKI using KDIGO criteria, because misclassification at the outset derails downstream decisions; AKI is present with an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, or urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h or less for 6 hours, and staging is based on the magnitude of creatinine rise or urine output decline, with stage 3 including a creatinine greater than 4.0 mg/dL or initiation of renal replacement therapy [^112LuMYS] [^114piCBk].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline creatinine, because using an imputed value can misclassify severity; ERBP recommends using the first documented creatinine value of the current episode as baseline rather than back-calculating from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min, and I should avoid using eGFR formulas in AKI since they assume steady state, which is violated in acute disease, especially in fluid-overloaded or sarcopenic patients where dilution or muscle mass alters creatinine kinetics [^112Xhksn] [^1112ZGjH] [^117QPeGE].

> Hold on, I should verify urine output interpretation; I initially thought to apply the 0.5 mL/kg/h threshold using actual body weight, but ERBP advises using ideal body weight to avoid overdiagnosing oliguria in obesity, and I need to remember that ADH-driven antidiuresis can make urine output appear "low" despite preserved function, so I must correlate with clinical context and consider shift-based calculations when catheters are not in place [^1115o1zG] [^1112ZGjH].

> Next, I should review the focused history and physical to triage pre-renal, intrinsic, and post-renal causes; I need to check for hypotension, heart failure, liver disease, sepsis, recent surgery, contrast or nephrotoxin exposure, and obstructive symptoms, while on exam I should assess volume status, look for rashes suggesting vasculitis or interstitial nephritis, and palpate for bladder distension, because these clues shape the differential and prioritize testing and interventions [^113bGqC5] [^117E4SRg].

> I will now examine the core laboratory workup; I should double-check serum creatinine and BUN trends, obtain electrolytes and acid–base status, CBC for anemia or infection, and a urinalysis with dipstick for blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrites, and glucose, documenting results promptly, since hematuria and proteinuria without infection or trauma raise concern for glomerular disease and mandate further evaluation [^111uSGTg] [^112PEUde].

> Let me consider urine studies next; I should confirm urine specific gravity and osmolality to assess concentrating ability, calculate the fractional excretion of sodium when oliguria is present, and inspect the sediment, because muddy brown granular casts suggest ATN, RBC casts suggest glomerulonephritis, and WBC casts suggest interstitial nephritis, while acknowledging that in sepsis the predictive value of urine chemistries is limited and must be interpreted cautiously [^116w2gWm] [^117E4SRg].

> I need to ensure imaging is not delayed; renal ultrasound is the first-line modality to assess kidney size and echogenicity and to exclude obstruction, and UKKA recommends obtaining it within 24 hours for most AKI and within 6 hours if obstruction is suspected, with CT or MRI reserved for equivocal cases or when detailed anatomy is needed, keeping contrast risk in mind and using non-contrast protocols when possible [^117G2kG1] [^113cjUrc] [^116sgdAt].

> But wait, what if the ultrasound shows small, echogenic kidneys; that would suggest CKD rather than pure AKI, so I should reconsider whether this is acute-on-chronic disease and adjust expectations for recovery and thresholds for intervention accordingly, while still pursuing reversible precipitants of the acute decline [^111bUB13].

> Next, I should review when to pursue serologic testing and biopsy; if there is hematuria and proteinuria without an obvious cause, I should suspect rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and order ANCA, anti-GBM, ANA, complements, and consider urgent nephrology consultation for biopsy, recognizing that in the critically ill, false positives are more common and results must be interpreted in clinical context [^112PEUde] [^116TUvSq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about biomarkers; I should confirm that while NGAL, KIM-1, and others can detect injury earlier than creatinine, ADQI 2020 concludes there is insufficient evidence for routine biomarker use to refine AKI staging, though combining damage and functional biomarkers with clinical data may help risk-stratify and optimize processes of care in select settings [^1128wWJv] [^111kbxsv] [^112FhYb3].

> I will now examine immediate management principles; I should stop nephrotoxins, optimize volume status and perfusion pressure, avoid hyperglycemia, and reassess drug dosing as kidney function changes, while using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for resuscitation and avoiding starch-containing solutions, and if obstruction is present, I must relieve it promptly to prevent irreversible injury [^111iZ4kE] [^1161eqHR] [^117GEmGx].

> Let me verify when to involve nephrology; I should consult early for stage 3 AKI, AKI without a clear cause, preexisting advanced CKD, suspected glomerular disease, or when considering renal replacement therapy, because timely input can change outcomes and guide biopsy or specialized interventions [^111NmB7g] [^115jUdPN].

> I should confirm follow-up plans; KDIGO recommends reassessing kidney function about 3 months after an AKI episode to evaluate for resolution or new or worsening CKD, and given the elevated long-term risks after AKI, structured follow-up is essential even when creatinine has normalized [^112SzyRY] [^116gQkzx].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnostic sequence remains disciplined: confirm AKI with KDIGO using the episode baseline, triage the cause with history and exam, obtain core labs and urinalysis with sediment, image early for obstruction, escalate to serologies and biopsy when indicated, integrate biomarkers judiciously, and apply guideline-based management and follow-up, adjusting for context and comorbidities at each step [^112LuMYS] [^113bGqC5] [^117G2kG1] [^1128wWJv].

---

The acute renal failure (ARF) workup centers on **prompt recognition** with KDIGO criteria (serum creatinine rise ≥ 0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours or ≥ 1.5× baseline within 7 days, or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours) [^112LuMYS] and **early detection** using serial creatinine and urine output monitoring [^1169pgFu]. The core workup includes a focused history, exam, urinalysis with microscopy, electrolytes, and renal ultrasound within 24 hours to exclude obstruction [^117G2kG1] [^113cjUrc]. Use **FENa/FEurea** and urine sediment to distinguish prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes, and reserve biopsy for unexplained intrinsic renal disease. Early nephrology input is essential for complex or severe cases, and management is supportive: treat the cause, stop nephrotoxins, optimize volume/perfusion, and start RRT for life-threatening indications [^111iZ4kE] [^111NmB7g].

---

## Clinical definition and staging

ARF is defined and staged by the **KDIGO criteria**, which standardize diagnosis and severity [^114piCBk]:

| **Stage** | **Serum creatinine criteria** | **Urine output criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | ≥ 0.3 mg/dL increase within 48 hours or 1.5–1.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours |
| Stage 2 | 2.0–2.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 12 hours |
| Stage 3 | ≥ 3.0× baseline within 7 days or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL with ≥ 0.5 mg/dL increase, or initiation of RRT | ≤ 0.3 mL/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours |

---

## Initial clinical assessment

### History

The history should document the **temporal profile** of onset and progression, and review risk factors — including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, and malignancy — as well as exposures such as nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aminoglycosides, contrast), recent surgery, infection, or trauma. Also assess for prerenal features (hypovolemia, hypotension, heart failure, liver disease), intrinsic causes (nephrotoxic drugs, infection, autoimmune disease, rhabdomyolysis), and postrenal elements (obstructive symptoms, BPH, malignancy, stones) [^113bGqC5].

---

### Physical examination

The physical examination should assess **volume status** (jugular venous pressure, edema, lung crackles, dry mucosa), hemodynamics (blood pressure, heart rate), and signs of systemic disease (rash, joint swelling, serositis), and include an abdominal exam for masses, distension, or suprapubic fullness suggesting obstruction [^111iZ4kE].

---

## Laboratory investigations

### Essential laboratory tests

- **Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)**: Baseline and serial measurements to assess trajectory [^111iZ4kE].
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate.
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia, infection, bleeding.
- **Urinalysis**: Dipstick for protein, blood, glucose, leukocytes, nitrites; microscopy for cells, casts, crystals [^111uSGTg].
- **Urine sodium and osmolality**: Calculate FENa and FEurea to differentiate prerenal (< 1% FENa, < 35% FEurea) from intrinsic renal failure [^notfound].

---

### Additional laboratory tests (as indicated)

Order additional tests as indicated by clinical suspicion: **autoimmune serology** (ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM, complement levels) for suspected glomerulonephritis; viral serologies (HIV, hepatitis B/C) when infection-related GN is suspected; and myoglobin/CK for suspected rhabdomyolysis. Consider novel biomarkers such as NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 for early detection and risk stratification, recognizing they are not yet routine [^1128wWJv].

---

## Imaging studies

Renal ultrasound is the **first-line modality** to assess kidney size and echogenicity and to exclude obstruction; obtain within 24 hours unless the cause is clear or AKI is improving, and within 6 hours if obstruction is suspected [^117G2kG1] [^113cjUrc]. Non-contrast CT is used when ultrasound is inconclusive and obstruction remains suspected, and MRI is an alternative to CT when contrast is contraindicated or to further characterize renal lesions.

---

## Indications for renal biopsy

Renal biopsy is indicated for **unexplained intrinsic renal failure**, suspected glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, persistent proteinuria or hematuria, or lack of improvement despite supportive care.

---

## Differential diagnosis

ARF is classified into **three categories**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Prerenal | - Hypovolemia <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Liver failure <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - ARBs [^notfound] |
| Intrinsic renal | - Acute tubular necrosis <br/> - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis <br/> - Hemolytic uremic syndrome [^111f8R3z] |
| Postrenal | - Obstruction (stones, tumors, BPH, strictures) [^116sgdAt] |

---

## Management principles

- **Treat underlying cause**: Correct hypovolemia, stop nephrotoxins, treat infection, relieve obstruction [^111iZ4kE].
- **Supportive care**: Fluid management, electrolyte correction, blood pressure control, nutritional support [^111NmB7g].
- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, volume overload, uremic symptoms, or progressive AKI [^117E4SRg].
- **Early nephrology consultation**: For complex cases, severe AKI, or consideration of RRT [^115jUdPN].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include reassessment of **renal function** at 3 months to evaluate for resolution or progression to CKD [^112SzyRY], and long-term monitoring for hypertension, proteinuria, and CKD progression. Patient education should cover medication review, hydration, and recognition of recurrent AKI symptoms [^notfound].

---

The ARF workup emphasizes **early recognition**, structured evaluation, and targeted management to improve outcomes and reduce progression to CKD.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function. It is often diagnosed in the context of other acute illnesses and is particularly common in critically ill patients. The clinical consequences of AKI include the accumulation of waste products, electrolytes, and fluid, but also less obvious effects, including reduced immunity and dysfunction of non-renal organs (organ cross-talk).

The impact and prognosis of AKI vary considerably depending on the severity, clinical setting, comorbid factors, and also geographical location. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with serious short- and long-term complications, in particular increased mortality and morbidity, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high financial healthcare costs. As such, AKI is now recognized as a major public health problem.

Rapid diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup are essential to identify those types of AKI where specific therapies and interventions are available to reverse the injurious process within the kidneys. This review will summarise the key aspects of diagnosis and diagnostic work-up with particular focus on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

Diagnosis of acute kidney disease

AKI is defined as occurring over 7 days and CKD starts when kidney disease has persisted for more than 90 days. Based on epidemiological studies and histological case series, it is clear that some patients have a slow but persistent (creeping) rise in serum creatinine over days or weeks but do not strictly fulfil the consensus criteria for AKI. To classify this phase between the early stage of AKI (first 7 days) and the onset of CKD (beyond 3 months), the KDIGO expert group proposed the term "acute kidney disease" (AKD) and suggested the following criteria: a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for < 3 months, a decrease in GFR by ≥ 35%, and an increase in serum creatinine by > 50% for < 3 months or evidence of structural kidney damage for < 3 months. These criteria are currently under revision (personal communication with the ADQI group).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® renal failure [^116sgdAt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal failure can be divided into acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Both are common and result in increased patient morbidity and mortality. The etiology is multifactorial and differentiation of acute kidney injury from chronic kidney disease includes clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging. The main role of imaging is to detect treatable causes of renal failure such as ureteral obstruction or renovascular disease and to evaluate renal size and morphology. Ultrasound is the modality of choice for initial imaging, with duplex Doppler reserved for suspected renal artery stenosis or thrombosis. CT and MRI may be appropriate, particularly for urinary tract obstruction. However, the use of iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors and cost-benefit ratio. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^116zoaEu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^111JD9cT]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on renal failure [^111bUB13]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a role in the management of patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. However, clinical circumstances strongly impact the appropriateness of imaging use. In patients with newly detected renal dysfunction, ultrasonography can assess for reversible causes, assess renal size and echogenicity, and thus, establish the chronicity of disease. Urinary obstruction can be detected, but imaging is most useful in high-risk groups or in patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion for obstruction. Computed tomography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance arteriography, and percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsy are valuable in other clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^116MgyqL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

Diagnosis of AKI

The diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. The definition has evolved from the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage (RIFLE) criteria in 2004 to the AKI Network (AKIN) classification in 2007. In 2012, both were merged resulting in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Accordingly, AKI is diagnosed if serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) or more in 48 h or rises to at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days (Table 1). AKI stages are defined by the maximum change of either serum creatinine or urine output. The importance of both criteria was confirmed in a recent study in > 32,000 critically ill patients which showed that short- and long-term risk of death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) were greatest when patients met both criteria for AKI and when these abnormalities persisted for longer than 3 days.

Table 1
KDIGO definition and classification of AKI

AKI acute kidney injury, GFR glomerular filtration rate, KDIGO Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, RRT renal replacement therapy

Several studies in various different patient populations have confirmed an association between stages of AKI and short- and long-term outcomes. However, serum creatinine and urine output are markers of excretory function only and do not provide any information about any other roles of the kidney, i.e. metabolic, endocrine, or immunological functions. They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context. Some patients fulfil the AKI definition but do not have AKI, and there are also patients with clear evidence of renal injury who do not meet the creatinine or urine criteria for AKI (Table 2).

### Defining acute renal failure: RIFLE and beyond [^1158tM6U]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The introduction of the RIFLE classification has increased the conceptual understanding of the acute kidney injury (AKI) syndrome, and this classification has been successfully tested in a number of clinical studies. This review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the RIFLE classification and suggests additional parameters to broaden future definitions of AKI. These definitions should not only focus on kidney function alone, but also include parameters describing the origin of the patient, the most important causal factors responsible for AKI and information on the pre-existing kidney function. This more complete definition should lead to a decrease in the variability of the results of epidemiological studies and of future clinical trials in AKI populations.

### Recommendations on acute kidney injury biomarkers from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference: a consensus statement [^1128wWJv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In the last decade, new biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified and studied in clinical trials. Guidance is needed regarding how best to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Objective

To develop recommendations on AKI biomarkers based on existing data and expert consensus for practicing clinicians and researchers.

Evidence Review

At the 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting, a meeting of 23 international experts in critical care, nephrology, and related specialties, the panel focused on 4 broad areas, as follows: (1) AKI risk assessment; (2) AKI prediction and prevention; (3) AKI diagnosis, etiology, and management; and (4) AKI progression and kidney recovery. A literature search revealed more than 65 000 articles published between 1965 and May 2019. In a modified Delphi process, recommendations and consensus statements were developed based on existing data, with 90% agreement among panel members required for final adoption. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Findings

The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain, and more research is necessary.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^111rWcXj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of AKI, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and performance characteristics of the test. Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on AKI diagnosis or management should be a priority in AKI research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in AKI have been largely unsuccessful.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112714HR]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Before you call renal: acute kidney injury for hospitalists [^115kZHtU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical problem of growing incidence in hospitalized patients. It increases the risk of poor outcomes, length of stay and the cost of hospitalization. Successful management of acute kidney injury requires early recognition and diagnosis through detailed medical history, careful physical exam, judicious use of laboratory and radiologic tests and timely renal consultation. Subsequent management is tailored to the likely mechanism of injury with emphasis on limiting both further injury and systemic consequences. A common sense approach to acute kidney injury is essential for hospitalists aiming to limit further injury, prevent acute complications and lessen the risk of chronic morbidity.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^111a1GMg]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder for which currently there is no accepted definition. Having a uniform standard for diagnosing and classifying AKI would enhance our ability to manage these patients. Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require collaborative networks of investigators drawn from various disciplines, dissemination of information via multidisciplinary joint conferences and publications, and improved translation of knowledge from pre-clinical research. We describe an initiative to develop uniform standards for defining and classifying AKI and to establish a forum for multidisciplinary interaction to improve care for patients with or at risk for AKI.

Methods

Members representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI participated in a two day conference in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in September 2005 and were assigned to one of three workgroups. Each group's discussions formed the basis for draft recommendations that were later refined and improved during discussion with the larger group. Dissenting opinions were also noted. The final draft recommendations were circulated to all participants and subsequently agreed upon as the consensus recommendations for this report. Participating societies endorsed the recommendations and agreed to help disseminate the results.

Results

The term AKI is proposed to represent the entire spectrum of acute renal failure. Diagnostic criteria for AKI are proposed based on acute alterations in serum creatinine or urine output. A staging system for AKI which reflects quantitative changes in serum creatinine and urine output has been developed.

Conclusion

We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. We have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI which will need to be validated in future studies. The Acute Kidney Injury Network offers a mechanism for proceeding with efforts to improve patient outcomes.

Patients with altered renal function are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED) and emergency physicians often play an important role in the evaluation and management of renal disease. Early recognition, diagnosis, prevention of further iatrogenic injury, and management of renal disease have important implications for long-term morbidity and mortality. This article reviews basic renal physiology, discusses the differential diagnosis and approach to therapy, as well as strategies to prevent further renal injury, for adult patients who present to the ED with renal injury or failure.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^111f8R3z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic work-up

As a syndrome, AKI can have multiple aetiologies. In critically ill patients, the most common causes are sepsis, heart failure, haemodynamic instability, hypovolaemia, and exposure to nephrotoxic substances. Acute parenchymal and glomerular renal diseases are relatively rare. Determining the aetiology is essential to guide management and potentially target and influence the disease process.

The terms "pre-renal", "renal" and "post-renal" have traditionally been used to narrow the differential diagnosis of AKI. It was a long-held view that "pre-renal AKI" or "transient" AKI were synonymous with "hypovolaemic AKI" and "fluid responsiveness". However, several studies have demonstrated that tubular damage may be present in patients with "pre-renal AKI". Furthermore, adverse outcomes have been noted even when creatinine returned to baseline within 24 h. Based on these results, the ADQI group proposed to differentiate between "functional AKI" and "kidney damage" in preference to the terms "pre-renal", "renal", and "post-renal" AKI.

The specific diagnostic workup in individual patients with AKI depends on the clinical context, severity, and duration of AKI, and also on local availability. Urinalysis, examination of the urinary sediment, and imaging studies should be performed as a minimum, with additional tests depending on the clinical presentation (Fig. 4).

### Acute kidney injury [^1142XM1n]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease.

### Incidence and prognosis of acute kidney diseases and disorders using an integrated approach to laboratory measurements in a universal health care system [^113RrLYN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do the acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) criteria from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines identify patients who do not meet existing criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI), and what is the prognosis of these patients?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1.1 million Canadian residents, AKD criteria identified many patients who did not meet existing criteria for CKD or AKI, and patients with AKD without AKI had overall modestly increased risks of incident and progressive CKD, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Meaning

The incorporation of AKD into clinical and research initiatives for kidney disease would increase recognition of patients at risk of adverse outcomes who are not identified by current AKI and CKD criteria; however, the clinical importance of AKD remains to be determined.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^1112ZGjH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Similar problems may occur when defining AKI stage 3 by the RRT criterion. The optimal timing of RRT for AKI is not known and clinical practice is very variable. As such, AKI staging depends directly on the decision-making process of the clinician rather than underlying renal function.

Finally, single serum creatinine values do not provide any information about specific stages of the AKI process. Importantly, they do not indicate whether a patient is still in the progression phase or if recovery has already begun. Also, eGFR formulae are not valid to determine renal function in AKI.

Limitations of urine-based criteria for AKI

Urine output is an important clinical marker but, like creatinine, is not renal specific. In fact, urine output may persist until renal function almost ceases. Similarly, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response of functioning kidneys during periods of prolonged fasting, hypovolaemia, after surgery, and following stress, pain, or trauma. In these situations, the action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) can result in the generation of very concentrated urine with osmolarities up to 1400 mmosm/l. Assuming a daily solute load of 700 mosmoles, the urine volume may physiologically decrease to 500 mL (i.e. 0.28 ml/kg/h in a 70 kg person) as a result of normal kidney function.

The KDIGO criteria for AKI are based on the presence of oliguria for a minimum of 6 h. Several experts have questioned the validity of this arbitrary cut-off and suggest using either a longer minimum period (e.g. 12 h) or a lower threshold for urinary output (e.g. 0.3 ml/kg/h instead of 0.5 ml/kg/h) to reach sufficient specificity for diagnosing AKI.

Finally, in obese patients, weight-based urine output criteria may be particularly misleading (Table 2). In fact, the European Renal Best Practice Guidelines (2012) recommend using the ideal weight rather than the true weight when calculating urine output in ml/min/kg to avoid an overdiagnosis of AKI.

Adjunctive diagnostic tools to diagnose AKI

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to use additional tools to diagnose AKI, especially where creatinine and urine values change only slowly, are misleading, or cannot be interpreted accurately. This is particularly relevant for critically ill patients where the presence of fluid overload, muscle wasting, sepsis, and reduced effective circulating volume may completely mask the diagnosis of AKI.

### When cardiac failure, kidney dysfunction, and kidney injury intersect in acute conditions: the case of cardiorenal syndrome [^116hwqzW]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and describe diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers of renal function and renal injury in the cardiorenal syndrome complicating acutely decompensated heart failure.

Data Sources

PubMed search and review of relevant medical literature.

Study Selection

Two reviewers screened and selected studies in English with diagnostic or prognostic assessment of biomarkers of renal injury.

Data Extraction

Narrative review of the medical literature.

Data Synthesis

Cardiorenal syndrome has a complex pathophysiology and has a generally poor prognosis in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. Among the methods to recognize risk for cardiorenal syndrome may be the use of circulating or urinary biomarkers, which may allow for more accurate early diagnosis and risk stratification; use of biomarkers may provide important pathophysiologic understanding beyond risk prediction. However, different phenotypes of patients with acute renal dysfunction may be present, which has ramifications with respect to response to treatment strategies. Addition of biomarkers of renal injury may provide additional prognostic value to biomarkers of renal or cardiac function, but more data are needed.

Conclusions

Biomarkers reflecting renal function and injury are likely to better phenotype subgroups of patients with cardiorenal syndrome and to provide unique prognostic information. Future studies are needed relative to strategies using such biomarkers to guide care of affected patients.

### Acute kidney injury: what's the prognosis? [^116Mvdoq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common (especially during critical illness), increasing in incidence, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification currently provides a standardized estimate of incidence and outcomes from AKI. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human AKI, our ability to assess kidney function is limited and functional impairment poorly correlates with structural injury to the kidneys. Emerging novel biomarkers are, however, likely to further enhance risk stratification, facilitate early diagnosis, enable early enrollment in therapeutic trials, and assess prognosis. Sepsis remains the leading cause of AKI among the critically ill and over the past few years insights into the pathogenesis of AKI in sepsis are beginning to shift attention from renal blood flow to inflammation-mediated organ injury. Emerging evidence suggests that survivors of AKI incur long-term risks for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared with those without AKI. Despite decades of research, no specific therapy for AKI other than supportive care currently exists and further work is required to better understand the pathogenesis of AKI during critical illness and to develop novel treatments.

### A framework and key research questions in AKI diagnosis and staging in different environments [^111E9siD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common worldwide, and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. The RIFLE system of staging AKI correlates with survival in AKI in several settings. A similar AKI definition and staging system that also incorporates lesser degrees of serum creatinine elevation was proposed at the inaugural Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) meeting in 2005. At the Second AKIN meeting in Vancouver, Canada in September 2006, our group developed a research agenda that would test the utility of these diagnostic and staging criteria to predict patient outcomes in a variety of clinical settings and patient groups.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Three-day, international, consensus conference. A multidisciplinary stakeholder committee was divided into work groups. Recommendations for clinical practice and for future research were developed by the committee as an iterative process. This procedure consisted of a literature review phase and focus group interactions with presentations to the entire committee.

Results

We first proposed a conceptual framework of disease that describes a series of AKI stages, antecedents and outcomes, and allows a description of research recommendations based on transition between AKI stages. We further proposed methods for testing of the definition and development of research questions to establish the utility of new biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of AKI and associated illnesses.

Conclusions

Retrospective studies should be conducted to initiate the process of validating the AKIN definition of AKI, followed by comprehensive prospective studies that incorporate sampling for emerging AKI biomarkers.

### Recommendations for clinical trial design in acute kidney injury from the 31st Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference. A consensus statement [^111RgZHj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient enrichment strategies

AKI is complex and multifactorial, with multiple conditions presenting with clinically indistinguishable features. The heterogeneous nature of AKI syndromes refers to the different exposures that may all lead to acute decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but the underlying mechanisms are quite different (cyclosporin-induced AKI vs septic AKI vs cardiorenal AKI). However, a kidney damage without a loss of function is also associated with worse outcome. Heterogeneity in AKI development and clinical course stems from numerous factors including susceptibility, underlying comorbidities, severity of acute illness, presence of extra-renal organ failures, and the type and severity of the insult leading to AKI. Patient baseline variability, including known and unknown differences in chronic and acute characteristics, can drive differential responses to different interventions and will contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effects observed in clinical trials.

Several approaches can be considered to minimize baseline variability in clinical trials. These include stratified randomization to balance key known or clinically apparent baseline characteristics (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD]), use of standardized protocols to minimize process of care variability, selection of a particular clinical setting to focus on a homogenous type of insult (e.g. post-cardiopulmonary bypass), or use of improved diagnostics (e.g. biomarkers) to better identify patient subtypes. Application of prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies (supplementary Table 2) would be expected to identify patients most likely to develop an outcome of interest and respond to an intervention. Precise differential diagnosis may contribute to trial efficiency by selecting patients with traits more likely to favorably respond to candidate therapies. Implementation of enrichment strategies in AKI could enable identification of the right patients for discrete prevention, treatment, and kidney rehabilitation interventions.

The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^116QKB7G]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, definition and staging of AKI is based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR, and its proxy serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes of kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function. The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them as a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition and particularly for the assessment of the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcome (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying (i) the need to use the first available (admission) serum creatinine in that episode as baseline creatinine; and (ii) draw attention to the fact that urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating the urinary output in mL/min/kg. ERBP also felt that it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients. Indeed, after publication of the RIFLE criteria, it became rapidly apparent that different interpretations were still given to 'baseline creatinine', and that the urinary output criterion was either omitted, or calculated on 24-h urine output. For baseline creatinine, some authors suggested using an estimation of serum creatinine, by backward calculation from a presumed 'standard GFR' of 75 mL/min/1.73 m²; others suggested using the last known value. This concept of a 'universal baseline' clashes with the current epidemiology of AKI, where an important subpopulation do not start from 'normal renal function', but do already have underlying CKD. Siew et al. demonstrated that the use of the value at admission in the episode under consideration was best associated with risk. Also in the AKIN criteria, the intention is to use the evolution of serum creatinine relative to the first observed value in that episode. It was demonstrated that using admission creatinine rather than estimated creatinine from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min improved the prediction of need for renal replacement therapy and mortality, and decreased misclassification. ERBP wants to stress that the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), using whatever formula, is obsolete in patients with AKI, as all these formulae presume that kidney function is stable, and markers of GFR are in steady state, which is of course contradictory with the fact that patients have AKI.

Blood and urine tests are commonly performed by clinicians in both ambulatory and hospital settings that detect chronic and acute kidney disease. Thresholds for these tests have been established that signal the presence and severity of kidney injury or dysfunction. In the appropriate clinical context of a patient's history and physical examination, an abnormal test result should trigger specific actions for clinicians, including reviewing patient medication use, follow-up testing, prescribing lifestyle modifications, and specialist referral. Tests for kidney disease can also be used to determine the future risk for kidney failure as well as cardiovascular death.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^117QPeGE]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine is measured as a concentration and is therefore affected by variations in volume status. As a result, the diagnosis of AKI may be delayed or missed in patients with significant fluid shifts or fluid overload. This was highlighted in a post-hoc analysis of the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. It revealed that AKI was unmasked or classified differently in up to 18% of patients after serum creatinine levels were adjusted for net fluid balance and estimated total body water. Affected patients had mortality rates similar to those with AKI that was present before adjustment.

Another important limitation of all creatinine-based definitions of AKI is that they require a reference value to describe "baseline" renal function. Ideally, this value should reflect the patient's steady-state kidney function just before the episode of AKI. However, information on pre-hospital kidney function is not always available so that various surrogate estimates are frequently used. These may include inpatient results or the imputation of values such as back-calculating a baseline creatinine and using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in patients with missing data. Unfortunately, these methods can inflate as well as reduce the true incidence of AKI. At present, there is no standard approach to determining baseline renal function.

Creatinine-based criteria for AKI often do not take into account underlying renal reserve. In patients with normal kidney function, a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl may indeed be due to an important reduction in GFR. In contrast, in patients with underlying CKD, absolute rises in serum creatinine represent variable changes in GFR, and a rise by 0.3 mg/dl may be within the acceptable daily variation and simply reflect an inconsequential change in GFR. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing KDIGO AKI stage 3 which is defined by a rise in serum creatinine to > 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 353.6 μmol/l). A patient with a baseline serum creatinine of 3.9 mg/dl (345 μmol/l) who experiences a creatinine rise by 0.3 mg/dl in 48 h would be classified as having KDIGO AKI stage 3, whereas such a rise would be defined as AKI stage 1 in a patient with normal baseline renal function.

### Improving outcomes of acute kidney injury: report of an initiative [^1169Qv9p]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder comprising several etiological factors and occurring in multiple settings. The disorder has a variety of clinical manifestations that range from minimal elevation in serum creatinine level to anuric renal failure. We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. This Acute Kidney Injury Network has proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI. These proposed standards will need to be validated in future studies, a process that will be facilitated by the Acute Kidney Injury Network, which offers a forum that encourages acquisition of knowledge to improve patient outcomes.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116w2gWm]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO guideline recommended urine sediment analysis for differential diagnosis in patients with AKI, especially when glomerular disease is expected. Meeting participants noted that urine sediment analysis is not routinely performed in many centers despite its potential role in the workup of AKI. Additionally, the value of urine biochemistry analysis has been challenged, especially in sepsis.

The FST may be useful for identifying patients with AKI who are likely to have progressive disease and need dialysis. There is also evidence that the FST is useful in predicting delayed graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. This test was not included in the 2012 guideline but should now be considered. Importantly, unregulated diagnostics tests such as FST or urine sediment analysis require careful standardization and quality control. Their introduction into clinical practice should include local evaluation for correct performance and interpretation.

The traditional approach to classifying AKI as pre-renal, renal, and post-renal is still found in many medical text-books. A different framework is needed, because these terms are considered unhelpful, especially the term pre-renal, which is often misinterpreted as "hypovolemic" and may encourage indiscriminate fluid administration. For classifying AKI, it may be more beneficial to distinguish between conditions that reduce glomerular function, conditions that result in injury of tubules and/or glomeruli, and conditions that do both.

Endpoints for clinical trials and quality improvement initiatives for AKI include mortality, new onset or progression of CKD, and dialysis dependency. Additional endpoints are needed for both clinical management and research, and these might include recovery of function, maximum changes in creatinine concentration, stage of AKI/AKD, impact on renal reserve, and patient experience. Additionally, there is a need to better define renal recovery and its functional (filtration, tubular, endocrine) and anatomic/structural dimensions.

Follow-up

Increased risks for mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression of kidney disease are well-documented outcomes of AKI.– However, not everyone with AKI has a poor outcome, and predictors of poor outcomes have been identified. Follow-up recommendations (Figure 1)have been proposed that could be integrated into a KDIGO guideline revision. Although it has been suggested that patients be screened at hospital discharge or seen within 1 month of AKI diagnosis, there is no consensus on the optimal strategy and duration of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes.

Challenges of diagnosing AKI in critically ill patients

As outlined earlier, the use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR in critically ill patients is limited by the lack of steady-state conditions, unpredictable rate of production, and variable degree of elimination (Table 2). Medications may cause increases in creatinine without reflecting a true decrease in GFR and fluid overload may lead to a dilution of creatinine concentrations. Finally, serum creatinine substantially lags behind a reduction in GFR and thus does not provide a useful real-time assessment of GFR. It is therefore not surprising that AKI is often diagnosed late in critically ill patients.

The interpretation of additional diagnostic investigations can be challenging, too. Dipstick haematuria is not uncommon in patients with an indwelling urinary catheter and most commonly due to simple trauma. Even more specialised tests, like autoimmune tests, have a higher risk of false-positive results in critically ill patients. For instance, infection is a frequent cause of a false-positive ANCA result. Until more reliable tests are routinely used in clinical practice it is essential to interpret creatinine results and other diagnostic tests within the clinical context.

Future diagnostic tools

A variety of new functional and damage markers of AKI have been shown to provide information related to the underlying pathophysiology of AKI and may also be utilised as diagnostic tools. It is expected that some of these markers will be routinely integrated into the definition as well as diagnostic workup of AKI.

Achieving the ability to rapidly and accurately measure and monitor GFR in real time would be very beneficial, especially in the ICU. Several groups are developing optical measurement techniques using minimally invasive or non-invasive techniques that can quantify renal function independent of serum creatinine or urine output. In the past few years, significant progress has been made in using two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to study kidney function. It is very likely that several of these approaches will enter clinical phase studies in the very near future. These techniques will enable an earlier diagnosis of AKI and also provide opportunities to improve clinical management, including the use of nephrotoxic substances and appropriate drug dosing.

New imaging techniques may also be utilised, including cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging or intravital multiphoton studies. However, given the complexity, financial costs, and need for patient transport, it is likely that they will remain research tools.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^112bBvFV]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "RIFLE diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The RIFLE criteria is a clinical calculator used to classify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI). The acronym RIFLE stands for Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease. This scoring system applies to patients who are at risk of developing AKI, particularly those in critical care settings such as the intensive care unit.

The RIFLE criteria is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategy and predict patient outcomes.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the RIFLE criteria. However, it may not be applicable or accurate in patients with chronic kidney disease or other conditions that affect baseline creatinine levels or urine output. It's also important to note that the RIFLE criteria does not identify the cause of AKI, so further diagnostic evaluation may be necessary.

The RIFLE criteria for diagnosing acute kidney injury involve assessing the severity based on changes in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine output. Based on user input, the criteria determine a classification level: Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, or End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

Here's how the computation works:

- **Risk, RIFLE-R**: Identified when the serum creatinine level is 1.5 to 2 times above baseline, or the GFR shows more than a 25% decrease below baseline. Urine output is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

- **Injury, RIFLE-I**: Occurs if the serum creatinine level is more than 2 to 3 times above baseline, or there is more than a 50% decrease in GFR below baseline. This stage includes urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours.

- **Failure, RIFLE-F**: Determined when serum creatinine exceeds 3 times above baseline or reaches 4 mg/dL (350 mcmol/L) or an acute rise of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L). It also indicates a GFR decrease of over 75% below baseline. Urine output is critically low, at less than 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or anuria (complete absence of urine) for 12 hours.

- **Loss, RIFLE-L**: Describes persistent acute kidney injury lasting over 4 weeks.

- **ESRD, RIFLE-E**: Represents end-stage renal disease extending for more than 3 months.

The user's input concerning these criteria leads to a categorical diagnosis aligning with the RIFLE classification system, providing a structured perspective on the severity and progression of acute kidney injury.

### Diagnosis, epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury [^117E7Dec]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is an increasingly common and potentially catastrophic complication in hospitalized patients. Early observational studies from the 1980s and 1990s established the general epidemiologic features of acute kidney injury: the incidence, prognostic significance, and predisposing medical and surgical conditions. Recent multicenter observational cohorts and administrative databases have enhanced our understanding of the overall disease burden of acute kidney injury and trends in its epidemiology. An increasing number of clinical studies focusing on specific types of acute kidney injury (e.g., in the setting of intravenous contrast, sepsis, and major surgery) have provided further details into this heterogeneous syndrome. Despite our sophisticated understanding of the epidemiology and pathobiology of acute kidney injury, current prevention strategies are inadequate and current treatment options outside of renal replacement therapy are nonexistent. This failure to innovate may be due in part to a diagnostic approach that has stagnated for decades and continues to rely on markers of glomerular filtration (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) that are neither sensitive nor specific. There has been increasing interest in the identification and validation of novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury that may permit earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This review summarizes the major epidemiologic studies of acute kidney injury and efforts to modernize the approach to its diagnosis.

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m, or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112cs4jN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The availability of a consensus definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been an important step in establishing AKI epidemiology. AKI affects 30–60% of critically ill patients and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. Evidence is also accumulating that the burden of AKI extends beyond the acute phase with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased risk of cardiovascular complications, recurrent episodes of AKI and long-term mortality. Prevention of development and/or progression is currently limited to hemodynamic and fluid status optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Search for a specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the complex and incompletely elucidated pathophysiology. Progress in the management of AKI is to be expected from the recognition that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, clinical phenotypes, pathophysiology, nephrotoxicity, optimal supportive management, as well as the importance of recovery and long-term follow-up. A discussion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

1.3. Further follow-up of AKI

1.3.1 Assess patients 2 months after AKI to evaluate the completeness of resolution, the detection of new onset CKD or worsening of pre-existing CKD. (1C)

Rationale

Observations in recently published epidemiological studies show that in a considerable number of patients who survive the acute clinical condition, CKD develops or worsens. Thus, management of patients should extend even beyond the condition of AKI, and should include monitoring for new-onset CKD. Although the follow-up interval after which an assessment should occur is a matter of clinical judgement, we feel that in high-risk in-patients kidney function should be re-assessed not later than 2 months after hospital discharge. Patients should be managed according to appropriate guidelines if CKD is detected.

### Acute kidney injury [^113Ghui6]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and classification of acute pathology in the kidney are major clinical problems. Azotemia and oliguria represent not only disease but normal responses of the kidney to extracellular volume depletion or decreased renal blood flow. Changes in urine output and glomerular filtration rate are therefore neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of renal pathology. However, no simple alternative for the diagnosis currently exists. By examining both glomerular and tubular function, clinicians routinely make inferences not only on the presence of renal dysfunction but also on its cause. However, pure prerenal physiology is unusual in hospitalized patients, and its effects are not necessary benign. Sepsis, the most common condition associated with acute renal failure in the intensive care unit, may alter renal function without any characteristic changes in urine indices, and classification of these abnormalities as prerenal will undoubtedly lead to incorrect management decisions. The clinical syndrome known as acute tubular necrosis does not actually manifest the morphologic changes that the name implies. A precise biochemical definition of acute renal failure has never been proposed, and until recently, there has been no consensus on the diagnostic criteria or clinical definition. Depending on the definition used, acute renal failure has been reported to affect from 1% to 25% of intensive care unit patients and has led to mortality rates ranging from 15% to 60%. From this chaos, two principles emerged: first, the need for a standard definition and, second, the need to classify the severity of the syndrome rather than only consider its most severe form. The RIFLE criteria were developed to achieve these goals, and the term acute kidney injury has been proposed to encompass the entire spectrum of the syndrome, from minor changes in renal function to requirement for renal replacement therapy. Thus, acute kidney injury is not acute tubular necrosis, nor is it renal failure. Small changes in kidney function in hospitalized patients are important and are associated with significant changes in short-term and possibly long-term outcomes. The RIFLE criteria provide a uniform definition of acute kidney injury and have now been validated in numerous studies.

### Assessment and diagnosis of renal dysfunction in the ICU [^117H2XCL]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with impaired renal function is crucial in the setting of critical illness. Serum creatinine serves as the gold standard for assessing steady-state renal function, helping to define those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although these baseline creatinine values are often not available in the setting of critical illness, CKD, whether defined by serum creatinine or proteinuria, increases the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite delays in elevations following renal insults, serum creatinine remains the standard for assessing acute changes in renal function. Standardized definitions of AKI, using changes in serum creatinine and urine output, have informed the epidemiology of ICU-acquired AKI and have helped define the long-term outcomes in patients who experience AKI. A complex cyclical interplay exists between AKI and CKD, in which CKD predisposes patients to an increased risk of AKI, whereas those with AKI, regardless of baseline renal function, are more likely to suffer from post-AKI CKD. The clarification of the AKI-CKD dynamic remains a work in progress and will be aided by the implementation of novel measures of renal function. Several novel biomarkers of renal function have been proposed to augment serum creatinine in the diagnosis of AKI and CKD. These biomarkers, taken with recent clinical investigations, have laid the groundwork for the impending paradigm shift in risk stratifying and in diagnosing changes in renal function in the ICU.

Results

Diagnosis

Questions:
Which are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the appropriate imaging work-up in case of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What is the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests?
Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
What is the timing and the suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

Statements (severity grading)

Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal), and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis (1C).
Patients who have persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death (1C).
Patients with organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the three following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal), and (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Most patients (80–85%) will develop a mild disease course (self-limited, mortality < 1–3%), but around 20% will have a moderate or severe episode of AP, with a mortality rate from 13 to 35%. Thus, it is important to diagnose (or better predict) an episode of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to identify the patients with high risk of developing complications.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^112XELTZ]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

### Classification and staging of acute kidney injury: beyond the RIFLE and AKIN criteria [^1117NoeX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often overlooked in hospitalized patients, despite the fact that even mild forms are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes such as increased mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular failure and infections. Research endorsed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative led to the publication of a consensus definition for AKI — the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, and End-stage renal disease) — which was designed to standardize and classify renal dysfunction. These criteria, along with revised versions developed by the AKI Network (AKIN), can detect AKI with high sensitivity and high specificity and describe different severity levels that aim to predict the prognosis of affected patients. The RIFLE and AKIN criteria are easy to use in a variety of clinical and research settings, but have several limitations: both utilize an increase in serum creatinine level from a hypothetical baseline value and a decrease in urine output, but these surrogate markers of renal impairment manifest relatively late after injury has occurred and do not consider the nature or site of the kidney injury. New biomarkers for AKI have shown promise for early diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis of AKI. As more data become available, they could, in the future, be incorporated into improved definitions or criteria for AKI.

### Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: is NGAL ready for clinical use? [^116Psxf6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria were introduced in 2004, defining the clinical stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcome measures based on serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and urine output. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that these markers are insufficient in drawing an accurate illustration of kidney injury. Indeed, mortality and morbidity remain high in AKI, suggesting that accuracy and speed of patient evaluation are lacking. A great deal of evidence indicates that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a sensitive and specific early marker of various etiological classes of AKI and would be highly valuable in conjunction with existing markers of AKI for better classifying renal injury as well as dysfunction (kidney attack). Improvements in diagnosis, risk identification, stratification, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring will benefit clinical decision-making in the individualized bundling of therapies and ongoing patient management. In particular, kidney protection and AKI prevention may become feasible if an earlier and more accurate diagnosis is made for AKI. Here, we discuss the opportunity to consider whether NGAL is ready for routine clinical use in a number of etiologies of AKI.

### Acute kidney injury [^116gQkzx]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, heterogeneous, multifactorial condition, which is part of the overarching syndrome of acute kidney diseases and disorders. This condition's incidence highest in low-income and middle-income countries. In the short term, AKI is associated with increased mortality, an increased risk of complications, extended stays in hospital, and high health-care costs. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and an increased risk of death. Several strategies are available to prevent and treat AKI in specific clinical contexts. Otherwise, AKI care is primarily supportive, focused on treatment of the underlying cause, prevention of further injury, management of complications, and short-term renal replacement therapy in case of refractory complications. Evidence confirming that AKI subphenotyping is necessary to identify precision-oriented interventions is growing. Long-term follow-up of individuals recovered from AKI is recommended but the most effective models of care remain unclear.

### Imaging of acute renal failure in the hospital setting [^111ky61b]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a decline in the glomerular filtration rate. AKI affects up to 20% of hospitalized patients, and is even more common among intensive care unit admissions. Complications of AKI are related to uremia (encephalopathy, neuropathy, pericarditis), volume overload (pulmonary edema), and electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia). In addition to having increased associated morbidity and mortality, patients who develop AKI may never fully recover their baseline kidney function. Imaging can play a valuable role in the work-up of AKI. This article discusses the utility of imaging in characterizing AKI in adult patients in a hospital setting.

KDOQI commentary — duration of acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcomes: Duration of AKI may be a more important predictor of outcomes than the magnitude of serum creatinine change, and although this dimension can be assessed retrospectively, it cannot be included in prospective staging criteria; consideration should be given to including duration of AKI in future epidemiologic criteria.

### Heterogeneity in the definition of major adverse kidney events: a scoping review [^1176BH49]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key findings

In this systematic scoping review, we found marked heterogeneity in applied criteria for MAKE across 122 eligible studies. While the number of published articles using MAKE as an endpoint continued to rise, heterogeneity remained, both in terms of the observation periods selected for MAKE evaluation and the criteria applied to each MAKE component. In particular, we identified 37 different criteria for persistent renal dysfunction, which can be further influenced by baseline creatinine definitions and/or eGFR calculations. Moreover, in some studies, descriptions of applied criteria for MAKE components were lacking and criteria and observation periods for MAKE evaluation vary according to study characteristics. Furthermore, MAKE rates varied by as much as 7% with different observation periods and by 36.4% with different dialysis component definitions.

Relationship to previous studies

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic scoping review to describe the heterogeneity in the applied criteria and observation periods used to detect MAKE. Observed heterogeneity and its impact on MAKE rates, with some studies even lacking a description of applied criteria, are noteworthy and even problematic in study interpretation or comparison and planning RCTs.

The concept of MAKE was originally proposed by Shaw in 2011 as a patient-centered renal outcome including death, new dialysis, and incident or progressive chronic kidney disease. Subsequently, it was operationalized to include death, dialysis, and persistent renal dysfunction in most articles. Since the introduction of MAKE, death has been a key component. However, it remains unclear if death is a kidney injury related endpoint or a competing endpoint for renal dysfunction. This is because mortality mostly reflects the underlying acute illness. Although death from kidney failure has been employed as a component for proposed Major Adverse Renal Events for CKD patients, attributing mortality to kidney injury in intensive care unit patients, however, is particularly challenging and possibly misleading. Yet, death is a fundamental patient-centered outcome. As a consequence, despite such concerns, death from any cause continues to be used in studies of MAKE.

### RIFLE criteria for acute kidney injury are associated with hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a cohort analysis [^115u1qTy]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	The RIFLE classification is a very sensitive definition of acute kidney injury: acute kidney injury defined by the RIFLE classification occurred in two thirds of general ICU patients.

- 	RIFLE classes injury and failure are independently associated with increased risk for in-hospital dead.

- 	Patients who meet the very sensitive RIFLE "risk" criteria, are at significant risk for progression to injury or failure, and therefore in-hospital dead.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^114piCBk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend to diagnose and stage the severity of AKI as follows (meeting any of the criteria):

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Stage 1|- Serum creatinine increase 1.5–1.9 times baseline <br/> - Serum creatinine increase > 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 mcmol/L) <br/> - Urinary output < 0.5 mL/kg/hour during a 6 hour block|
|Stage 2|- Serum creatinine increase 2.0–2.9 times baseline <br/> - Urinary output < 0.5 mL/kg/hour during two 6 hour blocks|
|Stage 3|- Serum creatinine increase > 3 times baseline <br/> - Serum creatinine increase > 4.0 mg/dL (353 mcmol/L) <br/> - Initiation of RRT <br/> - Urinary output < 0.3 mL/kg/hour during > 24 hours <br/> - Anuria for > 12 hours.|

### A comparison of RIFLE with and without urine output criteria for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^115WftEP]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

Use of RIFLE without the urine criteria significantly:

- underscores the incidence of AKI,

- underscores severity of AKI,

- delays the diagnosis of AKI,

- is associated with higher mortality

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^115BhpEW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

20 Creatinine clearance can be performed in collection periods of one to 24 hours, although longer collection times increase the likelihood of errors related to inaccurate time recording and incomplete collection. 6 A cohort study of 484 patients in the ICU found that four-hour creatinine clearance testing is a valid measurement of acute kidney injury. A decrease of greater than 33% in the first 12 hours conferred a twofold elevated risk of dialysis or death.
20. FLUID RESUSCITATION An assessment of volume status and hemodynamic stability is a key component in the management of patients with acute kidney injury because fluid overload is associated with increased mortality. 25 Consequently, a delicate balance exists between optimizing renal perfusion and avoiding fluid overload.

26 If fluid resuscitation is indicated, isotonic crystalloids are recommended over colloids as the initial therapy. 7, 27, 28 Excess chloride may be associated with worsening renal function and acid-base disturbances. 29 A prospective study of patients in the ICU found that a chloride-restrictive strategy for resuscitation was associated with a lower incidence of acute kidney injury and need for renal replacement therapy. If metabolic derangements from acute kidney injury do not respond to conservative treatment, renal replacement therapy, in consultation with a nephrologist, may be required. Table 7 includes indications for initiating renal replacement therapy.

7, 35–37 A multicenter RCT of 488 patients with acute kidney injury and septic shock compared early initiation of renal replacement therapy with delayed initiation and found no difference in 90-day mortality.
38. FOLLOW-UP The transition from the hospital to the outpatient setting presents an opportunity to improve the care of patients with acute kidney injury. Follow-up three months after hospitalization is reasonable if renal function is recovered, with earlier follow-up intervals for patients with a slower recovery. Prognosis Stage 3 acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy is associated with mortality rates between 44% and 52%.

### Intrinsic acute renal failure… [^1176j9hQ]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

2 Renal injury evolves during the initiation phase, which lasts hours to days. In the maintenance phase, which lasts days to weeks, the glomerular filtration rate reaches its nadir and urine output is at its lowest. The recovery phase lasts days, often beginning with post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. Hypovolemia from excess urine output is a concern during this phase. Despite recovery of urine production, patients can still have difficulty with uremia and homeostasis of electrolytes and acid because tubular function is not completely recovered. Diligent monitoring is indicated throughout all phases of acute tubular necrosis. General Treatment of Acute Renal Failure Initial treatment should focus on correcting fluid and electrolyte balances and uremia while the cause of acute renal failure is being sought. A volume-depleted patient is resuscitated with saline. More often, however, volume overload is present, especially if patients are oliguric or anuric.

Furosemide administered intravenously every six hours is the initial treatment for volume overload. Depending on whether the patient takes furosemide regularly, the initial dose can be between 20 and 100 mg. If an inadequate response occurs in one hour, the dose is doubled. This process is repeated until adequate urine output is achieved. A continuous furosemide drip may be required. The last resort is ultrafiltration via dialysis. The main electrolyte disturbances in the acute setting are hyperkalemia and acidosis. The aggressiveness of treatment depends on the degree of hyperkalemia and the changes seen on the electrocardiogram. Intravenously administered calcium is cardioprotective and temporarily reverses the neuromuscular effects of hyperkalemia. Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL. Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

1, 7 Acute tubular necrosis has three phases: initiation, maintenance, and recovery. After the initial insult to the kidneys, the maintenance phase typically lasts one to two weeks. During the recovery phase, there may be marked diuresis and a slow return of kidney function. To date, no therapy has been shown to hasten recovery from acute tubular necrosis. All patients received an infusion of 0. 9 percent normal saline. Within 48 hours of the procedure, serum creatinine levels increased by more than 25 percent in 12 of 98 patients in the saline-only group and in four of 102 patients in the acetylcysteine group. A third study 22 showed that preprocedural acetylcysteine was neither helpful nor harmful.

DOPAMINE A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 23 of low-dose dopamine therapy was conducted in patients with clinical evidence of early renal dysfunction who met two criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In this study, 328 patients from 23 ICUs were assigned to receive dopamine or placebo. The primary endpoint was elevation of the serum creatinine level during the infusion. The main outcome measures were all-cause hospital mortality, nonrecovery of renal function, or both. Diuretic use in these higher risk patients was associated with a significant risk of death or nonrecovery of renal function. In the patients who survived one week past the initial nephrology consultation, the risk of death and nonrecovery of renal function was significantly increased.

SODIUM BICARBONATE A recent placebo-controlled trial 28 involving 119 patients found an absolute risk reduction of 11. 9 percent and a relative risk of
0. 13 for elevated serum creatinine levels in patients who were given a sodium bicarbonate infusion before a radiocontrast-media procedure compared with those who were given only saline. This single-center study was stopped early because of the degree of benefit demonstrated for sodium bicarbonate infusion.
