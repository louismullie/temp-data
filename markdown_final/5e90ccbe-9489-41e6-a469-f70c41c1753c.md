## Question

Can it also be patellar tendinitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it could be patellar tendinitis, and how to distinguish it from patellofemoral pain and other anterior knee pain sources. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical diagnostic criteria that separate patellar tendinopathy from patellofemoral pain. Next, I will review key differentials and when imaging helps. After that, I need to check the recommended first-line management and timelines. Finally, I will consider special populations and red flags that might change the diagnosis or urgency of care [^111HdNQv] [^115nYyBS] [^112oh51m].

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. Wait, let me verify the current consensus: the preferred term is patellar tendinopathy, not patellar tendinitis, because the condition is primarily degenerative with minimal inflammatory cells rather than an inflammatory tendinitis, so "tendinopathy" more accurately reflects the histopathology and guides treatment choices away from anti-inflammatory monotherapy [^1145jkc8] [^114jVcUN] [^113qqNm9].

> I will now examine the clinical hallmarks that distinguish patellar tendinopathy from patellofemoral pain. Patellar tendinopathy typically presents with focal pain localized to the inferior pole of the patella or proximal patellar tendon, load-dependent pain that worsens with energy-storage activities like jumping or sprinting, tenderness to palpation at the inferior patellar pole or tendon, and pain reproduced with a single-leg decline squat or the Royal London hospital test, whereas patellofemoral pain is more diffuse retropatellar or peripatellar pain aggravated by activities loading the patellofemoral joint in flexion such as squatting, stairs, or prolonged sitting, often with a positive patellar tilt test and without focal tendon tenderness [^117XzNpX] [^1173BAcb] [^111HdNQv] [^115R6K8C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the differential diagnosis so I don't miss mimics. Quadriceps tendinopathy causes pain at the superior patellar pole and is provoked by resisted quadriceps contraction, infrapatellar bursitis produces localized swelling and tenderness superficial or deep to the patellar tendon and can mimic patellar tendinopathy, fat pad impingement worsens with knee extension and has posteriorly displaced inferior patella, and in adolescents I need to consider traction apophysitis at the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter) or inferior patella (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson), which are self-limited growth-plate disorders rather than true tendinopathy [^112XRXEE] [^113ZcVJG] [^1119mYPa] [^112oh51m].

> Next, I should review when imaging adds value. Initially, I thought ultrasound might be the gold standard, but wait, I should verify that; MRI remains the reference for many intra-articular and complex extensor mechanism pathologies, while ultrasound is practical, cost-effective, and accurate for detecting tendon thickening, hypoechogenicity, and neovascularity, and can be used to confirm patellar tendinopathy when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain or when there is no improvement after a structured exercise program, so I should correct myself and say ultrasound is an excellent first-line imaging adjunct rather than the gold standard [^115cKhmg] [^117XzNpX] [^115HUU24].

> Let me consider the recommended management pathway and timelines, and I need to ensure I align with guideline-based care. First-line treatment for patellar tendinopathy is exercise therapy, ideally supervised, for at least 12 weeks, using a progressive loading approach such as heavy slow resistance or staged programs that start with pain modulation and load management, progress to strength, then energy-storage and sport-specific phases; additional conservative treatments or injections are reserved only if there is no clinically relevant improvement after 12 weeks, and surgery is considered only after at least 6 months of comprehensive conservative care and when imaging confirms persistent pathology, with shared decision-making about uncertain benefits [^111qJXH8] [^116rtGb1] [^114p8aoB] [^115uEquG].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence for exercise versus other modalities. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses consistently support eccentric or progressive tendon-loading exercise as foundational therapy, with moderate to low certainty evidence and no clear superiority of surgery over exercise at 12 months in small randomized trials, reinforcing that exercise should be prioritized before invasive options, though some adjuncts like hyaluronic acid injections may be considered selectively if loading alone fails after 12 weeks [^111NDXsd] [^111PxgcH].

> But wait, what if the patient is an adolescent or has atypical features; I need to check for age-specific considerations. In children and adolescents, traction apophysitis at the tibial tubercle or inferior patella is common and should be distinguished from true patellar tendinopathy, as management and prognosis differ; also, I should remember that asymptomatic tendon abnormalities on imaging are not rare in athletes, so imaging must be interpreted in clinical context to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^112oh51m] [^114CC9mR].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Given the focal inferior pole tendon pain, load-dependent symptoms with jumping, and focal tenderness, the diagnosis is patellar tendinopathy rather than patellar tendinitis, and I should avoid anti-inflammatory monotherapy while initiating a structured, progressive loading program with clear 12-week checkpoints and shared decision-making about adjuncts or imaging if progress stalls, documenting outcomes with validated tools like VISA-P to track clinically relevant change [^1145jkc8] [^112qcZQA] [^111qJXH8] [^114p8aoB].

It can be patellar tendinitis (jumper's knee) if the pain is **localized to the inferior pole of the patella** [^1173BAcb] and worsens with **jumping, landing, or squatting** [^114jVcUN]. Diagnosis is clinical [^117XzNpX], supported by tenderness at the inferior patellar pole and pain on a single-leg decline squat [^117XzNpX]; ultrasound can confirm tendon thickening or hypoechogenicity if needed [^112b4Cg8] [^114bMyLs]. Differentiate from patellofemoral pain (diffuse retropatellar pain, worse with stairs/sitting) [^111HdNQv] and other causes of anterior knee pain [^116W4zw6]. Management is **load management and progressive eccentric/strength training** [^116rtGb1]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases after 6–12 months of conservative care [^115uEquG] [^111NDXsd].

## Clinical features of patellar tendinitis

Patellar tendinitis presents with **characteristic clinical features**:

- **Pain location**: Localized to the inferior pole of the patella (patellar tendon origin) [^1173BAcb].
- **Pain characteristics**: Load-dependent [^117XzNpX]; worsens with jumping, landing, or squatting and improves with rest [^1173BAcb].
- **Palpation**: Tenderness at the inferior patellar pole or proximal patellar tendon [^112b4Cg8].
- **Functional tests**: Pain reproduced with single-leg decline squat or Royal London Hospital test [^117XzNpX].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical tests

The diagnosis of patellar tendinitis is primarily clinical, supported by specific tests:

| **Clinical test** | **Description** | **Diagnostic utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Palpation | Tenderness at inferior patellar pole or proximal patellar tendon | High sensitivity [^notfound] |
| Single-leg decline squat | Pain reproduced during squatting on a declined surface | High specificity [^notfound] |
| Royal London Hospital test | Pain with resisted knee extension at 30° flexion | Moderate specificity [^notfound] |

---

Imaging is not routinely required but can support the diagnosis when uncertainty remains. Ultrasound demonstrates tendon thickening, hypoechogenicity, and neovascularity [^112b4Cg8] [^114bMyLs]; MRI shows increased signal intensity and structural changes in chronic cases [^113mUSS7].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Patellar tendinitis must be differentiated from other causes of anterior knee pain:

- **Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**: Diffuse retropatellar or peripatellar pain, worse with stairs, prolonged sitting, or squatting [^115R6K8C] [^1164X9Ct].
- **Quadriceps tendinopathy**: Pain at the superior patellar pole, aggravated by resisted quadriceps contraction [^112XRXEE].
- **Infrapatellar bursitis**: Localized swelling and tenderness over the infrapatellar bursa [^113ZcVJG].
- **Fat pad impingement**: Pain worsened by knee extension, prolonged standing, or kneeling [^1119mYPa].
- **Osgood-Schlatter disease**: Adolescents with pain at tibial tubercle, associated with growth spurts [^112oh51m].

---

## Risk factors and predisposing conditions

Several factors increase the risk of patellar tendinitis:

- **Athletic activity**: Repetitive jumping, landing, or sprinting (e.g. basketball, volleyball, soccer) [^114jVcUN].
- **Training errors**: Sudden increases in training intensity, volume, or frequency [^notfound].
- **Biomechanical factors**: Lower limb malalignment, patellar maltracking, or muscle imbalances [^111hAMYN].
- **Intrinsic factors**: Reduced quadriceps/hamstring flexibility, decreased ankle dorsiflexion, or altered neuromuscular control [^113DHvfL].

---

## Management strategies

Management of patellar tendinitis follows a **stepwise approach**:

- **Load management**: Activity modification to reduce tendon load and avoid aggravating activities [^1173BAcb].
- **Exercise therapy**: Progressive eccentric strengthening (e.g. decline squats), heavy slow resistance training, and isometric exercises are first-line treatments [^116rtGb1] [^111PxgcH].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: NSAIDs, cryotherapy, and taping may provide short-term symptom relief [^115PHERg].
- **Injections**: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or corticosteroid injections may be considered in refractory cases, though evidence is mixed [^115R8yGV] [^113EwGb3].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for chronic, refractory cases after 6–12 months of conservative treatment. Procedures include open or arthroscopic debridement, with variable success rates [^115uEquG] [^111NDXsd].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Patellar tendinitis often has a favorable prognosis with appropriate management, but recurrence is common if underlying risk factors are not addressed. Chronic cases may persist for months to years, significantly impacting athletic performance and daily activities [^113QPXcW].

---

Patellar tendinitis is a common cause of anterior knee pain, especially in athletes involved in jumping sports. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by targeted tests and imaging when needed. Management centers on **load management and progressive strengthening**, with surgery reserved for refractory cases.

Abstract

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary guideline for patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellar tendinopathy (PT) to facilitate clinical decision‐making in primary and secondary care.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert panel identified questions in clinical decision‐making. Based on a systematic literature search, the strength of the scientific evidence was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method and the weight assigned to the considerations by the expert panel together determined the strength of the recommendations.

Results

After confirming PFP or PT as a clinical diagnosis, patients should start with exercise therapy. Additional conservative treatments are indicated only when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes after six (PFP) or 12 (PT) weeks. Pain medications should be reserved for cases of severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery is reserved for very specific cases of nonresponders to exercise therapy and those requiring additional conservative treatments. Although the certainty of evidence regarding exercise therapy for PFP and PT had to be downgraded ('very low GRADE' and 'low GRADE'), the expert panel advocates its use as the primary treatment strategy. The panel further formulated weaker recommendations regarding additional conservative treatments, pain medications, imaging assessments and open surgery ('very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' assessment or absence of scientific evidence).

Conclusion

This guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy for PFP and PT. The recommendations facilitate clinical decision‐making, and thereby optimizing treatment and preventing unnecessary burdens, risks and costs to patients and society.

Level of Evidence

Level V, clinical practice guideline.

Panel selection and scoping questions

In 2019, as part of the preparatory phase of the guideline process, an expert panel was commissioned by the Netherlands Association of Sports Medicine to update and expand the existing 2010 guideline. The panel consisted of representatives from all relevant healthcare disciplines (general practice, occupational medicine, sports medicine, orthopaedic surgery, radiology, podiatry and physical therapy) involved in treating patients with anterior knee pain. The panel received methodological support from the Knowledge Institute of the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists. More information about the selection of the expert panel and declaration of interest is provided in the online Supporting Information. Additionally, a written invitational conference was organized and the involved medical associations were invited to suggest clinical questions for the optimal care of patients with anterior knee pain. The patient's perspective was clarified through a survey of patients with PFP and PT for inclusion in the recommendations. In cooperation with the panel, the Dutch Patient Federation (Nederlandse Patienten Federatie [NPF]) developed an online survey assessing patient characteristics, pros and cons, and levels of satisfaction with treatment options in primary and secondary care. Data were collected from patients with PFP and PT, between January and April 2020. Based on the results of this preparatory phase, eight major clinical questions were prioritized. These clinical questions addressed uncertainties related to diagnosing PT, the value of exercise therapy including additional conservative treatments, the role of pain medications and indications for open surgery regarding PFP and PT. Each clinical question was developed within distinct guideline Modules and Scoping Questions (Figure 1). After presenting the scoping question, each module contains relevant background, results of the evidence review, rationale and, finally, the recommendations.

Figure 1
Modules and Scoping Questions. Overview of the eight distinct guideline Modules and Scoping Questions for PFP and PT. PFP, patellofemoral pain; PT, patellar tendinopathy.

Other conditions that can result in anterior knee pain, such as specific intraarticular pathologies (chondral defects, patellofemoral osteoarthritis [OA]), patellar instability or recurrent patellar dislocation, fractures, tendinopathies other than PT, apophysitis, bursitis or referred pain from the hip, were not covered.

Module 4: 'Diagnosing PT'

Scoping question: How is PT correctly diagnosed?

Background: The diagnosis of PT is mainly based on patient history and physical examination. Patients typically report local load‐dependent pain at the inferior pole of the patella. PFP and OA are common differential diagnoses. The diagnostic accuracy of patient history and physical examination, as well as the additional value of imaging assessments, remains unclear.

Evidence review: Two studies on physical examinations were included ('very low GRADE').

Rationale: Owing to the absence of literature on the diagnostic value of patient history, recommendations are based on a consensus paper and the opinions of the expert panel. When considering additional imaging assessment, diagnostic ultrasound emerges as the most suitable and readily accessible technique.

Recommendations:

The following criteria should be used for a correct clinical diagnosis of PT: o Load‐dependent pain at the inferior pole of the patella; and… ▪… a positive palpation test for pain at the inferior patellar pole and/or… ▪… a positive Royal London hospital test and/or… ▪… pain at the inferior patellar pole during the single leg decline squat.
Additional imaging assessments should be undertaken as a confirmatory test when uncertainty remains regarding the correct clinical diagnosis of PT or in the absence of clinically relevant changes after 12 weeks of exercise therapy (Module 5: 'Exercise therapy for PT').
The patient should be informed of the lack of evidence regarding additional imaging assessments and the possible extra financial burden. *

Evidence review

Regarding the eight predefined modules and scoping questions (Figure 1), a detailed description of the systematic literature search and selection strategy, as well as the assessment of the risk of bias of individual studies, can be found under 'Construction of modules' in the module section in the online Supporting Information. This guideline was developed based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method was used to rate the certainty of the evidence (Table 1).

Table 1
GRADE classification.

The strength of the scientific evidence and the weight assigned to the considerations by the expert panel together determine the strength of the recommendations. In accordance with the GRADE method, a low GRADE value of conclusions in the systematic literature analysis does not preclude a strong recommendation a priori; weak recommendations are also possible with a high GRADE value. Moreover, the strength of a recommendation is always determined by weighing all the relevant arguments. The evidence review and study selection for each module are presented in the online Supporting Information.

Consensus process

The expert panel considered pain and function as critical outcome measures and return to sports/work, duration of absenteeism and patient satisfaction as important outcome measures for decision‐making. The expert panel met in person and online, and the panel chair (SvB) ensured that all members had equal and uninhibited votes. Every module, including the final recommendations, was discussed with all members of the expert panel to create a unanimous recommendation. During the commentary and authorization phases, the draft guideline was submitted to all medical associations involved, as well as the NPF and other relevant stakeholders. These associations provided comments that were viewed and processed by the expert panel. The final version of the guideline was approved by all involved medical associations. The literature conclusions, considerations and summaries with tables and/or figures per module are presented in the online Supporting Information.

DISCUSSION

After ruling out other clinical conditions and confirming PFP or PT as a clinical diagnosis, this guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy preferably [partly] under the supervision of a physical therapist and following this treatment for 6 (PFP) to 12 (PT) weeks. Additional conservative treatments are only indicated when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes and pain medications should be reserved for exceptional cases of severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery is reserved for very specific cases, which do not respond to exercise therapy or additional conservative treatments (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Evidence‐based clinical approaches for PFP and PT. Optimal treatment and timelines with exercise therapy as the cornerstone in the first 6 and 12 weeks for PFP and PT, respectively. Pain medications may play a role in this first part in cases with severe pain, with additional conservative treatments only when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes. Due to the limited additional value of imaging assessments for PT, its use should be considered only after 12 weeks. Reconsider diagnosis after 12 weeks (PFP and PT) and open surgery is reserved for very specific cases only. PFP, patellofemoral pain; PT, patellar tendinopathy.

An innovative aspect of this guideline is that criteria and explicit timelines have been established to clarify when clinically relevant changes can and should be expected. The expert panel delineated clinically relevant changes as measurable changes on accepted patient‐reported outcome measures, including a minimum of 10 points on the AKPS or 16 points on the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Scale‐Patella. The limited additional value of other conservative treatments, pain medications, imaging assessments and open surgery has been highlighted to support shared decision‐making. A systematic approach to making clinical practice recommendations was adopted using the AGREE II instrument and GRADE method. The process of development of this guideline revealed relevant knowledge gaps, such as the parameters of exercise therapy and the added value of additional conservative treatments, medications and open surgery. An in‐depth discussion of the results for each scoping question can be found in the online Supporting Information.

### Patellar tendinopathy: clinical diagnosis, load management, and advice for challenging case presentations [^1173BAcb]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis The hallmark features of patellar tendinopathy are (1) pain localized to the inferior pole of the patella and (2) load-related pain that increases with the demand on the knee extensors, notably in activities that store and release energy in the patellar tendon. While imaging may assist in differential diagnosis, the diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy remains clinical, as asymptomatic tendon pathology may exist in people who have pain from other anterior knee sources. A thorough examination is required to diagnose patellar tendinopathy and contributing factors. Management of patellar tendinopathy should focus on progressively developing load tolerance of the tendon, the musculoskeletal unit, and the kinetic chain, as well as addressing key biomechanical and other risk factors. Rehabilitation can be slow and sometimes frustrating. This review aims to assist clinicians with key concepts related to examination, diagnosis, and management of patellar tendinopathy. Difficult clinical presentations (eg, highly irritable tendon, systemic comorbidities) as well as common pitfalls, such as unrealistic rehabilitation time frames and overreliance on passive treatments, are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Anterior knee pain is one of the most common presentations of knee pain affecting adolescents and adults, particularly in physically active populations. In 2010, the Netherlands Association of Sports Medicine published a monodisciplinary guideline for patellofemoral pain (PFP). Since then, progress in the scientific literature (e.g. consensus statements and other monodisciplinary guidelines) has led to an increased awareness of the need for a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of physical therapists, podiatrists and orthopaedic surgeons. Furthermore, the previous guideline focused only on PFP; patellar tendinopathy (PT) was not covered.

Although PFP and PT appear to have an unfavourable long‐term prognosis, no multidisciplinary evidence‐based guidelines exist. In clinical practice, patients should be advised about optimal treatment and timelines. Moreover, in addition to scientific evidence, patient expectations and values are important to include in treatment guidelines. Therefore, a clinical approach for treating anterior knee pain based on evidence and patient information is necessary.

This study aimed to develop a multidisciplinary evidence‐based guideline to facilitate clinical decision‐making, diagnosis and treatment of PFP and PT for healthcare providers involved in the treatment of these patients and working in primary and secondary care.

Module 8: 'Open surgery for PFP and PT'

Scoping question: What is the value of open surgery for patients with PFP and PT?

Background: When PFP and PT are unresponsive to conservative treatments, patients are sometimes referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, potential supplementary diagnostics and appraisal of indications for surgical treatment. The Dutch Guideline on Knee Arthroscopy recommends not performing arthroscopy for PFP and exercising caution in performing arthroscopy for PT. However, the role of open surgery in the surgical treatment of PFP and PT remains unclear.

Evidence review: No studies have been conducted on open surgery for PFP. One systematic review of open surgery for PT was included ('low GRADE').

Rationale: Recommendations of the expert panel were based solely on clinical expertise. Imaging assessments (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) are obligatory and should be evaluated for post‐traumatic, degenerative, or congenital morphological causes of PFP. When open surgery for PT is indicated, the expert panel recommends magnetic resonance imaging assessment to confirm the exact location and degree of patellar tendon abnormalities before surgery.

Recommendations:

Initially, PFP and PT should only be treated with non‐operative treatments for at least 6 months (see Module 2: 'Exercise therapy for PFP', Module 3: 'Additional conservative treatments for PFP', Module 5: 'Exercise for PT' and Module 6: 'Additional conservative treatments for PT').
Surgery should only be considered when conservative treatment fails; the variable and unpredictable outcomes and potential risks of open surgery for PFP and PT should be discussed, and shared decision‐making should be employed when choosing the treatment.
Open surgery should be considered only when, following at least 6 months of non‐operative treatments, including exercise therapy, the patient continues to experience persistent and disabling symptoms and functional limitations, and o Anatomical morphology is determined to be the cause of persistent PFP confirmed by imaging assessments or o PT is confirmed by imaging assessments.

METHODS

Terminology

According to the 2016 Manchester statement, PFP is the most preferred term and is defined as 'pain around or behind the patella, which is aggravated by at least one activity that loads the patellofemoral joint during weight bearing on a flexed knee'. PT is characterized by tenderness on palpation and load‐dependent pain at the inferior pole of the patella. According to the 2019 International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium Consensus, 'tendinopathy is the preferred term for persistent tendon pain and loss of function related to mechanical loading'. Consistency in the use of terms and definitions in communication between healthcare providers and patients reduces unnecessary confusion and increases the therapeutic alliance. Therefore, in this guideline, the terms 'patellofemoral pain' and 'patellar tendinopathy' are used.

### Patellar tendinopathy: diagnosis and treatment [^114jVcUN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patellar tendinopathy is a common cause of pain in athletes' knees. Historically, it has been related to jumping sports, such as volleyball and basketball. Repetitive jumping generates a considerable load of energy in the extensor mechanism, leading to symptoms. The main pathophysiologic phenomenon in patellar tendinopathy is tendinosis, which is a degenerative disorder rather than an inflammatory disorder; therefore, the other popular term for this disease, tendinitis, is not appropriate. The nonsurgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy is focused on eccentric exercises and often has good results. Other experimental options, with variable levels of evidence, are available for recalcitrant cases. Surgical treatment is indicated for cases that are refractory to nonsurgical treatment. Open or arthroscopic surgery can be performed; the two methods are comparable, but arthroscopic surgery results in a faster recovery time.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^113WzQqr]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses–NMAs' (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines.

Our population, intervention, comparator and outcomes (PICO) were defined as follows:

P: patients with patellar tendinopathy.

I: any treatment modality for patellar tendinopathy.

C: any other treatment modality, placebo or no treatment.

O: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or equivalent for pain (primary outcome) and Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Patellar (VISA-P; secondary outcome).

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design of any type and compared treatment modalities for patellar tendinopathy with other treatment modalities, placebo or no treatment. Additionally, at least one of our preset outcome measures had to be included in the study. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy of any duration and severity with or without radiological confirmation. Duration of the condition was not a criterion and neither were previous treatments and follow-up. Inclusion of special populations (eg, athletes) was not an exclusion criterion and was not considered in analyses, provided that their proportion in the treatment groups was comparable.

Non-randomised comparative studies, observational studies, case reports, case series, literature reviews, published conference abstracts and studies published in languages other than English were excluded.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^111h22Qe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The expert panel advocates for the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the first choice of pain medication in select cases of patients with PFP and PT; however, no evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of this specific drug and no evidence for the use of this drug during training is available. Although the expert panel currently sees no role for injection therapy, including cell therapies, in the management of patients with PT, available evidence suggests that this perspective may change in the future with the emergence of RCTs featuring larger sample sizes and long‐term follow‐ups.

Patients with PFP or PT also reported receiving a whole range of conservative treatments (additional to exercise therapy or as stand‐alone treatments), while our literature research regarding these treatments concluded that scientific evidence for these additional treatments is either absent or had a 'very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' (online Supporting Information modules 'Additional conservative treatments' and 'Pain medications' for PFP and PT). Therefore, the expert panel formulated weaker recommendations regarding these interventions. Despite the absence of scientific evidence for open surgery, the expert panel felt an urgent need to formulate a cautious but decisive recommendation for an orthopaedic assessment to ascertain the indication for open surgery. This is reserved for nonresponders to diligent exercise therapy or exercise therapy plus additional conservative treatments for at least six months. In cases of distinct anatomical pathology, such as central patellar tendon necrosis, more prompt surgical intervention may be warranted.

### MR imaging of anterior knee pain: a pictorial essay [^115JbL5B]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pathology is a frequent cause of joint pain and limitation of function and mobility among patients presenting to an orthopaedic department. Proper recognition and treatment of pathologic conditions depend on the knowledge of normal anatomy and of the various abnormalities, which affect this area of the knee and may present with anterior knee pain. A broad array of benign and malignant processes may be manifested as anterior knee discomfort, and this common clinical entity is among the most frequent indications for MR imaging of the lower extremities. Clinical history and physical examination are also of paramount importance. The disorders can be categorized and differentiated primarily according to their location. Traumatic or non-traumatic disorders of the patella, patellar retinacula, quadriceps and patellar tendons and supra or infrapatellar fat pad can be the source of symptoms. This article includes a comprehensive pictorial essay of the characteristic MR features of common and uncommon disorders causing anterior knee pain. For accurate assessment of the aforementioned clinical problem, a radiologist should be able to identify typical MR imaging patterns that contribute in establishing the correct diagnosis and thus tailoring the appropriate therapy.

Tendinopathy

Background: Tendinopathy is characterized by pain and dysfunction in a tendon, commonly due to excessive load or strain. In active patients and athletes, overuse can lead to chronicity. The most common tendinopathy in the knee is of the patellar tendon, is colloquially known as "jumper's knee" since it is commonly seen in jumping athletes, and can lead to microtears at the tendon insertion at the distal pole.
Diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis is based on history and physical exam. Patients with patellar tendinopathy present with anterior knee pain that is worse with activity, tenderness to palpation at the inferior pole of the patella. Other tendinopathies present with tenderness to palpation and pain at the tendon insertion site with activation of the muscle. Radiologic imaging will be normal. Ultrasound can assist in confirming diagnosis and will show loss of the normal fibrillar pattern, increased spacing between fibrillar lines, and generally reduced echogenicity.MRI will show increased signal at the tendon insertion.
Treatment: Pain secondary to tendinopathy is treated symptomatically in the acute phase – this includes NSAIDs and physical therapy with a progressive loading program. Additional adjuncts for pain control such as cryotherapy, peritendinous injection with corticosteroids or platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be considered if the pain fails to respond to NSAIDs and PT and/or the pain persists beyond the acute phase. Ultrasound-guided needle tenotomy, percutaneous needle scraping, and high volume injection, and stem cells are at the forefront of regenerative medicine for tendinopathy and are currently being evaluated. If non-invasive management fails, surgical intervention would be the next step.

### Traumatic patellar tendinopathy [^1143LUoy]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

In patellar tendinopathy, there is anterior knee pain with tenderness of the attachment of the patellar tendon over the lower pole of the patella. The condition is commonly associated with athletic overuse, but we have encountered it in some patients following direct blunt trauma to the anterior aspect of the knee. We describe the history and management of patients with traumatic patellar tendinopathy.

Method

Between April 2000 and August 2006, we managed eight otherwise healthy well trained athletes who developed signs and symptoms compatible with classical patellar tendinopathy after a direct trauma to the anterior aspect of the patellar tendon during sport activity.

Results

The clinical diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy was confirmed clinically and at imaging by MRI and ultrasound scans. Patients responded to conservative or surgical management, in the same way as patellar tendinopathy secondary to overuse.

Conclusion

A single direct traumatic event can lead to chronic tendon problems. Hence, in addition to overuse injury, patellar tendinopathy can follow a direct trauma and exhibit the same clinical features. Further research is required to better understand the pathophysiology of the clinical condition.

### Patellofemoral pain [^111HdNQv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain — differential diagnosis and screening: Clinicians should refer to the hip pain and mobility deficits — hip OA CPG to determine the presence of hip OA when hip OA has been reported to present with a primary complaint of knee pain, and should use information from the patient's age, history, provocative activities, and physical examination test results to screen for the presence of other possible causes of AKP including patellar tendinopathy, patellar subluxation or dislocation (instability), tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion), and patellar apophysitis (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease). Persons with iliotibial band syndrome often present with tenderness and localized swelling over the lateral femoral epicondyle that is provoked by palpation of the lateral femoral epicondyle. Pain from patellar tendinopathy is typically localized to the inferior pole of the patella or near the tibial tubercle, may be differentiated from PFP by pain located over the patellar tendon, tenderness to palpation of the patellar tendon, and symptom response, and is aggravated by activities that require higher rates of knee extensor loading, such as jumping or high-speed sprinting. Clinicians should refer to the consensus statement written by the international patellofemoral osteoarthritis consortium for clinical symptoms and signs to screen for the presence of PFOA. Anterior knee pain in children may be due to apophysitis of the tibial tubercle or the inferior pole of the patella, and clinicians should use the patient's age and the presence of tenderness to palpation over these sites to determine the presence of these conditions.

Epidemiology and Pathophysiology

Patellar tendinopathy (PT), sometimes referred to as patellar tendinosis, patellar tendinitis, or Jumper knee, is a common cause of anterior knee pain that affects up to 14% of athletes and is most prevalent in jumping sports, such as basketball and volleyball. Although Jumper knee has been used as a blanket term to include a range of conditions, such as pain at the insertion of the quadriceps tendon, pain at the distal patellar pole, and pain at the tibial tubercle, PT is more specifically used to describe pain secondary to the insertion of the patellar tendon at the distal pole of the patella and is the focus of this review. In addition, studies have demonstrated that rather than an inflammatory condition indicated by the term tendinitis, it is a chronic degenerative condition that results from microtears and cell death from a repetitive loading of the tendon during cutting, repetitive acceleration, and jumping motions. - Histologically, loss of collagen bundle organization and mucoid degeneration are identified in affected tendons, particularly at the proximal insertion. Hypercellularity, neovascularization, and relative absence of inflammatory cells are common findings as well.

Patellar tendinopathy has been shown to affect men at twice the rate of women and can be an extremely debilitating condition that causes high rates of delayed return to sport and may ultimately be the cause of retirement in more than 50% of athletes with the condition. Besides affecting training and performance levels during competition, PT can lead to persistent pain that affects daily activities and in severe cases can even lead to patellar tendon rupture.

The cause of PT was previously postulated to be secondary to an adaptational change by the tendon in response to compressive forces of the inferior patellar pole on the posterior aspect of the tendon during knee flexion, weakening the tendon over time. However, that theory was never rigorously tested until Lavagnino et aldemonstrated through a biomechanical cadaver study that tendon attenuation was actually a result of tensile forces at the distal pole insertion, as well as a decreased patella-patellar tendon angle causing microdamage at the proximal tendon.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^113UokEd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline has been accessible since 9 May 2022 on the database website of the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists. Furthermore, a 'patient version' developed by the expert panel is available online. The guideline will be partially (scoping questions and modules) or entirely evaluated and updated after 2027. Additional modules with other scoping questions can be added to the guideline at later stages.

The patient perspective was guaranteed by the involvement of the NPF during the preparatory, commentary and authorization phase of the guideline and clarified by means of the NPF survey. However, the patients or their representatives did not participate in the panel meetings. Furthermore, the voice of patients with PT may be underrepresented in the NPF survey since only nine patients with PT compared to 43 patients with PFP completed the survey. Additionally, socioeconomic backgrounds or other characteristics of the participants of the NPF survey indicating marginalized groups are unknown. This may have led to the panel's considerations failing to see specific questions and needs of marginalized groups. As a result, recommendations in this guideline may be less appropriate regarding these groups. During future guideline developments, these limitations in involvement of patient participation in general and marginalized groups in particular should be taken into account.

Another limitation worth noting concerns the relatively informal approach employed to achieve consensus within the expert panel. This guideline was formulated in accordance with the internal guideline of the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists (Federatie Medische Specialisten). Throughout the different stages of development of this guideline, all members of the expert panel participated in meetings where rationales and preliminary recommendations were formulated. Subsequent to these meetings, panelists were invited to revisit the rationales and recommendations, with opportunities provided for them to propose modifications. However, it is acknowledged that contemporary standards emphasize the use of more formal methodologies for achieving consensus among groups of experts, citing greater reliability. Informal consensus‐building methods carry the inherent risk of peer pressure influencing individual opinions and may lead to discussions being dominated by a minority of experts. Although the process of formulating rationales and recommendations may lack complete transparency, we assert that the consensus‐building process was equitable and that the integrity of the final recommendations remained intact. Furthermore, the draft guideline was reviewed by all involved parties and finally approved.

Module 5: 'Exercise therapy for PT'

Scoping question: What is the optimal form of exercise therapy for patients with PT?

Background: Treatment of PT using exercise therapy is the most substantiated treatment in the literature; when an adjunct conservative treatment is chosen, it is regularly combined with exercise therapy. However, there is ambiguity regarding the type of exercise therapy that should be administered. Moreover, there is limited knowledge about the effectiveness of different exercise therapy programmes; frequency, intensity, type and time factors; and duration of continued exercise therapy after return to activity (sports/work).

The aim of this module was to elucidate the effectiveness of specific exercise therapy in patients with PT compared to other types of specific exercise therapy or a control group.

Evidence review: Five RCTs were included ('very low GRADE').

Rationale: Despite the low level of evidence, the expert panel advocates for the use of exercise therapy as the first choice for patients with PT. Although there is no 'one size fits all plan', the expert panel suggests the use of a four‐stage treatment plan based on Rudavsky and Cook (2014).

Recommendations:

Use the following four‐step‐treatment‐plan to treat patients with PT(Figure 2): 1 Pain management: Patient education and loading advice. 2 Strength progression: ▪ A progressive resistance exercise programme for the quadriceps should be performed for at least 12 weeks while continuously adjusting exercise intensity for the individual patient. ▪ Heavy slow resistance training is preferred, although different types of training programmes/contractions (e.g. isometric contractions) may be used to minimize the reactive pain response of the patellar tendon. 3 Energy storage/stretch‐shorten cycle: Depending on the type of sport, start with plyometric exercises. 4 Maintenance of muscle strength.
Additional conservative treatments should be considered when, after 12 weeks of thorough exercise therapy (including education and loading advice), no clinically relevant changes occur (Module 6: 'Additional conservative treatments for PT' and Module 7: 'Pain medications for PT').

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^115nYyBS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Bursitis

There are multiple bursas around the knee. Bursa are synovial lined structures that provide a low-friction interface between tissues to provide smooth motion. Bursitis, inflammation of the bursa, can be secondary to repetitive microtrauma from overuse, direct trauma, autoimmune disease including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or infection. Prepatellar bursitis is the most common bursitis of the knee, presenting with anterior knee pain and swelling. Infrapatellar bursitis may also cause anterior knee pain mimicking patellar tendinopathy but can be diagnosed by careful palpation for localized tenderness. In both conditions it is important to differentiate fluid in the bursa from intraarticular effusion. Treatment includes local cryotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID's) and avoidance of further direct trauma to the bursa. If there are any signs of septic bursitis the bursa should be aspirated and appropriate antibiotics prescribed.

Inflammatory disorders

Oligoarticular JIA often presents with monoarticular knee arthritis. Children may present with anterior knee pain but the typical history of morning stiffness, gradual resolution of pain with activity and clinical exam findings usually allow the practitioner to make the correct diagnosis. A complete joint and systemic examination to exclude other joint involvement is important as is screening for asymptomatic uveitis associated with JIA.

The JIA subtype, Enthesitis Related Arthritis, is unique in that it is more common in school-age boys, is frequently associated with the genetic marker HLA-B27 and inflammation of the entheses may be a prominent finding. Enthesitis (inflammation at the attachment of tendons, ligaments and fascia to bone with characteristic pain on palpation) around the knee may be confused with Osgood's Schlatter or Sinding-Larsen Johannsen disease. Enthesitis is usually associated with arthritis and symptoms are more prominent in the morning, which helps to differentiate it from the osteochondroses and traction apophysitis group.

Treatment of arthritis includes physiotherapy for improving range of motion and strength, NSAID's and potentially local intra-articular corticosteroid injection or disease modifying anti-rheumatic therapy. All children and adolescents suspected of having JIA or other chronic inflammatory arthritis should be referred to a pediatric rheumatologist.

Synovial plica

The knee has normal synovial folds that are residual embryonic remnants persisting from when the knee cavity was a septated structure. Occasionally, pathological conditions occur within the plica(e) due to local synovitis caused by acute, direct or repetitive microtrauma. The inflamed plica can become trapped between the patella and the femoral condyle. Impingement can cause further inflammation and fibrosis with abrasion of the femoral condyle, changes in the articular surface and reactive changes in the subchondral bone. Diagnosis is clinical; common complaints are of medial knee pain worsened with running, stair climbing or squatting accompanied by snapping and catching during flexion (usually flexion arc 30–70 degrees). On examination the medial patellar retinaculum from the patella to the medial femoral condyle or anteromedial joint line may be tender. The plica may be palpable as a thickened band that is tender when pressed against the edge of the condyle. Management includes patellar mobilization and massage, flexibility exercises for the hamstrings, quadriceps and gastrocnemius, and anti-inflammatory medications with surgical removal of the plica reserved for recalcitrant symptoms.

Quadriceps tendinopathy

Pain arising at the quadriceps tendon attachment to the patella is uncommon in the pediatric population. On examination there is tenderness at the superior margin of the patella and pain is exacerbated by resisted quadriceps contraction. Treatment includes local massage at the site of pain in addition to the general principles used for patellar tendinopathy.

Bipartite patella

The patella ossifies between 3 and 5 years of age with gradual coalescence of multiple ossification centers. Accessory ossification centres often occur; the most common location is the superolateral patella. A bipartite patella is usually an asymptomatic, incidental radiographic finding. Radiographs show regular smooth fragment margins with no evidence of soft tissue swelling, differentiating the lesion from acute fracture. Occasionally bipartite patella may cause anterior knee pain. Clinically there is soft tissue tenderness at the superolateral pole of the patella. Initial treatment is conservative with modified activity and local flexibility and strengthening exercises. Surgical options include excision or fixation of the bipartite patella or release of the vastus lateralis insertion.

Stress fracture of the patella

Stress fractures of the patella are rare causes of anterior knee pain. In the pediatric population, it is reported in jumping athletes who present with intense localized pain with possible overlying soft tissue swelling. Radiographs will detect chronic stress reaction; early lesions are best detected by radionucleotide bone scan.

### Distinguishing quadriceps tendinopathy and patellar tendinopathy: semantics or significant? [^115E5X5L]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Jumper's knee is not synonymous with patellar tendinopathy. The term includes patellar tendinopathy and quadriceps tendinopathy. Although the patellar and quadriceps tendons work in tandem as part of the extensor mechanism of the knee, they have distinct anatomy and functional roles. As a result, there are probable differences in risk factors, etiology, and response to treatment. It is time to clinically separate patellar tendinopathy and quadriceps tendinopathy and design more specific rehabilitation programs. In this Viewpoint, the authors will (1) provide a rationale for distinguishing the 2 clinical entities-patellar tendinopathy and quadriceps tendinopathy-for treatment decision making, and (2) identify areas of research priority in quadriceps tendinopathy.

### Progression of patellar tendinitis following treatment with platelet-rich plasma: case reports [^113EwGb3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is becoming more attractive given its favourable side effect profile and autologous nature, leading to rapid clinical adoption in the absence of high-level evidence. We are presenting three patients who developed a progression of patellar tendinitis following treatment, which to our knowledge is the first report of worsening of patellar tendinitis following PRP therapy.

Methods

The records of three patients with symptom exacerbation of patellar tendinitis following treatment with PRP were reviewed. IRB exemption was obtained. Clinical and operative records, radiographs, and MR imaging were reviewed for all patients.

Results

Three patients reported to our clinic for a second opinion with symptoms of anterior knee pain consistent with patellar tendinitis. Each patient had previously been treated with PRP therapy due to prolonged symptoms. Clinical and radiological findings following treatment included patellar tendon thickening, worsening pain, discontinuation of athletic participation in all three patients, and osteolysis of the distal pole of the patella in one patient identified during surgical intervention.

Conclusions

Growing interest in the use of autologous products for the management of chronic tendinopathies has led to widespread clinical implementation with minimal scientific support. It is tempting to apply a new treatment for management of a difficult clinical entity, especially when the risk/benefit ratio appears favourable. However, caution must be exercised as unexpected results may be encountered.

Common causes of chronic anterior knee pain

Pain receptors are present within several knee structures, including the patella, synovium, fat pad, tendon, subchondral bone, and quadriceps retinaculum. Any of these structures, individually or in combination, can cause anterior knee pain. Most causes of anterior knee pain involve the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. The term anterior knee pain is often used interchangeably with patellofemoral pain. Previous literature has also interchanged the term "chondromalacia patella" with anterior knee pain but this is now out of favor; chondromalacia patella is a surgical finding not a diagnosis. Patients with anterior knee pain do not necessarily have chondromalacia patella and patients with chondromalacia do not uniformly have pain. Anterior knee pain may be caused by conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton including hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthe's disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansen disease). Anterior knee pain is occasionally caused by serious underlying systemic disease including inflammatory conditions and malignancies.

Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common knee problem presenting to primary care physicians. Patellofemoral syndrome is a non-specific descriptive term used to describe pain in and around the patella.

Epidemiology

PFP affects active and non-active children, is more common in girls and is most common during the adolescent growth spurt. Up to 30% of all visits to sports medicine practitioners are for anterior knee pain. Incidence rates of 7% and 10% have been reported in young male and female athletes respectively. Symptoms usually affect both knees with one side more symptomatic than the other.

Etiology

The etiology of PFP is unclear. There are currently two main theories: malalignment of the patella relative to the femoral trochlea with resultant articular cartilage abnormalities, and excessive mechanical loading and chemical irritation of local nerve endings with resultant peripatellar synovitis. Soft tissue tightness is common during the adolescent growth spurt with resultant inflexibilities altering the stress through the patellofemoral joint. Acute trauma, repetitive microtrauma/overuse and malalignment all can lead to increased strain on the peripatellar soft tissues or increased patellofemoral joint stress.

Data extraction — handling

The primary author (DC) extracted the key characteristics of each eligible article and inserted in tables in Microsoft Word to facilitate analysis and presentation.

For the presentation of results, outcomes were divided into short term (≤ 12-week follow-up), mid-term (˃12 weeks– ≤ 12-month follow-up) and long term (˃12 months follow-up). All short-term follow-up time points were converted to weeks and mid-term follow-up time points to months for consistency and easier analysis.

Comparisons of interventions reported by two or more studies at similar follow-up time points were pooled quantitatively by pairwise meta-analyses in the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity. Raw mean differences (MD) with their accompanying 95% CI were calculated and used in the tests as the tools used across studies were the same. Finally, an NMA was conducted for both outcome measures (pain VAS and VISA-P) at each follow-up period where adequate data existed.

Where pain results were reported in different settings (eg, at rest, at night, during sports) in studies, pain during sports was preferentially used. Placebo/sham treatment was considered as no treatment in both the pairwise and NMAs.

Results

Study characteristics

Online supplemental table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies. A total of 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were found to be eligible, including 1332 patients (1407 tendons) with patellar tendinopathy (mean age 29.2 years). The majority of patients had chronic tendinopathy (> 3 months) and the mean duration of symptoms, where stated, was 25.7 months (range 1–120 months). The included studies assessed 33 interventions that were applied alone or in combination with other interventions. Follow-up ranged from immediate postintervention follow-up to 53 months. The most frequent follow-up time points were 12 and 24–26 weeks. Two studies only assessed immediate postintervention outcomes. All but 5 of the included studies included pain as an outcome; 31 studies used a numerical scale of 0–10 or 0–100 ('VAS' or 'Numerical Rating Scale') and 1 a non-numerical categorical scale. VISA-P was used in 30 studies.

Risk of bias assessment

Online supplemental table 2 shows the risk of bias assessment for each study, with the overall risk of bias as determined by the authors of the present review and justification for the high overall risk of bias decisions. Fifteen studies were considered with low and 22 with a high overall risk of bias.

Findings — pairwise meta-analyses

Online supplemental table 3 illustrates the results of the studies, with pooling where possible (two or more studies comparing the same interventions with results at the same follow-up periods) and the strength of evidence for each outcome measure for the pooled comparisons. Justifications are provided in the table legend for downgrading the strength of evidence where the GRADE tool was used.

The findings of the pooled results from meta-analysed data are presented below. All results based on single studies can be seen in the table and are not discussed further as they are considered to be of limited evidence; those from studies with a low overall risk of bias are underlined.

Patellofemoral instability and patellar subluxation

Patellofemoral dysplasia, whether congenital or acquired, represents a spectrum of disorders characterized by static and dynamic malalignment of the patella relative to the distal femur. Malalignment results in maltracking of the patella with resultant instability and potential osteochondral injury. Four clinical subtypes are recognized based on the degree of malalignment: mild dynamic imbalance of the patella with excessive loading of the lateral patellar and femoral facets (lateral patellar compression syndrome); chronic subluxing patella; recurrent patellar dislocation; and chronic (or obligatory) dislocation of the patella. Patients with patellofemoral instability may complain of anterior knee pain, episodic giving way, locking and catching sensations associated with recurrent effusions. On examination, findings are similar to PFP. Patella alta, tenderness over the medial patella femoral ligament, positive patellar apprehension test or frank lateral dislocation may be elicited. Treatment includes stretching tight lateral structures (vastus lateralis, iliotibial band), strengthening medial structures (VMO), knee orthoses for patellar stabilization, and foot orthoses to correct excessive subtalar pronation. Orthopedic referral and possible surgical management is recommended for recurrent and chronic obligatory patellar dislocation.

Patellar tendinopathy

"Jumper's knee" or patellar tendinopathy is a common cause of infrapatellar pain. Pain is usually maximal at the patellar attachment and proximal tendon and is aggravated by jumping or hopping. In children and adolescents the osteochondroses/traction apophysitis Osgood-Schlatter (OSD) and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson (SLJD) disease commonly present with pain at the attachments of the patellar tendon. (See osteochondroses section below) PFP is commonly associated with patellar tendinopathy. On examination there is local tenderness over the patellar tendon; thickening or nodules may be palpable. There may be abnormalities of the PF joint. Treatment requires load reduction (activity modification, biomechanical correction), cryotherapy and progressive eccentric strengthening.

### The pathophysiology of patellofemoral pain: a tissue homeostasis perspective [^113s7y3j]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Fundamental to rational, safe, and effective treatment for any orthopaedic condition is an accurate understanding of the etiology of the symptoms. The decades-old paradigm of a pure structural and biomechanical explanation for the genesis of patellofemoral pain is giving way to one in which biologic factors are being given more consideration. It is increasingly evident that a variable mosaic of possible pathophysiologic processes, often caused by simple overload, best accounts for the etiology of patellofemoral pain in most patients. Inflamed synovial lining and fat pad tissues, retinacular neuromas, increased intraosseous pressure, and increased osseous metabolic activity of the patella all have been documented as contributing to the perception of anterior knee pain. Considered together, these processes can be characterized as loss of tissue homeostasis and can be seen as providing a new and alternative explanation for the conundrum of anterior knee pain. Certain high loading conditions of the patellofemoral joint can be of sufficient magnitude to induce the symptomatic loss of tissue homeostasis so that, once initiated, they may persist indefinitely. From this new biologic perspective, it clinically matters little what structural factors may be present in a given joint (such as chondromalacia, patellar tilt or a Q angle above a certain value) if the pain free condition of tissue homeostasis is safely achieved and maintained.

### Surgery for patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) [^111NDXsd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tendinopathy is an overuse condition that commonly affects athletes. Surgery is usually offered if medical and physical therapies fail to treat it effectively. There is variation in the type of surgery performed for the condition.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgery for patellar tendinopathy in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases, to 17 July 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, clinical trial registries (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared surgical techniques (open or arthroscopic) with non-operative treatment (including placebo surgery, exercise or other non-surgical modalities) in adults with patellar tendinopathy. Major outcomes assessed were knee pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, withdrawal rate, proportion with adverse events and proportion with tendon rupture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Two trials (92 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Participants in both trials were followed for 12 months. Neither trial compared surgery to placebo surgery. One trial (40 randomised participants) compared open surgical excision with eccentric exercises, and the other compared arthroscopic surgery with sclerosing injections (52 randomised participants). Due to the nature of the interventions, neither the participants or the investigators were blinded to the group allocation, resulting in the potential for performance and detection bias. Some outcomes were selectively not recorded, leading to reporting bias. Overall, the certainty of the evidence from these studies was low for all outcomes due to the potential for bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes. Compared with eccentric exercises, low-certainty evidence indicates that open surgical excision provides no clinically important benefits with respect to knee pain, function or global assessment of success. At 12 months, mean knee pain - measured by pain with standing jump on a 10-point scale (lower scores indicating less pain) - was 1.7 points (standard deviation (SD) 1.6) in the eccentric training group and 1.3 (SD 0.8) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%) and a relative reduction in pain of 10% better (ranging from 30% better to 10% worse) in the treatment group. At 12 months, function on the zero- to 100-point Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) scale was 65.7 (SD 23.8) in the eccentric training group and 72.9 (SD 11.7) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute change of 7% better function (ranging from 4% worse to 19% better) and relative change of 25% better (ranging from 15% worse to 65% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 13%). Participant global assessment of success was measured by the number of people with no pain at 12 months: 7/20 participants in the eccentric training group reported no pain, compared with 5/20 in the open surgical group (risk ratio (RR) 0.71 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.88); one trial, 40 participants). There were no withdrawals, but five out of 20 people from the eccentric exercise group crossed over to open surgical excision. Quality of life, adverse events and tendon ruptures were not measured. Compared with sclerosing injection, low-certainty evidence indicates that arthroscopic surgery may provide a reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success, however further studies are likely to change these results. At 12 months, mean pain with activities, measured on a 100-point scale (lower scores indicating less pain), was 41.1 (SD 28.5) in the sclerosing injection group and 12.8 (SD 19.3) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 28% better (ranging from 15% to 42% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%), and a relative change of 41% better (ranging from 21% to 61% better). At 12 months, the mean participant global assessment of success, measured by satisfaction on a 100-point scale (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating greater satisfaction), was 52.9 (SD 32.6) in the sclerosing injection group and 86.8 (SD 20.8) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute improvement of 34% (ranging from 19% to 49%). In both groups, one participant (4%) withdrew from the study. Functional outcome scores, including the VISA score, were not reported. Quality-of-life assessment, adverse events, and specifically the proportion with a tendon rupture, were not reported. We did not perform subgroup analysis to assess differences in outcome between arthroscopic or open surgical excision, as we did not identify more than one study with a common comparator.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if surgery is beneficial over other therapeutic interventions, namely eccentric exercises or injectables. Low-certainty evidence shows that surgery for patellar tendinopathy may not provide clinically important benefits over eccentric exercise in terms of pain, function or participant-reported treatment success, but may provide clinically meaningful pain reduction and treatment success when compared with sclerosing injections. However, further research is likely to change these results. The evidence was downgraded two levels due to the small sample sizes and susceptibility to bias. We are uncertain if there are additional risks associated with surgery as study authors failed to report adverse events. Surgery seems to be embedded in clinical practice for late-stage patella tendinopathy, due to exhaustion of other therapeutic methods rather than evidence of benefit.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: a review [^113jfkda]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 5% of all primary care visits in adults are related to knee pain. Osteoarthritis (OA), patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are among the most common causes of knee pain.

Observations

Knee OA, affecting an estimated 654 million people worldwide, is the most likely diagnosis of knee pain in patients aged 45 years or older who present with activity-related knee joint pain with no or less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness (95% sensitivity; 69% specificity). Patellofemoral pain typically affects people younger than 40 years who are physically active and has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 25%. The presence of anterior knee pain during a squat is approximately 91% sensitive and 50% specific for patellofemoral pain. Meniscal tears affect an estimated 12% of the adult population and can occur following acute trauma (eg, twisting injury) in people younger than 40 years. Alternatively, a meniscal tear may be a degenerative condition present in patients with knee OA who are aged 40 years or older. The McMurray test, consisting of concurrent knee rotation (internal or external to test lateral or medial meniscus, respectively) and extension (61% sensitivity; 84% specificity), and joint line tenderness (83% sensitivity; 83% specificity) assist diagnosis of meniscal tears. Radiographic imaging of all patients with possible knee OA is not recommended. First-line management of OA comprises exercise therapy, weight loss (if overweight), education, and self-management programs to empower patients to better manage their condition. Surgical referral for knee joint replacement can be considered for patients with end-stage OA (ie, no or minimal joint space with inability to cope with pain) after using all appropriate conservative options. For patellofemoral pain, hip and knee strengthening exercises in combination with foot orthoses or patellar taping are recommended, with no indication for surgery. Conservative management (exercise therapy for 4–6 weeks) is also appropriate for most meniscal tears. For severe traumatic (eg, bucket-handle) tears, consisting of displaced meniscal tissue, surgery is likely required. For degenerative meniscal tears, exercise therapy is first-line treatment; surgery is not indicated even in the presence of mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, catching).

Conclusions and Relevance

Knee OA, patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are common causes of knee pain, can be diagnosed clinically, and can be associated with significant disability. First-line treatment for each condition consists of conservative management, with a focus on exercise, education, and self-management.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^1119mYPa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Fat pad irritation/impingement

The infrapatellar fat pad is richly innervated and injury may cause anterior knee pain. Impingement of the infrapatellar fat pad between the patella and the femoral condyle may be secondary to direct trauma or acute hyperextension injury. Chronic irritation may be associated with patellar tendinopathy, patellofemoral syndrome or exposure to recurrent synovitis. Pain is often worsened by knee extension, prolonged standing and kneeling. On examination there is localized tenderness and swelling in the fat pad with posterior displacement of the inferior pole of the patella. Associated predisposing biomechanical factors include genu recurvatum and anterior tilting of the pelvis. Treatment includes local cryotherapy, taping the patella to reduce the amount of tilt and impingement, local muscle flexibility and strengthening, and correcting lower limb biomechanics as in patellofemoral syndrome.

### Layered approach to the anterior knee: normal anatomy and disorders associated with anterior knee pain [^11272xMM]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain is a common complaint that can be caused by a wide spectrum of disorders affecting the many varied tissues at the anterior knee. The anatomy and pathologic conditions of the anterior knee can be approached systematically by organizing the region into four layers: (a) superficial layer of fat, fascia, and bursae; (b) functional layer composed of the extensor mechanism and patellar stabilizers; (c) intracapsular extrasynovial layer containing the fat pads; and (d) intra-articular layer. The superficial layer is composed of delicate tissues that are predisposed to blunt and penetrating trauma, irritation, and infection. The extensor mechanism forms the functional layer, is responsible for knee extension and patellar stabilization, and is engaged in repetitive movements; overuse disorders dominate in this layer. The fat pads of the anterior knee are discussed collectively as an extracapsular extrasynovial layer, functioning to improve congruence and protect the articular surfaces during motion. Diseases involving the fat pads can be primary or secondary to pathologic conditions in the rest of the joint. The synovial lining and cartilage surface are in the fourth and final intra-articular layer; pathologic conditions are centered around arthritides and internal derangement. Symptoms in the anterior knee may be due to conditions affecting one or more of these interrelated layers. © RSNA, 2018.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^113QPXcW]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Patellar tendinopathy describes persistent pain and dysfunction of the patellar tendon related to mechanical loading. It usually occurs as a response to overuse and has a complex, multifactorial pathology. The condition is more common in athletes who participate in sports that involve repetitive loading of the tendon, such as basketball and volleyball. Across all sports, up to 22% of elite athletes report patellar tendon pain at some point during their career. Diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy is clinical, with the patient often describing activity provoked localised tendon pain and stiffness. In the early stages, an individual can often continue activity. However, the pain can progress, resulting in chronic impairment with an average duration of 32 months.

Management can be divided into active and passive modalities. Active strategies mainly involve tendon-loading regimes, of which eccentric training has been the most popular, with a 50%–70% chance of improvement reported at 3–6 months follow-up. Recently, both isometric and heavy slow resistance (HSR) exercises were shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in patellar tendinopathy. There is a multitude of passive treatments for patellar tendinopathy, which include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, iontophoresis, topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), low energy laser therapy and therapeutic ultrasound (US). Surgical intervention is usually considered when non-operative interventions have been unsuccessful. Definitive guidelines on the management of patellar tendinopathy do not currently exist.

We aimed to summarise the available evidence on the management of patellar tendinopathy both with direct comparisons between interventions and by producing treatment ranks with a network meta-analysis (NMA) using direct and indirect comparisons. We expect our findings will inform the formulation of future guidelines and guide further research.

Risk of bias — strength of evidence assessment

The internal validity (freedom from bias) of each included study was assessed with the 'Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomised trials' separately by DC and MB, and a third independent opinion (NLM) was sought where disagreements existed. Overall, studies were characterised as of 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' overall risk of bias with the use of the authors' judgement based on whether they thought the possible bias identified in the subcomponents of the Cochrane tool could have influenced the true results of the study.

The strength of evidence was assessed with the GRADE tool, where the results of two or more studies were pooled in pairwise meta-analyses and with the GRADE-NMA tool for NMAs. Strength of evidence assessment was performed by DC and MB independently and any disagreements were resolved by discussion and involvement of a third assessor (NLM). The strength of evidence of each outcome measure within each comparison was assessed separately. Our recommendations for clinical practice were based on results of either 'high' or 'moderate' strength of evidence with both clinical and statistical significance. Clinical significance was defined as at least 1.5 points difference in pain VAS and 13 points in VISA-P between the compared interventions and these thresholds were also used as the minimal clinically relevant difference (MCRD) as part of the 'imprecision' risk assessment of the GRADE tool.

As part of the GRADE-NMA tool, the certainty of the evidence of the direct estimate was rated first using the overall risk of bias, inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity), indirectness (clinical heterogeneity) and publication bias. Subsequently, the indirect estimate was rated using the lowest ratings of the two direct comparisons forming the most dominant first-order loops and intransitivity (differences in study characteristics of studies used in indirect comparisons). Finally, the network estimate was rated using the highest certainty of evidence between direct and indirect estimates, the incoherence (difference between direct and indirect comparisons — assessed using the 'node splitting' approach) and imprecision.

### Exercise for patellar tendinopathy [^111QXh5C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tendinopathy is a prevalent condition that commonly affects the tendon's origin, causing pain at the front of the knee. The main treatment for patellar tendinopathy involves different types of exercise (e.g. strengthening and stretching). The most common method of strengthening exercise is eccentric (lengthening) muscle loading. Strengthening exercises can be land-based or water-based, weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing, or both. Other treatments include surgery and glucocorticoid injections.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 5 September 2023, with no restrictions by language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of strengthening exercise interventions compared to placebo or sham intervention; no treatment, usual care, or minimal intervention; or other active intervention. Strengthening exercises include concentric, eccentric, eccentric-concentric, and isometric exercises designed to enhance the strength and power of muscles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Major outcomes included pain, function, participant-reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life, return to sport, proportion of participants with adverse events, and proportion of participant withdrawals.

Main Results

We included seven trials (211 participants with chronic patellar tendinopathy) comparing strengthening exercises with no treatment (3 trials, 93 participants), glucocorticoid injection (1 trial, 38 participants), surgery (1 trial, 40 participants), stretching exercise (1 trial, 15 participants), or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction (1 trial, 30 participants). All trials included athletes (88% males, mean age 26 years) with a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most trials were susceptible to bias, particularly selection bias/random sequence (57.1%), selection bias/allocation concealment (42.8%), detection bias (28.5%), attrition bias (71.4%), and selective reporting biases (28.5%). Given the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor investigators were blinded to group allocation in any trials (performance bias). We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Strengthening exercise versus no treatment We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment. Mean pain with no treatment was 62.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = no pain) compared to 27.06 points with exercise (mean difference (MD) 34.94 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.94 better to 48.94 better; 1 study, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for bias)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment at the end of treatment. Mean function with no treatment was 65.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (100 = best function) compared to 72.04 points with exercise (MD 7.04 points better, 95% CI 6.94 points worse to 21.02 points better; 2 studies, 95 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for imprecision and once for bias)). The studies reported none of the other outcomes. Strengthening exercise versus glucocorticoid injection Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain compared to glucocorticoid injection at the end of treatment. Mean pain with glucocorticoid injection was 18.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = no pain) compared to 24.04 points with exercise (MD 6.04 points worse, 95% CI 8.19 better to 20.26 better; 1 trial, 38 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to glucocorticoid injection at the end of treatment. Mean function with no treatment was 82.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (100 = best function) compared to 76.25 points with exercise (MD 5.75 points worse, 95% CI 17.41 worse to 5.93 better; 1 trial, 38 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision)). The trial reported none of the other outcomes. Strengthening exercise versus surgery We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to surgery at 12-month follow-up. Mean pain with surgery was 13.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = no pain) compared to 17.00 points with exercise (MD 4.00 points worse, 95% CI 4.06 better to 12.06 worse; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise improves function compared to surgery. Mean function in the surgery group at the end of treatment was 45.10 points on a 0 to 100 scale (100 = best function) compared to 52.4 points in the exercise group (MD 7.30 points better, 95% CI 5.02 worse to 19.62 better; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for bias and twice for serious imprecision)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to treatment success compared to surgery at the end of treatment. The mean global assessment of treatment success with surgery was 0.2 points on a -5 to +5 scale (+5 maximum was improvement) compared to 1.76 points with exercise (MD 1.56 points better, 95% CI 0.52 worse to 3.64 better; 1 trial, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for bias and once for imprecision)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to the rate of participants who returned fully or partially to sport when compared to surgery at 12-month follow-up. The return to sport rate with surgery was 86% compared to 85% with exercise (risk ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.34; 1 trial, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for bias and once for imprecision)). The trial reported none of the other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment and to function or pain compared to glucocorticoid injection. Compared to surgery, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain or improves function, and it may make little or no difference to treatment success and the proportion of athletes returning to sport. No trials measured adverse events. All trials analyzed in this review included participants who were athletes, limiting the findings to athletes rather than the general public.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^111PxgcH]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Based on our findings and those of previously published systematic reviews, we recommend against the use of ESWT or concentric exercise monotherapy to manage patellar tendinopathy. Eccentric loading should continue to be used as first-line treatment and isometric loading, which may be as effective for immediate pain relief (low strength of evidence), may be preferable in select cases. However, its mid-term and long-term effects remain unknown. Heavy or moderate slow resistance exercise also appears effective and could be used instead of or in combination with eccentric exercise, although its effectiveness is only based on limited evidence. Topical GTN and/or hyaluronic acid injections could be considered adjuncts at 12 weeks if loading regimes alone have been ineffective. Finally, eccentric loading should continue to be assessed as monotherapy in future research.

Anterior knee pain is associated with many different causes. The clinical diagnosis may be unclear when the patient initially presents for evaluation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a valuable modality with high diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of extensor mechanism pathology, which commonly presents with anterior knee pain.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome [^114t6i2x]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is one of the most common causes of anterior knee pain encountered in the outpatient setting in adolescents and adults younger than 60 years. The incidence in the United States is between 3% and 6%. The cardinal feature of PFPS is pain in or around the anterior knee that intensifies when the knee is flexed during weight-bearing activities. The pain of PFPS often worsens with prolonged sitting or descending stairs. The most sensitive physical examination finding is pain with squatting. Examining a patient's gait, posture, and footwear can help identify contributing causes. Plain radiographs of the knee are not necessary for the diagnosis of PFPS but can exclude other diagnoses, such as osteoarthritis, patellar fracture, and osteochondritis. If conservative treatment measures are unsuccessful, plain radiography is recommended. Treatment of PFPS includes rest, a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy directed at strengthening the hip flexor, trunk, and knee muscle groups. Patellar kinesiotaping may provide additional short-term pain relief; however, evidence is insufficient to support its routine use. Surgery is considered a last resort.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116DKnC6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anterior knee pain (see Figure 1) is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints seen in the pediatric population. A fairly extensive differential diagnosis exists as anterior knee pain is a fairly nonspecific phenomenon. A thorough history and physical examination with attention to anatomic location of the pain, inciting factors, relationship of associated symptoms as well as a general assessment of growth and development will aid in the evaluation and treatment of this disorder. An awareness of typical injury patterns can aid the physician in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Identification of worrisome signs and symptoms will also help in defining which cases may require further evaluation. All pediatric patients presenting with knee pain require evaluation for ipsilateral hip and lumbar spine disorders. This article will review common causes of chronic anterior knee pain in the pediatric population with a focus on patellofemoral pain. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review and will not review acute traumatic knee injuries. Lateral, medial or posterior knee pain will be covered in a subsequent article.

Figure 1
Patients with anterior knee pain localize the pain to the anterior knee and will point to the entire extensor mechanism, rather than to specific anatomic regions [1].

Clinical history

The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or rest, aggravating and alleviating factors, night pain); trauma (acute macrotrauma, repetitive microtrauma, recent/remote); mechanical symptoms (locking or extension block, instability, worse during or after activity); inflammatory symptoms (morning stiffness, swelling); effects of previous treatments and the current level of function of the child. Patients with overuse anterior knee pain may report a sensation of giving way or instability. This sensation is usually a pseudo-giving way due to what is coined the "quadriceps inhibitory reflex" or a neuromuscular inhibition that occurs secondary to pain, muscle weakness, patellar instability or joint instability. It is important to note that true instability is suggestive of internal derangement of the knee most commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears or meniscal injury.

A history of previous injury or knee surgery, chronic inflammatory joint disease or bleeding diathesis, is significant, especially if knee swelling is present.

Anterior knee pain is a common problem and its management can be challenging. A thorough evaluation of the patient's history and examination of the lower extremity and knee extensor mechanism is necessary. Clinically elusive conditions should be considered before ascribing the pain as idiopathic, the most common diagnosis of adolescent anterior knee pain. In the majority of cases, the natural history of idiopathic anterior knee pain is improvement and resolution. Nonoperative therapeutic measures usually provide improved knee function.

### Increased patellar volume / width and decreased femoral trochlear width are associated with adolescent patellofemoral pain [^1137fBxV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain is one of the most common forms of knee arthralgia in adolescent females. Unlike in adults, in whom the etiology of patellofemoral pain is considered to be multifactorial (eg, altered bone shape and musculoskeletal dynamics), the etiology of adolescent patellofemoral pain has been historically attributed to overuse. Although it is highly plausible that adolescent patellofemoral pain results from excessive maltracking, as suggested by recent research, an increase in patellar, relative to femoral, size could also contribute to patellofemoral pain through altered cartilage stresses/strains, resulting in overloading of the subchondral bone. Because the role of bone morphology in the genesis of patellofemoral pain in adolescent females remains largely unknown, research is needed in this area to improve our understanding of patellofemoral pain and advance diagnosis/treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are patellar volume and width increased, and femoral trochlear width decreased, in female adolescents with patellofemoral pain compared with asymptomatic females? (2) Are measures of patellofemoral size correlated with patellofemoral tracking?

Methods

Twenty adolescent females with patellofemoral pain (age, 13.7 ± 1.3 years) and 20 asymptomatic female control participants (age, 13.6 ± 1.3 years) were enrolled in this case-control institutional review board-approved study. This study focused on a strict definition of patellofemoral pain, peripatellar pain in the absence of other structural pathologic conditions (eg, tendinitis, ligament injury, Osgood-Schlatter disease) or a history of dislocations/trauma. Control participants with no history of patellofemoral pain or other lower extremity pathology were matched for age (within 6 months) and body mass index (within 5 kg/m). Participants self-referred and were recruited through clinicaltrails.gov, printed advertisements, and word of mouth. Three-dimensional (3-D), static, T1-weighted, gradient recalled echo MR images were acquired, from which 3-D patellofemoral models were created. Patellar volume and width, patellar-to-femoral volume and width ratios, and femoral trochlear width were compared across cohorts. In addition, 3-D patellofemoral tracking was quantified from dynamic MR images captured during cyclical flexion-extension volitional movements of the lower extremity. The size measures and ratios were correlated to patellofemoral tracking.

Results

Compared with control participants, the cohort with patellofemoral pain had greater patellar volume (13,792 ± 2256 versus 11,930 ± 1902 mm; 95% confidence interval, 1336 mm; p = 0.004; d = 0.89) and width (38.4 ± 3.0 versus 36.5 ± 2.7 mm; 95% CI, 1.8 mm; p = 0.021; d = 0.67). The femoral trochlear width was smaller (32.0 ± 1.8 versus 32.9 ± 1.8 mm; p = 0.043, d = 0.54). The patellar-to-femoral volume ratio and the patellar-to-trochlear width ratio were greater in adolescents with patellofemoral pain (0.15 ± 0.02 versus 0.13 ± 0.01, p = 0.006, d = 0.83 and 1.20 ± 0.09 versus 1.11 ± 0.09, p = 0.001, d = 1.02). No correlations were found between patellar size and patellofemoral tracking (r < 0.375, p > 0.103).

Conclusions

In adolescent females with patellofemoral pain, the increased patellar volume/width and patellar-to-trochlear width ratio, along with the decreased femoral trochlear width, may initiate a pathway to pain through improper engagement of the patella within the femoral trochlea. Specifically, the mean differences between cohorts in patellar and femoral trochlear width (1.9 mm and 0.9 mm) are 58% and 37% of the mean patellar and femoral cartilage thickness in females, respectively, as reported in the literature. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of pain.

Bursitis

Background: A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that acts as a friction cushion between structures. There are 10 bursa within and around the knee, and the 4 major bursa are the prepatellar, suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and pes anserine bursa. When friction or trauma irritates a bursa, it can become inflamed and be a significant source of knee pain. Bursitis is clinically recognized by localized pain, point tenderness, and edema at the sight of the bursa. Septic bursitis may also present with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fevers and leukocytosis.
Etiology: Superficial to the patella is the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa, which can become inflamed with kneeling activities, and is colloquially called "housemaid's knee or carpenter's knee". Inferior to the patella are two bursae, subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which lies superficial to the patellar ligament, and the deep (subtendinous) infrapatellar bursa which lies deep to the patellar ligament. Inferomedial knee pain may be caused by anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa lies deep to the pes anserinus comprising the tendinous attachments of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius. Proximal to the anserine bursa and deep to the semimembranosus tendon is the semimembranosus bursa. There are three lateral bursae: the bursa deep to the iliotibial tract, bursa deep to the lateral collateral ligament, and the inferior subtendinous bursa deep to the biceps femoris tendon. Posteriorly, there are two subtendinous bursa, one deep to the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. A bursa can become inflamed by overuse leading to increased friction across the bursa. Septic bursitis requires bacteria to enter the bursa and is associated with trauma.
Diagnostic criteria: Physical exam is significant for pain and point tenderness overlying the affected bursa and may be associated with swelling. Prepatellar bursitis will present with egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella. Septic bursitis may present with erythema and warmth. Radiologic knee series are usually normal. Evaluation with ultrasound will show a hypoechoic fluid filled sac or discrete fluid collection at the site of pain indicating bursitis.
Treatment: The treatment of bursitis-related knee pain is typically focused on reducing the inflammation of the bursa, itself – this includes ice, NSAIDs, activity modifications (such as knee pads for prepatellar bursitis), injections of corticosteroid, and therapeutic aspiration. For patients with active lifestyle or occupational demands and non-septic bursitis, intrabursal injection of corticosteroids provides acute pain relief. If septic bursitis is suspected, infectious workup includes blood sampling for evaluation of leukocytosis and aspiration of bursal fluid with gram stain and cell count. Treat septic bursitis with antibiotics. Recurrent or persistent severe bursitis may benefit from surgical interventions such as bursectomy.

Knee pain is a common presenting complaint with many possible causes. An awareness of certain patterns can help the family physician identify the underlying cause more efficiently. Teenage girls and young women are more likely to have patellar tracking problems such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome, whereas teenage boys and young men are more likely to have knee extensor mechanism problems such as tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion) and patellar tendonitis. Referred pain resulting from hip joint pathology, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, also may cause knee pain. Active patients are more likely to have acute ligamentous sprains and overuse injuries such as pes anserine bursitis and medial plica syndrome. Trauma may result in acute ligamentous rupture or fracture, leading to acute knee joint swelling and hemarthrosis. Septic arthritis may develop in patients of any age, but crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy is more likely in adults. Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is common in older adults.

### Sports and exercise-related tendinopathies: a review of selected topical issues by participants of the second international scientific tendinopathy symposium (ISTS) vancouver 2012 [^114CC9mR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

At ISTS 2012, the value of US imaging in achieving a more specific diagnosis was apparent in a retrospective study of 143 US scans (ISTS 2012 abstract, in press). Although the proximal pole of the patella was, as expected, the most common location of pathology (present in 71% of tendons), pathology was also frequently observed at the distal pole (38%), sometimes in conjunction with other locations, but more commonly, as the sole location. Mid-substance pathology always occurred in association with involvement of either the proximal or the distal insertion. This level of anatomic specificity in diagnosis is clearly of value when tendon-directed treatments (eg, injections or exercise) are being considered.

However, the phenomenon that imaging abnormalities do not necessarily signal the presence of clinically significant symptoms has been well established. Cook et al reported that 22% of elite athletes demonstrated pathological lesions within the patellar tendon, despite the absence of anterior knee pain. Similar cross-sectional studies using MRI in rotator cuff injury have shown structural abnormalities at similar frequencies in symptomatic and age-matched controls. Importantly, the presence of asymptomatic structural abnormalities within tendons identified using imaging has been shown to increase the risk of developing pain.

With regard to the rotator cuff, early studies indicated a progressive course of rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, a recent study reported a low risk for tear progression in small, symptomatic supraspinatus tears (25% in 3.5 years). The progression of rotator cuff tendinopathy is associated with increased symptom manifestation.

Despite their clinical utility, both US and MRI are subject to artefacts and typically yield poor interobserver and intraobserver reliability. Investigators are developing more reliable and sensitive methods of quantitative tendon imaging, but these methods are, at this point in time, more relevant for research than for clinical practice. At ISTS 2012, two emerging methods for analysing and quantifying grey-scale US images were presented. De-Groot-Ferrando and colleagues (ISTS 2012 abstract, in press) described a reliable method to quantify morphometric parameters as well as textual features such as contrast and entropy. Van Schie et al (ISTS 2012 abstract, in press) reviewed Ultrasound Tissue Characterisation (UTC), which captures contiguous transverse images over the length of the tendon. These methods may have the potential to detect subtle changes in tendon structure not seen previously; however, further research is required. Sonoelastography is another developing technique which needs further evaluation within the field of tendinopathy.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^112BdF6A]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Search strategy

A literature search was conducted by DC and MB via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL in May 2021, with the following Boolean operators in 'all fields': '((patellar tendinopathy) OR (jumper's knee) OR (patellar tendinitis) OR (patellar tendinosis) OR (patellar tendonitis)) AND ((treatment) OR (management) OR (intervention) OR (exercise) OR (concentric) OR (eccentric) OR (isometric) OR (slow resistance) OR (physiotherapy) OR (electrotherapy) OR (injection) OR (steroid) OR (glyceryl) OR (gtn) OR (platelet-rich plasma) OR (prp) OR (autologous) OR (shockwave) OR (eswt) OR (polidocanol) OR (hyaluronic) OR (surgery) OR (sham))'.

Relevant review articles were screened to identify eligible articles that may have been missed during the initial search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar were performed for each eligible article. Clinical trial registries were also searched for ongoing or recently completed relevant studies which have not yet been published.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112y4AhH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain refers to pain behind or around the patella (also known as patellofemoral pain syndrome, anterior knee pain, runner's knee, and, formerly, chondromalacia patellae). Patellofemoral pain is common, accounting for 11–17% of all knee pain presentations to general practice.(1 2) While it typically occurs in physically active people aged < 40 years, it also affects people of all activity levels and ages.(1 2) Patellofemoral pain can be diagnosed in the clinic, and evidence based treatments can reduce pain and improve function, allowing patients to maintain a physically active lifestyle.

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in the assessment of anterior knee pain [^115cKhmg]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Key points

Ultrasonography showed high diagnostic accuracy in detecting most causes of AKP.
Although MRI is the gold standard technique for AKP imaging, ultrasonography can be used to make a swift screening and assessment of the painful anterior knee and can be used as an alternative to MRI when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.
MRI may be warranted if a patellar cartilage defect is clinically suspected or the ultrasonography yielded negative results.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) decision model — medical screening and differential classification: Component 1 is "medical screening (includes psychological screening)" that triages to "Appropriate for physical therapy evaluation and intervention", "Appropriate for physical therapy evaluation and intervention, along with consultation with another health care provider", or "Not appropriate for physical therapy evaluation and intervention", which directs to "Consultation with appropriate health care provider". Component 2 instructs to "classify condition through differential evaluation of clinical findings suggestive of musculoskeletal impairments of body functioning (ICF) and the associated tissue pathology/disease (ICD)". Diagnosis of PFP (B) includes "Retropatellar or peripatellar pain", reproduction of pain with activities "loading the PFJ in a flexed position", "Positive patellar tilt test", and "Exclusion of all other possible sources of anterior knee pain", with physical impairment measures listing "Patellofemoral pain cluster of findings". Differential diagnosis advises to "Consider other knee conditions and symptoms referred from hip or lumbopelvic region", "Consider systemic or medical conditions that may impact diagnosis and management", and "Consider psychological issues that may require referral to a health care practitioner in addition to physical therapy".

### Treatment of patellar tendinopathy – a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113agBCu]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patellar tendinopathy is a common, painful, overuse disorder. Although many different treatment methods have been described, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment for this condition. The purpose of this study was to systematically review, summarize, and compare treatments for patellar tendinopathy from published randomized controlled trials.

Methods

Database searches were performed for randomized prospective controlled trials comparing treatment methods for patellar tendinopathy. The thirteen articles considered relevant were scrutinized according to quality assessment guidelines and levels of evidence.

Results

Strong evidence was found for the use of eccentric training to treat patellar tendinopathy. Moderate evidence was found for conservative treatment (heavy slow resistance training) as an alternative to eccentric training. Moderate evidence suggests that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment did not influence treatment outcomes. Limited evidence was found for surgery, sclerosing injections, and shockwave therapy.

Conclusion

Physical training, and particularly eccentric training, appears to be the treatment of choice for patients suffering from patellar tendinopathy. However, type of exercise, frequency, load, and dosage must also be analyzed. Other treatment methods, such as surgical treatment, sclerosing injections, and shockwave therapy, must be investigated further before recommendations can be made regarding their use. Ultrasound can likely be excluded as a treatment for patellar tendinopathy. There is a persistent lack of well-designed studies with sufficiently long-term follow-up and number of patients to draw strong conclusions regarding therapy.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^115s2NUv]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Anterior knee pain is common in children and adolescents. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the pediatric skeleton. Most causes of anterior knee pain involve the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. It is important for the clinician to consider conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton including hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthe's disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansen disease). Anterior knee pain is occasionally caused by serious underlying systemic disease including inflammatory conditions and malignancies. The clinical history and physical exam often lead to correct diagnosis and identify cases requiring further evaluation, imaging or referral. General return to play guidelines can be followed for PFP and most causes of anterior knee pain

### Patellofemoral pain [^115R6K8C]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain — diagnosis recommendations: Clinicians should use reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain during squatting as a diagnostic test for patellofemoral pain (PFP), and should also use performance of other functional activities that load the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) in a flexed position, such as stair climbing or descent, as diagnostic tests for PFP. Clinicians should make the diagnosis of PFP using the following criteria: the presence of retropatellar or peripatellar pain; reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain with squatting, stair climbing, prolonged sitting, or other functional activities loading the PFJ in a flexed position; and exclusion of all other conditions that may cause anterior knee pain, including tibiofemoral pathologies. Clinicians may use the patellar tilt test with the presence of hypomobility to support the diagnosis of PFP.

### Patellar nomenclature: the tower of babel revisited [^114gF8cx]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Because we communicate mainly through words, it is important that terms be understood in the same manner by all readers. Unfortunately, the study of the patellofemoral joint is complicated by the use of expressions that hold different meanings for different readers. Ideally, the community of musculoskeletal physicians should agree on a single definition of terms, but until then, authors and speakers should define their terms clearly. Some terms, such as chondromalacia and patellofemoral syndrome, should be abandoned altogether. I propose a glossary of confusing terms pertaining to the patellofemoral joint, the various interpretations of these terms, and possible resolutions of these conflicts. Words and terms included in this review include chondromalacia, patellofemoral syndrome, anterior knee pain, subluxation, malalignment, proximal realignment, Roux procedure, and "normal".

Osteochondroses

Osgood-Schlatter (OSD) and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson (SLJD) disease are osteochondroses and traction apophysitis affecting the extensor mechanism of the knee. OSD occurs at the growth plate of the tibial tuberosity at the inferior attachment of the patellar ligament and is more common than SLJD, which occurs at the inferior pole of the patella at the superior attachment of the patellar ligament. Both conditions present in adolescence during the growth spurt and are characterized by well localized pain aggravated by exercise. On examination there is well localized tenderness and soft tissue swelling. There is often tightness of surrounding muscles, especially the quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemius. Both OSD and SLJD are clinical diagnoses and radiographs are not usually required. If pain is severe or there is marked swelling radiographs should be obtained to exclude bony tumors or infection. Typical radiographs of OSD show enlargement and fragmentation of the tubercle (Figure 4). Management is conservative; these are self-limited conditions that resolve with skeletal maturity but symptoms may persist for up to 24 months. Treatment includes activity modification, local cryotherapy, local muscle stretching and strengthening, and correction of any predisposing biomechanical factors, such as subtalar pronation with physical therapy, bracing and/or orthotics. Occasionally in OSD, symptoms may persist with skeletal maturity due to non-union of the tibial tuberosity. The separate fragment should be excised.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy [^113TkfcM]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Patellar tendinopathy is a common pathology typically seen in athletes involved in repetitive explosive jumping and running activities. Also known as jumpers' knee, it is commonly seen in high-level basketball players. Typically, athletes continue to play with symptoms, which can be aggravated and progress to partial patellar tendon tears. When partial patellar tendon tears occur, prolonged recovery and decreased performance is commonly seen. The pathology and treatment can be frustrating for both the athlete and medical provider. Patellar tendinopathy typically does not involve inflammation but rather microinjury to the tendon fibers, which leads to mucoid degeneration, necrosis, and loss of transitional fibrocartilage. When partial tendon tears do occur, the typical location is posteromedially adjacent to the patella. Treatment involves a stepwise approach starting with nonoperative means, including activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and physical therapy focused on eccentrics. Extracorporeal shock wave treatments and injections with platelet-rich plasma or bone marrow aspirate concentrate should be considered, with evolving literature to support their use. Ultrasound percutaneous tendon scrapping with a needle supplemented with the aforementioned injections is an emerging treatment option that the authors have found to be helpful, although further studies are required. Surgical intervention is considered after failure of nonoperative treatments, and typically occurs in tears greater than 50% of the tendon thickness and in tendons with increased thickness (> 8.8 mm). Open or arthroscopic debridement can be considered, with no studies showing superior outcomes with either technique; however, no high-quality comparison studies exist. The authors prefer an open technique where, much like a bone-patellar tendon-bone harvest, the unhealthy proximal tendon and bone are excised with then closure of the healthy tendon with absorbable sutures. Suture anchor repair may also be used when necessary. In a recent systematic review, surgical management of patellar tendinopathy has been shown to result in improved patient-reported outcomes with return to sport at high levels. 1 Treatment for the difficult and sometimes frustrating pathology of patellar tendinopathy continues to evolve, with biologic and less-invasive ultrasound-based treatments showing promise, and surgical intervention providing reliable outcomes.

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^114kPPvw]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the ' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses'(PRISMA) guidelines (figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: 'pain', 'function', 'ROM', 'force/strength', 'patient satisfaction', 'treatment success', 'QoL', 'complications'. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper's knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)'.

Medical Subject Heading terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar were performed for each relevant article.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^116YsNBY]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

The Review Manager V.5 software was used for pairwise meta-analyses and accompanying forest plots and heterogeneity tests (χ 2 and I 2). STATA V.16.1 with Ian White's 'mvmeta' extension (multivariate random effects meta-regression) was used for NMAs (frequentist approach). This uses a general model of treatment contrasts and it allows for both heterogeneity and inconsistency. A frequentist approach estimates the network model, expressing the consistency and inconsistency models as multivariate random effects meta-analysis or meta-regression.

Where exact mean and SD values were not reported in the included articles, approximate values (to the nearest decimal place) were derived from the graphs. When only IQR was reported, the SD was calculated as IQR/1.35. When only median was reported, mean was assumed the same. When CIs of means were reported, SDs were calculated by dividing the length of the CI by 3.92 and then multiplying by the square root of the sample size. Where standard errors of the mean were given, these were converted to SDs by multiplying them by the square root of the sample size. In studies where only the means and the population were given, the SD was imputed using the SDs of other similar studies using the 'prognostic method' (calculating the average of all SDs). Pooled means were calculated by adding all the means multiplied by their sample size and then dividing this by the sum of all sample sizes. Pooled SDs were calculated with the following formula:

### Sports and exercise-related tendinopathies: a review of selected topical issues by participants of the second international scientific tendinopathy symposium (ISTS) vancouver 2012 [^117AmShc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prevention

Tendinopathies are common and often cause long-lasting symptoms of pain and dysfunction which negatively impact on working and/or sporting capacity. Thus, preventive strategies for tendinopathy seem warranted. However, little research on the prevention of tendinopathy has been published. In 1992, van Mechelen et al introduced the sports injury prevention research model. This model will be used as a framework for describing what is known already, and what should be targeted in future research projects.

Step 1: magnitude of the problem

Several studies have been published on the frequency of sport-related and exercise-related tendinopathies. However, comparison and interpretation of results is difficult due to a lack of consistent case definitions and inappropriate time-loss-based injury registration methods. Most studies are performed in selected populations such as elite athletes, or in participants of one specific sport. The definition of tendon problems is often unclear since tendon pain, US tendon abnormalities and sport-specific diagnoses such as jumper's knee or tennis elbow are used interchangeably. Many people continue their work or sporting activities despite their chronic overuse injury and/or tendon pain. This means that in many epidemiological studies, despite their prevalence tendinopathies are not included in the incidence rate as new injuries that cause time loss from work or sports.

Bahrrecommended the quantification of overuse injuries in a standardised way using prevalence (not incidence) in prospective studies with continuous or serial measurements of symptoms. Valid and sensitive scoring instruments that measure pain and functional level should be used, and severity should be determined in relation to this rather than from time lost from sport/work (as many athletes continue to compete despite pain). The VISA-A and VISA-P are examples of valid, sensitive and cross-culturally adapted questionnaires which measure pain, function and sports participation in athletes with Achilles or patellar tendon problems (discussed above). Recently, the aforementioned recommendations led to the development of a new method, including a questionnaire, for the registration of overuse problems.

### Intrinsic risk factors for the development of patellar tendinitis in an athletic population. A two-year prospective study [^113DHvfL]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Retrospective studies have suggested various factors that might cause a disposition to develop patellar tendinitis, but no prospective data exist to determine any relationships. The purpose of this study was to determine the intrinsic risk factors for the development of patellar tendinitis in an athletic population. Before the study, 138 male and female students of physical education were evaluated for anthropometric variables, leg alignment characteristics, and muscle tightness and strength parameters. During the 2-year study, 19 of the 138 students developed patellar tendinitis. In all cases the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of a hypoechogenic nodular lesion in the proximal region of the patellar tendon. Univariate and stepwise discriminant function analyses were performed comparing the various measurements. These analyses revealed that the only significant determining factor was muscular flexibility, with the patellar tendinitis patients being less flexible in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles (P < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that lower flexibility of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles may contribute to the development of patellar tendinitis in an athletic population. Therefore, the prevention of this condition in athletes should be focused on screening for and treating poor quadriceps and hamstring muscle flexibility.

### Is impingement the cause of jumper's knee? Dynamic and static magnetic resonance imaging of patellar tendinitis in an open-configuration system [^113mUSS7]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic overload is considered the main cause of patellar tendinitis, but it has been postulated that impingement of the inferior patellar pole against the patellar tendon during knee flexion could be responsible.

Hypothesis

The role of the patellar pole in patellar tendinitis can be determined by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Methods

We compared 19 knees with patellar tendinitis and 32 asymptomatic knees of age-matched subjects using an open-configuration magnetic resonance imaging system. Dynamic sagittal images were obtained from full extension to 100 degrees of flexion with and without activation of the quadriceps muscle. The following measurements were made from the images: tendon-patella angle, anteroposterior diameter of the tendon, signal difference-to-noise ratio, the shape of the inferior patellar pole, and the location of the patellar tendon insertion.

Results

The tendon-patella angle was not significantly different between groups at any flexion angle, with or without quadriceps muscle activation. The insertion site of the patellar tendon differed significantly but not the shape of the inferior pole of the patella. The volume and the signal difference-to-noise ratio of zones of increased intratendinous signal as well as the anteroposterior diameter of the proximal patellar tendon were increased in symptomatic knees.

Conclusions

The relationship between the patella and the patellar tendon was identical in both groups; therefore, chronic overload seems to be a major cause of patellar tendinitis.

### Therapeutic interventions in children and adolescents with patellar tendon related pain: a systematic review [^116GjCKV]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

The systematic review was prospectively registered the review in PROSPERO (registration number 82736). The review was informed according to the Cochrane guidelines and is reported according to the PRISMA statement.

Data sources and searches

We carried out a systematic search in the following bibliographic databases: Medline via Pubmed, Embase via OVID, CINAHL via Ebsco, SportDiscus up until 24 November 2017. The search terms and strategy were developed with a research librarian and are available in online supplementary material 1.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Studies evaluating any intervention for any type of patellar tendon related pain in children or adolescents were eligible for inclusion, providing the design included an intervention and a comparator. Specifically, non-randomised controlled clinical trials and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including semi/quasi-randomised and cluster randomised trials) were eligible. Any therapeutic intervention or control treatments were included (including, but not restricted to, non-surgical interventions, injection-based interventions, exercise, surgical interventions or standard care/wait and see and so on). Studies had to include children or adolescents (aged under 18 years), with patellar tendon related pain. We included any publications in English or Scandinavian languages. Studies were excluded if reporting on primary complaints of patellofemoral joint disorders including patellofemoral pain a, patellofemoral instability, acute traumatic causes of knee pain, inflammatory arthritis, or if they included a population age > 18 years. If the study included a mixed-age population extending across the age limits in our inclusion criteria, we requested age-specific data for those < 18 years from trial authors.

Selection of studies

Duplicates were removed and relevant studies identified from the search were imported into Covidence for screening. Studies were independently screened by title and abstract by two authors (TO and GC). This was followed by full text evaluation of the selected studies from the first selection step by both authors. Disagreement between the two reviewers was solved by consensus involving a third reviewer (BD).

### Results of surgical treatment of chronic patellar tendinosis (jumper's knee): a systematic review of the literature [^114opWH8]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the literature concerning surgical treatment options for chronic patellar tendinosis (jumper's knee), a common problem among athletes. When conservative treatment fails, surgical treatment is required.

Methods

Systematic review of the literature concerning the results of current surgical treatment options for chronic patellar tendinosis. All articles of studies with an evidence level ≥ IV from January 2000 until February 2015 presenting the surgical outcome after arthroscopic as well as open treatment of chronic patellar tendinosis were included. The literature research of the PubMed database was performed using the following key words: "patellar" and "tendinitis", "tendonitis", "tendinosis" or "tendinopathy"; "inferior patellar pole"; "jumper's knee"; "surgical treatment" and "open" or "arthroscopic patellar tenotomy".

Results

A systematic review of the literature was performed especially to point out the effectiveness of arthroscopic treatment of chronic patellar tendinosis. The results revealed good clinical results for arthroscopic as well as open treatment of chronic patellar tendinosis that is refractory to conservative treatment in athletes. An average success rate of 87% was found for the open treatment group and of 91% for the arthroscopic treatment group. However, after open surgery, the mean time of return to the preinjury level of activity is 8 to 12 months, with a certain number of patients/athletes who cannot return to the preinjury level of activity.

Conclusions

Minimally invasive, arthroscopically assisted or all-arthroscopic procedures may lead to a significantly faster return to sporting activities and may, therefore, be the preferred method of surgical treatment.

### Time-to-event analysis for sports injury research part 2: time-varying outcomes [^1118Snx6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Now the reader may speculate: are the concepts of multistate transitions (question 1) and subsequent injury (question 2) similar? Importantly, multistate transitions and subsequent injury should be considered two different, but nevertheless related, concepts. In figure 1, the difference between the two concepts is visualised as subsequent injury refers to injury 1 and injury 2 (marked with red), whereas each state is marked with a blue circle with arrows (representing the transitions) are connecting the states.

Key point 2: in time-to-event modelling, the researcher can consider subsequent injuries using the concept of shared frailty. This allows for correction for selection of 'less-injury-prone' athletes over time.

Time-to-event outcomes question 3: how to deal with competing risks?

Key question 3: in your dataset, there are data on many different injury types (eg, Achilles tendinopathy, patella-femoral pain, iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy). However, you may only be interested in studying Achilles tendinopathy. Should you just omit all other injuries (patella-femoral pain, iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy) when analysing the data?

In the initial presentation of the M-FASIS, OSTRC and SIC models, the possibility of dealing with multiple injuries was discussed, and the first steps were taken to promote the concept of competing risk. Standard time-to-event data include the time span from a specified time origin until the occurrence of one type of event (eg, Achilles tendinopathy). If there is a simultaneous risk of several types of injuries (eg, patella-femoral pain, iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy), then these different types of injuries are considered competing, in the sense that a person can only sustain one of them at a given point in time. In the Achilles tendinopathy example, the competing risks were based on injury diagnoses. In a sports injury setting, competing risks can be assessed based on: (i) classification, for example, tendon-related injury, muscle injuries, joint-related injury and injuries unrelated to sport; (ii) anatomical location, for example, knee injury, foot injury, hip injury or (iii) diagnoses, for example, patella-femoral pain, patellar tendinopathy, Achilles tendinopathy.

### Effectiveness of progressive tendon-loading exercise therapy in patients with patellar tendinopathy: a randomised clinical trial [^112b4Cg8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Applicant eligibility was assessed with an initial online screening, including the VISA-P questionnaire and a self-reported pain map to assess the location of pain (figure 1). The screening criteria that needed to be fulfilled were VISA-P score < 80 points and the reporting of pain exclusively at the inferior pole of the patella or anywhere along the course of the patellar tendon (figure 1E) in association with physical load. The final eligibility assessment in our hospital to confirm eligibility included first, history taking, completing the VISA-P questionnaire and physical examination performed by one sports physician (R-JdV) with 10 years experience. Activity level was measured using the Cincinnati Sports Activity Scale (CSAS). The clinical examination was regarded positive if tenderness at the inferior patellar pole or patellar tendon could be reproduced on palpation and a single-leg squat. Provocation tests according to the patellofemoral pain consensus statement were performed to exclude patellofemoral pain. Second, eligibility was confirmed by using grey scale ultrasound and power Doppler to increase the likelihood of the clinical diagnosis, performed by a radiologist-in-training with 5 years experience (SJB) under supervision of a senior musculoskeletal radiologist with 16 years experience (EHGO). The ultrasound examination was regarded positive if there was presence of structural and/or hypoechoic changes and/or tendon thickening (anterior–posterior diameter > 6 mm) and/or the presence of intratendinous power Doppler flow.

### Effectiveness of progressive tendon-loading exercise therapy in patients with patellar tendinopathy: a randomised clinical trial [^112qcZQA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patellar tendinopathy (PT) is a common chronic tendon injury that is characterised by load-related pain in the patellar tendon. As many as 45% of elite athletes in jumping sports like basketball and volleyball suffer from PT. This often results in prolonged sport absence, which hampers an individual's athletic performance and the health-related benefits of physical activity. It also has been shown that 58% of the patients with PT encounter problems with participation in physically demanding work.

Despite the fact that many risk factors in the aetiology and pathogenesis of PT have been suggested, a direct cause–effect relationship is currently unknown. The nomenclature 'tendinitis' has been replaced by 'tendinopathy', since histopathological studies confirm structural degenerative changes of the tendon tissue as the key feature, with minimal presence of inflammatory cells. Anti-inflammatory treatment options are, therefore, discouraged and these have proven ineffective for tendinopathy.

Eccentric exercise therapy (EET) has strong evidence of effectiveness for PT and is also supported in guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), London, UK. However, EET is pain-provoking and the therapeutic effects on pain and functional outcome are debated when applied during the competitive season. A recent review proposed an alternative exercise therapy for PT consisting of progressive tendon-loading exercises (PTLE) within the limits of acceptable pain. To date, it is unknown how the effectiveness of PTLE compares to EET.

The aim of our stratified, single-blinded, block-randomised controlled trial was to compare PTLE and EET based on clinical outcome after 24 weeks in patients with PT.

### A systematic review of surgical treatment for refractory patellar tendinopathy [^111GEFyH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Classification

The diagnosis of PT was originally solely a clinical one comprising symptoms and distal patellar pole tenderness. Blazina in 1973 coined the term "Jumper's knee" to highlight the prevalence of PT in jumping activities and formulated a classification system to indicate the severity of PT on a scale of I to IV. This system ranges from Blazina I, which is pain after exercise through Blazina IV, which was added later to indicate patellar tendon rupture. To supplement the clinical diagnosis, both ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging have been used to demonstrate tendon thickening and changes at the distal patellar pole. After Blazina, the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment for the patellar tendon (VISA-P) score was developed to better quantify the severity and response to the treatment of PT. Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment for the patellar tendon is a series of eight questions used to generate a score out of 100, with a score of 100 representing the fewest symptoms.

More recently, the Popkin-Golman Classification was developed as a novel classification system to more objectively characterize the severity of PT by factoring in the size and location of partial patellar tendon tears (PPTT) when present and to also establish tendon thickness as a predictor of PPTT. In their study, it was found that tendon thickness > 8.8 mm strongly correlated with a PPTT and that athletes with a tendon thickness greater than 11.5 mm or > 50% tear thickness (ie, Popkin-Golman grade 4 PPTT) on axial MRI were unlikely to improve with nonsurgical management. This provides an objective measure to better triage athletes toward or away from surgical management for their PT.

The case report highlights an unusual case of posterolateral knee pain after total knee arthroplasty. Tendinitis of the patellar tendon or pes anserinus is a common complication after total knee arthroplasty; however, there is no report in the literature regarding the biceps femoris tendinitis causing acute pain in the early postoperative period. In this case, the biceps tendinitis was diagnosed and treated by ultrasound-guided injection into the tendon sheath.

### The influence of exercise dosing on outcomes in patients with knee disorders: a systematic review [^114PCj9p]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design Systematic review. Background Therapeutic exercise is commonly used to treat individuals with knee disorders, but dosing parameters for optimal outcomes are unclear. Large variations exist in exercise prescription, and research related to specific dosing variables for knee osteoarthritis, patellar tendinopathy, and patellofemoral pain is sparse. Objectives To identify specific doses of exercise related to improved outcomes of pain and function in individuals with common knee disorders, categorized by effect size. Methods Five electronic databases were searched for studies related to exercise and the 3 diagnoses. Means and standard deviations were used to calculate effect sizes for the exercise groups. The overall quality of evidence was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results Five hundred eighty-three studies were found after the initial search, and 45 were included for analysis after screening. Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale scores were "fair" quality and ranged from 3 to 8. For knee osteoarthritis, 24 total therapeutic exercise sessions and 8- and 12-week durations of exercise were parameters most often associated with large effects. An exercise frequency of once per week was associated with no effect. No trends were seen with exercise dosing for patellar tendinopathy and patellofemoral pain. Conclusion This review suggests that there are clinically relevant exercise dosing variables that result in improved pain and function for patients with knee osteoarthritis, but optimal dosing is still unclear for patellar tendinopathy and patellofemoral pain. Prospective studies investigating dosing parameters are needed to confirm the results from this systematic review. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 1a. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(3):146–161.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^115R8yGV]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Patellar Tendinitis

There are few, low-quality studies investigating injectable biologics for patellar tendinitis. A review highlighted best practices in patellar tendinopathy treatment, suggesting that PRP may not provide additional benefit beyond conventional therapy. Studies suggest that this may be due to lack of consistent methodology on dose, frequency, and timing coupled with variable patient selection criteria. Two small studies report the use of MSCs in patellar tendinopathy. Pascual-Garrido et al treated eight patients and reported high patient satisfaction with the treatment at five years. Conversely, Rodas et al failed to demonstrate the superiority of MSCs compared to PRP treatment, although it should be noted that both arms had improvements in reported pain and function scores.

Consensus Point 11. There is inconsistent and conflicting evidence from low-quality studies on the use of PRP and injectable biologics for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy. Our appraisal suggests that injectable biologics are not recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy (Level II-3, Grade D).

### Therapeutic interventions in children and adolescents with patellar tendon related pain: a systematic review [^115J41Sz]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patellar tendon related pain conditions are common in children and adolescents, appear to begin in childhood and increase in prevalence during adolescence up to age 18. Patellar tendon related pain is an umbrella term, which encompasses Osgood-Schlatter's disease (OSD), Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease and patellar tendinopathy. OSD affects 1 in 10 adolescents and as many as 1 in 5 in certain sports. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence relating to prognosis.

In one prospective cohort study in 18 adolescents with OSD, even 2 years after initial diagnosis, over 60% demonstrated persistent patellar tendon changes (evaluated by ultrasonography) and continued to display deficits in functional performance. Individuals with a history of OSD can experience persistent pain, years later, in their early 20s, associated with OSD lesions, underscoring that these pain complaints may not go away on their own if treated with a 'wait and see' approach. Interventions which reliably improve long-term outcomes are needed.

While there is a large body of randomised trials and high-quality systematic reviews for managing patellar tendon related disorders in adults, there is a complete lack of systematic evaluations of treatment strategies specifically for adolescents and children. Considering patellar tendon related pain seem to start around the age of 10, there is a need for evidence and syntheses specific to this population. This is especially important considering some of these patellar tendon related pain complaints are unique to adolescent period, for example, Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome and OSD.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review (and if possible, meta-analysis) of the benefits and harms of different treatment options for patella tendon related pain in children and adolescents.

### Association between physical tests and patients-reported outcomes in athletes performing exercise therapy for patellar tendinopathy: a secondary analysis of the JUMPER study [^113hjpX1]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

The study was designed (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02938143) and conducted at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Erasmus MC University Medical Center, and all patients provided written informed consent before participation. Patients were enrolled from January 2017 to July 2019. For this specific study, we adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology guidelines for reporting cohort studies and to the minimum reporting standards for tendinopathy studies according to the International Consensus (ICON) Statement for Tendinopathy. This study is a secondary analysis using data from the JUMPER study, a large clinical randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effect of progressive tendon-loading exercises (PTLEs) and eccentric exercise therapy (EET) in athletes with PT for 24 weeks. The PLTE program consisted of 4 stages: isometric, isotonic, energy storage, and sport-specific exercises. Patients undergoing the EET program served as a control group, and this program consisted of 2 stages: a pain-provoking single-leg squat on a decline board with a 25° slope and sport-specific exercises. When patients completed the sport-specific exercises, they were advised to perform maintenance exercises during the return-to-sports phase. Both exercise programs had a minimum duration of 24 weeks. Additionally, patients were asked to perform exercises targeting risk factors for PT in both study arms. The common treatment principles for tendinopathy involving education and load management advice were given in both groups. Details about the exercise programs, education, and load management advice can be found in the supplementary files of a previously published work.

Participants

Consecutive patients aged 18 to 35 years with the diagnosis of PT were enrolled. The main inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of PT (pain on loading and palpation pain on the inferior part of the patella), which had to be confirmed by ultrasound findings (tendon structural changes or anterior-posterior thickness > 6 mm in grayscale ultrasound and or increased vascularity by power Doppler), and patients with < 80 of 100 points on the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Patella (VISA-P) questionnaire. The main exclusion criteria were other coexisting knee pathologies and a history of joint injection therapy in the preceding 12 months. Further details about the eligibility criteria are provided in(available in the online version of this article).

### Iatrogenic medial patellar instability: an avoidable injury [^114pqf3W]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic medial patellar instability is a specific condition that frequently causes incapacitating anterior knee pain, severe disability, and serious psychological problems. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient who has undergone previous patellar realignment surgery that has made the pain worse. The diagnosis can be established by physical examination and simple therapeutic tests (e.g., "reverse" McConnell taping) and confirmed by imaging techniques. This iatrogenic condition should no longer exist and could almost be eliminated by avoiding over-release of the lateral retinaculum.

### Acute patellar tendon ruptures: an update on management [^112bx5Ng]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Patellar tendon ruptures can be debilitating injuries. When incomplete, partial tears can be managed nonsurgically with immobilization and progressive rehabilitation. Although complete ruptures remain a relatively uncommon injury, they portend a high level of morbidity. Ruptures typically result from an acute mechanical overload to the extensor mechanism, such as with forced quadriceps contraction and knee flexion. However, chronically degenerated tendons are also predisposed to failure from low-energy injuries. Diagnosis can often be made clinically with recognition of a palpable defect to the tendon, localized patellar tendon tenderness, and inability to actively extend the knee. Diagnosis and surgical planning can be established with radiograph, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical repair is the mainstay of treatment, and there have been many recent advances in repair technique, optimal reconstruction strategies, and supplemental fixation. Time to surgery for complete tears remains the most important prognosticator for success. Direct primary repair can be completed with transosseous tunnels, suture anchor repair, or end-to-end repair. Tendon reconstruction can be achieved with or without mechanical or biologic augments. Rehabilitation programs vary in specifics, but return to sport can be expected by 6 months postoperatively.

### Evidence of abnormal anteroposterior patellar tilt in patients with patellar tendinitis with use of a new radiographic measurement [^111hAMYN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A number of clinical conditions of the patellofemoral joint have been correlated with abnormal patellofemoral radiographic measurements.

Hypothesis

An abnormal anteroposterior patellar-tilt angle may be a contributing factor to pathologic conditions of the knee.

Study Design

Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial.

Methods

The anteroposterior patellar-tilt angle was measured in cadaveric knees to determine the best knee position. The radiographs of normal subjects and patients with patellar tendinitis or patellofemoral pain syndrome were examined for differences in patellar-tilt angle.

Results

Cadaveric measurements demonstrated highest intertester and intratester reliability at 30 degrees of knee flexion and neutral femoral rotation. Intratester measurements on normal subjects exhibited high reliability, with a mean anteroposterior tilt angle of 30.8 degrees ± 6.7 degrees. In the patellofemoral pain group the mean anteroposterior tilt angle was 29.1 degrees ± 8.5 degrees; however, for patients with patellar tendinitis, it was 25.6 degrees ± 7.0 degrees, significantly lower than in the normal population. Furthermore, there was no difference between the angles of involved and uninvolved knees of patients with unilateral patellar tendinitis.

Conclusion

The anteroposterior patellar-tilt angle is a clinically reliable measurement of patellar tilt in the sagittal plane that can be used to study patellofemoral tilt in a variety of clinical situations. The results of this study demonstrate that patients with patellar tendinitis have abnormal patellar tilt in the sagittal plane.

For VISA-P, the intervention with the highest median rank was hyaluronic acid injection+eccentric exercise and that with the lowest median rank was concentric exercise (figure 5B).

Only two comparisons included evidence from both direct and indirect estimates (eccentric exercise versus concentric exercise and ESWT+eccentric exercise versus sham ESWT+eccentric exercise). The results of the network estimates for all comparisons for both pain VAS and VISA-P were of low or very low strength of evidence due to the high overall risk of bias, imprecision and intransitivity; the only results of moderate strength of evidence were the direct estimates of the comparison between ESWT+eccentric exercise and sham ESWT+eccentric exercise presented above in the pairwise meta-analyses.

Materials and methods

This case-control study in Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands, was approved by the institutional review board. Participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion. We performed cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a prospective trial investigating two different exercise programs for PT (, ID: NCT02938143).

Study participants

Participants were consecutively enrolled. National sports federations and regional healthcare providers facilitated recruitment. Athletes performing sports involving frequent jumping or cutting maneuvers were eligible. Potential subjects underwent initial online screening to assess the location of tenderness on a self-reported pain map. The Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment questionnaire for patellar tendons (VISA-P) was administered to measure symptoms, function, and ability to play sports. A VISA-P < 80 was one of the inclusion criteria for PT. All eligibility criteria are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

PT, patellar tendinopathy; VISA-P, Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment questionnaire for patellar tendons; PDUS, power Doppler ultrasound

Inclusion protocol

Jumping athletes with suspected PT and asymptomatic athletes were invited to our hospital to confirm eligibility. Clinical evaluation was performed by a sports physician (R.V.) with 10 years' experience, and athletes were regarded positive for PT if tenderness at the inferior patellar pole or patellar tendon could be reproduced on palpation and a single-leg squat. Provocation tests of the patellofemoral joint were performed to exclude patellofemoral pain. Subsequently, GSUS and power Doppler US (PDUS) were performed to verify the clinical diagnosis. US criteria for PT were presence of structural and/or hypoechoic changes and/or tendon thickening (anterior-posterior diameter > 6 mm) and/or the presence of intratendinous Doppler flow. We defined our reference standard for having PT as a clinical diagnosis with affirmative findings on GSUS and/or PDUS. For athletes with bilateral PT, the individual selected the most painful side. Asymptomatic athletes who had a maximum VISA-P score (100/100) and no history of anterior knee pain or diagnosis of PT were used as controls (Table 1). GSUS and PDUS were acquired, but findings were not an eligibility criterion in this group. Weight and height measures were used to calculate body mass index (kg/m 2). Activity level was assessed using the Cincinnati Sports Activity Scale (CSAS).

### Patellar tendinosis as an adaptive process: a new hypothesis [^112WTr4m]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patellar tendinosis (PT), or "jumper's knee" is a common condition in athletes participating in jumping sports, and is characterised by proximal patellar tendon pain and focal tenderness to palpation. Hypoechoic lesions observed in the proximal patellar tendon associated with the tendinosis are typically described as being a result of degenerative change or "failed healing". We propose a new model for the development of the hypoechoic lesion observed in PT, in which the aetiology is an adaptive response to differential forces within the tendon.

Methods

We assessed the clinical, histopathological, and biomechanical literature surrounding the patellar tendon and integrated this with research into the response of tendons to differential forces.

Results and Conclusions

We propose that the hypoechoic lesion commonly described in PT is the result of adaptation or partial adaptation of the proximal patellar tendon to a compressive load. We postulate that the biomechanics of the patellar-patellar tendon interface creates this compressive environment. Secondary failure of the surrounding tensile adapted tendon tissue may result in tissue overload and failure, with resultant stimulation of nociceptors. We believe that this "adaptive model" of patellar tendinosis is consistent with the clinical and histological findings.
