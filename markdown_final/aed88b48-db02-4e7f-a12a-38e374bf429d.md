## Question

How does spirometry help in diagnosing asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how spirometry helps in diagnosing asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic anchor for asthma and where spirometry fits. Then, I should verify the core spirometric abnormalities and the bronchodilator reversibility thresholds. Next, I will examine the diagnostic algorithm and where spirometry sits in the flow. After that, I need to check limitations, including false negatives and the need for repeat testing or provocation. Then, I will review adjunctive tests like FeNO and PEF variability. I should also consider special populations and feasibility constraints. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and close with the clinical impact and key takeaways, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor so I don't jump to conclusions: asthma is a clinical diagnosis characterized by variable respiratory symptoms and objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and guidelines emphasize documenting the latter rather than relying on symptoms alone, which is exactly where spirometry becomes central to confirming the diagnosis [^1148j9QB] [^115ppn5R] [^113LT73i].

> I will now examine the core spirometric abnormalities that support asthma; wait, let me verify the key indices and thresholds. Obstruction is suggested by a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio below the lower limit of normal or below 0.70 in adults, and variable airflow limitation is supported by a post-bronchodilator increase in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL from baseline, which is the conventional diagnostic threshold adopted by GINA and commonly used in practice, although a technical standards committee proposed a > 10% predicted change that GINA has not adopted for diagnostic decisions pending more data [^117NCPzZ] [^112HHJDS] [^117WmeDa].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic algorithm so I don't misplace spirometry in the sequence. The recommended flow is to assess whether symptoms are typical of asthma, then obtain objective lung function testing, preferably spirometry with bronchodilator response; if spirometry is not available, peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring can substitute, but it is less reliable and should be interpreted carefully due to meter variability and effort dependence [^115spWrp] [^112bSiM5] [^111aC4up].

> Next, I should review how to interpret results and what to do when spirometry is normal. Let me think about this carefully. If spirometry shows obstruction with reversibility, that supports asthma; if spirometry is normal, asthma is not excluded because variable airflow limitation may be intermittent, so repeating spirometry when symptomatic, withholding bronchodilators appropriately, or proceeding to bronchoprovocation testing can increase diagnostic yield; marked reversibility (> 12% and > 400 mL) strongly favors asthma and is less typical of COPD, which helps in differential diagnosis [^116i3ybZ] [^11792zsF] [^117NCPzZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on inhaled corticosteroids or is well controlled? I need to ensure I account for that. Once ICS-containing therapy is started, variability of symptoms and lung function decreases, making confirmation harder; guidelines advise documenting the diagnosis before initiating ICS whenever possible, and if uncertainty persists, consider stepping down therapy or repeating testing under controlled conditions to unmask variability [^116i3ybZ] [^116aN6nP].

> I should double-check the role of adjunctive tests when spirometry is nondiagnostic. FeNO is a conditional adjunct in patients aged 5 years and older when the diagnosis remains uncertain after history, exam, and spirometry; high FeNO supports T2/eosinophilic inflammation and ICS responsiveness, but low FeNO helps rule out T2 asthma and FeNO should not be used alone to diagnose asthma; in children, thresholds around ≥ 35 ppb support asthma likelihood when integrated with other objective findings [^113MyjHg] [^111rLE4B] [^116Gifhy].

> Let me consider PEF variability as a fallback when spirometry is unavailable. I need to ensure I state the limitations clearly. Excessive diurnal PEF variability (> 20% over 1–2 weeks on the same meter) can support variable airflow limitation, but PEF is less reliable than spirometry, devices vary, and a normal PEF does not exclude asthma. GINA still prefers spirometry and cautions against relying on PEF alone for diagnosis [^112bSiM5] [^115spWrp] [^116p8Y8d].

> Next, I should review special populations and feasibility so I don't overgeneralize. In children under 5, objective testing is limited. Diagnosis is largely clinical with therapeutic trials, and spirometry becomes feasible and recommended from about age 5. In older adults, age-adjusted interpretation is essential to avoid overcalling obstruction. In primary care, underuse of spirometry is common due to access, training, and time constraints, which contributes to misdiagnosis and underscores the need for structured diagnostic pathways and, where needed, community diagnostic hubs [^114BtFWA] [^114q6oiM] [^115bdX5g] [^114Jv9xW] [^113ZhC95].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical, stepwise approach I'm proposing so it aligns with guidelines. Start with a careful history to establish pretest probability, perform spirometry with adequate bronchodilator withholding when feasible, interpret for obstruction and reversibility, and if normal or nondiagnostic, repeat when symptomatic or proceed to bronchoprovocation; integrate FeNO or PEF variability when uncertainty persists, and avoid anchoring on a single test or on symptoms alone; this multifaceted, objective-first strategy reduces both over- and underdiagnosis [^1148j9QB] [^115ppn5R] [^113LT73i].

> I need to ensure I address the clinical impact of actually using spirometry rather than assuming it changes practice. Routine spirometry changes management decisions in a meaningful proportion of patients, including children, and improves diagnostic certainty. Nonetheless, it remains underutilized in primary care, and when combined with structured care pathways, access to spirometry can reduce referrals and improve alignment with guideline-concordant care, though outcomes data are mixed and implementation quality matters [^1132n3m2] [^112PjVUd] [^113ZhC95] [^114Jv9xW].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to avoid overstatement. Spirometry is the preferred first-line objective test to document variable expiratory airflow limitation in suspected asthma, but a normal spirometry does not exclude asthma. Diagnosis often requires serial testing, bronchoprovocation, or adjunctive measures, and confirmation should be sought before initiating long-term ICS when possible to preserve diagnostic clarity and guide appropriate therapy [^1148j9QB] [^115ppn5R] [^113LT73i].

Spirometry helps diagnose asthma by documenting **variable expiratory airflow limitation** — the physiological hallmark of asthma [^115ppn5R] — via a **post-bronchodilator FEV1 increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL** [^112HHJDS] or by showing **excessive variability** in lung function [^111XtitB]. Because spirometry can be normal between episodes, a normal result does not exclude asthma; if suspicion remains high, **repeat spirometry, peak-flow monitoring, or bronchoprovocation testing** is indicated [^1147h6Tf] [^1148j9QB]. Spirometry is recommended for all patients with suspected asthma when feasible, and is especially important to distinguish asthma from COPD and other causes of dyspnea [^113LT73i] [^114Ze2M6].

## Key spirometric findings in asthma

Spirometry measures **forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)** and **forced vital capacity (FVC)**; the **FEV1/FVC ratio** helps identify obstruction. In asthma, the hallmark is **variable expiratory airflow limitation**, demonstrated by one or more of the following:

| **Spirometric finding** | **Definition** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Reduced FEV1/FVC ratio | < 0.70 or below the lower limit of normal (LLN) | Indicates airflow limitation, consistent with asthma |
| Bronchodilator reversibility | Increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline after bronchodilator | Confirms variable airflow limitation, highly suggestive of asthma |
| Normal spirometry | FEV1/FVC ratio within normal limits | Does not exclude asthma; obstruction may be intermittent or absent at the time of testing |

## Diagnostic criteria for asthma using spirometry

According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and other guidelines, asthma is diagnosed when a patient has **typical respiratory symptoms** (wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough) and **objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^115ppn5R]. Spirometry provides this objective evidence through **bronchodilator reversibility** — a post-bronchodilator increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline — or by demonstrating **excessive variability** in lung function (e.g. variation in FEV1 > 20% between visits or over time) [^111XtitB].

---

## Limitations and challenges of spirometry in asthma diagnosis

While spirometry is valuable, it has limitations:

- **Normal results**: Patients with mild or well-controlled asthma may have normal spirometry between exacerbations, so a normal test does not exclude asthma [^112rNsHe].
- **False positives**: Bronchodilator reversibility can occur in other conditions (e.g. COPD, bronchiectasis), so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^113d5NE3].
- **Patient factors**: Young children, elderly, and those with cognitive or physical limitations may have difficulty performing spirometry accurately [^115bdX5g].
- **Technical factors**: Poor technique, improper calibration, or lack of trained personnel can affect accuracy [^111s8CFa].

---

## Adjunctive tests when spirometry is inconclusive

When spirometry is inconclusive or unavailable, **additional tests** can help confirm asthma:

- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring**: Documenting diurnal variability (> 20%) over 1–2 weeks supports asthma [^notfound].
- **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**: Elevated FeNO (> 35 ppb in adults, > 20 ppb in children) suggests eosinophilic inflammation, consistent with asthma [^notfound].
- **Bronchoprovocation testing**: Methacholine or mannitol challenge can identify airway hyperresponsiveness when spirometry is normal but suspicion remains high [^117AGe3D].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize the **importance of spirometry** in asthma diagnosis:

- **GINA 2024**: Recommends spirometry as the preferred initial test to document variable airflow limitation; if spirometry is unavailable, use PEF monitoring or bronchoprovocation testing [^116i3ybZ].
- **ERS 2022**: Recommends spirometry as part of the diagnostic work-up in adults with suspected asthma [^113LT73i].
- **NHLBI 2020**: Recommends FeNO as an adjunct when the diagnosis is uncertain or spirometry cannot be performed [^113MyjHg].

---

## Clinical scenarios where spirometry is particularly useful

Spirometry is especially helpful in the following scenarios:

- **Differentiating asthma from COPD**: Asthma typically shows reversible airflow limitation, whereas COPD shows fixed obstruction [^114Ze2M6].
- **Assessing severity and monitoring control**: Serial spirometry helps track disease progression and response to therapy [^117NCPzZ].
- **Identifying alternative diagnoses**: Spirometry can reveal patterns suggestive of other respiratory conditions (e.g. restrictive lung disease, upper airway obstruction) [^117NCPzZ].

---

Spirometry is a **cornerstone of asthma diagnosis**, providing objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation. While it has limitations, combining spirometry with clinical assessment and adjunctive tests ensures accurate diagnosis and optimal management.

### Office spirometry: indications and interpretation [^117NCPzZ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

High-quality, office-based spirometry provides diagnostic information as useful and reliable as testing performed in a pulmonary function laboratory. Spirometry may be used to monitor progression of lung disease and response to therapy. A stepwise approach to spirometry allows for ease and reliability of interpretation. Airway obstruction is suspected when there is a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, but there is no strong evidence to clearly define what constitutes a significant decrease in this ratio. A low FVC is defined as a value below the 5th percentile in adults or less than 80% of predicted in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FVC are used together to identify obstructive defects and restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive defects should be assessed for reversibility, as indicated by an improvement of the FEV1 or FVC by at least 12% and 0.2 L in adults, or by more than 12% in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. FEV1 is used to determine the severity of obstructive and restrictive disease, although the values were arbitrarily determined and are not based on evidence from patient outcomes. Bronchoprovocation testing may be used if spirometry results are normal and allergen- or exercise-induced asthma is suspected. For patients with an FEV1 less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a short-acting bronchodilator may be tried instead of bronchoprovocation testing.

This study describes the current approach of determining the probability of asthma based on a clinical assessment corroborated by peak expiratory flow measurements, spirometry and/or a trial of treatment. Challenges related to time and resource pressures in general practice and the overlapping features of asthma with other conditions. Future models of care need to provide cost-effective access to accurate (potentially novel) tests, and institute diagnostic services that guide clinicians through evidence-based algorithms and that reflect our evolving understanding of asthma and its phenotypes are needed.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders of childhood. The typical symptoms are a result of reversible airway obstruction. There is no 'gold-standard' test to diagnose asthma, but the most commonly used investigation to help with a diagnosis is spirometry. This article outlines some of the technical aspects of spirometry together with how the forced expiration manoeuver and bronchodilator responsiveness testing can be performed and interpreted in a child with suspected asthma.

### Diagnostic differentiation between asthma and COPD in primary care using lung function testing [^115Raemb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we looked at which patient characteristics distinguish between patients diagnosed with asthma or COPD, and established the added value of spirometry and of more advanced lung function measurements when differentiating between the two chronic airways diseases. Although asthma and COPD are both heterogenous conditions with multiple overlapping features, there are important clinical differences as well. We observed that in the scenario using only medical history questions, it is already possible to reliably distinguish between asthma and COPD. The most important factors to aid differentiation are smoking behaviour, certain respiratory symptoms and the presence of allergies. The use of postbronchodilator spirometry provided important additional discriminative power in correctly labelling a patient as having asthma or COPD. More advanced diagnostic tests that are mainly used in secondary care, such as measuring bronchial hyperresponsiveness and diffusion capacity, did not provide a better differentiation in this primary care study population.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117WmeDa]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma diagnosis — GINA 2024 updates for clinical practice state that the diagnostic flowchart has been revised to accommodate limited access to spirometry, that peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry but better than relying on symptoms alone, and that the flowchart allows selection of different initial lung function tests with clarified criteria for variable expiratory airflow limitation and more details about bronchodilator withholding; GINA has not adopted the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society proposal to change bronchodilator responsiveness from an increase from baseline of ≥ 12% and 200 mL to > 10% predicted for diagnosis, noting the committee avoided diagnostic recommendations and that further population and outcome data will be considered.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116i3ybZ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis confirmation in suspected difficult-to-treat asthma — spirometry, thresholds, and bronchodilator withholding: Confirmation of the diagnosis is important, because in 12–50% of people assumed to have severe asthma, asthma is not found to be the correct diagnosis; perform spirometry, before and after bronchodilator, to assess baseline lung function and seek objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and if initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing is negative (≤ 200 mL or ≤ 12% increase in FEV1), consider repeating after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic or stepping controller treatment before further investigations such as bronchial provocation testing; check full flow-volume curve to assess for upper airway obstruction; if spirometry is normal or is not available, provide a peak flow meter and diary and consider bronchial provocation testing if able to withhold bronchodilators (short-acting beta2 agonist [SABA] for at least 6 hours, LABA for up to 2 days depending on duration of action).

### A stepwise approach to the interpretation of pulmonary function tests [^117AGe3D]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Office-based pulmonary function testing, also known as spirometry, is a powerful tool for primary care physicians to diagnose and manage respiratory problems. An obstructive defect is indicated by a low forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, which is defined as less than 70% or below the fifth percentile based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in adults, and less than 85% in patients five to 18 years of age. If an obstructive defect is present, the physician should determine if the disease is reversible based on the increase in FEV1 or FVC after bronchodilator treatment (i.e., increase of more than 12% in patients five to 18 years of age, or more than 12% and more than 200 mL in adults). Asthma is typically reversible, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not. A restrictive pattern is indicated by an FVC below the fifth percentile based on NHANES III data in adults, or less than 80% in patients five to 18 years of age. If a restrictive pattern is present, full pulmonary function tests with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide testing should be ordered to confirm restrictive lung disease and form a differential diagnosis. If both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the FVC are low, the patient has a mixed defect. The severity of the abnormality is determined by the FEV1 (percentage of predicted). If pulmonary function test results are normal, but the physician still suspects exercise- or allergen-induced asthma, bronchoprovocation (e.g., methacholine challenge, mannitol inhalation challenge, exercise testing) should be considered.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112bSiM5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — LMIC diagnosis and confirmation: GINA does not recommend that diagnosis of asthma should be solely based on syndromic clinical patterns, and suggests lung function testing with a PEF meter if spirometry is not available. When spirometry is not available, the presence of variable expiratory airflow limitation can be confirmed by PEF, and before starting long-term ICS-containing treatment, the following investigations can help to confirm the diagnosis of asthma or prompt investigation for alternative diagnoses: ≥ 20% improvement in PEF 15 minutes after giving 2 puffs of albuterol, or improvement in symptoms and PEF after a 4-week therapeutic trial with ICS-containing treatment; either of these findings would increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of asthma versus other diagnoses. The World Health Organization (WHO) Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary care lists the PEF meter as an essential tool in the management of chronic respiratory diseases.

### Novel measure of lung function for assessing disease activity in asthma [^115YNXJM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In asthma, lung function measures, such as spirometry, are often discordant with the clinical assessment of disease activity, as determined by symptoms, exacerbation frequency and response to treatment. There is no single diagnostic test for asthma, and both clinical assessment of symptoms and objective tests can produce false positives and false negatives. Spirometry may be normal in patients with active airways disease, and the diagnosis of asthma, for example, may require multiple measurements over time to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction. In addition, age-related changes in FEV 1 or fixed airflow obstruction may lead to overdiagnosis or treatment in older people. This disparity, alongside the fact that primary care clinicians may not have access to reliable lung function testing at the point of clinical decision-making, often leads clinicians to adopt a no-test approach to diagnosis and treatment.

Recently, Mountain et al. described a new approach to lung function testing that involved assessing the inhomogeneity of gas exchange in the lung. This study is a first look at whether this technique has the potential to provide a better measure of disease activity in the lungs of asthmatic patients than standard spirometry.

### Asthma over the age of 65: all's well that ends well [^1111Sf7P]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma in older adults (often classified as those 65 years or older) is relatively common, underdiagnosed, and suboptimally treated. It is an important health problem, as the population of the United States continues to age. Unfortunately, asthma morbidity and mortality rates are highest in this age group. Alterations in the innate and adaptive immune responses occur with aging, and contribute to pathophysiologic differences and subsequent treatment challenges. The symptoms of asthma may differ from those in younger populations, and often include fatigue. There are unique factors that can complicate asthma management among older adults, including comorbidities, menopause, caregiver roles, and depression. Pharmacologic therapies are often not as effective as in younger populations, and may have greater side effects. Spirometry, peak flow measurements, and asthma education are typically underused, and may contribute to delays in diagnosis as well as worse outcomes. There are specific strategies that health care providers can take to improve the care of older adults with asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112fY8Gw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

The role of an increased level of Fin the diagnosis of asthma is still evolving, and no definitive test exists for diagnosing asthma. Fmeasurement may support a diagnosis of asthma in individuals for whom the diagnosis is uncertain even after a complete history, physical examination, and spirometry testing including bronchodilator responsiveness. Recognition of allergen sensitivity is extremely important for interpreting Flevels. Allergic rhinitis and atopy, which can be present in individuals with and without asthma, are associated with increased Flevels, and taking these factors into consideration is critical for accurately interpreting Ftest results.

On the basis of current data on Fmeasurement in clinical settings, Ftesting has a supportive role in evaluation when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain. The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for use of Ftesting in asthma diagnosis:
Individuals in whom a diagnosis of asthma is being considered who may benefit from Fmeasurement as part of the evaluation process include the following: Those aged 5 years and older who have an uncertain diagnosis of asthma Those in whom spirometry testing cannot be performed accurately
Because the data on the diagnostic accuracy of Fmeasurement in children younger than 4 years are not conclusive, Fmeasurement in this age group should not be used.
Ftest results should not be used alone to diagnose asthma. Fmeasurements can serve as an adjunct test that may aid in diagnosing asthma in the appropriate setting. After clinicians consider other conditions that may influence Flevels, they should perform the test when the results of a thorough clinical assessment, including other appropriate tests, are inconclusive.
Clinicians should use the cutoff levels or ranges listed in Table II for Fmeasurement when evaluating persons for asthma. The likelihood that individuals aged 5 years and older have asthma increases by 2.8 to 7.0 times when the Ftest result is high. Clinicians who use Ftesting for asthma diagnosis should keep the following considerations in mind: Flevels of less than 25 parts per billion (ppb) (or < 20 ppb in children aged 5–12 years) are inconsistent with T2 inflammation and suggest a diagnosis other than asthma (or that the individual has asthma but their T2 inflammation has been managed with corticosteroids or they have non-T2 inflammation or noneosinophilic asthma). Flevels greater than 50 ppb (or > 35 ppb in children aged 5–12 years) are consistent with elevated T2 inflammation and support a diagnosis of asthma. Individuals who have T2 inflammation are more likely to respond to corticosteroid treatment. Flevels of 25 ppb to 50 ppb (or 20–35 ppb in children aged 5–12 years) provide little information on the diagnosis of asthma and should be interpreted with caution and attention to the clinical context. The specificity and sensitivity of the Ftesting process depend on the clinical situation. However, in corticosteroid-naive individuals with asthma, Fmeasurement is most accurate for ruling out the diagnosis of asthma when the result is less than 20 ppb. In this situation, the test has a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.77, and a diagnostic odds ratio (OR) of 12.25. ICS treatment should not be withheld solely based on low Flevels.
Fmeasurements should be performed by appropriately trained personnel who have extensive experience in interpreting the result or who consult experienced clinicians who can interpret the findings accurately. Ftesting can be performed in primary or specialty care settings. However, the costs of testing (ie, for equipment and expendable supplies) may prohibit the test's adoption in the primary care office setting. Cost and the need for reproducible maneuvers will need to be addressed before home testing can become feasible.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should share the following information about Ftesting with individuals suspected of having asthma and caregivers: The Fmeasurement process is safe for almost everyone. Ftesting may be helpful in determining whether an individual has asthma, but it cannot be used to diagnose asthma. Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma who have conditions or behaviors (such as smoking) that could affect the interpretation of the Ftest results that these issues could limit the accuracy of diagnostic attempts. Ftest results cannot be used in isolation. Their interpretation must take into account other clinical factors and traditional measures. The evidence favors the use of Fmeasurement as an adjunct to other diagnostic methods (including a structured history, clinical findings, and pulmonary function testing) when the results from these other measures are not conclusive. Decisions about treatment with an ICS are not dependent on Fmeasurements, but such measurements may help direct stepwise therapeutic choices.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111aC4up]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Lung function testing is essential — use lung function testing to confirm the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation and variable expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is preferably performed at the initial assessment; in cases of clinical urgency it may be delayed to a subsequent visit, but confirmation of diagnosis may be more difficult once patients are started on ICS-containing therapy. Early confirmation (or exclusion) of the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation may avoid needless trials of therapy or delays in initiating other investigations. Measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) on the same meter over a period of 1–2 weeks may help to confirm reversible airflow limitation and the diagnosis of asthma by demonstrating excessive variability; however, PEF is not as reliable as spirometry, and a normal PEF does not rule out either asthma or COPD. Consider alternative diagnoses; the above approach to diagnosis does not replace the need for a full assessment to first exclude non-respiratory diagnoses such as heart failure, and physical examination may provide supportive information.

### Distinguishing asthma and COPD in primary care: a case-based approach [^114Ze2M6]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect more than 40 million Americans, cost more than $100 billion annually, and together constitute the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. Distinguishing between asthma and COPD can be difficult; accurate diagnosis requires spirometry that demonstrates a characteristic pattern. Asthma is diagnosed if airway obstruction on spirometry is reversible (greater than 12% and greater than 200 mL improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) with administration of bronchodilators or through the observation of bronchoconstriction (reduction in FEV1 of 20% or greater) with a methacholine challenge. COPD is diagnosed if airway obstruction (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] ratio less than 70%) on spirometry is not reversible with bronchodilators. Although not considered a separate diagnosis, asthma-COPD overlap can be a useful clinical descriptor for patients displaying diagnostic features of both diseases. In these cases, spirometry will show reversibility after administration of bronchodilators, which is consistent with asthma, and the persistent baseline airflow limitation that is more characteristic of COPD. Treatment should follow Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. In patients with asthma-COPD overlap, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines, but pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches specific to COPD may also be needed.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the asthmas [^111mun6e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimizing asthma diagnosis is an essential part of global strategies to reduce the excessive illness burden from asthma. New understanding about how to address the complexity and heterogeneity of the different forms of asthma means that asthma diagnosis now requires a compound diagnostic approach and label. Eliciting the typical symptoms and abnormal physiology of variable airflow limitation permits the recognition of asthma, and the identification of further features, such as eosinophilic or type 2 inflammation, allows a compound diagnostic label of eosinophilic asthma. This conveys key information about future exacerbation risk and likely treatment responsiveness. Treatable traits are a useful way to implement this new approach to diagnosis. Targeted assessment is used to inform a specific treatment plan in a pragmatic and iterative process.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HHJDS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds for diagnosis — states that in adults with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline, or if spirometry is not available a change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with asthma. A Technical Standards Committee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator responsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 12% and > 200 mL to an increase from baseline of > 10% of the patient's predicted value; this recommendation was based on data for survival, and the Technical Standards Committee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115VJ7PH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to feNO testing, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend to do not use fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement alone to assess asthma control, predict future exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity in ≥ 5 years old patients with asthma. Ensure that it is a part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy, if used.

### Novel measure of lung function for assessing disease activity in asthma [^113jRB51]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In asthma, spirometric measurements associated with airways resistance are often discordant with other clinical features of disease activity or control.

This study demonstrates that a novel technology measuring the evenness of lung expansion and contraction can reflect these clinical features better than spirometry.

A reliable, objective measure of disease activity in asthma would be very valuable for both patient management and clinical research.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113d5NE3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

### Sensitivity of FEVand clinical parameters in children with a suspected asthma diagnosis [^114AEmK5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and a robust diagnosis is crucial to optimize patient care and reduce its burden. To diagnose asthma in children, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommendations propose a 12% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) after a bronchodilation test. Nevertheless, such a criterion is rarely confirmed in these patients in clinical practice.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of spirometric and clinical parameters in identifying children with possible asthma.

Methods

The VERI-VEMS Study is a multicenter international retrospective cohort study. Data were collected, from January 2008 until January 2019, for all consecutive children (aged 5–18 years), with a diagnosis of asthma, who performed a spirometry at the time of the diagnosis. We compared the sensitivity of the reversibility criterion proposed by GINA guidelines, with other spirometric and clinical variables, using physician-diagnosed asthma and response to treatment as the standard.

Results

The study included 871 children. The reversibility criterion of 12% of FEV 1 showed a sensitivity of 30.4%. The 3 best spirometric or clinical criteria were the presence of dry cough, or wheezing or atopy and dry cough, or wheezing or exercise-induced dyspnea, with a sensitivity reaching 99.5%, with no added value of the spirometric parameters in the calculation of the cumulated sensitivity for the diagnosis of pediatric asthma.

Conclusions

Postbronchodilator reversibility of 12%, although essential for patients' follow-up, has an insufficient low sensitivity in reaching a diagnosis of asthma in pediatric patients, compared with a combination of clinical symptoms, that show a better sensitivity. Further studies on specificity will help clarify the role of this change in the diagnostic paradigm in formally diagnosing children with asthma.

### Introduction to pulmonary function [^114TSFKA]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a dynamic and complex inflammatory disease. Recent research suggests that it is a manifestation of a systemic disorder of the entire respiratory system including both upper and lower airways. The diagnosis of asthma can be made based on clinical history, physical findings, and pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. In children, spirometry may be difficult; therefore, diurnal changes in peak expiratory flow rate can be used instead to assist in the diagnosis of asthma. Increasing the use of objective pulmonary measures will help better identify and monitor treatment of lower respiratory inflammatory disease.

### What is the best pulmonary diagnostic approach for wheezing patients with normal spirometry? [^1147h6Tf]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and variable air flow obstruction. The diagnosis of asthma, however, is often based upon nonspecific clinical symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, the physical examination and measurements of pulmonary function are often unremarkable in patients with asthma, thereby complicating the diagnosis of the disease. The following discussion will review approaches to the diagnosis of asthma when lung functions are normal, and will largely focus on the use of bronchial provocation tests to detect underlying AHR.

Lung function assessment timing — Lung function should be assessed at diagnosis or start of treatment, after 3–6 months of ICS-containing treatment to assess the patient's personal best FEV1, and periodically thereafter. In most adult patients, lung function should be recorded at least every 1–2 years, but more frequently in higher risk patients including those with exacerbations and those at risk of decline in lung function; lung function should also be recorded more frequently in children based on asthma severity and clinical course (Evidence D). Once the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed, it is not generally necessary to ask patients to withhold their regular or as-needed medications before visits, but preferably the same conditions should apply at each visit.

### Why is spirometry underused in the diagnosis of the breathless patient: a qualitative study [^111DvRqh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are obvious differences between primary and secondary care. A study by Janson et al showed that only 27% of physicians always used spirometry to diagnose asthma, in comparison to 73% of specialists, whilst 68% of primary care doctors used spirometry to monitor patients for asthma compared to 88% of specialists. However, as already discussed, non-respiratory specialists may also overlook or misdiagnose airways narrowing in the absence of spirometry.

At least one other paper has commented that spirometry is not taught to the same level as other diagnostic methods such as undertaking a physical exam or interpreting electrocardiograms. Spirometry should be taught within the clinical context so that its value is apparent to trainees. All our participants commented on the importance of patient-centred teaching and its value. Whilst it has been shown that further education increases the use of spirometry by general practitioners and also improves their capacity to diagnose clearcut pathologies, there is less literature on the teaching of spirometry to junior postgraduates and undergraduate medical students. New methods for teaching spirometry should be evaluated and we have previously shown that e-learning can have advantages in this context and is especially beneficial in helping trainees with data interpretation.

### Diagnostic differentiation between asthma and COPD in primary care using lung function testing [^116R1xQE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both common chronic respiratory diseases affecting approximately 1 in 12 people worldwide. The two conditions are defined as different disease entities with unique pathophysiological mechanisms and characteristic clinical features. The underlying pathophysiology in COPD is characterized predominantly by neutrophilic inflammation, whereas in asthma the inflammatory pattern is mostly due to eosinophilic inflammation. Asthma typically presents with intermittent respiratory symptoms caused by airflow obstruction predominantly due to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Asthma is often presented at younger age as part of an atopic constitution, but can also be diagnosed in adulthood. In contrast, COPD is a slowly progressive lung disease with patients having persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction. In high-income countries like the Netherlands COPD usually presents in patients older than forty who are generally current or former smokers. Patients with asthma or COPD are mostly diagnosed and managed by primary care clinicians.

Looking at the classic pathophysiological and clinical presentations, the distinction between asthma and COPD seems clear, but in clinical practice patients often show features of both diseases. These similarities make it difficult for clinicians to distinguish between asthma and COPD, especially in older and more diverse patient populations encountered in primary care –. However, differentiating between the two respiratory conditions is important as they have different pharmacotherapeutic regimens. In patients with asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are highly effective in reducing symptoms and reducing the risk of asthma-related mortality. In contrast, patients with COPD respond poorly to ICS and are mainly treated with (long-acting) bronchodilators to relieve symptoms. In addition to this, misdiagnosing asthma for COPD could lead to serious health risks considering that monotherapy with long-acting bronchodilators is contra-indicated in asthmatics since it increases the risk of severe exacerbation –. On the other hand, (unnecessary) treatment with ICS may cause pneumonia and increased risk of osteoporosis –.

Thus, establishing a correct diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment of asthma and COPD, but this can be challenging for primary care clinicians. Supporting them in the diagnostic process seems therefore essential, but this also depends on the availability of diagnostic tools. Although quality spirometry has shown to be feasible in primary care settingsthere is substantial room for improvement of its use to accurately diagnose chronic respiratory diseases. Thus, the first aim of our current study was to establish which patient characteristics distinguish between patients diagnosed with asthma or COPD. The second and main aim was to establish the added value of spirometry and more advanced lung function measurements to differentiate between these two chronic airways diseases.

### Choosing wisely: adherence by physicians to recommended use of spirometry in the diagnosis and management of adult asthma [^114Jv9xW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) and the American Thoracic Society provide guidelines stating that physicians should use spirometry in the diagnosis and management of asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends, over a 10-year period, in the utilization of spirometry in patients newly diagnosed with asthma. We hypothesized that spirometry use would increase in physicians who care for asthma patients, especially since 2007, when the revised NAEPP guidelines were published.

Methods

This retrospective cohort analysis of spirometry use in subjects newly diagnosed with asthma used a privately insured adult population for the years 2002–2011. Our primary outcome of interest was spirometry performed within a year (± 365 days) of the initial date of asthma diagnosis. We also examined the type of asthma medications prescribed.

Results

In all, 134,208 patients were found to have a diagnosis of asthma. Only 47.6% had spirometry performed within 1 year of diagnosis. Younger patients, males, and those residing in the Northeast were more likely to receive spirometry. Spirometry use began to decline in 2007. Patients cared for by specialists were more likely to receive spirometry than those cared for by primary care physicians; 80.1% vs 23.3%, respectively. Lastly, even without spirometry, a significant portion of patients (78.3%) was prescribed asthma drugs.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that spirometry is underutilized in newly diagnosed asthma patients. Moreover, the use of controller medications in those diagnosed with asthma without spirometry remains high.

### Difficulties in the interpretation of lung function tests in the diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111sXsQB]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak flow measurement between primary care (several practioners and nurses) and specialists in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Design

A randomized, prospective cohort study of 98 patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Two chest specialists independently interpreted the peak flow and spirometric data and they were also blinded to the primary care results.

Results

There was total agreement in interpretation of the data between general practitioners and specialists in only 20 (20.4%). Levels of diagnostic agreement were highest between the two chest specialists (55%) and lowest between the general practice records and the diagnosis assigned by general practitioners (16%). Disagreement between general practitioners and the two chest specialists was consistent (38%) indicating systematic differences in interpretation.

Conclusions

This study raises concerns about differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak expiratory flow rates in general and hospital practice and the guidelines on which these interpretations are based.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111K9Vft]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis — In patients with chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnosis involves a stepwise approach beginning with whether the patient is likely to have chronic airways disease, then syndromic categorization as having typical asthma, typical COPD, features of both, and/or with other conditions such as bronchiectasis; lung function testing is essential to confirm persistent airflow limitation, and variable airflow obstruction can be detected with serial peak flow measurements and/or measurements before and after bronchodilator.

### Does the routine use of spirometry improve clinical outcomes in children? – A systematic review [^113NsTNi]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Spirometry is a portable and relatively simple test designed to identify and quantify abnormalities in respiratory function. The measurements derived from spirometry are measures of airflow and exhaled lung volumes. Spirometry can generally be reliably performed by children > 6 years of age and by some preschoolers under modified criteria.

Data from spirometry add to clinical management in numerous ways, including assisting in characterizing respiratory pathophysiology, grading the severity of lung disorders, monitoring disease, and determining the effectiveness of therapy. Hence, its use is recommended in pediatric clinical guidelines as part of clinical management including guidelines for chronic cough, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and recurrent wheezing, asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Other diagnoses and conditions in which spirometry aids in management include, but are not limited to, oncology conditions, connective tissue disorders, neuromuscular weakness, and scoliosis.

Although spirometry is widely advocated in pediatric guidelines and routine in most respiratory clinics, there is evidence of under‐utilization of spirometry in primary care settings. For example, only half of all family physicians and general pediatricians use spirometry in patients with asthma and only 21% routinely use it in asthma guideline‐recommended situations, that is, establishing an asthma diagnosis, severity, or control. Although pediatricians used spirometry 66% of the time, only 10% performed the test consistently on each asthma visit. In another survey of children with asthma, only a third were referred for spirometry and only one‐half of hospitalized children underwent spirometry during follow‐up.

Clarification of the value and impact of spirometry in routine consultations, with systematic review evidence, is essential for integrating spirometry into routine clinical practice. Thus, our systematic review aimed to evaluate the question "In children with suspected or known respiratory diseases, does the routine use of spirometry improve health‐related quality of life (QoL) outcome and guide clinical management, compared to not using spirometry?"

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

Asthma in children 5 years and younger — tests to assist diagnosis — notes that while no tests definitively diagnose asthma with certainty, the following are useful adjuncts: a therapeutic trial for at least 2–3 months with as-needed SABA and regular low-dose ICS may provide some guidance (Evidence D), with response evaluated by symptom control and frequency of wheezing and exacerbations; marked improvement on treatment and deterioration when stopped support a diagnosis, and a trial may need repeating; allergic sensitization can be assessed by skin prick testing or allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, is present in the majority once over 3 years of age, absence does not rule out asthma, and allergic sensitization is the best predictor for development of persistent asthma; chest radiographs are rarely indicated but may help exclude alternative diagnoses when doubt exists, with other imaging as appropriate; lung function, bronchial provocation, and other physiological tests do not have a major role at this age, though by 5 years many can perform reproducible spirometry with coaching; FeNO is not widely available and remains primarily a research tool, can be measured with tidal breathing with published normal reference values for children aged 1–5 years, and in preschool children an elevated FeNO recorded 4 weeks from any URTI predicted physician-diagnosed asthma at school age and increased the odds for wheezing, asthma and ICS use by school age.

### The role of oscillometry in asthma [^113cmdAa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Oscillometry is a noninvasive pulmonary function test that has gained significant interest in the evaluation of lung disease. Currently, oscillometry is primarily a research tool, but there is a growing body of evidence supporting its clinical use. This review describes the recent work evaluating the role of oscillometry in the diagnosis and treatment of asthma.

Recent Findings

A large body of observational data supports the ability of oscillometry to distinguish healthy individuals from those with respiratory symptoms or lung disease. Oscillometry may not be as useful as an isolated diagnostic test in asthma, but the combination with other pulmonary function tests may improve its diagnostic ability. Oscillometry can detect peripheral airways dysfunction in asthma, which is associated with symptoms and the risk for exacerbations. To help guide future research, minimal clinically important differences for specific oscillometry variables have been developed. Oscillometry may be useful in monitoring the response to biological therapy and has potential for personalizing treatment for individual patients. Oscillometry also has potential in uncovering unique aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma in obesity.

Summary

Oscillometry is a promising tool in the diagnosis and management of asthma. More research is needed to support its routine clinical use.

If "Yes", "Obtain spirometry", then determine "Is spirometry compatible with asthma (consistent with obstruction)?". A "Yes" leads to "Continue to Module B: Initiation of Therapy for Initial Treatment or Continuation of therapy", whereas a "No" leads to "Consider other options according to site availability and patient/provider preferences and characteristics (Refer to Sidebar C, Sidebar D, and Appendix C)". If spirometry is not feasible at that step, proceed to "Continue to Module B: Initiation of Therapy for Initial Treatment or Continuation of therapy".

### Can measures of small airway dysfunction aid with the diagnosis or management of asthma exacerbations? A systematic review [^113RM5af]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this systematic review suggest that small airway function tests are feasible during exacerbations and may aid in monitoring improvement. However, given that small airway function was not a primary outcome in most included studies and the limited number of RCTs, the evidence remains inconclusive regarding their added value over traditional lung function measures. More research is needed to determine which tests, if any, provide clinically meaningful information and whether small airway dysfunction during exacerbations is consistent across all asthma patients or varies by specific phenotypes. Previous studies have highlighted the role of small airways in asthma heterogeneity, with evidence suggesting that small airway dysfunction is present across multiple asthma subtypes and may be associated with worse disease outcomes.

Incorporating these tests into clinical practice could provide a more comprehensive assessment of airway function, particularly in patients whose symptoms are not adequately reflected by traditional spirometry. Small airway function tests may facilitate earlier detection of exacerbations, allowing for timely intervention or the development of new interventions if incorporated into clinical trials. This could potentially reduce the severity and duration of exacerbations, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Tests like IOS that do not require forced breathing manoeuvres are easier for patients to perform, especially during exacerbations. This can improve patient compliance and the reliability of test results, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making.

Despite the promising findings, several limitations need to be addressed. The heterogeneity in study designs, patient populations and outcome measures poses challenges in generalising the results. Additionally, small airway function tests exhibit variability in measurement techniques, with differences in device calibration, reference equations and interpretation thresholds leading to inconsistencies across studies. Moreover, the availability of small airway function tests in routine clinical practice remains limited, and their cost-effectiveness needs further evaluation.

Furthermore, while alternative spirometric measures such as FEV₃ and FEV₆ have been proposed for early airflow limitation detection, their clinical relevance in asthma and exacerbation settings remains under investigation. They were not included in this review due to limited validation and lack of standardised reference ranges

Addressing these challenges through large-scale studies could pave the way for a more nuanced understanding and management of asthma exacerbations. Developing standardised protocols for test administration and interpretation will be crucial for their widespread adoption. Integrating these tests with existing diagnostic frameworks could facilitate earlier detection of exacerbations and potentially improve patient outcomes by allowing for timely interventions.

### Oscillometry in the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of asthma in children and adults [^111vNNr6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing asthma typically relies on clinical history, physical examination, and objective lung function test results. Spirometry, the gold standard for assessing lung function, is universally recommended for the diagnostic, assessment, and monitoring of asthma. It requires maximal respiratory effort that limits cooperation in certain populations and has limitations in detecting small airway dysfunction. Oscillometry requires minimal patient effort, is noninvasive, and provides valuable information on both large and small airways. Recent task force reports have suggested oscillometry as an alternative or a complementary lung function test to spirometry in the management of individuals with asthma. This review explores the scientific evidence and psychometric properties regarding oscillometry in the main purposes served by lung function testing in asthma, namely diagnosis, assessment of control and future risk, as well as longitudinal monitoring, including clinical utility. Furthermore, it addressed challenges and facilitators to implementation and future directions regarding its positioning as lung function testing in individuals with asthma.

In addition, low FEV1 is a strong independent predictor of risk of exacerbations, even after adjustment for symptom frequency.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood; however, no diagnostic criteria exist to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recognise that the diagnosis of asthma is a clinical one. Because of concerns about the diagnosis of asthma, particularly overdiagnosis, the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has developed comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis incorporating objective tests. The NICE interim report proposes a diagnostic algorithm incorporating the sequential use of four measures of lung function and inflammation in children with symptoms, each applied as a dichotomous variable: spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1] and forced vital capacity [FVC] expressed as a ratio FEV 1 :FVC), bronchodilator reversibility, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and peak flow variability. For the development of the NICE guideline, systematic scientific literature searches were done to identify all published evidence relevant to the review questions. The authors acknowledged that no evidence was found for asthma diagnosis in children for either FEV 1 :FVC or bronchodilator reversibility, and little evidence exists for fractional exhaled nitric oxide and peak flow variability. Despite these findings, the guideline proposes a complex algorithm in which at least two of these tests must be positive to make the diagnosis.

### Office spirometry in primary care for the diagnosis and management of COPD: national lung health education program update [^116f9uMp]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The use of office spirometry was recommended by the National Lung Health Education Program (NLHEP) consensus conference in 1999 for detection and management of COPD. Since that time, spirometry utilization has increased, but its role in the diagnosis of COPD is still evolving. This update reviews the role of spirometry for screening and case finding in COPD as well as for asthma. Spirometry has been used for disease management in patients with airway obstruction, with varying results. The diagnostic criteria for COPD using spirometry have also evolved in the past 17 years, with differences arising between the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease and NLHEP recommendations. More sophisticated spirometers as well as new reference equations are widely available. Standardization guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society published in 2005 provide a robust framework for performing and interpreting spirometry, but clinicians still need hands-on training and meaningful feedback to perform high-quality spirometry in the office setting.

### Diagnosis of asthma in symptomatic children based on measures of lung function: an analysis of data from a population-based birth cohort study [^111FE8eF]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma remains the most common chronic disease of childhood, with 1·1 million children in the UK currently receiving treatment. Because of the absence of gold standard tests to confirm or refute asthma, most guidelines concur that asthma is a clinical diagnosis based on a characteristic pattern of symptoms and signs in the absence of an alternative explanation. A careful reassessment of a large Canadian cohort of 613 adults with a recent diagnosis of asthma ruled out the diagnosis in a third of those assessed. This finding probably represents a combination of asthma remission and overdiagnosis, but in 2% of the population analysed an alternative serious cardiorespiratory disorder was diagnosed. Because of concerns about overdiagnosis (and underdiagnosis), on behalf of the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), experts have developed comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis of asthma incorporating objective tests, which are yet to be implemented (figure 1). Despite the accompanying review highlighting the paucity of evidence in children for the use of lung function measures in the diagnosis of asthma (table 1), the interim reportproposes a diagnostic algorithm for use in primary care in children with symptoms. The algorithm incorporates the sequential use of four measures of lung function and inflammation, each applied as a dichotomous variable: first, spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) expressed as a ratio FEV 1 :FVC; second, bronchodilator reversibility; third, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FNO); and fourth, peak flow variability. For both adults and children, spirometry is the first-line investigation; baseline FEV 1 is not included, but rather the FEV 1 :FVC ratio, with the proposed cutoff for a positive test being an FEV 1 :FVC ratio of less than 70% or of less than the lower limit of normal if this is known for children. Bronchodilator reversibility is done only if the FEV 1 :FVC ratio is less than 70%, and deemed positive if FEV 1 improves by 12% or more from baseline; children positive to both tests can be diagnosed with asthma. If bronchodilator reversibility is negative, both a FNO of 35 or more parts per billion and more than 20% variability in peak expiratory flow measured over 2–4 weeks is required to diagnose asthma (ie, three positive tests are needed). For children with normal spirometry (FEV 1 :FVC ≥ 70%), bronchodilator reversibility testing is not done, but both a FNO of 35 or more parts per billion and a more than 20% peak flow variability is required for an asthma diagnosis. Children with other combinations of results should be referred to a specialist for opinion, be reviewed in 6 weeks with repeat tests, or have other diagnoses considered.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aN6nP]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making the initial diagnosis — diagnosis before treatment is started is based on identifying both a characteristic pattern of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath (dyspnea), chest tightness or cough, and variable expiratory airflow limitation; the symptom pattern matters because respiratory symptoms may be due to other acute or chronic conditions; evidence supporting the diagnosis should be documented when the patient first presents since characteristic features may improve spontaneously or with treatment; confirmation is often more difficult after starting ICS‑containing treatment because this reduces variability of both symptoms and lung function; and where access to spirometry is limited, advice is provided for using PEF in asthma diagnosis.

### Asthma update: part I. diagnosis, monitoring, and prevention of disease progression [^113kJiB9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Despite increased scientific knowledge about asthma and improved therapeutic options, the disease continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel has updated its clinical guidelines on asthma medications, prevention of disease progression, and patient self-management. Diagnostic criteria have not changed, and identification of the disease relies on the physician's analysis of the patient's symptoms, family history, and spirometric measurements of lung function. Classification of asthma severity also has not changed, but many obstacles remain, including the variability of asthma and the classification system's inability to account for physical activity levels, which may result in significant underestimation of the severity of asthma. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommends the use of written action plans with or without monitoring of peak expiratory flow, although evidence supporting these management techniques is inconclusive. Patients with asthma may benefit from earlier use of inhaled corticosteroids, which have been proven safe in the usual dosages. However, further studies are needed to determine whether inhaled corticosteroids can prevent the progression of asthma.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^117UbHaF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fourth, while post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended. The degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate COPD from asthma (except when airflow limitation disappears following bronchodilators, which is incompatible with COPD), or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Accordingly, it is not necessary nor advised to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Finally, the role of screening spirometry in the general population for the diagnosis of COPD is also controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposure to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated. By contrast, in those with symptoms and/or risk factors (e.g. > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, prematurity, or other significant early-life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high, and spirometry should be considered as a method for case finding.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114gmUr9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

No RCTs could be found to address Question 2.1 (see Appendix B EtD Table I).

More than 50 studies have been conducted, and some of these studies included healthy and symptomatic individuals, smokers and nonsmokers, atopic and nonatopic individuals, and individuals with and without a prior diagnosis of asthma. The protocols for diagnostic Fassessments varied, and conclusions about the optimal testing protocol remain uncertain.

Based on the Expert Panel's interpretation of the literature and the systematic review report findings, the overall certainty of evidence for this recommendation is moderate. The Expert Panel considers implementation of the recommendation in a broad population to be appropriate based on the diversity of the populations included in the systematic review report. The imprecision in the studies on the utility of Fmeasurement in asthma diagnosis is notable.

Rationale and discussion

In the Expert Panel's opinion, an additional tool to aid in diagnosing asthma could be beneficial, especially when that tool may help identify specific asthma phenotypes. The Expert Panel considered many facets of harm, risk, opportunity, and benefits in making its recommendation.

The acceptability of Fmeasurement to individuals with a potential diagnosis of asthma is likely to be high, given that the test involves minimal effort and does not incur discomfort or side effects. Publications on studies that used Ftesting did not report any overt harms. The Expert Panel noted that most studies conducted Fmeasurements only in specialty care research settings, and few data are available on the use of Fmeasurement in primary care settings. As with many innovations, the cost of Fequipment and testing may limit its broader use. These barriers to broader dissemination could have a negative impact on the availability of Ftesting and lead to less equitable care for populations with limited resources.

Questions 2.2 and 2.3

What is the clinical utility of Fmeasurements to select medication options (including corticosteroids) for individuals aged 5 years and older?
What is the clinical utility of Fmeasurements to monitor response to treatment in individuals aged 5 years and older?

Recommendation 2: In individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent allergic asthma, for whom there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the addition of Fmeasurement as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessments.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

Spirometry testing in suspected work-related asthma (WRA) — spirometry, performed alone or with pre- and postbronchodilator testing, is an important component of evaluation and management, with roles that include: 1. Determining whether asthma is present; 2. If asthma is present, helping inform whether the asthma is work related; and 3. Monitoring response to therapy and possible return to work.

Lung function documentation and when to seek specialist advice: Airflow limitation may be present in patients with long-standing asthma, due to remodeling of the airway walls, or limited lung development in childhood, so it is important to document lung function when the diagnosis of asthma is first made, and specialist advice should be obtained if the history is suggestive of asthma but the diagnosis cannot be confirmed by spirometry.

Conclusion

COPD can be estimated with high diagnostic accuracy using spirometry. It is also possible to rule in asthma with spirometry. However, asthma can not be ruled out only using spirometry. This diagnostic uncertainty leads to an overestimation of asthma presence. Patients with inconclusive spirometric results should be referred for NO – measurement and/or bronchial provocation if possible to guarantee accurate diagnosis.

### The role of objective tests to support a diagnosis of asthma in children [^115VpHzd]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In many healthcare settings asthma in children is a clinical diagnosis based on parental reported symptoms. These include intermittent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and periodic nocturnal dry cough. Increased symptoms often coincide with colds. Confirming a diagnosis of asthma in children can be difficult and recent reports highlight that misdiagnosis, including over- and under-diagnosis of asthma are common. Recent UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend diagnostic algorithms for children from five years and adults to support a clinical suspicion of asthma. Spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility and fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing are the first line tests to diagnose asthma in children. The introduction of these tests across all healthcare settings has the potential to reduce misdiagnosis, improve asthma management and reduce healthcare spending for asthma.

### Asthma end points and outcomes: what have we learned? [^116YavZg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

In spite of the wide prevalence of asthma and its substantial consequences, the diagnosis and assessment of asthma has not been standardized, and the goals of therapy currently are not being achieved. Our purpose is to help delineate what the most important asthma end points are and what kinds of strategies we should use to guide therapy. Comparison of numerous studies reveals that asthma measures used routinely in the clinic, such as spirometric lung function, do not uniformly correlate with asthma control. We cannot improve outcomes until we determine which measures reveal the underlying disease process most clearly and at the same time offer ease of performance during routine office visits. We propose that by standardizing the way we collect and analyze data from our daily practice, we can better define which measures reflect true asthma control. Such measures most likely address a spectrum of changes occurring in the pathophysiology of asthma, notably distal airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Inflammation may provide the best opportunity for assessment and treatment, because if it is adequately addressed, airway sensitivity may improve, thereby reducing airway obstruction and subsequently minimizing exacerbations. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide as a measure of inflammation is suggested as offering the best combination of disease evaluation and practical implementation for improved asthma outcomes.

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^113ZhC95]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate practice organisation and systems focussing on the identification, diagnosis and treatment are pivotal for quality asthma care. There was compelling evidence to indicate that integrated, multi-faceted practice-based approaches for the management of patients improves outcomes and reduces the need for referral to secondary care. Coordinated practice systems that combine several interventions such as decision support tools, flagging of electronic records, use of care pathways, staff training and structured approaches to patient education, if consistently implemented, afford the greatest benefits. Implementation of practice schemes is likely to be enhanced where there is dedicated clinical and administrative leadership.

Intuitively an accurate diagnosis should lead to better patient outcomes, although we found conflicting evidence that access to proper diagnosis has an impact on patient outcomes. Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis remains the fulcrum on which optimal asthma management depends. Indeed programmes in which an expanded medical team improved the quality of asthma care within the primary care setting (such as a diagnostic and management support organisation) show clear benefit on patient outcome.

Spirometry combined with an assessment of reversibility has been set as gold standard for asthma diagnosis. However, standards on quality of spirometry such as those set by the ERS and ATS are often not achieved – and impose an unnecessarily high and potentially unachievable threshold in primary care. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that primary care office spirometry can meet the acceptability criteria –. Although such standards are laudable particularly in a specialist setting, their practicability in primary care, where patients commonly have mild–moderate, intermittent disease, is debatable. The latest ATS-ERS spirometry guidelines (published in October 2019) may address some of these issues. However, the use of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma remains beyond reach in primary care around the world.

In many countries primary care physicians have limited or no access to tests of lung function or airway inflammation. The creation of diagnostic hubs in the community may open access to these tests. A structured approach to diagnosis including applicability and feasibility for primary care is currently under development by an ERS taskforce; its outcome not available at the time of writing.

Asthma — use cases, limitations, and operational considerations for FeNO testing: FeNO testing has a supportive role in evaluation when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain, and individuals who may benefit include those aged 5 years and older who have an uncertain diagnosis of asthma and those in whom spirometry testing cannot be performed accurately. Because the data on the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO measurement in children younger than 4 years are not conclusive, FeNO measurement in this age group should not be used. FeNO test results should not be used alone to diagnose asthma; FeNO measurements can serve as an adjunct test when the results of a thorough clinical assessment, including other appropriate tests, are inconclusive. FeNO measurements should be performed by appropriately trained personnel, FeNO testing can be performed in primary or specialty care settings, and the costs of testing may prohibit adoption in the primary care office setting; recognition of allergen sensitivity is extremely important for interpreting FeNO levels because allergic rhinitis and atopy are associated with increased FeNO levels.

### The challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care [^112PWVpK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a complex disease associated with airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness and variable airflow obstruction that may not all co-exist in many patients. The criteria for spirometric diagnosis of asthma include an improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator challenge. This latter approach is often recommended as a first-line strategy for asthma diagnosis in the asthma guidelines. Simple spirometry can be carried out in the physician's office in a timely manner, and it provides useful information about the relationship between flow and volume. There are few clinically relevant risks associated with performing simple spirometry tests. However, the test's accuracy and reproducibility depends on maximal effort by the patient. The assessor must have the expertise to coach the patient, address language barriers and recognise unacceptable efforts, as poorly performed manoeuvres can mimic various disease patterns. Measurement of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is simple, convenient and can be done either in the clinic or in the home settings.PEFR variability has been linked to airway hyper-reactivity and is recognised as a useful diagnostic aid that is well suited for adoption in primary care.

More sophisticated testing such as methacholine challenge is recommended among patients who present with clinical features compatible with asthma but normal spirometric findings on initial testing. Methacholine challenge testing (MCT) includes inhalation of methacholine, a substance that is intended to induce bronchoconstriction in susceptible airways and may be associated with some risks. To our knowledge, there have been no reported deaths from MCT. Some reports indicate that MCT is quite safe, even in patients with severe obstruction. To date, the role of MCT as a first-line test for asthma diagnosis in the primary care setting has not been clearly delineated and has yet to be recommended by any agency or guideline outside of a specialty care facility.

The importance of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in the community setting has been discussed by Aaron et al. They describe that about one-third of obese and non-obese individuals with physician-diagnosed asthma did not have asthma when objectively assessed. These findings raise awareness of the importance of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis, and have stimulated considerable debate around which test to consider first by primary care physicians in the office setting.

### The challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care [^117MHaeV]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma represents one of the most common chronic conditions encountered in primary care and diagnosis should be confirmed objectively with the demonstration of variable airflow obstruction. As many asthmatics have normal lung function at the time of clinical presentation, objective confirmation of airflow limitation may be challenging. Fluctuations in airflow obstruction can be documented with simple office spirometry after bronchodilator challenge, home monitoring of peak expiratory flow and bronchoconstriction induced by spasmogens such as methacholine. We present a case highlighting the challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care and provide a critical review of the diagnostic approaches highlighted above. Our aim is to provide a pragmatic interpretation of the available literature with a view to assisting clinicians in selecting the diagnostic test best suited for individualised patient encounters.

Diagnosis: Forced Spirometry

A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who complains of dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease (see above), but forced vital capacity maneuver during spirometry showing the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 is needed to establish the diagnosis of COPD. The FEV 1 also serves to determine the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1, 2, 3, 4 or mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). Yet, several important aspects related to forced spirometry need to be considered here.

First, airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible is not specific for COPD. For instance, it may also be found in patients with asthma and other diseases, so the clinical context and risk factors (see above) must also be considered when establishing a diagnosis of COPD.

Low levels of knowledge on asthma diagnosis amongst health care workers

There is low levels of knowledge among health personnel on the utility of spirometry in the diagnostic evaluation of asthmatic children. In a study done in Nigeria, it was shown that while up to 95% of paediatric registrars knew and had seen a spirometer before and knew about its role in asthma diagnosis only 37% used it in diagnosis. A survey among 131 health workers in 6 centres in Nigeria revealed that 116 (88.5%) had low knowledge levels on asthma diagnosis.

(iv) Factors related to diagnostic guidelines

Lack of or non-adherence to guidelines for asthma diagnosis

Most countries in SSA either do not have guidelines and in countries where they are available, they are not fully implemented especially in rural areas. Ayuk et al. showed that the use of guidelines is poor amongst paediatric residents from 23 university teaching hospitals in Nigeria with only 59.1% of them adhering to GINA guidelines. The most reported reason for non-adherence to guideline based asthma diagnosis was the lack of knowledge of contents of the guideline and the importance of their role in diagnosis.

Mis-diagnosis of asthma due to inherent asthma heterogeneity, co-morbid conditions and alternate diagnosis

In LMIC, where the burden of infectious diseases over-ride non-communicable diseases, health workers tend to prioritize, even over-diagnose these infectious diseases at the expense of asthma. Two such conditions that tend to be over-diagnosed at the expense of asthma are bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Pneumonia which mimics asthma especially if fever is not considered has been shown to lead to underdiagnosis of asthma in Ugandan children. The different phenotypic presentations of the wheezing child below 5 years has led to diagnostic terms such as 'the asthma syndrome' being used in the Ugandan study.

### Interpretation of spirometry, peak flow, and provocation testing for asthma [^111XtitB]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Spirometry plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of asthma. The hallmark spirometry finding of expiratory airflow variability can be demonstrated in several ways including peak airflow and bronchodilator and bronchoprovocation testing. Challenges of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis underscore the need to consider clinical context while interpreting these tests. A meticulous and multifaceted approach prioritizing objective testing is imperative while diagnosing asthma.

Physiologic tests and biomarkers for diagnosis and management of elderly patients with asthma emphasize that "Many of the same tests used in younger patients with asthma are useful to characterize AIE", and that "Spirometry and airway reactivity measurements are first-line methods for diagnosing and monitoring AIE". Evidence indicates "lower FEV1 and more severe airflow limitation in older patients with asthma", and that "Bronchoprovocation testing can detect airway reactivity in older as in younger patients", with older patients showing "more peripheral airway closure during bronchoconstriction (measured by the reduction in FVC)" than younger patients. When interpreting results, "age-adjusted values are essential, particularly when interpreting the FEV1/FVC ratio, to avoid overdiagnosing respiratory impairment", and although predicted values are available for the elderly, "data for nonwhite individuals and for those older than 75 years are sparse". Testing is limited because these are "effort-dependent maneuvers", and studies show "80% or more of older persons can achieve ATS-acceptable spirometry", though "this may be hard for some frail".

Research has shown that spirometry is underutilized in the clinical setting. This study profiles the use of spirometry in an asthma management program at an inner-city community health clinic. Eligible subjects included 56 children who presented with an acute asthma exacerbation. Physicians recorded patient diagnosis before and after viewing spirometry. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was used to determine associations between symptoms and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Physicians changed 30.4% of patients' treatment plans after viewing spirometry results. Wheezing was significantly associated with FEV1 in bivariate analysis; however, multivariate modeling failed to identify significant relationships. The use of spirometry influenced patient diagnosis and treatment.

### Spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children [^112PQpUZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the diagnostic accuracy of lung function measurements made using spirometry for childhood asthma, recent guidelines for the measurement and interpretation of spirometric lung function tests and recent developments for diagnosing asthma.

Recent Findings

Measurements of lung function and bronchial lability made using spirometry may not perform any better than other tests such as skin prick testing, or measurements of exhaled nitric oxide for diagnosing asthma. New guidelines are available.

Summary

Spirometry is a simple, robust and widely available tool for investigating lung function. There are published guidelines for making measurements and their interpretation. The place of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma, however, needs clarification. The diagnostic profiles of measurements of bronchodilator responsiveness and bronchial hyperreactivity made using spirometry, although reasonable, are not perfect. In schoolchildren, they are no better than knowledge of aeroallergen sensitization when considering a diagnosis of asthma.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

### The use of a direct bronchial challenge test in primary care to diagnose asthma [^114zCdey]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, the best combination of clinical features and diagnostic tests has not been found. An alternative might be to use the exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test, which can also contribute to an accurate diagnosis of asthma. Although there are no reports of the FeNO test being used in primary care settings, if the BCT could be routinely implemented with success, there may also be a valid argument for implementing the FeNO test. Further research is warranted on this point.

The real-life retrospective study design meant that we lacked a control group against which to compare our results. If a randomized controlled trial is performed to compare BCT in primary and secondary care, we predict this will reach similar conclusions with regards the safety, feasibility, and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, the strength afforded by prospective research would reinforce the argument that BCT has a role in primary care settings. Prospective research should ideally follow the group of patients with respiratory symptoms, normal spirometry, and a negative BCT who are referred to secondary care to record the additional diagnostic steps and the final diagnosis. To assess whether diagnostic referrals can be reduced, a randomized trial should prospectively compare a cohort who undergo BCT in primary care and another who are referred directly to secondary care.

Our data in a real-life primary care setting indicate that histamine provocation testing is feasible and safe. In our cohort, we believe it improved the accuracy of asthma diagnosis. Consequently, using BCT in primary care, in addition to spirometry alone, has the potential to reduce the rates of asthma misdiagnosis and the need for diagnostic referrals to secondary care. We therefore recommend that the use of a BCT be considered in well-equipped primary care laboratories as it provides a valuable addition to spirometry with bronchodilator response in the diagnostic work-up of patients with respiratory symptoms.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnosis in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years: The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, which should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests, and more than one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. Many health professionals do not have access to spirometry; if so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather than relying on symptoms alone. Test before treating, wherever possible, i.e., document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has improved, and additional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations including patients already on ICS-containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only symptom (including cough variant asthma), and patients in low-resource settings.

### Asthma diagnosis and treatment: filling in the information gaps [^116WWbHF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of asthma are based on guideline recommendations, which have provided a framework for the efforts. Asthma, however, is emerging as a heterogeneous disease, and these features need to be considered in both the diagnosis and management of this disease in individual patients. These diverse or phenotypic features add complexity to the diagnosis of asthma, as well as attempts to achieve control with treatment. Although the diagnosis of asthma is often based on clinical information, it is important to pursue objective criteria as well, including an evaluation for reversibility of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, an area with new diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, there exist a number of treatment gaps (ie, exacerbations, step-down care, use of antibiotics, and severe disease) in which new direction is needed to improve care. A major morbidity in asthmatic patients occurs with exacerbations and in patients with severe disease. Novel approaches to treatment for these conditions will be an important advance to reduce the morbidity associated with asthma.

### Physiological tests of small airways function in diagnosing asthma: a systematic review [^117B8qF8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common but heterogeneous disease characterised by chronic airway inflammation and clinically defined by the presence of respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity. Physiologically, asthma is characterised by variable expiratory airflow limitation which may become persistent over time. Symptoms and airflow limitation can be extremely variable, including the age of onset, triggers for symptoms, the decline in lung function and therapeutic response.

It is estimated that 339 million people are affected by asthma globallybut diagnosing asthma is often challenging as there is no gold standard test. This has led to a high burden of undiagnosed disease, especially in children and older adults. According to current guidelines, a diagnosis of asthma should be objectively supported with an assessment of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) reversibility. However, some patients with asthma have no evidence of reversibility or airflow obstructionand airflow obstruction and reversibility are seen in patients with alternative diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, the forced manoeuvres required for spirometry requires effort and coordination, which can be difficult for some individuals.

In the past, asthma was thought to only affect larger airwaysbut current evidence suggests that small airways (defined as airways of ≤ 2 mm in diameter) are affected as well. The small airways may form a site of active disease, even in the absence of airflow obstruction. If the small airways are the first to be affected in asthma, identifying small airways dysfunction (SAD) may help identify asthma earlier, enabling treatment. However, there are a large number of tests that report small airways function. Some of these are being used as secondary outcomes in experimental studies of asthma, to determine asthma phenotype and assess the response to new therapies. The evidence to support the use of any physiological test of small airways function in the diagnosis of asthma is unclear.

This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence to support the use of commonly reported physiological tests of small airways function to diagnose asthma in adults, and assess if the selected tests should be included in future clinical studies of the disease.

### Improving asthma outcomes: clinicians' perspectives on peripheral airways [^115vjCsD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common and well-known diagnosis to specialists, general practitioners, and the general public. Decades of research has shed much light on the nature of asthma, but as is often the case, it raises more questions, and importantly causality and pathophysiology remain very poorly understood. Perhaps the push to simplify the concept and hence its management has been detrimental, given that its clinical spectrum is broad and complex and a simple approach to treatment does not match the reality of this complexity. The authors strongly argue that better characterization of pathophysiology, be they called phenotypes, traits, or biomarkers, is required to improve management and to advance research. Respiratory physiology has a fundamental role in diagnosis and management of airways diseases and is the functional representation of both inflammation and lung and airway remodeling. Peripheral airways disease is an integral part of asthma, and the ability to measure function of the peripheral airways has allowed studies that reveal the importance of small airway function in asthma. Is this useful for clinicians and researchers? In this article, we explain what aspects of peripheral airway dysfunction are clinically important, and how this informs assessment and management.

A branch conducts "Further history and tests for alternative diagnoses" with "Is alternative diagnosis confirmed?", leading to "Treat for alternative diagnosis" when confirmed. If other diagnoses are unlikely, it advises to "treat empirically with ICS-containing treatment (Boxes 4–5 & 4–11)", then "Review response in 1–3 months, including PEF or spirometry if available" and, if improved, "Treat for asthma with ICS-containing treatment See Boxes 4–5 & 4–11". The footnote states that "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, but it is better than having no objective measurement of lung function", and that readings "may vary by up to 20% between different meters" and to use "only the highest of three readings".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115ppn5R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following): positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

### Making the diagnosis of asthma [^112rNsHe]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests can only increase or decrease the probability of the asthma diagnosis, so a thorough history is very important. In patients with asthma-like symptoms, spirometric evidence of airway obstruction plus a large bronchodilator response makes asthma much more likely. However, normal spirometry is common in patients with mild asthma who are not symptomatic at the time of testing, and patients with poorly controlled asthma may lack substantial bronchodilator response. Inhalation challenge test often helps confirm asthma in patients with normal spirometry. Adult smokers with intermittent respiratory symptoms may have either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Normal post-bronchodilator spirometry rules out COPD. In patients with airway obstruction, a low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide increases the probability of COPD and makes asthma much less likely. A high exhaled nitric oxide level makes allergic asthma more likely. Response to inhaled corticosteroids makes asthma more likely and COPD less likely.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to feNO testing, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessments in ≥ 5 years old patients with persistent allergic asthma, if there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry.

Poverty and inaccessibility to health care

In several studies, poor socio-economic status and/or lack of medical health funding was associated with under-recognition of asthma hence severe asthma.

Inaccessibility to health facilities has been cited by Oluwole et al. as one of the reasons for possible underdiagnosis of asthma. A review of studies done in South Africa on childhood asthma by Zar et al. highlighted inaccessibility to health care as an impediment to asthma diagnosis.

Strained health systems and lack of diagnostic resources

Health systems with strained resources have been cited by some authors as the cause for under-diagnosis of asthma.

While lung function testing eg spirometry remains an objective measure in diagnosis and assessing the severity of airflow obstruction, it remains widely unavailable. Spirometry, skin prick allergy testing and serum specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) for allergy testing are not available in most primary care, district and provincial hospitals where the asthmatic patient initially presents. The availability of spirometry was reported to be as low as 29.4% in Nigeria while availability of the less reliable peak flow meter which may be used in diagnosis and monitoring was reported to be 38%. A study done by Desalu et al. in Nigeria showed that while 60.7% knew of the role of spirometry in diagnosis, only 25.2% reported having a spirometer in their hospital. Another study in Uganda also revealed non availability of diagnostic tests.

Ayuk et al. reviewed literature on the use of spirometry particularly in resource poor countries and highlighted that unavailability of spirometers, ignorance of their importance in diagnosis and follow-up as well as lack of knowledge on how to use them and interpret results are the main reasons why spirometer use is low.

A systematic review done by Kibirige et al. on 'Availability and Affordability of diagnostic tests for asthma and COPD', availability of spirometry was low ranging from 13 to 53% in most countries in Sub Saharan Africa.

A review of records over two and half years at University of Nigeria teaching hospital spirometry laboratory showed that referral of patients from primary care health workers is poor and only patients above 15 years of age were documented to have been referred for spirometry. In addition there is lack of respiratory physicians in most tertiary hospitals.

### Can measures of small airway dysfunction aid with the diagnosis or management of asthma exacerbations? A systematic review [^1115o4Mr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory airway disease marked by airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway remodelling and underlying inflammation. Asthma affects people of all ages and is common. In 2019, it was estimated that over 260 million people globally had poorly controlled asthma. Due to structural alterations in the airways, people with asthma are susceptible to long-term airflow restriction. Only a small percentage of individuals experience severe obstruction, which is correlated with factors such as genetic predisposition, age at onset, length and severity of the disease, environmental exposures and inadequate therapy. The diagnosis of asthma remains a clinical one, with no gold standard test to identify the disease. In stable disease, there has been increasing interest in the use of small airways tests to diagnose and monitor asthma, as the small airways have been shown to represent an area of significant inflammation without impacting the results of tests which assess the large airways.

Asthma exacerbations are acute episodes marked by worsening symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing and a marked, progressive decrease in respiratory function. Asthma exacerbations burden patients, society and healthcare systems. As with stable asthma, there is no gold-standard test to diagnose an asthma exacerbation. Asthma exacerbations have been traditionally diagnosed and their severity assessed by clinical symptoms, physical examination and some physiology tests including the peak expiratory flow (PEF). In clinical studies, alongside clinical features and PEF, spirometric-based tests have been used including FEV1 and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC). However, published evidence suggests that the correlation between conventional lung function measurements (ie, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PEF) and asthma symptoms is weak. Reasons for this are unclear and might include the involvement of small airway dysfunction in exacerbations which is not adequately detected by traditional tests of large airways function.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^113ze1Ms]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnoses and diagnostic uncertainty

Misdiagnosis of asthma remains a major problem with rates of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis being high. Overdiagnosis is problematic as it exposes children to unnecessary side effects of medications and runs the risk of trivialising asthma.

There are several conditions that may be associated with chronic cough, wheeze and/or shortness of breath in children and therefore present similarly to asthma (table 1). Due to the difficulties with diagnosis, especially in young children where objective testing is not possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be reviewed at each clinical presentation and interaction.

Table 1
Asthma differentials and clues in medical history

Diagnosing asthma in children

There is no single 'gold-standard' test that can be used to accurately diagnose asthma. In practice, a diagnosis should be made based on characteristic symptom patterns, evidence of variability in airflow limitation in the presence of airway inflammation, likelihood of alternative diagnoses and response to treatment. Getting the diagnosis correct is key for optimal management of paediatric asthma.

Lung function tests can be used to aid the diagnosis of asthma in children over the age of 5 years. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and spirometry are commonly used to assess airflow obstruction and reversibility. PEF can be used to detect diurnal variation, which is a typical feature of asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) specifically recommends the use of either PEF or spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children over 5 years. Once a child is old enough to reliably perform lung function testing, it is recommended that this be undertaken if the diagnosis of asthma has not been previously confirmed. In children under 5, lung function testing is rarely practical outside a research setting. This makes diagnosis in this age group additionally challenging. Guidelines vary between countries and regions with regard to diagnostic criteria. An overview of the similarities and differences between these guidelines is displayed in table 2. Lung function testing is frequently used to monitor progress of children with asthma as part of their care. Objective testing should be repeated if there is poor response to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.

### Diagnostic accuracy of FEV1 / forced vital capacity ratio z scores in asthmatic patients [^111gkcfG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is used as a criterion for airflow obstruction; however, the test characteristics of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma are not well established. The accuracy of a test depends on the pretest probability of disease.

Objective

We wanted to estimate the FEV1/FVC ratio z score threshold with optimal accuracy for the diagnosis of asthma for different pretest probabilities.

Methods

Asthmatic patients enrolled in 4 trials from the Asthma Clinical Research Centers were included in this analysis. Measured and predicted FEV1/FVC ratios were obtained, with calculation of z scores for each participant. Across a range of asthma prevalences and z score thresholds, the overall diagnostic accuracy was calculated.

Results

One thousand six hundred eight participants were included (mean age, 39 years; 71% female; 61% white). The mean FEV1 percent predicted value was 83% (SD, 15%). In a symptomatic population with 50% pretest probability of asthma, optimal accuracy (68%) is achieved with a z score threshold of -1.0 (16th percentile), corresponding to a 6 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. However, in a screening population with a 5% pretest probability of asthma, the optimum z score is -2.0 (second percentile), corresponding to a 12 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. These findings were not altered by markers of disease control.

Conclusion

Reduction of the FEV1/FVC ratio can support the diagnosis of asthma; however, the ratio is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnostic accuracy. When interpreting spirometric results, consideration of the pretest probability is an important consideration in the diagnosis of asthma based on airflow limitation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11792zsF]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 7–3: Spirometric measures in asthma and COPD — reduced post-BD FEV1/FVC (< lower limit of normal, or < 0.7) indicates airflow limitation in asthma but is required for diagnosis of COPD and required for diagnosis of asthma+COPD. Post-BD increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and 200 mL from baseline (reversible airflow limitation) is usual at some time in course of asthma but may not be present when well controlled or on ICS-containing therapy, and is common and more likely when FEV1 is low. Post-BD increase in FEV1 > 12% and 400 mL from baseline (marked reversibility) has high probability of asthma, is unusual in COPD, and is compatible with asthma+COPD.

### How to use the fractional exhaled nitric oxide test [^116Gifhy]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical questions

Can the test be used to diagnose asthma? Is FeNO more accurate than spirometry or peak flow diaries?

Asthma is a clinical diagnosis and as a result, there is no single diagnostic test. NICE guidelines recommend that for children under 5 years with suspected asthma, their symptoms should be treated according to clinical judgement and have regular reviews. Once they reach 5 years, symptomatic children should undergo objective testing, including spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility or FeNO testing.

Asthma can be diagnosed if the patient has symptoms suggestive of asthma and a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb with positive peak flow variability or obstructive spirometry with positive bronchodilator reversibility (table 2). In children, a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb makes asthma (and a response to ICS) very likely.

Table 2
A table to show the positive test thresholds for objective tests used to diagnose asthma in children and young people (aged 5 years and older)

Current guidance advocating serial monitoring (peak flow readings or spirometry) to confirm diagnosis may miss mild asthma as abnormal airway physiology may be undetectable, suggesting these tests used serially have a low sensitivity.

Research has shown that the predictive values for FeNO are higher than that of traditional diagnostic methods. Table 3 below summarises the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO compared with traditional methods.

### The role of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and oscillometry in pediatric asthma [^114A9a9Z]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing pediatric asthma is challenging and requires the evaluation of symptoms, inflammation, and lung function. Spirometry, which is commonly used to evaluate lung function in asthma, is difficult to obtain from young pediatric patients and frequently not possible to obtain from patients under 5 years of age. This is also true for the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (F ENO) measurement, which can indicate type 2 airway inflammation in asthma, and controversy has existed regarding the appropriate use of F ENO measurement in asthma diagnosis and monitoring. Impulse oscillometry can be used to evaluate lung function and may be easier to perform than spirometry for pediatric patients. This narrative review evaluates the recent guidelines for diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric asthma. It also provides an overview of the use of F ENO measurement and impulse oscillometry in pediatric asthma. A panel discussion of the role of F ENO measurement and impulse oscillometry in pediatric asthma concludes this article.

### Does routine spirometry impact on clinical decisions and patient-related outcome measures of children seen in respiratory clinics: an open-label randomised controlled trial [^1132n3m2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this open-label RCT, we examined the impact of the routine use of spirometry on doctors' clinical decisions and PROMs, compared with non-use of spirometry, at paediatric respiratory clinics. We found that using spirometry with clinical review, compared with controls, significantly increased (1) the proportion of children whose doctors altered their clinical decision during the review and (2) 'change score' in clinical decision. Spirometry also contributed to significant improvement in PROMs, including overall STAI with state anxiety, and the PC-QoL social domain. Both patients and doctors rated the benefits of using spirometry in clinical practice highly on Likert scales.

To use, or not to use, spirometry routinely for children with respiratory problems is a long-standing question; hence, our study attempted to find an answer. Our study is important as this is the first high-level evidence informing the role of spirometry in paediatric respiratory practice. Despite the importance of spirometry for clinical practice, there is marked paucity of Level 1 evidence. We undertook the RCT by concealed allocation to strengthen our findings, although blinding was not possible. Given that spirometry data is a measure used for a single point in time for clinical decisions, we evaluated the outcomes of spirometry integration at a single clinic visit. Our study's endpoints, assessed from both doctor and patient perspectives, provided clear evidence of the benefits of incorporating spirometry into regular clinical review.

The impact of spirometry on diagnosis and management in children has previously been reported in few observational asthma studies. One study of 367 children with asthma described that spirometry results changed treatment decisions in 15% of outpatient visits, independent of the patient's age, disease severity, symptom control or clinical findings. In another community-clinic-based study involving 56 children with an asthma exacerbation, nearly one-third of the children had their original treatment plans changed after doctors viewed their spirometry results. Similar to these previous studies, we found that spirometry changed clinical decisions in medication use for approximately one-third of the children. However, most subgroups of clinical decision changes (including diagnosis certainty or severity, or medication or investigation) were not significantly different between groups. This is likely because the majority of our participants were review cases in the tertiary centre who already had a definitive diagnosis and established management regimes and our sample size was not powered for subgroup analysis. However, despite the lack of statistical significance, we still believe that the contribution of spirometry is substantial for each individual as it is important to correct or confirm the diagnosis and management, as recommended by several guidelines.

### Ascertainment of small airways dysfunction using oscillometry to better define asthma control and future risk: are we ready to implement It in clinical practice? [^1141VPwe]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evidence suggests a clear advantage for including airway oscillometry into clinical practice for more accurate assessment, prediction of those at risk of deterioration, and management decision guidance. Clinicians would benefit from greater knowledge in terms of advantages and limitations to prescribe and interpret oscillometry. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the additive value of oscillometry to conventional spirometry and F. If a patient is not clinically responding to therapy despite normal spirometry, this is a strong indication for oscillometry. We recommend that oscillometry be considered for use in specialized care and community practice.

### Asthma diagnosis using patient-reported outcome measures and objective diagnostic tests: now and into the future [^111bZLC5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global prevalence of asthma continues to increase; however, asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. This results in a significant burden on the healthcare system and preventable patient morbidity and mortality. Over-diagnosis of asthma based on clinical history alone also complicates patient management. This heightens the importance of a prompt and accurate asthma diagnosis. Therefore, a review of the literature was performed regarding both objective diagnostic testing for asthma and using patient-reported outcome measures.

Recent Findings

The cornerstone of asthma diagnosis remains spirometry with testing for bronchodilator reversibility testing for pediatric and adult populations. This test may need to be repeated at multiple time points due to its low sensitivity. Peak flow measurement, fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing, and allergy testing are useful adjuncts to the diagnosis and phenotyping of asthma. Bronchoprovocation testing is reserved for people with high clinical suspicion for asthma, but negative spirometry. Novel noninvasive testing modalities may play a diagnostic role in the future. The advent of remote digital health monitoring technology has resulted in revisiting patient-reported outcome measures for the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma.

Summary

Overall, improved diagnostic tools for asthma are crucial for earlier recognition and treatment of the disease and improved patient care outcomes worldwide.
