## Question

26 year old male with recurrent respiratory infection despite antibiotics and they are from the middle east. What diagnosis to consider?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the possible diagnoses to consider in a 26-year-old man from the Middle East who has recurrent respiratory infections despite antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of recurrent infections in a young adult and which warning signs mandate an immunologic workup. Then, I should prioritize the differential diagnosis by pretest probability, starting with primary immunodeficiencies such as CVID and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia, followed by structural airway disorders like bronchiectasis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, and then cystic fibrosis with atypical presentations. Next, I will consider regional infectious etiologies such as tuberculosis and MERS, and finally I should outline a staged diagnostic algorithm and immediate management steps, including when to refer and what empiric therapies to avoid or initiate while awaiting results.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that make this presentation concerning in a 26-year-old: recurrent lower respiratory tract infections despite appropriate antibiotics, young adult age, and Middle Eastern origin, which raises the possibility of consanguinity and founder effects for inborn errors of immunity. These features should trigger a structured immunologic evaluation rather than repeated empiric antibiotics alone [^114gLDEs] [^113jdQwz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the most likely etiologies before ordering low-yield tests. In adults with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, common variable immunodeficiency and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia are high on the list, and both can present in the 20s to 30s with recurrent bacterial pneumonias and bronchiectasis, often with diagnostic delays exceeding a decade, so I need to check quantitative immunoglobulins and vaccine-specific antibody responses early [^112zxh9u] [^111icH4R].

> Wait, let me verify the role of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia. It is frequently missed and can be triggered by drugs, hematologic malignancies, or systemic disease, so I should confirm IgG levels and, if low, assess for contributory causes and correlate with infection severity and frequency using standardized criteria to guide immunoglobulin replacement decisions [^113jdQwz].

> I will now examine structural airway diseases that predispose to recurrent infections. Bronchiectasis is a key consideration, and in young adults without smoking or classic CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia is a leading cause, so I should screen for chronic wet cough, chronic sinusitis, otitis media, situs anomalies, and male infertility, and consider nasal nitric oxide and ciliary function testing if the phenotype fits [^1144un2a] [^113RG9Ue].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cystic fibrosis would be unlikely at age 26 without a pediatric diagnosis, but I should double-check that assumption. Late-onset or milder CF phenotypes do occur, and some adults present with bronchiectasis and recurrent infections without classic pancreatic insufficiency, so a sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic testing remain appropriate when clinical suspicion persists despite normal newborn screening or early-life testing [^116gNiF5] [^113hvDLL].

> Let me consider regional infectious etiologies next. Tuberculosis must be high on the list given Middle Eastern epidemiology and the patient's age, so I should obtain a careful exposure history and TB-focused testing, including IGRA and sputum studies, before labeling this as noninfectious disease, and I should keep MERS in mind if there are compatible exposures or epidemiologic links, though sustained human-to-human transmission is limited outside outbreaks [^114crNkr].

> But wait, what if the "infections" are actually asthma or allergic airway disease misclassified as recurrent pneumonia? I need to ensure spirometry with bronchodilator response is performed because asthma is common in young adults and can mimic or coexist with recurrent infections, and distinguishing fixed from reversible airflow obstruction will refine the differential and prevent unnecessary antibiotics [^1137zS9U].

> Next, I should review a staged diagnostic algorithm to avoid shotgun testing. First-line labs should include CBC with differential, quantitative immunoglobulins with IgG subclasses, vaccine-specific antibody titers to pneumococcus and tetanus, HIV testing, and a baseline chest radiograph. If bronchiectasis is suspected or confirmed, proceed to high-resolution CT of the chest and, when indicated, sputum culture for typical and atypical organisms including mycobacteria. If PCD is suspected, add nasal nitric oxide and ciliary studies. If CF is suspected, obtain sweat chloride and CFTR genetics even when prior tests were unrevealing [^112zxh9u] [^1144un2a] [^116gNiF5].

> Hold on, I should verify immediate management while awaiting results. Avoid reflexive repeat antibiotics unless there is clear evidence of acute bacterial infection, ensure vaccinations are up to date, initiate airway clearance if bronchiectasis is present, and refer early to clinical immunology and pulmonology for coordinated evaluation. If CVID or significant hypogammaglobulinemia is confirmed, initiate immunoglobulin replacement therapy to reduce future infection burden and organ damage [^113jdQwz] [^114gLDEs].

> Let me reconsider the differential synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The leading diagnoses here are primary immunodeficiency such as CVID or secondary hypogammaglobulinemia, followed by bronchiectasis due to primary ciliary dyskinesia, and then atypical or late-onset cystic fibrosis, with active tuberculosis remaining a critical infectious mimic that must be excluded early. Asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can coexist and should be assessed with pulmonary function testing and Aspergillus IgE when clinically indicated [^113jdQwz] [^1144un2a] [^112zCpnP].

> I should confirm that my plan aligns with validated warning signs and referral thresholds. The Jeffrey Modell and ESID criteria support immunologic evaluation in adults with recurrent serious infections or poor vaccine responses, and given this patient's age, region, and failure of standard therapy, urgent referral to immunology is warranted to prevent diagnostic delay and cumulative lung injury [^114gLDEs] [^113jdQwz].

---

In a 26-year-old Middle Eastern male with recurrent respiratory infections despite antibiotics, the most likely diagnosis is **primary immunodeficiency** (especially common variable immunodeficiency or selective IgA deficiency) [^114gLDEs] [^113jdQwz], given the age, ethnicity, and poor response to therapy. Other considerations include **bronchiectasis** (often due to primary ciliary dyskinesia or immunodeficiency) [^1144un2a], **cystic fibrosis** (even in adulthood) [^116gNiF5], and **tuberculosis** (given regional risk) [^114crNkr]. Evaluate with immunoglobulin levels, IgG subclasses, specific antibody responses, HIV testing, chest CT, and sputum cultures; consider CFTR testing, PCD screening, and TB testing based on clinical context [^112zxh9u] [^115piTex] [^116a11bE] [^117YL4cT].

## Differential diagnosis

### Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs)

- **Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)**: Presents in late adolescence/adulthood with recurrent respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, and poor antibody responses; often underdiagnosed [^111icH4R].

- **Selective IgA deficiency**: Common PID with recurrent respiratory infections and normal IgG/IgM; may coexist with IgG subclass deficiencies [^notfound].

- **X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA)**: Rare, severe humoral defect with very low IgG and absent B cells; usually diagnosed in childhood but can present later [^notfound].

- **Activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)**: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder with recurrent respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, and lymphadenopathy; Middle Eastern ancestry is represented in cohorts [^1126kMXf].

---

### Structural lung diseases

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic airway dilation with recurrent infections; consider PCD, immunodeficiency, or CF; HRCT confirms diagnosis [^1144un2a].

- **Cystic fibrosis (CF)**: Even without neonatal diagnosis, adult-onset CF can present with recurrent infections; consider sweat testing and CFTR genetics if clinical suspicion persists [^116gNiF5].

- **Tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn syndrome)**: Rare congenital tracheobronchial dilation with recurrent infections; HRCT and bronchoscopy aid diagnosis [^112hhdPN].

---

### Infectious etiologies

Tuberculosis should be considered given the patient's Middle Eastern origin and the potential for atypical or smear-negative disease; **MERS-CoV** is unlikely without exposure but should be considered if there is recent travel or contact with camels or confirmed cases [^114crNkr].

---

### Other considerations

Other considerations include **allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)** — suggested by recurrent infections with asthma-like symptoms and elevated IgE — and **alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency**, which can cause early-onset emphysema and recurrent infections; consider testing if there is a family history or early emphysema [^112zCpnP].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

| **Diagnostic category** | **Tests** |
|-|-|
| Immunodeficiency | - Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM) <br/> - IgG subclasses <br/> - Specific antibody responses (pneumococcal, tetanus) <br/> - HIV testing <br/> - Lymphocyte subsets if indicated [^113jdQwz] [^112zxh9u] |
| Structural lung disease | - High-resolution chest CT (bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomegaly) <br/> - Sputum cultures (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal) <br/> - CFTR genetic testing/sweat test if CF suspected [^111RWekJ] [^116gNiF5] |
| Infectious etiologies | - Tuberculosis testing (IGRA, sputum AFB smear/culture) <br/> - MERS-CoV PCR if exposure risk [^notfound] |
| Other | - Aspergillus IgE/total IgE if ABPA suspected <br/> - Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels if family history or early emphysema [^112zCpnP] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis is **primary immunodeficiency** (CVID or selective IgA deficiency) [^114J97uM], given age, ethnicity, and poor antibiotic response. Bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and tuberculosis are important differentials. A structured workup — immunoglobulins, specific antibodies, chest CT, sputum cultures, and targeted testing for CF/PCD/TB — is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^112kXoWC].

We report the case of a 13-year-old male presenting with recurrent symptoms of respiratory distress after a trauma of the lower limb. Pulmonary symptoms had been misinterpreted for several weeks and only marked symptoms of deep venous (DVT) and caval vein thrombosis later prompted the correct diagnosis of DVT and embolic events and subsequently a successful thrombolytic therapy. The case reported here shows a diagnostic pitfall of pulmonary embolism in an adolescent. It emphasizes the need to consider the possibility of thromboembolic events also in young children and adolescents presenting with atypical pulmonary symptoms and suffering from pulmonary diseases not responding to antibiotic therapy. In addition, although the homozygous PT A20210A gene mutation is a rare defect and its relevance as a risk factor on its own remains to be elucidated, this case suggests that a complete thrombophilia laboratory workup should be performed in young patients with a first symptomatic thromboembolic onset.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

Recurrent respiratory infections

Recurrent respiratory infections in children

Recurrent respiratory infections are common in children. Nearly 25% of children experience RRTIs during their first year of life and approximately 6% of children under 6 years of age experience RRTIs. In most cases, these infections pass with mild symptoms and the frequency of infection tends to reduce over time, with a complete resolution typically around 12 years of age. Nonetheless, RRTIs can significantly negatively impact the quality of life of the child and family and have important medical and social costs. In some cases, URTIs can cause acute complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, glomerulonephritis, and myocarditis.

There is a lack of universal consensus on the definition of RRTIs. A consensus was published proposing an up-to-date definition and recommendations to guide physicians in the complex process of diagnosing, managing, and preventing pediatric RRTIs. For example, childhood respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are considered recurrent if within a year a child aged 6–12 years has three or more RTIs (one of which can be pneumonia, including severe pneumonia) or two mild cases of pneumonia confirmed by X-rays and/or clinical criteria.

The widespread presence of recurrent URTIs is not considered a global phenomenon. However, several cohort studies have attempted to estimate the prevalence of recurrent URTIs. The prospective, observational birth cohort study Steps to the Healthy Development and Well-being of Children (STEPS) observed 1,089 children from their birth until they turned 2 years old, tracking RTIs using a daily symptom diary. Recurrent RTIs were defined as more than 98 days of respiratory illness per year and was reported in 10% of the participant cohort. Approximately 60% of the participants with RRTIs were diagnosed with a minimum of three episodes of acute otitis, 73% received at least three courses of antibiotic treatment and 21% had been hospitalized with an acute form of RTI. By the time the children turned 2 years old, 12% had been diagnosed with asthma. Therefore, the authors concluded that RRTIs are a risk factor for asthma in children.

Acute otitis media (AOM) vs otitis media with effusion (OME) — clinical distinction and antibiotic stewardship: OME may occur either after an episode of AOM or from eustachian tube dysfunction related to an upper respiratory tract infection and may also precede and predispose to AOM; because OME does not represent an acute infectious process that benefits from antibiotics, clinicians should become proficient in distinguishing normal middle ear status from OME or AOM to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, adverse effects, and antimicrobial resistance.

### A case of tracheobronchomegaly misdiagnosed as COPD: case report and literature review [^112hhdPN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tracheobronchomegaly, also known as Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (MKS), is a rare congenital condition characterized by significant dilation of the trachea and main bronchi along with an abnormal wall structure. Diagnosis can be confirmed through computed tomography, pulmonary function tests, and diagnostic bronchoscopy. Currently, there is no curative treatment for MKS; thus, symptomatic and supportive care remain the primary therapeutic approaches. Early diagnosis, effective infection control, and individualized management are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Methods

This case report describes a middle-aged woman who presented with chronic cough, expectoration, and wheezing. She had been misdiagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at a local hospital for an extended period and was subsequently referred to our institution for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, which confirmed the diagnosis of MKS. By reviewing the literature via PubMed, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 29 previously reported cases of MKS, including the present case, totaling 30 cases (21 males and 9 females), predominantly middle-aged and elderly individuals.

Conclusions

Based on our literature review, the misdiagnosis rate of MKS remains high, often accompanied by significant diagnostic delays. Additionally, the proportion of secondary MKS cases has increased, challenging the traditional notion that MKS is exclusively congenital. Despite its rarity, clinicians should consider MKS in patients presenting with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, abnormal tracheobronchial morphology., poor response to antibiotic therapy, or refractory COPD-like symptoms. Early imaging and bronchoscopic evaluations are essential to confirm the diagnosis and prevent delayed treatment.

### Granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency [^114J97uM]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency and consists of impaired immunoglobulin production causing recurrent sinopulmonary infections. The most common cause of mortality for this disorder, however, is from the development of malignancy and autoimmune disorders. One common entity that develops is a systemic granulomatous and lymphoproliferative disorder that can cause an interstitial lung disease more formally referred to as granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GL-ILD). We discuss a case of a 25-year-old woman with common variable immunodeficiency and GL-ILD and review the literature to summarize the most common radiological findings to raise the suspicion for GL-ILD on high-resolution computed tomography and delineate this from infection and other mimickers. We will also review key histopathological characteristics for diagnosis and the clinical approach and treatment options for this rare disease.

### Evaluating the child with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections [^1123Thff]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

We review the limited available evidence on underlying causes of recurrent pneumonia in children, supplemented by our own clinical experience. Diagnosing recurrent pneumonia in children is difficult. Diagnostic confusion is possible with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and asthma. In our series of children with recurrent pneumonia, we never identified asthma as an underlying cause. Because the frequency or severity of recurrent pneumonia does not always justify additional invasive investigations, the diagnostic work-up may be incomplete in a number of cases. This may help to explain why an underlying cause for recurrent pneumonia cannot be found in approximately 30% of cases. Finally, the paradigm that recurrent pneumonia in the same lung lobe has a differential diagnosis different from those recurring in multiple lobes was not borne out in our case series. A stepwise and pragmatic approach to evaluating children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections is recommended.

Results

Patients' characteristics

Fifty-three patients with APDS (34 male patients) from 30 unrelated families were included; 5 patients (4 male) were deceased. Living patients had a mean age of 17.2 years (age range, < 1–65 years). Forty-two patients were of European descent, 4 were Afro-Caribbean, 3 were Middle Eastern, 2 were Indian, 1 was Chinese, and 1 was Japanese. Fifty patients were heterozygous for E1021K, and 3 related subjects were heterozygous for E525K.

Presentation

Recurrent respiratory tract infections occurred in 96% of patients, with onset from less than 1 to 7 years of age. Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or both were common at presentation (42%). Five patients were identified in adulthood after their child received a diagnosis of APDS; 2 had bronchiectasis and recurrent respiratory tract infections, 1 experienced recurrent respiratory tract infections in childhood and a persistent granulomatous local skin reaction to BCG vaccination, 1 was under investigation for chronic cervical lymphadenopathy, and 1 had no reported health issues. The 4 symptomatic adults had abnormal immunoglobulin profiles, including increased IgM and reduced IgG 2 levels, although none had a low total IgG level.

Infective complications

Pneumonia (85%), bronchiectasis (60%), and upper respiratory tract infections were common, often with childhood onset (Table I). Only 2 patients did not report recurrent respiratory tract infections. The most common bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella species also observed. The mean age at diagnosis of bronchiectasis was 8.6 years (range, 1.3–36 years). Four patients had permanent hearing loss from recurrent otitis media. Non–respiratory tract bacterial infections included ocular infections (21%: conjunctivitis [n = 8], dacryocystitis [n = 3], and orbital cellulitis [n = 2]) and abscesses (17%: S aureus skin abscesses [n = 4], salivary gland abscesses [n = 3], dental abscesses [n = 3], and S pneumoniae lymph node abscess [n = 1]). No invasive bacterial infections were reported. Two unrelated patients had persistent granulomatous skin lesions at BCG vaccination injection sites (Fig 1); material from 1 lesion was culture positive for BCG. No other mycobacterial infections were reported.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome: relapse? Hospital infection? [^111AgQNP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The patient attended outpatient clinic on day 35, complaining of exertional dyspnea, low-grade fever, and malaise since her discharge. Her chest radiography showed extensive shadowing. Computer tomographic scan of the thorax indicated widespread ground-glass shadowing in both lung fields, which was especially prominent at left lower and lingular lobes. Her hemoglobin level had dropped further to 8.4 g/dL. Sputum culture yielded substantial growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RT-PCR results of throat and nasal swabs were positive twice for coronavirus, but coronavirus cultures from these areas were negative. One month after onset, her coronavirus antibody titer was 200. In view of possible relapse of SARS, she was treated with oral ribavirin (1,200 mg a day) and lopinavir (133.3 mg a day)/ritonavir (33.3 mg) combination (3 capsules twice a day) in addition to intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam combination. The patient was afebrile, and symptoms improved 3 days after admission. Serial chest radiograph showed gradual resolution of shadowing. Subsequent RT-PCR and sputum culture were negative.

### Rash from the past: a case of recurrent reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption triggered by common coronavirus [^113qXUC7]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human coronaviruses cause respiratory illness, though polymorphic mucocutaneous findings can develop. Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME) is characterized by mucocutaneous eruptions involving 1 or more mucous membranes with limited additional cutaneous involvement. Diagnosis requires 7 to 10 days of prodromal symptoms with clinical, radiographic, or laboratory evidence of a respiratory infection, and a noncontributory medication history. While Mycoplasma pneumoniae –induced rash and mucositis (MIRM) was recognized in 2015, RIME was recognized after realization that other infections including Chlamydia pneumoniae, influenza, enterovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza cause MIRM-like findings. Descriptions of RIME in the literature have increased in frequency with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel pathogenic trigger of RIME. However, there is limited description of recurrent RIME episodes caused by nonpandemic lineage coronaviruses. Further, recurrent episodes of RIME are not well characterized. Here, we present a case in a young-adult male of recurrent RIME secondary to common coronavirus responding to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids.

### A 54-year-old man with chronic cough and recurrent upper respiratory infection [^114FLhXg]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 54-year-old man sought treatment at the ED for a productive cough with green phlegm of approximately 6 months' duration that was accompanied by a 10-pound weight loss, night sweats, and occasional subjective fevers. He had made several prior visits to the ED for the cough and was hospitalized 4 months earlier for similar symptoms, at which time he underwent a bronchoscopy with BAL and was discharged with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. He did not report any itching, rashes, sinus infections, joint swelling, joint pain, or GI symptoms. His long-term medications included omeprazole and amlodipine. The patient had a past medical history of grade III follicular lymphoma for which he completed six cycles of bendamustine 4 years before presentation and had been in remission since. He was a never smoker, had a recent travel history to the Dominican Republic 8 months before admission, and had no recent sick contacts.

### Primary ciliary dyskinesia: when to suspect the diagnosis and how to confirm it [^113RG9Ue]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive condition. The signs and symptoms are due to congenital abnormalities of ciliary structure and function, resulting in impaired mucociliary clearance. This affects the ciliated epithelium lining the nose, sinuses, Eustachian tube and airways. As a consequence, the patient typically presents with a range of features, including recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, persistent glue ear and possible hearing deficit. Around half of all patients will have situs anomalies, most typically situs inversus totalis. The most significant morbidity results from the development of bronchiectasis. Access to early diagnosis and effective treatment is essential to reduce disease progression and to alleviate the burden of symptoms. This review aims to provide a clinical guide to what to look for and when to suspect the diagnosis. Recent advances in the screening and diagnostic tests available will be outlined, as well as some future directions that aim to enhance the current diagnostic techniques.

### Recurrent respiratory infections [^112WXvjf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The child who has recurrent infections poses one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in pediatrics. The clinician faces a two-fold challenge in determining first whether the child is normal or has a serious disease, and then, in the latter case, how to confirm or exclude the diagnosis with the minimum number of the least invasive tests. It is hoped that, in the absence of good-quality evidence for most clinical scenarios, the experience-based approach described in this article may prove a useful guide to the clinician.

### An unusual cause for recurrent chest infections [^1113aSGi]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

We present a case of an elderly non-smoking gentleman who, since 2005, had been admitted multiple times for recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, wheeze, cough and sputum. The patient was treated as exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Bronchoscopy was done which revealed multiple hard nodules in the trachea and bronchi with posterior tracheal wall sparing. Biopsies confirmed this as tracheopathia osteochondroplastica (TO). He had increasing frequency of admission due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas infections, which failed to clear despite intravenous, prolonged oral and nebulised antibiotics. The patient developed increasing respiratory distress and respiratory failure. The patient died peacefully in 2012. This case report highlights the typical pathological and radiological findings of TO and the pitfalls of misdiagnosing patients with recurrent chest infections as COPD.

### Monitoring clinical and microbiological evolution of a cystic fibrosis patient over 26 years: experience of a Brazilian CF centre [^111z3RQP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Burkholderia cepacia complex is a group of opportunistic pathogens in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients believed to be associated with poor prognosis and patient-to-patient transmissibility. Little is known about clinical outcomes after B. vietnamiensis chronic colonization/infection.

Case Presentation

A 33 yo male patient had diagnosis of CF by 7 yo, after recurrent pneumonia during infancy and lobectomy (left upper lobe) at 6 yo. Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) was first isolated by 13 yo, and the patient fulfilled the criteria for chronic colonization by 15 yo. In the following 16 years (1997–2013), there was intermittent isolation of P. aeruginosa and continuous isolation of Bcc, identified as B. vietnamiensis. There was clinical and laboratorial stability for 16 years with annual rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.61 and 1.35%, respectively. From 2013 to 2015, there was significant clinical and lung function deterioration: annual rate of decline in FEV1 and FVC was 3 and 4.1%, respectively while body mass index decreased from 18.1 to 17.1. Episodes of hemoptysis and respiratory exacerbations (with hospital admissions) became more frequent. CF related diabetes was diagnosed (fasting glycemia: 116 mg/dL, oral glucose tolerance test: 305 mg/dL). Because of the severity of the disease in the last years, in addition to traditional microbiological surveillance, microbiome analysis by next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on respiratory secretions. The NGS showed that 97% of the sequencing data were attributed to genus Burkholderia.

Conclusions

We report the case of a 33-year-old male CF patient known to have chronic infection with B. vietnamiensis who remained clinically stable for 16 years and presented recent clinical and laboratorial deterioration. Microbiome analysis of respiratory secretions was performed in 3 samples collected in 2014–2015. Clinical deterioration overlapped with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and microbiome composition revealed no significant differences when compared microbiome results to culture dependent methods.

### Advances in the care of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs): from birth to adulthood [^112hvKKN]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Another example of change and continuing evolution in PID is our improved understanding and approach to the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs). The term CVID describes a heterogeneous set of disorders that are collectively characterized by defective antibody production and which can have a highly variable clinical presentation typified by recurrent infection of the respiratory tract. Readers are referred to recent publications for fuller details of the diagnostic criteria that apply in CVID, ESID Working Clinical Criteria (available here:), and to recent publications describing current PID and CVID classifications.

While survival of patients with CVIDs has improved in recent decades due in part to the wider availability and advances in immunoglobulin replacement therapy, this has exposed a risk of morbidity and mortality in CVID due to secondary, non-infectious complications of disease that may include autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases, functional and structural lung disease, liver diseases, and the development of malignancies. We now appreciate that these secondary complications need to be actively searched out, as part of any diagnosis and patient phenotyping, as well as throughout continuing patient assessment.

Diagnosis on the basis of clinical presentation and close clinical scrutiny of the patient and their history remain of paramount and primary importance; but today, they are not sufficient alone to reach an accurate diagnosis of a CVID because of the large degree of overlap in phenotypes and the variable presentation of different genetic disorders, which may present like CVID but which do not constitute a CVID diagnosis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The three key diagnostic aspects of immunodeficiency to consider in CVID

Among patients diagnosed with CVID, the number with undiagnosed combined immunodeficiency is generally underestimated, and this is a group that needs urgently to be identified through better clinical, laboratory, and increasingly genetic assessment.

The infection profile in CVIDs has been examined in several reports, such as those from the French DEF-I national study in which it was found that upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are highly prevalent and often manifest early as presenting features in CVID. Unusual, opportunistic infections need to be interpreted as potential signs of a combined immunodeficiency, and patients presenting with these need to be further evaluated even when formally fulfilling the criteria for CVID. Similarly, clinical signs of immune dysregulation — often termed as complex CVID patients — should alert for a diagnostic work-up for combined immunodeficiency and end-organ disease(s).

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^113PsMBr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Immunodeficiency in adults is more prevalent than commonly recognized and often remains underdiagnosed due to its heterogeneous presentation. This review highlights the most frequent causes of adult-onset immunodeficiency and provides a structured approach to its evaluation. Early recognition and appropriate workup are crucial, as delayed diagnosis may lead to recurrent, severe, or opportunistic infections with significant morbidity. It is essential to emphasize that a normal initial workup does not exclude underlying immunodeficiency, particularly in high-risk patients. Therefore, individuals with recurrent infections, poor vaccine responses, or other clinical features suggestive of immune dysfunction should be referred to an immunology specialist for comprehensive assessment and tailored management. A multidisciplinary approach involving primary care providers, immunologists, infectious diseases physicians, and other specialists is key to optimizing patient outcomes and preventing long-term complication.

### Diagnostic approach to the etiology of recurrent pneumonia in children [^112kXoWC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In RP patients, etiological investigations should be systematic and take into account the characteristics of the patient population and geographical region. The utilization of diagnostic algorithms according to recurrence in the same or different areas is a particularly beneficial aspect of this process.

It is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between asthma and RP episodes or whether it is a coincidental association due to inadequate differential diagnosis. In this context, we believe that prospective studies applying diagnostic algorithms may be more comprehensive and informative.

Learning points

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is the most common among a rare group of congenital anomalies of the lower respiratory tract.
Diagnosing congenital anomalies in adults is often challenging and can easily be overlooked. We suggest including CPAM in a broad list of differentials in adult patients who present with pneumothorax, cystic lung disease, recurrent chest infection and/or haemoptysis.
Early diagnosis of CPAM and timely intervention can potentially avoid life-threatening complications and improve quality of life. It is noteworthy that surgery can be curative.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^114gLDEs]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation and Warning Signs

The clinical presentation of immunodeficiencies is highly variable, but most patients present with recurrent and/or severe infections. While no universally accepted definition exists for recurrent or severe infections in the context of immunodeficiency, certain patterns of infections should raise suspicion of an underlying immune defect. These include opportunistic infections (i.e. infections due to pathogens that would not cause disease in individuals with healthy immune systems), recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and severe infections requiring intravenous antibiotics, hospitalization, invasive interventions or that are life-threatening. In the context of IEI, the European Society for Immunodeficiency (ESID) and the Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) have proposed warning signs which should raise the suspicion of an underlying IEI in adults and children (Table 1). The JMF criteria have been clinically validated to evaluate IEI and SID patients, and may serve as a useful tool for the early detection of SID. Other warning signs for immunodeficiency in adults that should not be overlooked include chronic diarrhea, bronchiectasis, poor vaccine responses, autoimmune disorders, persistent lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, and granulomatous lesions. Additional scoring systems for early identification of patients affected by IEI based on expert opinions are in development, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy in primary care settings. Data-driven model systems using machine learning can also help screen individuals at high risk of IEI.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus: a multidisciplinary approach [^116Ctqfp]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 17-year-old Caucasian male presented to ENT with angular stomatitis, oral ulceration and cervical lymphadenopathy. Over the subsequent 18 months he developed recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, pyrexia of unknown origin, oral ulceration and maxillary sinus osteomyelitis. Extensive investigation ensued from various specialties. Positive investigations included a mild but persistently elevated serum Epstein-Barr virus PCR; however, no unifying diagnosis was elicited. It is noteworthy that a significant factor contributing to a delay in his diagnosis was poor compliance with invasive investigations. Ultimately, deteriorating liver function prompted liver biopsy which confirmed a diagnosis of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV). This enabled referral for curative treatment in the form of a stem cell transplant. CAEBV is extremely rare in Western countries. Due to fatal complications early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment. Our case highlights the need for regular clinical re-evaluation and a comprehensive multispecialty approach in such cases.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^113jdQwz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) definitions and severity criteria propose that adult hypogammaglobulinemia (HG) be defined as a serum IgG level below 700 mg/dL with stratification into 400 to 699 mg/dL, 200 to 399 mg/dL, and 0 to 199 mg/dL; age-appropriate pediatric reference ranges should be considered. To characterize persistence, SHG duration can be categorized as lasting 3 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and more than 24 months. Severe infection is proposed as requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, or antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal therapy for treatment, and recurrent infection is proposed per Jeffrey Modell Foundation criteria as 4 or more new ear infections, 2 or more serious sinus infections, 2 or more pneumonias, and 2 or more deep-seated infections including septicemia.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1124vQyJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

### Recurrent lower respiratory illnesses among young children in rural Kyrgyzstan: overuse of antibiotics and possible under-diagnosis of asthma. A qualitative FRESH AIR study [^1128BuZW]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality among children under 5 years (U5s) worldwide, particularly in developing countries.

Despite the availability of clinical practice guidelines, the management of lower respiratory tract illness (LTR-illness) in young children is often inconsistentdue to challenges in distinguishing between the main diagnostic categories. Clinically, the diagnostic categories can be divided into: viral infections (e.g. bronchitis, bronchiolitis, viral bronchopneumonia), bacterial infections (e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis), obstructive diseases (e.g. asthma and viral wheeze) and more uncommon diseases like tracheomalacia and cystic fibrosis. In general, viral infections are self-limiting, while bacterial infections are treatable with antibiotics, and obstructive diseases respond to steroids and bronchodilators.

In young children presenting with LTR-illnesses, former studies have pointed to an over-diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia with overuse of antibiotics and a corresponding under-diagnosis of asthma/viral wheeze. – Likewise, U5s with the diagnoses "recurrent pneumonia" or "recurrent bronchitis" often suffered from asthma, indicating that asthma was under-diagnosed and wrongly managed as recurrent pneumonia. –

The inappropriate use of antibiotics, the growing costs, and an alarming rise in antibiotic microbial resistance pose major health challenges. World leaders in the G7, G20 and the UN General Assembly have declared antimicrobial resistance to be a global crisis.

Asthma is a high-prevalent heterogeneous disease, likely in young children who have chronic or recurrent long periods of cough, wheeze and/or breathing difficulties, particularly if symptoms are most pronounced at night and in the early morning. However, many young children wheeze with viral infections, and deciding when a child should be given treatment is difficult. The frequency and severity of wheezing episodes and the temporal pattern of symptoms should be taken into account.

### Gastrointestinal presentations of common variable immunodeficiency: hiding in plain sight [^111icH4R]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency disorders typically have an onset in childhood. The suspicion for these conditions usually arises from a history of recurrent respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cutaneous infections with a history often dating back to infancy or early childhood. However, adults can also be affected. Common variable immunodeficiency, which usually has an onset/diagnosis in adulthood, is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency. However, as its presentation could be manifold, its diagnosis is often delayed. The gastrointestinal tract is the second most affected system after the respiratory tract; symptoms associated with the gastrointestinal tract are often intractable. As patients with common variable immunodeficiency are often misdiagnosed, a high index of suspicion and clinical correlation is required for the appropriate diagnosis of this potentially debilitating condition.

### Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections in children: a practical approach to diagnosis [^116wxsZC]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Many children are affected by recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), but the majority of them do not suffer from serious lung or extrapulmonary disease. The challenge for clinicians is to distinguish the recurrent RTIs with self-limiting or minor problems from those with underlying disease. The aim of this review is to describe a practical approach to children with recurrent LRTIs that limits unnecessary, expensive and time-consuming investigations. The children can be divided into three groups on the basis of their personal and family history and clinical findings: 1) otherwise healthy children who do not need further investigations; 2) those with risk factors for respiratory infections for whom a wait-and-see approach can be recommended; and 3) those in whom further investigations are mandatory. However, regardless of the origin of the recurrent LRTIs, it is important to remember that prevention by means of vaccines against respiratory pathogens (i.e. type b Haemophilus influenzae, pertussis, pneumococcal and influenza vaccines) can play a key role.

### Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD foundation consensus recommendations based on state of the art review [^1144un2a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent otitis media (ROM) with chronic middle ear effusion affects at least 80% of children with PCD, particularly in the first year of life. 31 Complications of ROM may include multiple sets of pressure equalization tubes, conductive hearing loss, speech/language delay, or need for hearing aids. 32 Chronic middle ear disease is quite common in the general pediatric population; thereby, ROM alone is insufficient to warrant further PCD testing. The absence of ROM goes against, but does not rule out, a diagnosis of PCD.

Recurrent pneumonia or bronchitis is common in PCD; however, some infants will lack this history due to frequent antibiotics for nasal discharge and otitis media. By preschool age, up to 80% of PCD patients have recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. 4 Bronchiectasis, predominantly affecting the middle and lower lobes, 33 is an age‐related finding in PCD, with 50% of children having bronchiectasis by 8 years of age and nearly universal presence in adults. 34, 35 In adults with PCD, the combination of bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis may be the most readily identifiable PCD‐related features because adults with PCD may not be able to recall age of onset of early childhood symptoms.

Finally, infertility occurs in nearly 100% of adult males with PCD, while females with PCD also have reduced fertility. The structure in both sperm tails and the fimbriae of fallopian tubes are almost identical to those in respiratory cilia. Thus, males with PCD have diminished fertility through reduced sperm motility, 36 while females with PCD have increased risk of ectopic pregnancy from abnormal fallopian transit of oocytes. 37

All of the above features may not be seen in each individual patient with PCD; however, most patients have 3 or more of the above features. The combination of multiple distinct clinical features of PCD (neonatal respiratory distress, chronic wet cough with recurrent lower respiratory infections and bronchiectasis, chronic nasal drainage with pansinusitis, recurrent otitis media particularly in childhood, laterality defect, and male infertility) markedly increases the likelihood of a PCD diagnosis.

### Recurrent lower respiratory illnesses among young children in rural Kyrgyzstan: overuse of antibiotics and possible under-diagnosis of asthma. A qualitative FRESH AIR study [^111HXc3j]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Infection diagnoses

The main diagnoses suggested by the HPs, when presented with the case history of a 12-month-old child with recurrent cough and some wheeze, were infectious diagnoses, especially pneumonia and a multitude of bronchitis diagnoses (Table 1).

The prevalent use of the pneumonia diagnosis may have been relevant in some instances. However, the pneumonia diagnosis often disregarded essential criteria, for instance, in children without fever. Furthermore, untraditional labels used such as "protracted courses of pneumonia" are unfounded, as bacterial pneumonia is characterised by acute, high temperature together with cough and respiratory distress and often quickly cured with antibiotics. In Eigen's study,92% of the young children with so-called permanent or recurrent pneumonia had evidence of airway hyper-reactivity, concluding that asthma was a common cause, even in the absence of wheezing.

The variety of bronchitis diagnoses applied (Table 1) were often managed with antibiotics. However, bronchitis and "acute bronchitis" are defined as virally induced and self-limiting infections with cough, without the need for antibiotics. Likewise, the diagnosis "chronic bronchitis" signals a long-term infection, which in other settings is associated with asthma. Other bronchitis prefixes used, such as: "obstructive", "asthmatic", and "allergic" or "allergic obstructive bronchitis" connote to viral asthma/wheeze. However, the treatment provided was mostly antibiotics, which is not aligned with the management of recurrent viral wheeze/asthma in U5s.

Case 5

A 26 year-old woman is recently known for CVID. She was referred to our clinic for extensive bilateral bronchiectasis. Her laboratory results showed hypogammaglobulinemia (IgM = 0.0.14 g/L normal: 0.4–2.6, IgG = 4.1 g/L normal: 6.5–18, IgA = 0.05 g/L normal: 0.7–3.6). She is getting IVIg now but she became pregnant 2 years ago while her diagnosis was not made and no immunotherapy was given. She had severe dyspnea and suffered from recurrent pneumonia during her pregnancy that was treated with antibiotic. She gave birth to a healthy boy baby. We do not have the immunoglobulin level of the child at birth but according to the mother's statement he had no serious infection in his first 6 months of life.

Case 6

Male patient with CVID born out of a consanguineous marriage. Whole exome sequencing revealed 2 heterozygous mutations in TNFRSF13B gene. This male patients married a healthy appeared woman and his wife became pregnant. During pregnancy, his wife underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS), fetal DNA was obtained and revealed homozygous mutation in TNFRSF13B gene suggesting a strange fact that the mother is carrier of a mutation in the same gene while she is not a family member of the father. The boy infant was born and advised not to receive any live attenuated vaccine. He was brought to our clinic for further evaluation and hypogammaglobulinemia was found in his lab data in his 6-month-old visit (IgG = 1.5 g/L, IgA = 0.1 g/L, IgM = 0.2 g/L).

Case 7

A male child with meningitis, recurrent upper and lower respiratory infections was diagnosed with X-linked Agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) deficiency. The parents conceived their second child before genetic counseling. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was performed in 12 weeks gestation, DNA is extracted and sequenced. The mutation exists in the fetus as well. Fetal DNA sample was checked for maternal DNA contamination by short tandem repeats markers. Although in this case abortion was legally allowed, the parents chose to preserve the boy offspring. We only advised them avoid live vaccination for him.

### A rare case report of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS): diagnostic pitfalls [^112PgY1w]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Activated PI3K Delta Syndrome (APDS) is a rare autosomal dominant inborn error of immunity (IEI) caused by overactivation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, leading to impaired T- and B-cell differentiation, progressive lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and elevated IgM. Clinically, it presents with early-onset recurrent infections, chronic lymphoproliferation, and autoimmunity, though severity varies widely, from severe childhood disease to asymptomatic adults. The phenotype overlaps with other IEIs such as CVID, CTLA-4 deficiency, NFKB1 deficiency, and STAT3 gain-of-function, often leading to misdiagnosis. Indeed, Rivalta B. et al. described cases initially diagnosed as hyper-IgM syndrome, CVID, or unspecified hypogammaglobulinemia, underscoring the diagnostic challenges.

The suspicion of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and the diagnosis of APDS are usually delayed. Typically, symptoms of APDS present in early childhood with recurrent infections, particularly involving the lungs, sinuses, and ears. In the most recent cohort reported by Barzaghi F. et al. the classical onset was characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, often mild but frequent, and associated with airway remodelling. Coulter et al. reported that recurrent respiratory tract infections were the most common presentation, observed in 98% of patients, with onset before the age of 7 years. This was followed by recurrent otitis media (48%) and rhinosinusitis (45%). Similarly, Jamee et al. found that the most frequent infections in APDS patients were pneumonia (43.6%), otitis media (28.8%), sinusitis (25.9%), diarrhoea (16%), and eye infections (10.7%). A genotype–phenotype correlation has also been suggested, with sinusitis more commonly reported in APDS1, while pneumonia is more frequently observed in APDS2. Notably, bronchiectasis, a marker of chronic pulmonary damage, has been reported in 28–60% of patients across various cohorts, with a mean age at diagnosis of 8.6 years.

Results

Immune system defects in CSR-deficient patients

Patient 1 (P1) was the unique child born from a Turkish nonconsanguineous family. He presented with severe, recurrent bacterial infections at the age of 5 years. No opportunistic infections were noticed. A serum immunoglobulin assay revealed normal IgM levels (0.7 g/L) but decreased IgG (4.7 g/L) and IgA (0.09 g/L) levels. P1 received prophylactic antibiotics with no immunoglobulin substitution. During follow-up, the IgG levels (including IgG isotypes) and IgA levels rose progressively but remained lower than normal at 10 years of age (Table I). No specific antibody response to antigenic challenge could be studied.

Patient 2 (P2) was an English-born male not related to P1 who first suffered from severe and recurrent upper respiratory infections at the age of 18. No susceptibility to opportunistic infections was reported. At diagnosis, he presented with depressed IgG levels (0.70 g/L) and IgA levels (0.03 g/L) but had normal IgM levels (0.87 g/L). At the time of evaluation, P2 was 67 years old and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease following 35 years of smoking. Immunoglobulin assays revealed a lack of serum IgA but a slight decrease of serum IgM; IgG (and specific antibody response) could not be evaluated because of the patient's regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy (Table I). The patient responded well to immunoglobulin replacement therapy, with the exception of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Transmission characteristics of MERS and SARS in the healthcare setting: a comparative study [^114crNkr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) is a zoonotic pathogen that has caused recurrent spillovers in the human population since March 2012. A total of 1,047 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS including 460 deaths have been reported in Saudi Arabia alone as of 15 July 2015; the concentration of human infections in this region is thought to be linked to the local population of dromedary camels, which may serve as an intermediate host for MERS. The human-to-human transmission potential of MERS is thought to be subcritical, although there is occasional amplification in the healthcare setting. While sporadic importations of MERS to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America via returning travelers from the Middle East had not sparked local outbreaks until recently, a single importation into South Korea on 4 May 2015 triggered the largest cluster of cases outside the Middle East to date. The index patient was a 68-year-old businessman who visited several countries in the Middle East before returning to South Korea via Qatar, where he developed respiratory symptoms on 11 May 2015. An accurate diagnosis of MERS was not established until 20 May 2015, after the index patient had sought treatment in several different healthcare facilities. A total of 186 MERS infections in South Korea have been linked to the healthcare facilities visited by the index patient and subsequent infections. As a result of this large cluster, more than 6,000 contacts have been monitored in South Korea.

Although large-scale community transmission has not been reported for MERS, large hospital clusters are not infrequent and can amplify transmission, which aligns with the transmission characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a related coronavirus that sparked global concern in 2002–2003. Coronaviruses associated with both syndromes have high affinity to the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia, particularly among older adults with underlying medical conditions. Both viruses are thought to be associated with some degree of transmission heterogeneity, indicating that super-spreading events are expected.

While the individual heterogeneity of MERS (i.e. variation in the transmissibility by individuals) has been explored recently, here we focus exclusively on hospital outbreaks, where transmission is amplified. Further, we provide the first head-to-head comparison with SARS and carry out a comparative analysis of the transmission characteristics and exposure patterns of previously reported hospital clusters of MERS and SARS to assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial outbreak and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters.

We present the case of a child given a CFSPID designation in early life who was later reclassified as having CF based on a combination of recurrent respiratory symptoms and CFTR functional testing, despite normal sweat chloride levels. Here we demonstrate the importance of monitoring these children, each time reviewing the diagnosis based on updated understanding of individual CFTR mutation phenotypes or clinical findings inconsistent with the designation. This case identifies situations in which the CFSPID designation should be challenged, and gives an approach for this when CF is suspected.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae-an emerging extra-pulmonary pathogen [^117GCDVr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma is a well-recognised pathogen that colonises mucosal surfaces of humans and animals. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts of children and adults, leading to a wide range of respiratory and non-respiratory clinical conditions. M. pneumoniae infection is frequently considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with respiratory illnesses, and is commonly managed empirically with macrolides and fluoroquinolones. This contrasts with patients who present with non-respiratory symptoms in the context of a recent or current unrecognised M. pneumoniae infection, for whom this pathogen is rarely considered in the initial differential diagnosis. This review considers the microbiological, epidemiological, pathogenic and clinical features of this frequent pathogen that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory and non-respiratory infections.

Recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis (RABS) — microbiology and prophylaxis: The microbiology of RABS is similar to that of isolated acute bacterial sinusitis and warrants the same treatment, but closely spaced sequential antimicrobial courses may foster emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial species in recurrent episodes. There are no systematically evaluated options for prevention of RABS in children; in general, prolonged prophylactic antimicrobial therapy should be avoided and is not usually recommended, though when there are no recognizable predisposing conditions in children with RABS, prophylactic antimicrobial agents may be used for several months during the respiratory season, and prophylaxis should only be considered in carefully selected children with thoroughly documented infections.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1137zS9U]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Challenges in clinical diagnosis — airflow patterns and age‑related presentation: Although asthma is characterized by variable expiratory airflow limitation, at least initially, and COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, the definitions of asthma and COPD are not mutually exclusive; in children and young adults with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms the differential diagnosis differs from older adults and, once other conditions are excluded, the most likely chronic airway disease in children and young adults is asthma, whereas in adults with long‑standing asthma persistent airflow limitation may be found and patients with COPD may show evidence of reversible airflow obstruction when a rapid‑acting bronchodilator is administered, so in medical records such patients often are assigned both diagnoses.

### Cystic fibrosis in disguise-the wolf in sheep's clothing, a case report [^113hvDLL]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood hypoglycemia in combination with hepatomegaly is suspicious for inborn errors of metabolism. Cystic fibrosis typically presents with failure to thrive, pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms. Hepatic involvement and hypoglycemia can occur in a significant number of patients, although hepatomegaly is uncommon.

Case presentation

A 28 months old boy was presented with recurrent upper airways infections, progressive lethargy and weight loss. Clinically hepatomegaly was the main presenting feature and hypoglycemia (minimum 1.4 mmol/l) was noted as were elevated transaminases. The patient did not produce enough sweat to analyze it. Infectious causes for hepatitis were excluded and a broad metabolic work-up initiated. A therapy with starch was initiated to control hypoglycemia. In further course loose stools were reported and pancreatic elastase was found to be reduced. A further sweat test yielded pathological chloride concentration and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

Conclusions

Cystic fibrosis is a systemic disease and less common presentations need to be considered. Even in the age of CF-newborn screening in many countries CF needs to be ruled out in typical and atypical clinical presentations and diagnostics need to be repeated if inconclusive.

### The spectrum of disease manifestations in patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and partial antibody deficiency in a university hospital [^114UV3hj]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Partial Antibody Deficiency

Of the nine patients with IgG subclass deficiency most were Caucasian (8 patients, 89%) and one patient originated from the Far East. Seven patients were female (78%) and two male (22%). The median age when symptoms started was 16 years (IQR 4–37 yrs) and the median age at diagnosis was 38 years (IQR 14–45 yrs). None of the patients died during follow up. Four patients were diagnosed with an IgG4 deficiency of which one had IgG therapy and one antibiotic prophylaxis. Two patients had an IgG2 deficiency, one on IgG therapy and antibiotics prophylaxis as well and one patient was on antibiotics only. Two patients had a IgG3 deficiency, both on antibiotic prophylaxis and one patient with a combined IgG2,3 and 4 deficiency who was treated by IgG therapy and antibiotics prophylaxis. The two patients without therapy became free of infections. One out of four patients on antibiotic prophylaxes and one on out of three patients on IgG therapy became infection free.

As shown in Table II all patients had infections prior to diagnosis which mainly consisted of respiratory tract infections. Two of the 9 patients with an IgG subclass deficiency had suffered form from bacterial meningitis. In contrast to CVID, patients with a selective IgG deficiency did not suffer from gastrointestinal infections.

Despite a median time to diagnosis of ten years (IQR 0–33 yrs). None of the patients developed chronic pulmonary disease or other complications during follow up.

Of the nine patients diagnosed with Selective antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins (SADNI) six were female (67%) and three male (33%) and all were Caucasian. The median age at start of the symptoms was 33 years (IQR 20–44 yrs) and the median age at diagnosis was 44 years (IQR 21–50 yrs). The median IgG at diagnosis was 10.3 g/L (IQR 6.6–17.7 g/L). None of the patients died during follow up.

### Reconsidering the diagnosis: abnormal sweat chloride tests in non-CF bronchiectasis [^116gNiF5]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Overall, this study reveals a large cohort of patients with intermediate or positive sweat chloride tests, most of which have clinical features suggestive of CF, but without two disease‐causing variants in CFTR. More specifically, these patients were characterized by late‐onset of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections by atypical pathogens, and most were pancreatic sufficient and without significant gastrointestinal disease. Notably, this presentation is consistent with prior cases of patients diagnosed with CF in adulthood. While not all alternative pathologies were definitively ruled out, such as immunodeficiency or primary ciliary dyskinesia, the combination of elevated sweat chloride and pulmonary disease is most consistent with CF. Altogether, this data suggests pathologic dysfunction of CFTR or other related protein in the patients reported in this study, possibly due to an unidentified genetic cause.

Interestingly, a majority of this cohort was female and white, and of the three males included in the final analysis, two were significantly younger than the median age and two identified as African American. While the reason for this skewed demographic remains elusive, it is also reflective of the larger adult non‐CF bronchiectasis population as described by the Bronchiectasis Research Registry Consortium in the United States. Of the 1826 patients enrolled from 2008 to 2014, 79% were female and 89% were white. A similar registry in Europe also reports a population that is majority female.

### A young patient with recurrent respiratory tract infection and anasarca [^11483Uuh]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A young man with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections for the past 8 years presented with generalised anasarca. He was found to have advanced renal disease (stage 4) and a profound proteinuria of 82.9 g/day. Further workup revealed the presence of advanced bronchiectatic changes in the lungs. Rectal biopsy showed the characteristic pattern of amyloid deposition. A diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis secondary to bronchiectasis was made. To the best of our knowledge no other cases of bronchiectasis-associated renal amyloid disease with such marked proteinuria have been reported in the literature. Our patient had a relatively short duration between the onset of his symptoms related to underlying bronchiectasis and his clinical presentation of renal amyloidosis. He had an aggressive course of disease and unfortunately died at a very young age.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^113BBC6c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) seasonal influenza guideline (2018 update) — executive summary epidemiology and clinical impact: Seasonal influenza A and B virus epidemics are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza among all ages in the United States during 2010–2016 approximately 8% and varying from 3% to 11%. During 2010–2018 in the United States, seasonal influenza epidemics were associated each year with an estimated 4.3–23 million medical visits, 140 000–960 000 hospitalizations, and 12 000–79 000 respiratory and circulatory deaths, while a modeling study estimated 291 243–645 832 seasonal influenza–associated respiratory deaths annually worldwide. Use of available diagnostic modalities and proper interpretation can accurately identify patients presenting with influenza; timely diagnosis may decrease unnecessary testing and antibiotic use, improve infection prevention and control measures, and increase appropriate antiviral use; early treatment with antivirals reduces symptom duration and the risk of some complications and hospitalization, and may decrease mortality among high-risk populations.

Case Presentation

A 49-year-old man presented with 3 months of persistent fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. He had no response to treatment with antibiotics. He had been treated with an empiric 2-week course of steroids approximately 2 months before presentation, with mild and transient improvement. He did not use tobacco and had not experienced any weight loss, hemoptysis, arthralgia, or myalgia, and was otherwise in good health. He denied contact with anyone with pulmonary TB or other respiratory illnesses.
