## Question

Does plantar fasciitis needs surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether plantar fasciitis requires surgery and, if not, when surgery should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and how often symptoms resolve without surgery. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about first-line conservative care and its expected success rates. Next, I will define what constitutes "refractory" disease and the minimum duration of conservative therapy before surgery is appropriate. After that, I should review the surgical options, their indications, and the strength of evidence. Finally, I will weigh risks, benefits, and alternatives like ESWT or injections, and synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the natural history, because I need to ensure we are not over-treating a self-limited condition. Plantar fasciitis is common and, in most patients, improves over time; approximately 80% improve within 12 months with conservative care, and many resolve even without formal treatment, though earlier intervention tends to shorten symptom duration, so I should be cautious not to jump to surgery too quickly [^115q1q2v] [^112Voj19].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management and its expected success, and I need to check that I am aligning with current guidelines. High-quality guidance recommends plantar fascia–specific stretching, gastrocnemius–soleus stretching, activity modification, footwear changes, taping, and orthoses as part of a multimodal program, with NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections used selectively; importantly, most patients improve with these measures, and success rates around 80–90% are consistently reported in reviews and guidelines, which supports a conservative-first approach [^113DEfdB] [^112YLHGa] [^1112UiBi] [^115q1q2v] [^112CfzPU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about injections. I should double-check the evidence and risks. Corticosteroid injections can provide short-term pain relief but have limited medium-term benefit and a small but real risk of plantar fascia rupture, so they should be used judiciously and not as a routine first step. PRP shows promise for longer-term pain and function in some comparative studies, but heterogeneity and variable blinding temper certainty, so shared decision-making is key if considering regenerative options [^1162gKrT] [^1175KZzD] [^1157A8vq] [^116amdAJ].

> I will now examine when surgery becomes appropriate, and I need to ensure I am precise about the "refractory" threshold. Multiple guidelines converge on considering surgery only after at least 6 to 12 months of appropriate conservative therapy, with persistent, function-limiting pain despite stretching, orthoses, activity modification, and possibly ESWT or injections; this refractory window helps avoid premature operative intervention in a condition that often resolves spontaneously [^111QDiRD] [^112CfzPU] [^115q1q2v].

> Let me consider the surgical options and their indications, and I should verify the nuance about equinus. Plantar fasciotomy, either open or endoscopic, is the standard surgical procedure for recalcitrant cases, while gastrocnemius recession is specifically indicated when clinically significant equinus is present; minimally invasive techniques may offer faster early recovery, but long-term outcomes appear comparable to open approaches, so technique selection should balance anatomy, surgeon expertise, and patient goals [^114wV7Qj] [^111RbUaA] [^114cJgKc] [^112Z2VjR].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for surgery versus continued nonoperative care, because I should not overstate surgical superiority. Randomized data are limited. One RCT suggested endoscopic surgery improved Foot Function Index at 12 months and activity-related pain at 24 months versus a supervised rehabilitation program, but the difference attenuated by 24 months, underscoring that high-quality comparative evidence remains sparse and that patient selection and rehabilitation quality likely influence outcomes substantially [^1162E2d3].

> I need to check complication profiles and biomechanical trade-offs to counsel patients accurately. Surgical release can be complicated by lateral column overload and metatarsalgia, with risk rising when more than about 50% of the fascia is released; nerve injury, arch strain, and delayed healing can occur, and although satisfaction is high in case series, these are nonrandomized data, so I should present them cautiously during shared decision-making [^115aAimz] [^117SFE7Z] [^116xerXJ].

> But wait, what if we can avoid surgery with intermediate options? I should review ESWT and injections as bridges. ESWT is a reasonable nonoperative alternative for chronic, refractory symptoms, with meta-analytic data supporting short-term pain and function benefits, though heterogeneity and variable protocols limit certainty; PRP may offer superior medium-term outcomes versus corticosteroids in some analyses, yet evidence quality varies and access or cost may influence choice, so these should be framed as alternatives before proceeding to surgery [^115QcJFZ] [^111eVb8B] [^1157A8vq] [^111jQCig].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach, and I should confirm it aligns with guideline tiers. Start with education, stretching, footwear modification, taping or orthoses, and activity adjustment for at least 3 months. If inadequate, add night splints, formal physical therapy, and consider a single corticosteroid injection for short-term relief while acknowledging rupture risk. If symptoms persist beyond 6 to 12 months despite these measures, discuss ESWT or PRP as advanced conservative options. Reserve plantar fasciotomy and, when equinus is present, gastrocnemius recession for carefully selected refractory cases after shared decision-making and confirmation of the diagnosis, ideally with ultrasound or MRI if uncertainty remains [^1136matF] [^115q1q2v] [^111xKqNm] [^114wV7Qj].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. No, plantar fasciitis does not need surgery for most patients. Surgery is indicated only for a minority with chronic, refractory symptoms after an adequate trial of conservative care, typically 6 to 12 months, with persistent pain that limits function and quality of life, and even then, the decision should be individualized, incorporating patient preferences, anatomy, and the risks and benefits of operative versus continued nonoperative strategies [^115q1q2v] [^112CfzPU] [^114wV7Qj].

Most patients with plantar fasciitis **do not need surgery** [^112CfzPU]; fewer than 5–10% require it [^116yMz2E]. Surgery is reserved for **chronic, refractory cases** [^114wV7Qj] that persist beyond 6–12 months despite comprehensive conservative care [^112CfzPU] and significant functional impairment. Minimally invasive options (endoscopic or percutaneous release) offer faster recovery and fewer complications than open surgery [^114cJgKc] [^116SMria], with success rates of 70–90% [^112xP19i] but risks of lateral column pain, arch instability, and nerve injury [^115aAimz] [^112xP19i]. Conservative treatments — stretching, orthoses, night splints, ESWT, and injections — should be exhausted before considering surgery [^112CfzPU] [^115q1q2v].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is **not first-line** and is reserved for specific scenarios:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Chronic heel pain lasting ≥ 6–12 months despite comprehensive conservative therapy [^112CfzPU] [^114wV7Qj].
- **Functional impairment**: Significant limitation of daily activities, work, or sport [^115q1q2v].
- **Failure of conservative treatments**: Exhaustion of stretching, orthoses, night splints, ESWT, and injections [^1136matF] [^115QcJFZ] [^1175KZzD].
- **Patient preference**: Informed choice after counseling on risks, benefits, and alternatives [^112Voj19].

---

## Surgical procedures for plantar fasciitis

Several **surgical options** exist, each with distinct advantages and risks:

| **Surgical procedure** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Risks/complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Open plantar fasciotomy | Traditional open release of plantar fascia | - Direct visualization <br/> - Proven efficacy | - Larger incision <br/> - Longer recovery <br/> - Higher wound complications |
| Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy | Minimally invasive release via small incisions | - Smaller incisions <br/> - Faster recovery <br/> - Lower wound complications | - Nerve injury <br/> - Lateral column pain <br/> - Arch instability |
| Percutaneous plantar fasciotomy | Minimally invasive release with needle or scalpel | - Minimal incision <br/> - Rapid recovery <br/> - Low complication rate | - Limited visualization <br/> - Incomplete release <br/> - Recurrence |
| Gastrocnemius recession | Lengthening of gastrocnemius for equinus contracture | - Addresses equinus <br/> - Reduces tension on fascia | - Calf weakness <br/> - Achilles tendon injury <br/> - Recurrence |

---

Minimally invasive techniques (endoscopic or percutaneous) are **preferred** for faster recovery and fewer complications [^114cJgKc] [^116SMria].

---

## Success rates and outcomes

Surgical outcomes are **generally favorable**, with success rates of 70–90% for significant pain relief and functional improvement [^116yMz2E]. Minimally invasive approaches yield faster recovery, less postoperative pain, and quicker return to activity than open surgery [^114cJgKc] [^116SMria]. However, complications can occur, including lateral column pain, arch instability, nerve injury, and recurrence [^115aAimz].

---

## Conservative treatments and their effectiveness

Conservative treatments are **effective for most patients** and should be exhausted before surgery:

- **Stretching exercises**: Plantar fascia–specific and calf stretching reduce pain and improve function [^113DEfdB] [^114WzAeB].
- **Orthotic devices**: Prefabricated or custom orthoses provide short-term pain relief and functional improvement [^112YLHGa] [^1152JWWW].
- **Night splints**: Recommended for 1–3 months in patients with morning pain [^112p6QUL].
- **Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)**: Effective for chronic plantar fasciitis unresponsive to conservative therapy [^115QcJFZ] [^111eVb8B].
- **Corticosteroid injections**: Provide short-term relief but carry risks of plantar fascia rupture and fat pad atrophy [^1162gKrT] [^113QHc6Y].

---

## Risks and complications of surgical intervention

Surgical intervention carries **potential risks and complications**, including:

- **Lateral column pain**: Common after excessive fascia release [^115aAimz].
- **Arch instability**: Due to loss of plantar fascia integrity [^115EPuUH].
- **Nerve injury**: Particularly with endoscopic techniques [^1136BFbh].
- **Recurrence**: Persistent or recurrent symptoms despite surgery [^notfound].
- **Infection**: Rare but possible [^notfound].

---

## Patient selection criteria for surgery

Careful **patient selection** is essential; candidates should have:

- **Chronic symptoms**: ≥ 6–12 months of persistent pain [^112CfzPU].
- **Failure of conservative treatments**: Exhaustion of non-surgical options [^1136matF].
- **Significant functional impairment**: Limitation of daily activities or sport [^115q1q2v].
- **Realistic expectations**: Understanding risks, benefits, and recovery [^notfound].

---

## Recovery and rehabilitation

Postoperative recovery varies by technique: minimally invasive procedures allow **weight-bearing within days** and return to normal activities in 2–4 weeks, whereas open surgery may require several weeks of immobilization and a longer rehabilitation period. Physical therapy is essential to restore strength, flexibility, and function [^115UR473] [^117BrKXw] [^113DEfdB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Most patients with plantar fasciitis **do not need surgery** [^112CfzPU]; fewer than 5–10% require it [^116yMz2E]. Surgery is reserved for chronic, refractory cases with persistent pain and functional impairment despite comprehensive conservative care. Minimally invasive techniques offer favorable outcomes with faster recovery, but risks remain. Conservative treatments should be exhausted before surgical intervention is considered [^1136matF].

BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Most patients with plantar fasciitis will improve within 12 months, but at least 10% may go on to develop persisting symptoms. There is evidence of benefit from treatment with various low-risk conservative therapies including rest/activity modification, stretches and/or taping, insoles/orthoticsand possibly some evidence for the use of tension night splints (TNS) although this remains uncertain.

Corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injections are often used in patients with plantar fasciitis, and a variety of differing techniques and broad outcome figures for success rates are reported in the literature; however, some papers report a plantar fascia rupture rate of up to 10% indicating that some caution may be needed. If these measures prove unsuccessful, then a range of more invasive options have been suggested including extracorporeal shockwave therapy, autologous blood injectionsor surgery. However, comparing outcomes from these different options is often difficult due to the heterogeneity of patient populations, treatment interventions and follow-up, and many of these have not been subject to rigorously designed investigation.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective comparative studies [^1157A8vq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain, which often results in a significant limitation of daily activity. The objective of this review was to compare platelet-rich plasma injection (PRP) and corticosteroids injection in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library of clinical trials were searched in March 2019. Inclusion criteria were prospective comparative studies reporting functional scores or pain score with a minimum follow-up of 1 month. We excluded studies with patients younger than 18 years and patients with a history of surgical intervention, infection, or rheumatological disease. First author, publication year, sample size, type of intervention, outcome measures, and follow-up period were recorded. The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score was significantly better in the PRP group at 6 months' follow-up, with a lower visual analogue scale at 6- and 12-month intervals. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and Roles-Maudsley score were similar in the 2 treatments at 3 and 6 months. PRP injection in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis is considered safe, with a favorable functional outcome and pain control at intermediate and long-term follow-up in comparison to corticosteroid injection.

Patients and methods

Ethical approval of the study protocol

The research protocol was approved (85/2016) by the Bioethics and Biosafety Committee at the University of Extremadura (Plasencia, Spain). The ethical standards in human experimentation contained in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, and those of the relevant national bodies and institutions were observed at all times. All participants provided written informed consent before being enrolled.

Design and sample

A cross-sectional, descriptive observational study was carried out following the "Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology" statement and checklist. Before beginning treatment, 100 patients were recruited and examined face-to-face in the first consultation from a clinic of podiatric medicine and surgery that provides treatment for diseases/disorders of the foot at the University of Extremadura between September 2016 and January 2017. A non-randomized and consecutive sampling method was used to select these 100 participants who were enrolled in the study according to sample-size calculation.

Inclusion criteria were males or females aged 18–65 years, with PF or heel pain in the acute phase, after being diagnosed by a podiatrist, and who had not undergone treatment previously. For the diagnosis of painful heel syndrome by clinical examination, the following positive clinical signs were necessary: i) pain in the morning or after sitting down for a long time, ii) local pain where the fascia attaches to the heel, iii) increasing pain with extended walking or standing for > 15 min. Moreover, written informed consent was mandatory.

Exclusion criteria were: age < 18 years or > 65 years; plantar heel spurs (diagnosed by ultrasonography or prior radiographic evidence); previous foot trauma; dysfunction of the foot or ankle (e.g. instability); arthrosis or arthritis of the foot; surgery or previous treatment of the foot; neurologic abnormality (e.g. tarsal tunnel syndrome); non- or semi-autonomous in daily activities; inability to understand instructions.

### Platelet-rich plasma has better long-term results than corticosteroids or placebo for chronic plantar fasciitis: randomized control trial [^116amdAJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a supersaturated concentration of autologous platelets that augments the natural healing response of fascia. Previous studies have shown the superiority of PRP over corticosteroids (CS) for chronic plantar fasciitis. The aim of this study was to compare the pain and functional outcomes of PRP with CS and placebo injections for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. We conducted a 3-arm randomized controlled trial of 90 patients: PRP (n = 30 patients), CS (n = 30 patients), and placebo (n = 30 patients). The patients were followed at regular intervals until 18 months postinjection using validated instruments. The mean visual analog scale score showed significant improvement in all groups between baseline and 18-month follow-up (PRP: 8.2 vs 2.1; CS: 8.8 vs 3.6; placebo: 8.1 vs 5.4), with CS showing significantly better improvement than PRP in the short term, whereas longer-term PRP was significantly better than CS. The mean Roles and Maudley score showed significant improvement in all groups between baseline and 18-month follow-up (PRP: 1.7 vs 3.7; CS: 1.2 vs 3.1; placebo: 1.2 vs 2.0), with CS showing significantly better improvement than PRP in the short term, whereas longer-term PRP was significantly better than CS. The mean Short Form 12 score showed significant improvement in all groups between baseline and 18-month follow-up (PRP: 55.4 vs 80.2; CS: 56.2 vs 76.2; placebo: 54.1 vs 62.4). We found that all 3 groups showed significant improvement between baseline and end of the follow-up period with regard to pain, function, and general health. The CS arm showed better improvement in the short term, whereas the PRP arm showed better results in the long term. In contrast to previous studies, we found no significant drop-off effect of CS in the long term, which may be owing to background natural healing process of the disease. In summary, both PRP and CS are safe and effective treatment options for chronic plantar fasciitis, showing superior results to placebo treatment. The longer-term results and less reinjection and/or surgery rate of PRP makes it more attractive as an injection treatment option versus CS injection.

### Is extracorporeal shock wave therapy clinical efficacy for relief of chronic, recalcitrant plantar fasciitis? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo or active-treatment controlled trials [^111eVb8B]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and provide clinicians with an evidence base for their clinical decision making.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews.

Study Selection

All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ESWT for chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis were searched. Searching identified 108 potentially relevant articles; of these, 7 studies with 550 participants met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Number of patients, population, body mass index, duration of symptoms, adverse effects, blinding method, and details of shockwave therapy were extracted.

Data Synthesis

For intervention success rate, ESWT of low intensity was more effective than control treatment of low intensity. For pain relief, the pooled data showed a significant difference between the ESWT and control groups. For function, only low-intensity ESWT was significantly superior over the control treatment.

Conclusions

The efficacy of low-intensity ESWT is worthy of recognition. The short-term pain relief and functional outcomes of this treatment are satisfactory. However, owing to the lack of a long-term follow-up, its long-term efficacy remains unknown.

### Injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults [^1162gKrT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar heel pain, commonly resulting from plantar fasciitis, often results in significant morbidity. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), orthoses, physical therapy, physical agents (e.g. extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), laser) and invasive procedures including steroid injections.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Latest search: 27 March 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of plantar heel pain in adults were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, when a random-effects model was considered. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included a total of 39 studies (36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 quasi-RCTs) that involved a total of 2492 adults. Most studies were small (median = 59 participants). Participants' mean ages ranged from 34 years to 59 years. When reported, most participants had heel pain for several months. The trials were usually conducted in outpatient specialty clinics of tertiary care hospitals in 17 countries. Steroid injection was given with a local anaesthetic agent in 34 trials. Follow-up was from one month to over two years. With one exception, trials were assessed at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding, including lack of confirmation of allocation concealment. With two exceptions, we rated the available evidence as very low quality, implying in each case that we are 'very uncertain about the estimate'. The 39 trials covered 18 comparisons, with six of the seven trials with three or four groups providing evidence towards two comparisons. Eight trials (724 participants) compared steroid injection versus placebo or no treatment. Steroid injection may lead to lower heel pain visual analogue scores (VAS) (0 to 100; higher scores = worse pain) in the short-term (< 1 month) (MD -6.38, 95% CI -11.13 to -1.64; 350 participants; 5 studies; I² = 65%; low quality evidence). Based on a minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) of 8 for average heel pain, the 95% CI includes a marginal clinical benefit. This potential benefit was diminished when data were restricted to three placebo-controlled trials. Steroid injection made no difference to average heel pain in the medium-term (1 to 6 months follow-up) (MD -3.47, 95% CI -8.43 to 1.48; 382 participants; 6 studies; I² = 40%; low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence for no effect on function in the medium-term and for an absence of serious adverse events (219 participants, 4 studies). No studies reported on other adverse events, such as post-injection pain, and on return to previous activity. There was very low quality evidence for fewer treatment failures (defined variously as persistent heel pain at 8 weeks, steroid injection at 12 weeks, and unrelieved pain at 6 months) after steroid injection. The available evidence for other comparisons was rated as very low quality. We are therefore very uncertain of the estimates for the relative effects on people with heel pain of steroids compared with other interventions in:1. Tibial nerve block with anaesthetic (2 trials); orthoses (4 trials); oral NSAIDs (2 trials); and intensive physiotherapy (1 trial).2. Physical modalities: ESWT (5 trials); laser (2 trials); and radiation therapy (1 trial).3. Other invasive procedures: locally injectable NSAID (1 trial); platelet-rich plasma injections (5 trials); autologous blood injections (2 trials); botulinum toxin injections (2 trials); cryopreserved human amniotic membrane injection (1 trial); localised peppering with a needle (1 trial); dry needling (1 trial); and mini scalpel needle release (1 trial). We are also uncertain about the estimates from trials testing different techniques of local steroid injection: ultrasonography-guided versus palpation-guided (5 trials); and scintigraphy-guided versus palpation-guided (1 trial). An exploratory analysis involving pooling data from 21 trials reporting on adverse events revealed two ruptures of plantar fascia (reported in 1 trial) and three injection site infections (reported in 2 trials) in 699 participants allocated to steroid injection study arms. Five trials reported a total of 27 participants with less serious short-term adverse events in the 699 participants allocated steroid injection study arms. Reported treatments were analgesia, ice or both. Given the high risk of selective reporting for these outcomes and imprecision, this evidence was rated at very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low quality evidence that local steroid injections compared with placebo or no treatment may slightly reduce heel pain up to one month but not subsequently. The available evidence for other outcomes of this comparison was very low quality. Where available, the evidence from comparisons of steroid injections with other interventions used to treat heel pain and of different methods of guiding the injection was also very low quality. Although serious adverse events relating to steroid injection were rare, these were under-reported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out. Further research should focus on establishing the effects (benefits and harms) of injected steroids compared with placebo in typical clinical settings, subsequent to a course of unsuccessful conservative therapy. Ideally, this should be preceded by research, including patient involvement, aimed to obtain consensus on the priority questions for treating plantar heel pain.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2023 [^113DEfdB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for plantar fasciitis, more specifically with respect to stretching, APTA 2023 guidelines recommend to offer plantar fascia-specific and gastrocnemius/soleus stretching to provide short- and long-term pain relief and to improve short- and long-term function and disability.

### Endoscopic debridement for treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: an Innovative technique and prospective study of 46 consecutive Patients [^116dAuFH]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one the most common pathologies treated by foot and ankle surgeons. When nonoperative therapy fails, surgical intervention might be warranted. Various surgical procedures are available for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. The most common surgical management typically consists of open versus endoscopic plantar fascia release. Comorbidities associated with the release of the plantar fascia have been documented, including lateral column overload and metatarsalgia. We present an innovative technique for this painful condition that is minimally invasive, allows visualization of the plantar fascia, and maintains the integrity of the fascia. Our hypothesis was that the use of endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia with or without heel spur resection would provide a minimally invasive technique with acceptable patient outcomes.

### The heel complex: anatomy, imaging, pathologic conditions, and treatment [^112PVkqZ]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for heel pain is broad but primarily involves abnormalities of the Achilles tendon, calcaneus, and plantar fascia. Achilles tendon disorders include tendinosis, tendinitis, and partial or complete tears. Tendinosis refers to tendon degeneration, while tendinitis is inflammation after acute overload. Untreated tendinosis can progress to partial or complete tears. Tendon disorders can be accompanied by paratenonitis or inflammation of the loose sheath enclosing the tendon. Initial management involves rehabilitation and image-guided procedures. Operative management is reserved for tendon tears and includes direct repair, tendon transfer, and graft reconstruction. The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone. The majority of fractures are intra-articular; extra-articular fractures, stress or insufficiency fractures, medial process avulsion, and neuropathic avulsion can also occur. Posterosuperior calcaneal exostosis or Haglund deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and insertional Achilles tendinosis form the characteristic triad of Haglund syndrome. It is initially managed with orthotics and physiotherapy. Operative management aims to correct osseous or soft-tissue derangements. The plantar fascia is a strong fibrous tissue that invests the sole of the foot and contributes to midfoot stability. Inflammation or plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and can be related to overuse or mechanical causes. Acute rupture is less common but can occur in preexisting plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatment includes footwear modification, calf stretches, and percutaneous procedures. The main operative treatment is plantar fasciotomy. Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic proliferation within the fascia that can be locally aggressive and is prone to recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jQCig]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that PRP injections provide superior pain control compared to CSs at 3 to 6 mos, although this advantage is not observed in the short term or at 1 yr. PRP also resulted in better AOFAS scores at mid- to long-term follow-up, indicating improved foot and ankle function. While both PRP and CSs were associated with a reduction in plantar fascia thickness, no significant difference was observed between the two treatments. These findings highlight the need for further high-quality RCTs with standardized protocols and extended follow-up periods to fully elucidate the role of PRP, not only in pain control but also in functional recovery and structural improvement in patients with plantar fasciitis.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2014 [^113s4t7j]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for plantar fasciitis, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, APTA 2014 guidelines recommend to use the FAAM, FHSQ, or the FFI and consider using the computer-adaptive version of the LEFS before and after interventions intended to alleviate the physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with heel pain/plantar fasciitis.

### Proximal plantar fibroma as an etiology of recalcitrant plantar heel pain [^114yQthM]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Prompted by repeated pathology reports of fibromas at the origin of the plantar fascia after fasciectomy for chronic plantar heel pain, this study examined the incidence of proximal plantar fibroma. A retrospective study of 100 pathology specimens from 97 patients with the preoperative diagnosis of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis was performed. Patients ranged in age from 36 to 82, and included 31 males and 66 females. The specimens consisted of medial and central bands of the fascia obtained from transverse plantar fasciectomies. The fasciectomies were performed by 4 surgeons between July 1994 and March 2008. One quarter of the cases studied had a histological appearance of plantar fibroma. This new finding has not been reported in any literature in connection with recalcitrant heel pain. Histologic findings of the specimens were placed into 3 groups: neoplastic involvement (25%, 21 female and 6 male), inflammation without neoplastic involvement (21%, 13 female and 6 male), and other, which consisted of having no inflammatory or neoplastic response (54%, 32 female and 19 male). All of the patients ailed a 3- to 6-month conservative treatment regimen, which included anti-inflammatory medication, modification of activities, injection of corticosteroids, night splints, custom molded orthotics, and physical therapy. Only 3 patients underwent bilateral plantar fasciectomies. No patient required a revisional procedure. The authors conclude that 25% of recalcitrant heel pain is neoplastic in origin, and that patients presenting with these lesions require excision and not fasciotomy.

### Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy improves early postoperative results: a retrospective comparison of outcomes after endoscopic versus open plantar fasciotomy [^114cJgKc]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciotomy is offered to patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. Few studies have characterized the functional outcomes over time for the endoscopic approach compared with the open approach. We hypothesized that patients undergoing endoscopic surgery will have better postoperative functional outcomes early in the postoperative period but equivalent long-term outcomes compared with patients undergoing open surgery. We analyzed the prospectively collected data of all patients undergoing plantar fasciotomy at our institution from December 2007 to August 2014. A total of 42 feet of 38 patients were included in the analysis. The clinical data were collected preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months and 1 year. The functional outcomes analyzed included the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale, the Medical Outcomes Study, Short-Form, 36-item Health Survey, and patient satisfaction and expectations. Patients undergoing endoscopic surgery had significantly greater American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot and SF-36 Health Survey scores and lower pain scores at the 3-month period. They were also significantly more likely to be satisfied with and have had their expectations met by surgery. Compared with the open approach, the patients who had undergone endoscopic plantar fasciotomy experienced significantly greater improvements in the subjective and objective functional outcomes, with less pain and greater satisfaction, and had had their expectations met earlier in the recovery period, with equivalent long-term outcomes, compared with the patients who had undergone open plantar fasciotomy.

### Indication, surgical technique and results of endoscopic fascial release in plantar fasciitis (E FRPF) [^115EPuUH]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study is to present the surgical technique for, and review our indications and results after, endoscopic fascial release in patients with plantar fasciitis. In five thiel-embalmed human specimens, a biportal technique for endoscopic release of the plantar fascia was established. The aim was here to evaluate the relation between the plantar fascia and the heel spur and to perform a release that would not exceed 50–70% of the diameter of the calcaneoplantar fascia. The endoscopic technique was performed within the last 5 years in ten male and seven female patients. All patients with the clinical entity of plantar fasciitis underwent conservative treatment for at least 6 months. The average age at surgery was 35 years (24–56 years). In the first five patients, surgery was performed under c-arm control. In all patients the operation could be finished endoscopically. The endoscopic portals healed without complications. The time for surgery during the learning curve ranged between 21 and 74 min (average 41 min) and was still longer compared to the open technique. The clinical follow-up ranged between 4 and 48 months (average 18.5 months). Out of 17 patients, 13 improved clinically, and they would choose the treatment option again. In the Ogilvie-Harris score, seven patients showed good and six excellent results. In two patients, the initial results were not satisfactory, because of a bony stress reaction of the calcaneus. This complication was treated by 6 weeks of partial weight bearing, without any further problems. Two other patients developed secondary pain in the lateral column. In spite of the minimal invasive approach it seems to be important to be careful in increasing the weight bearing in early rehabilitation. The technique of the endoscopic plantar fascia release (E FRPF) can be performed in a standardised and reproducible procedure. The follow-up examination showed good midterm results, but a loss of stability of the plantar arch has to be strictly avoided.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^115tmpmg]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot amputation — surgical goals and emergent versus elective approach are specified: Healing with primary intention is prioritized, and in most instances it is advisable to perform an amputation at the most distal level that would allow for primary healing. Creation of a distal stump that will not cause muscle or other dynamic imbalances is emphasized. Although it is usually preferable to perform the amputation in an elective, controlled environment, when infection, necrotizing fasciitis, or gas gangrene are present, an open amputation may need to be done on an emergent basis. When performed under elective and stable conditions, the amputation should be fashioned so that it is curative, meaning the primary incision site can be closed primarily and that no further surgery is anticipated. When performed under emergent conditions, the procedure should usually be done proximal to the level of all necrotic tissue, with additional procedures anticipated to attain a closed wound and a stump that can accommodate shoes, custom inserts, or a prosthesis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of plantar fasciitis [^111QDiRD]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis, a self-limiting condition, is a common cause of heel pain in adults. It affects more than 1 million persons per year, and two-thirds of patients with plantar fasciitis will seek care from their family physician. Plantar fasciitis affects sedentary and athletic populations. Obesity, excessive foot pronation, excessive running, and prolonged standing are risk factors for developing plantar fasciitis. Diagnosis is primarily based on history and physical examination. Patients may present with heel pain with their first steps in the morning or after prolonged sitting, and sharp pain with palpation of the medial plantar calcaneal region. Discomfort in the proximal plantar fascia can be elicited by passive ankle/first toe dorsiflexion. Diagnostic imaging is rarely needed for the initial diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Use of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging is reserved for recalcitrant cases or to rule out other heel pathology; findings of increased plantar fascia thickness and abnormal tissue signal the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatments help with the disabling pain. Initially, patient-directed treatments consisting of rest, activity modification, ice massage, oral analgesics, and stretching techniques can be tried for several weeks. If heel pain persists, then physician-prescribed treatments such as physical therapy modalities, foot orthotics, night splinting, and corticosteroid injections should be considered. Ninety percent of patients will improve with these conservative techniques. Patients with chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis lasting six months or longer can consider extracorporeal shock wave therapy or plantar fasciotomy.

### Surgical treatment of bone marrow lesion associated with recurrent plantar fasciitis: a case report describing an innovative technique using subchondroplasty [^116cV7sn]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common chief complaints seen in the foot and ankle clinic. With a relatively benign course, most cases are self-limiting or amendable to conservative therapy; ~90% of all plantar fasciitis cases will respond to these methods. When conservative treatment and time fail, surgical intervention can be necessary to improve outcomes. We present a novel method using Subchondroplasty ® (SCP ®; Zimmer Holdings, Inc.; Warsaw, IN) and revision fasciotomy in a case in which initial fasciotomy had failed. After the patient had failed to improve, a worsening underlying bone marrow lesion was identified at the origin of the plantar fascia; thus, SCP ® was used with repeat fasciotomy. SCP ® involves injecting calcium phosphate into bone marrow lesions to stimulate long-term bone repair. At 10 months after SCP ®, the patient remained pain free and had returned to running at the final follow-up examination. This surgical treatment should be considered as an adjunctive procedure for those patients with plantar fasciitis, identifiable bone marrow lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, and continued pain when other treatment modalities have failed.

### Retrospective evaluation of ultrasound guided percutaneous plantar fasciotomy with and without platelet rich plasma [^113VNvsx]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common foot conditions presenting to a foot and ankle specialist. Surgical treatment outcomes following plantar fasciotomy vary but short-term studies have reported excellent early pain relief and significant improvements in symptoms. This study evaluates patient reported pain scores collected pre- and post-op for patients who underwent percutaneous ultrasonic microtenotomy (PUT) plantar fasciotomy with PRP injection vs without the use of PRP. We compared pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores, for patients treated surgically by Orthopedic Surgery department of foot and ankle faculty members between December 2007 and December 2022. A total of 30 patients were identified that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our results showed that there was a significant decrease in pain VAS scores from pre-op visit (at least 1 month prior to operation) to post-op visit (at least 1 month following operation) for both groups, with a paired t test (p value < .0001). However, patients who received PRP had a statistically significant decrease in pain level compared to the group who did not receive PRP. Statistical analysis completed with a 2-sample t test (p-value < .0325). Our results found the mean time between the initial pre-op visit and last post-op follow-up visit was 19 months. The mean for time following surgical intervention was 10 months. The findings of our study suggest that the dual use of PUT and PRP to treat plantar fasciitis, could potentially lead to an improvement in pain reduction and longevity of pain relief.

### Endoscopic fasciotomy for plantar fasciitis provides superior results when compared to a controlled non-operative treatment protocol: a randomized controlled trial [^1162E2d3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Plantar fasciitis is a frequent and painful condition with a lifetime incidence of 10%. Good results have been reported for operative treatment of plantar fasciitis refractory to non-surgical interventions in uncontrolled studies. The aim of this study was to compare the results of operative treatment (endoscopic debridement, removal of the heel spur and partial resection of the plantar fascia) with those of a controlled and supervised non-operative rehabilitation program.

Methods

Thirty consecutive patients with plantar fasciitis during more than 3 months were randomized to either (1) non-operative treatment with corticosteroid injections and a controlled strength training program or (2) an endoscopic 2-incision operation with partial fasciotomy and heel spur removal followed by the same strength training program. Patients were evaluated at entry and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively with the foot function index (FFI) and pain score during activity on a 100 mm VAS scale (VAS activity). FFI at 6 and 12 months was defined a priori as primary endpoint.

Results

Both groups improved significantly over time. The FFI score was significantly better in the operated group compared to the non-surgically treated group 12 months post-operatively (p = 0.033), at 24 months this was, however, not significant (p = 0.06). VAS activity at 24 months was significantly (p = 0.001) in favor of the operative group. More patients returned to running and jumping in the operative group (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial found significant and clinically relevant superior results for the operative treatment of plantar fasciitis as measured by Foot Function Index at 1 year and by VAS activity at 2-year follow-up when compared to the results of a supervised rehabilitation program.

### Treatment of plantar fasciitis… [^112xP19i]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

In one study, 3 83 percent of patients involved in stretching programs were successfully treated, and 29 percent of patients in the study cited stretching as the treatment that had helped the most compared with use of orthotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice, steroid injection, heat, heel cups, night splints, walking, plantar strapping and shoe changes.
3. 5 The three most commonly used mechanical corrections are arch taping, over-the-counter arch supports and custom orthotics. Arch taping and orthotics were found to be significantly better than use of NSAIDs, cortisone injection or heel cups in one randomized treatment study. 8 Arch taping was cited by 2 percent of patients as the treatment that worked best for plantar fasciitis in another study. 3 A single taping treatment is much less expensive than an over-the-counter arch support or an orthotic.

Taping provides only transient support, with studies 9, 10 showing that as little as 24 minutes of activity can decrease the effectiveness of taping significantly. Arch taping can be used as definitive treatment or as a trial to determine if the expense of arch supports or orthotics is worth the benefit. Taping may be more cost effective for acute onset of plantar fasciitis, and over-the-counter arch supports and orthotics may be more cost-effective for chronic or recurrent cases of plantar fasciitis and for prevention of injuries. 22, 23 Rupture of the plantar fascia was found in almost 10 percent of patients after plantar fascia injection in one series. 22 Long-term sequelae of plantar fascia rupture were found in approximately one half of the patients with plantar fascia rupture, with longitudinal arch strain accounting for more than one half of the chronic complications.

22, 23 On the other hand, one author 24 found that most individuals with rupture of the plantar fascia had resolution of symptoms with rest and rehabilitation. SURGERY In cases that do not respond to any conservative treatment, surgical release of the plantar fascia may be considered. Plantar fasciotomy may be performed using open, endoscopic or radiofrequency lesioning techniques. Overall, the success rate of surgical release is 70 to 90 percent in patients with plantar fasciitis. 24–27 Potential risk factors include flattening of the longitudinal arch and heel hypoesthesia as well as the potential complications associated with rupture of the plantar fascia and complications related to anesthesia.

### The effect of plantar calcaneal spur excision on plantar fascia surgery outcomes [^116zuZ9A]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain is a prevalent condition affecting 10% of the population, with plantar fasciitis being the most common cause. Plantar calcaneal spurs are frequently associated with plantar fasciitis, yet their role in the condition and surgical outcomes remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of plantar calcaneal spur excision on the outcomes of plantar fascia surgery, utilizing a radiofrequency microtenotomy and bone marrow aspiration technique. A retrospective review of 136 plantar fascia surgeries was conducted with 83 cases including plantar calcaneal spur excision. Demographic and operative factors were analyzed. Outcomes included time to weight-bearing in a boot and shoes, symptom resolution, and complications. Plantar calcaneal spur excision was associated with a statistically significant delay in symptom resolution (p = 0.006) and time to weight-bearing in shoes (p = 0.020). A statistically significant difference was observed regarding operative laterality, with right-sided surgeries demonstrating an increased time to symptom resolution (p = 0.007) and a higher retreatment rate (p = 0.017) compared to left-sided surgeries. There was no significant difference in complication rates or the need for retreatment between excision and non-excision groups. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of plantar calcaneal spur excision in surgical planning for plantar fasciitis, with implications for patient education and management strategies.

BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Plantar fasciitis is a common condition causing under-surface heel pain. This most typically affects people age 40–60, is more common in women than men and can affect both sedentary and active populations. Histological findings are typically that of myxoid degeneration, rather than inflammatory processes, and plantar fasciitis is akin to an 'over-use' or 'under-recovery' type of condition, rather than a single acute injury. Due to the lack of an inflammatory-driven process, this condition is sometimes referred to as 'plantar fasciosis' or 'plantar fasciopathy' in some published works, but for the purposes of this study the name 'plantar fasciitis' will continue to be used as this remains its the most common form; however, the limitations of this term are recognised.

The plantar fascia itself is a tough band of connective tissue in the sole of the foot. It originates at the medial process of the tuberosity of the calcaneus and inserts in slips to the proximal phalanxes. It has a role in supporting the longitudinal arch of the foot, but also has roles in proprioception and peripheral motor coordination and contains Pacini and Ruffini corpuscles and nerve endings. Originating as it does from the under-surface of the calcaneus, the plantar fascia is sometimes viewed as the functional end point of the Achilles tendon, which is attached to the posterior margin of the calcaneus, and there are superficial fibres directly connecting the two structures which persist into adult life. Increasing tension in the Achilles tendon increases strain within the plantar fascia which may be a contributing factor to the development of plantar fasciitis although the evidence remains unclear. Tight posterior chain muscles (hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus) are often found in patients with plantar fasciitis, with a reduction in ankle dorsiflexion being one of the most significant risk factors for the development of plantar fasciitis. Addressing any particular tightness in the calf muscle is therefore a key consideration in the management of patients with plantar fasciitis, with improvements in tightness correlating well to improvements in pain in these patients.

### Proximal plantar fibroma as an etiology of recalcitrant plantar heel pain [^115YazAz]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Prompted by repeated pathology reports of fibromas at the origin of the plantar fascia after fasciectomy for chronic plantar heel pain, this study examines the incidence of proximal plantar fibroma. A retrospective study of 101 pathology specimens from 97 patients with the preoperative diagnosis of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis was performed. Patients ranged in age from 36 to 82, and included 30 males and 67 females. The specimens consisted of medial and central bands of the fascia obtained from transverse plantar fasciectomies. The fasciectomies were performed between July 1994 and March 2008. One quarter of the cases studied had a histological appearance of plantar fibroma. This new finding has not been reported in any literature in connection with recalcitrant heel pain. Histologic findings of the specimens were placed into 3 groups: neoplastic involvement (25%, 21 female and 6 male), inflammation without neoplastic involvement (21%, 13 female and 6 male), and other, which consisted of having no inflammatory or neoplastic response (54%, 32 female and 19 male). All of the patients failed a 3- to 6-month conservative treatment regimen, which included anti-inflammatory medication, modification of activities, injection of corticosteroids, night splints, custom molded orthotics, and physical therapy. Only 4 patients underwent bilateral plantar fasciectomies. No patient required a revisional procedure. The authors conclude that 25% of recalcitrant heel pain is neoplastic in origin, and that patients presenting with these lesions require excision and not fasciotomy.

### Treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis with percutaneous latticed plantar fasciotomy [^114Qot4t]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis, the most common cause of pain in the inferior heel, accounts for 11% to 15% of all foot symptoms requiring professional care among adults. The present study reports the results of a minimally invasive surgical treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. All patients with plantar fasciitis who had undergone percutaneous latticed plantar fasciotomy at 3 clinical sites from March 2008 to March 2009 were included in the present study. The follow-up evaluations for this treatment were conducted using the Mayo clinical scoring system. We investigated 17 patients with recalcitrant chronic plantar fasciitis who had undergone this treatment within a follow-up period of ≥ 13 months. All procedures were performed in the clinic with the patient under local anesthesia. No wound infections or blood vessel or nerve damage occurred. At a mean follow-up period of 16.0 ± 2.29 (range 13 to 21) months, significant improvement was seen in the preoperative mean Mayo score (from 12.06 ± 2.54 to 89.76 ± 4.28, p < .001) and no patient had developed symptom recurrence. Also, none of the patients had developed complex regional pain syndrome. All patients were able to return to regular shoe wear by 3 weeks postoperatively. The technique of plantar fasciitis with percutaneous latticed plantar fasciotomy could be a promising treatment option for patients with recalcitrant chronic plantar fasciitis.

### Endoscopic surgery for plantar fasciitis: application of a deep-fascial approach [^1119NkB9]. Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical results of deep-fascial medial and lateral portals in performing endoscopic surgery for plantar fasciitis.

Methods

In 10 feet in 8 patients who were treated conservatively for more than 6 months with failure to relieve their symptoms, endoscopic surgery was performed. After the patient was placed in the supine position, a medial portal was made 5 mm deep to the plantar fascia and 10 mm anterior to its origin on the calcaneus under fluoroscopy. The lateral portal was established by placing a blunt trocar deep and perpendicular to the plantar fascia. A 2.7-mm-diameter arthroscope was passed through the deep-lateral portal, and the operative devices were inserted through the deep-medial portal. A motorized shaver was used for making a working space to excise the fat tissue along with a portion of the flexor digitorum brevis muscle. If a heel spur existed, it was resected to establish a clear view of the plantar fascia by use of an arthroscopic burr. After exposure of the plantar fascia, its medial half was removed with electric devices such as an Arthro-Knife (ConMed Linvatec, Largo, FL).

Results

The mean score on the American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Society Ankle Hindfoot Scale was 64.2 ± 6.3 points before surgery and 92.6 ± 7.1 points at 2 years after surgery (P < .0001). The mean duration to full weight bearing after surgery was 13.9 ± 8.4 days. All patients returned to full athletic activities by a mean of 10.7 ± 2.6 weeks.

Conclusions

Endoscopic surgery for plantar fasciitis through a deep-fascial approach allows a wide field of vision and working space, permitting reliable resection of the plantar fascia and heel spur.

### Plantar fasciitis: evidence-based review of diagnosis and therapy [^115dWR7G]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis causes heel pain in active as well as sedentary adults of all ages. The condition is more likely to occur in persons who are obese or in those who are on their feet most of the day. A diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is based on the patient's history and physical findings. The accuracy of radiologic studies in diagnosing plantar heel pain is unknown. Most interventions used to manage plantar fasciitis have not been studied adequately; however, shoe inserts, stretching exercises, steroid injection, and custom-made night splints may be beneficial. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy may effectively treat runners with chronic heel pain but is ineffective in other patients. Limited evidence suggests that casting or surgery may be beneficial when conservative measures fail.

### A review of 105 consecutive uniport endoscopic plantar fascial release procedures for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis [^115eD54x]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain in the U.S. Army soldier, resulting in a significant loss of man hours. Given the heavy operations tempo of the U.S. military, successful treatment options need to be considered and used as quickly as possible. Plantar fasciitis can be successfully treated in up to 90% of patients using conservative measures. Operative intervention might need to be considered for those in whom conservative measures have failed. The present report is a review of 105 consecutive uniport endoscopic plantar fascial release procedures performed by the principal investigator during a 9-year period. The following data were collected and analyzed: gender, age, weight, height, body mass index, medical treatment facility, procedure laterality, preoperative pain levels, postoperative pain levels at 3 months, first ambulatory day in the controlled ankle motion boot, return to activity as tolerated, and complications. Three major points were of interest: evidence of improvement in chronic plantar fasciitis when treated with uniport endoscopic procedures; the patient attributes associated with self-reported pain levels 90 days postoperatively; and the patient attributes associated with the average time until patients were able to return to activities as tolerated in a controlled ankle motion boot. It was noted that 44.5% of those with a body mass index of 29.80 kg/m(2) or greater reported a postoperative pain level of 0; and 96.3% of those with a body mass index of 25.53 kg/m(2) or less reported postoperative pain levels of 0. The analyzed data were used to characterize the clinical outcomes of the procedure, identify changes in outcome with surgeon experience, and identify whether certain patient subgroups have better outcomes, allowing surgeons to identify which patient might be the best candidates for an endoscopic release procedure.

### Midterm outcomes of endoscopic plantar fascia debridement in 125 patients: a 5-year follow-up [^116xerXJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common pathologies addressed by foot and ankle surgeons. Despite advances and overall success rates for conservative therapy, many of the recalcitrant cases proceed to require surgical correction. Partial to complete release of the fascia is often performed altering foot biomechanics and severing the windlass mechanism. Endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia allows for direct visualization and removal of the inflammatory tissue while leaving the fascia and its function intact. A total of 125 feet were evaluated with a minimum follow-up time of 5 years. Gender, body mass index, and duration of symptoms were all evaluated and documented. Visual analog scale scores (VAS), American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), and Foot Function Index (FFI) were collected both pre- and postoperatively. AOFAS, FFI, and VAS scores improved from a pre-operative mean of 57.6, 89.4%, and 8.6–89.1, 13.4%, and 0.7 respectively (p < .05) at final follow-up. Of the 125 patients, 98% stated they were satisfied with the operative outcome and would undergo the procedure again. At final follow-up, no patient suffered rupture of the fascia or recurrence. Patients were able to bear weight immediately following the surgery in a walking boot and on average patients were able to return to work at 3.4 days following surgery. This is a novel technique that does not compromise the plantar fascia or alter foot biomechanics with promising 5-year outcomes.

Plantar Fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis (PF) presents with stiffness and pain near the medial tuberosity of the calcaneus that is typically worse when initiating walking. In the majority of cases, symptoms resolve with conservative management. For recalcitrant PF, local interventions such as extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) or injections have been utilized. CSI is commonly administered to manage severe pain associated with PF. However, several trials and meta-analyses have found them to offer similar analgesia to dry needling and inferior analgesia to alternatives such as ESWT and PRP.CSI has also been associated with an increased risk of plantar fascia rupture. Meta-analyses have demonstrated low-quality evidence supporting the superiority of dextrose prolotherapy to placebo, although there was moderate-quality evidence of its inferiority to other modalities such as CSI for PF. Similarly, a series of five HA injections alleviated PF pain more than placebo at 5 weeks in another RCT, although additional studies are warranted to confirm this effect.

Most RCTs generally support that PRP injections were superior to placebo and CSI for pain relief and functional outcomes over 6 to 24 months. Some RCTs with shorter follow-up and lack of sham controls reported comparable outcomes to CSI in the early study phase, which may be confounded by anesthetic or placebo effect. Despite the heterogeneity and inconsistent blinding in these studies, multiple meta-analyses have reiterated that PRP is superior to CSI by 6 months for PF.

Two RCTs reported significant improvements in pain and function with injection of human amniotic/chorionic membrane (HACM) versus sham injections for PF up to 3 months, while a pilot RCT demonstrated comparable outcomes to CSI over 12 weeks. A meta-analysis comparing different injections for PF found HACM likely to be superior to placebo, although this warrants further study.

Consensus Point 9. There is low-quality evidence supporting superiority of dextrose prolotherapy compared to placebo for plantar fasciitis, although moderate-quality evidence suggests that it is inferior to corticosteroid injections. Therefore, prolotherapy is not the first recommended injection option for plantar fasciitis (Level I, Grade C).

Consensus Point 10. There is consistent evidence supporting that PRP injections for plantar fasciitis are associated with superior analgesia and physical function compared to placebo and corticosteroid injections over the long-term (6 to 24 months), although outcomes may be comparable in the short-term (Level I, Grade B).

### Cryosurgery: an innovative technique for the treatment of plantar fasciitis [^116cgpbi]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A prospective study testing the efficacy of cryosurgery on painful plantar fasciitis of the heel was performed. Cryosurgery, a minimally invasive, percutaneous, office-based technique, was used to treat 59 consecutive patients (61 heels), who had failed prior conservative therapy and were considered surgical candidates. Patients were evaluated on an 11-point visual analog scale administered preoperatively and up to 1 year of follow-up. The mean pain rating (8.38) before cryosurgery (day 0) is statistically significant to the mean pain rating (1.26) at day 365 postoperatively. Pain decreased significantly after the procedure (analysis of variance, P < .0001). These results suggest cryosurgery is significantly effective in treating patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. Cryosurgery offers a highly effective treatment modality after failed conservative treatment without resorting to open invasive outpatient surgery.

### Evaluating the quality of internet-derived information on plantar fasciitis [^112VC4gr]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Patients seeking medical advice increasingly turn to the World Wide Web. To test the hypothesis that Internet-provided medical information often is inaccurate and biased, we selected a common musculoskeletal condition. Three common Internet search engines were used to search "plantar fasciitis" and "plantar fascitis". Combining the first 50 web addresses from each search engine for both phrases and eliminating duplicate sites resulted in a database of 152 websites. Each website then was analyzed for authorship, sponsoring agency, and presence of financial incentive. The informational value score of each site then was graded using a 10-point scale evaluating the following parameters: basic definition of plantar fasciitis, causes and risk factors, clinical symptoms, diagnostic tests, differential diagnosis, conservative and surgical treatment options, and complications. The overall mean information value score for all 152 sites was 3.8 points; 36% of the sites showed financial bias. The highest mean scores among all authorship and sponsorship categories belonged to orthopaedic surgeons and academic institutions with mean scores of 7.1 and 6.1 points, respectively. Sites without obvious financial bias had significantly higher information value scores than sites with financial interests. Healthcare professionals should consider these findings when advising patients.

### Plantar heel pain and plantar fasciitis [^116EfPmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain, also known as plantar fasciitis, causes soreness or tenderness of the sole of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. Pain associated with the condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life. The prevalence and prognosis are unclear, but the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of conservative treatments for plantar heel pain? What are the effects of non-conservative treatments for plantar heel pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 162 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 84 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 39 studies and the further review of 45 full articles. Of the 45 full articles evaluated, five systematic reviews and nine RCTs were included at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 30 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for 12 interventions based on information relating to the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid injection alone (both short-term and longer-term effects), corticosteroid injections plus local anaesthetic injection (both short-term and longer-term effects), customised foot orthoses, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel pads and cups, local anaesthetic injection alone, night splints, stretching exercises, surgery, and taping.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^112Z2VjR]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Heel pain surgical management — third tier care continues tier 1 and/or 2 programs with consideration of surgical management, and options may include plantar fasciotomy using recognized techniques or extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) as an alternative. Current practice favors a minimally invasive approach to plantar fasciotomy versus extensive open surgical exposures, and in most cases removal of the plantar heel spur does not seem to add to the success of the outcome. In some cases multiple etiologic factors including nerve entrapment may necessitate combining nerve release and plantar fasciotomy, and radiofrequency coblation of the plantar fascia as well as radiofrequency nerve ablation and cryoprobe have been advocated more recently as an alternative surgical approach to chronic heel pain.

### Endoscopic debridement for treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: an innovative surgical technique [^117SFE7Z]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one the most common pathologies seen by foot and ankle surgeons. When nonoperative therapy fails, surgical intervention is warranted. Various surgical procedures are available for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. The most common surgical management typically consists of open versus endoscopic plantar fascia release. The documented comorbidities associated with the release of the plantar fascia include lateral column overload and metatarsalgia. We present a new technique for this painful condition that is minimally invasive, allows visualization of the plantar fascia, and maintains the integrity of this fascia. Our hypothesis was that the use of endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia would provide a minimally invasive technique with acceptable patient outcomes.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2023 [^115dAztK]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Heel pain — plantar fasciitis clinical practice guideline introduction outlines the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy's ongoing effort to create evidence-based practice guidelines for orthopaedic physical therapy management within the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. The purposes are to describe evidence-based PT practice, classify and define common musculoskeletal conditions using World Health Organization terminology, identify interventions supported by current best evidence, and identify appropriate outcome measures to assess changes from PT interventions. Additional aims are to provide a description to policy makers using internationally accepted terminology, provide information for payers and claims reviewers regarding orthopaedic physical therapist management, and create a reference publication for orthopaedic PT clinicians and educators regarding the best current practice of orthopaedic PT. The statement of intent clarifies that these guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care, that standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data for an individual patient and are subject to change, that these parameters should be considered guidelines only and that adherence will not ensure a successful outcome nor exclude other acceptable methods, and that ultimate judgment must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.

### Plantar fasciitis [^115q1q2v]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is a common problem that one in 10 people will experience in their lifetime. Plantar fasciopathy is an appropriate descriptor because the condition is not inflammatory. Risk factors include limited ankle dorsiflexion, increased body mass index, and standing for prolonged periods of time. Plantar fasciitis is common in runners but can also affect sedentary people. With proper treatment, 80% of patients with plantar fasciitis improve within 12 months. Plantar fasciitis is predominantly a clinical diagnosis. Symptoms are stabbing, nonradiating pain first thing in the morning in the proximal medioplantar surface of the foot; the pain becomes worse at the end of the day. Physical examination findings are often limited to tenderness to palpation of the proximal plantar fascial insertion at the anteromedial calcaneus. Ultrasonography is a reasonable and inexpensive diagnostic tool for patients with pain that persists beyond three months despite treatment. Treatment should start with stretching of the plantar fascia, ice massage, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Many standard treatments such as night splints and orthoses have not shown benefit over placebo. Recalcitrant plantar fasciitis can be treated with injections, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, or surgical procedures, although evidence is lacking. Endoscopic fasciotomy may be required in patients who continue to have pain that limits activity and function despite exhausting nonoperative treatment options.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111sGXg]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

The efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and corticosteroid (CS) injections for treating plantar fasciitis has been a subject of ongoing debate.

What Is New

This systematic review reveals that while PRP injections do not outperform CS in the short term or at 1-yr follow-up, they provide significantly better pain relief in the medium term (3–6 mos). These insights can help doctors make informed decisions when choosing between PRP and CS treatments for plantar fasciitis, especially for patients seeking longer-term pain management.

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common and debilitating degenerative condition of the plantar fascia, primarily caused by repetitive microtrauma and excessive tension on the plantar surface. This repeated stress leads to microtears within the fascia, which precipitate fibroblastic proliferation and subsequent abnormal collagen deposition, ultimately culminating in tissue degeneration and structural changes. These microtears result in edema and degenerative alterations, which are key mechanisms responsible for the pain experienced by patients with plantar fasciitis. While traditionally associated with inflammatory processes, emerging evidence suggests that PF is predominantly a degenerative condition with minimal inflammation, characterized by vascular dysfunction and structural damage within the fascia.PF is the most frequent cause of heel pain, with a global lifetime prevalence of 10%, and is more prevalent among females. The condition significantly impairs patients' quality of life, as the resulting pain and mobility restrictions limit daily activities, potentially leading to decreased physical fitness, work absenteeism, and psychological stress.

### A retrospective comparison of percutaneous plantar fasciotomy and open plantar fasciotomy with heel spur resection [^116SMria]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of recalcitrant heel pain is a relatively new approach. To compare the 2 approaches, a retrospective chart review was conducted of 53 patients (55 feet) who had undergone surgical treatment of plantar fasciitis by either open fasciotomy with heel spur resection or percutaneous medial fascial release. The outcomes measures included perioperative pain and the interval to return to full activity. Pain was measured on a subjective 10-point visual analog scale. Of the 55 fasciotomies performed, 23 were percutaneous and 32 were open, with adjunctive heel spur resection. The percutaneous group experienced a mean pain reduction of 5.69 points at the first postoperative visit, whereas open fasciotomy group experienced a mean pain reduction of 3.53 points. At 12 months postoperatively, no statistically significant difference was found in the pain levels between the 2 groups. The results also showed that the percutaneous group returned to normal activity an average of 2.82 weeks (p < .001) faster than the open group. In the patient cohorts studied, percutaneous medial fascial release was as effective at resolving recalcitrant plantar fasciitis pain as the open procedure and involved less postoperative pain and a faster return to full activity.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111emtY3]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of PRP versus CS treatment for plantar fasciitis remains controversial, as various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results. While some studies have found no significant difference in efficacy between PRP and CSs, others have reported superior outcomes with PRP. Therefore, our study aims to compare the effectiveness of PRP and CSs in treating plantar fasciitis across the following three critical aspects: pain, foot function, and plantar fascia thickness — each of which represents a clinically relevant dimension of the condition. Pain is the primary and most debilitating symptom, directly affecting patients' quality of life. Foot function is crucial as it determines patients' ability to perform daily activities, which is often severely impaired in those with plantar fasciitis. Plantar fascia thickness serves as a measurable indicator of structural changes within the fascia, providing insights into the underlying pathophysiology and the treatment's impact on tissue morphology. By thoroughly assessing these dimensions, we aim to provide robust insights into the most suitable treatment method for this widespread and impactful condition.

### Lateral column symptomatology following plantar fascial release: a prospective study [^115aAimz]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis or heel spur syndrome usually resolves with conservative management, but for patients with continued pain, surgical intervention is often pursued. In some cases, plantar fasciitis is relieved, but pain in the lateral column area appears postoperatively. This lateral column pain may be debilitating for the patient and often overlooked by the foot and ankle surgeon. The goal of the study was to identify the maximum amount of plantar fascia that can be surgically released to treat recalcitrant heel pain effectively while preventing the development of lateral column symptoms. All patients undergoing plantar fasciotomy after failing conservative treatment were eligible to participate. Patients rated their pain with an 11-point (0–10) visual analog scale (VAS) and described its location prior to and at monthly intervals after their surgery. Surgeons recorded whether 25, 50, or 66% of the plantar fascia was released during surgery. Open procedures were performed 72% of the time, and endoscopically in 28% of the patients. Key outcome variables included degree of fascial release and foot structure. Patients (n = 47) with lateral column pain after surgery (n = 15 feet) had a mean ± S.E. of 60.6 ± 3.0% of their plantar fascia released while those without pain (n = 35 feet) had only 48.7 ± 1.9% of this fascia released during surgery (ANOVA, p = .019). Age, weight, body mass index, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, general health, surgical procedure, postoperative care, calcaneal inclination angle, and talar declination angle did not differ for these groups (p > .146). For this patient population, regardless of surgical technique (endoscopic or open release), lateral column symptoms were more likely to result when more than 50% of the plantar fascia was released. The report proposes that a maximum of 50% of the plantar fascia be released during surgery.

### Trends in foot and ankle studies published in high-impact general medical journals: a systematic review [^116tkzBT]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The foot and ankle surgery literature lacks an analysis of studies published in general medical journals. Studies published in general medical journals have high visibility and significant impact on decision making by medical practitioners and health care policy makers. Knowledge of the subject matter and methodologic characteristics of foot and ankle publications being read by general medical practitioners and the lay public is important to the practicing foot and ankle surgeon. A systematic review of foot and ankle studies published from 2000 to 2017 in 5 high-impact general medical journals was undertaken. Data extracted included study topic, study design, study demographics, and methodologic characteristics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There were 47 foot and ankle studies published in the selected medical journals examined during the study time period. Most common topics were diabetic foot ulcers (n = 25 [53.2%]), plantar fasciitis (n = 6 [12.8%]), and Achilles tendinopathy (n = 5 [10.6%]). The most common study types were reviews (n = 24 [51.1%]), RCTs (n = 12 [25.4%], and prospective studies (n = 6 [12.8%]). Of the published RCTs, the most common journal of publication was the Journal of the American Medical Association (n = 7 [58.3%]). The median number of citations for RCTs published before 2016 was 242.5. Of the small number of RCTs that compared operative with nonoperative treatment, the majority supported nonoperative management (n = 3 [75%]). Diabetic foot ulcers, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are the most commonly published foot and ankle topics in general medical journals.

### Plantar heel pain and fasciitis [^113bPH74]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain causes soreness or tenderness of the sole of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. The prevalence and prognosis are unclear, but the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for plantar heel pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: casted orthoses (custom-made insoles), corticosteroid injection (alone, or plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel cups, heel pads (alone or with corticosteroid injection), lasers, local anaesthetic injection (alone or with corticosteroid injection), night splints plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, stretching exercises, surgery, taping, and ultrasound.

### Treatment options in patients with plantar fasciitis… [^116yMz2E]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is estimated to account for more than 10 percent of adult patients who present with foot problems. It commonly affects runners and other athletes and occurs frequently in persons older than 40 years. Buchbinder reviewed the diagnosis and treatment of this common musculoskeletal condition. Plantar fasciitis tends to be self-limited, and studies have shown that symptoms resolve in most patients within one year. The author notes that even surgical case series, which represent highly select patients, report surgical intervention rates of only about 5 percent. The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is usually straightforward. Patients typically note the gradual onset of inferior heel pain, which often is worse with the first steps of the morning and increases toward the end of the day after prolonged weight-bearing activities.

Imaging is not commonly necessary for diagnosis, but ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging have been used to demonstrate increased plantar fascia thickness in affected patients. Plain radiography and bone scans may be used to detect calcaneal stress fracture. The presence of calcaneal bone spurs on plain radiographs has no value in making or excluding the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Although a variety of treatment modalities for this condition exists, many of them lack a firm evidence basis for efficacy. The self-limited nature of plantar fasciitis portends a good prognosis, regardless of treatment. Calf muscle stretching, plantar fascia stretching, and foot taping are widely used but do not have firm data to support their effectiveness. Magnetic insoles have no demonstrated benefit, nor does therapeutic ultrasonography, laser therapy, iontophoresis, or electron-generating devices.

Heel cups, pads, and orthotics often are used in the treatment of plantar fasciitis, but evidence from controlled studies about their relative efficacy is limited and sometimes conflicting. The use of night splints to hold the heel in a neutral position or some dorsiflexion also has conflicting evidence support. Injection of corticosteroids near the plantar fascia origin has been used for treatment, although evidence of its benefit appears to be limited to short-term pain relief, and anecdotal concerns have been raised about an increased risk of fascia rupture. The author suggests a limited role for surgery in carefully selected patients with refractory symptoms after six to 12 months of conservative therapy. Endoscopic surgical approaches to fascia release have reported quicker recovery times compared with the usual open procedures, but these approaches may carry an increased risk of nerve injury.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QHc6Y]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Typically, the first line of treatment for plantar fasciitis is nonsurgical, involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, orthotics, and physical therapy. For patients who do not respond to these interventions, different types of injections are available. The current standard for local injection therapies includes corticosteroid (CS) injections, which provide short-term pain relief in approximately 70%–80% of patients. The effects generally last between 4 and 12 wks, with the greatest relief observed around 4 wks after injection. In most cases, a single injection is sufficient to achieve significant pain reduction. However, in refractory cases, up to three injections may be administered, although this increases the risk of complications. These complications may include plantar fascia rupture, infection, skin pigmentation changes, muscle damage, and fat pad atrophy. Although many patients experience partial improvement, the benefits tend to diminish over time, and full resolution of symptoms is not guaranteed. – In recent years, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have gained prominence in the treatment of plantar fasciitis by leveraging the regenerative potential of platelets and leukocytes.PRP releases a concentrated array of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), all of which are pivotal in tissue repair and regeneration. These growth factors enhance cellular proliferation, stimulate collagen synthesis, and promote angiogenesis, which are critical for the restoration of damaged plantar fascia. Moreover, the leukocytes in PRP contribute to its antimicrobial properties, reducing the risk of infection and further supporting the healing process. This multifaceted approach positions PRP as a promising therapeutic option, particularly for patients who have not responded adequately to conventional treatments.

### The clinical efficacy of two endoscopic surgical approaches for intractable plantar fasciitis [^1136BFbh]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In this randomized retrospective study, 2 different endoscopic approaches were used to treat intractable plantar fasciitis with the aim to reduce complications and improve therapeutic effects. The lateral double incisions group included 23 feet in 22 patients, and the medial and lateral incisions group included 21 feet in 19 patients. Both groups were treated with endoscopy through the suprafascial approach. Patients were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale (AOFAS-AHS) and visual analog scale (VAS) preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. At the final follow-up, the Roles-Maudsley (R-M) score was used to determine patient satisfaction. The AOFAS-AHS scores of the lateral double incisions group were 54.54 ± 7.02 preoperatively and 97.71 ± 3.67 postoperatively. Similarly, AOFAS-AHS scores in the medial and lateral incisions group were 55.52 ± 6.41 preoperatively and 96.64 ± 3.18 postoperatively. There was no significant difference in AOFAS-AHS scores between groups before and after surgery. The time to full weightbearing after surgery and the time to return to full athletic activities in the 2 groups showed no significant difference. The postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower than the preoperative values for both groups. However, no differences were noted in VAS scores or R-M scores postoperatively between the 2 groups. In the medial and lateral incisions group, 3 cases of injury of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve occurred postoperatively. In conclusion, both endoscopic approaches are effective in the treatment of intractable plantar fasciitis. The lateral double incisions approach showed a lower incidence of nerve injury.

### Plantar fasciitis: evaluation and treatment [^112CfzPU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of plantar heel pain. Its characteristic features are pain and tenderness, predominately on the medial aspect of the calcaneus near the sole of the heel. Considering a complete differential diagnosis of plantar heel pain is important; a comprehensive history and physical examination guide accurate diagnosis. Many nonsurgical treatment modalities have been used in managing the disorder, including rest, massage, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, night splints, heel cups/pads, custom and off-the-shelf orthoses, injections, casts, and physical therapy measures such as shock wave therapy. Most reported treatment outcomes rely on anecdotal experience or combinations of multiple modalities. Nevertheless, nonsurgical management of plantar fasciitis is successful in approximately 90% of patients. Surgical treatment is considered in only a small subset of patients with persistent, severe symptoms refractory to nonsurgical intervention for at least 6 to 12 months.

### Treatment of plantar fasciitis [^112Voj19]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain in adults. The disorder classically presents with pain that is particularly severe with the first few steps taken in the morning. In general, plantar fasciitis is a self-limited condition. However, symptoms usually resolve more quickly when the interval between the onset of symptoms and the onset of treatment is shorter. Many treatment options exist, including rest, stretching, strengthening, change of shoes, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, anti-inflammatory agents and surgery. Usually, plantar fasciitis can be treated successfully by tailoring treatment to an individual's risk factors and preferences.
