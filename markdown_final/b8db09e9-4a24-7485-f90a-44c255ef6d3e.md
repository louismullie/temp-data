## Question

Acute Angioedema management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute angioedema management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate airway assessment and stabilization. Then, I should classify the angioedema mechanism to guide therapy. Next, I will outline mechanism-specific treatments, including HAE-specific agents, ACE inhibitor–related angioedema, and histaminergic angioedema. After that, I need to address special populations and resource-limited settings. Finally, I will integrate disposition, follow-up, and a concise algorithm, while continuously verifying each step against guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the priority: airway comes before everything else, and I need to check for progressive oral, lingual, or laryngeal edema, stridor, dysphonia, dysphagia, or respiratory distress. If present, I should escalate early to awake fiberoptic intubation or surgical airway rather than waiting for collapse, because delays increase mortality in HAE and other upper airway angioedema scenarios [^2515ed9c] [^0a6451f2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I secure the airway. I should simultaneously classify the mechanism because treatment hinges on it: histaminergic/mast cell–mediated (allergic, idiopathic), bradykinin-mediated (HAE types I/II, acquired C1-INH deficiency, ACE inhibitor–associated), and other causes like NSAID-exacerbated or delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema. Recurrent angioedema without urticaria should prompt evaluation for C1-INH deficiency or ACE inhibitor exposure before labeling it idiopathic [^25fcbbb1] [^8f578b93] [^959d8106].

> I will now examine HAE-specific acute therapy. Wait, let me verify the first-line agents and timing: plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH, icatibant (B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist), and ecallantide (plasma kallikrein inhibitor) are all effective for acute attacks, and early administration shortens attack duration and severity. I should treat as soon as possible, ideally within 1 hour of symptom onset, and ensure patients have on-demand access to at least two standard doses with training for self-administration when appropriate [^8da1f693] [^c19aaf1f] [^148a145f] [^4c720453].

> But wait, what if HAE-specific agents are unavailable or contraindicated? I should double-check the role of fresh frozen plasma. FFP can be used as a temporizing option when specific therapies are not available, but it carries a risk of paradoxical worsening due to substrate delivery, so I need to monitor closely and be prepared to escalate airway management if deterioration occurs [^bc956c99] [^0a6451f2].

> Next, I should review ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema. Let me think about the pathophysiology and evidence: this is bradykinin-mediated and does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. No medication has proven benefit in high-quality trials, so the cornerstone is immediate ACE inhibitor discontinuation, supportive care, and early airway intervention if the upper airway is involved. I should avoid re-challenging with ACE inhibitors in the future due to recurrence risk [^e4371fba] [^16732ca2].

> For histaminergic angioedema, I need to ensure I am not conflating this with HAE. Epinephrine is first-line if there is any concern for anaphylaxis or airway compromise, followed by H1 antihistamines and corticosteroids for symptom control. I should confirm that urticaria is present or absent, because isolated angioedema without urticaria pushes me to reconsider bradykinin-mediated etiologies rather than pure histaminergic disease [^f213a5cf] [^8ab97bc6] [^2f92de2c].

> Let me consider special populations. In pediatrics, I should confirm that plasma-derived C1-INH, icatibant, and ecallantide are approved for acute treatment, and that home access and training are emphasized to reduce delays. In pregnancy, I should prefer plasma-derived C1-INH for acute treatment and prophylaxis given its safety profile. In resource-limited settings, FFP and attenuated androgens may be the only available options, but I must counsel on limitations and monitor carefully for adverse effects and delayed response [^0ad394db] [^30a59338] [^5479d422].

> I should double-check disposition and follow-up. Any patient with upper airway involvement warrants observation in a monitored setting with ready access to intubation or surgical airway. Even without airway involvement, HAE patients should generally be observed for several hours after treatment to ensure response. All patients should leave with an action plan, on-demand medication, and clear return precautions, and HAE patients should have specialist follow-up and consideration of long-term prophylaxis based on attack frequency and severity [^0a6451f2] [^d6917c3c] [^dfce86be].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying: stabilize airway first. Concurrently classify mechanism by history, exam, and targeted labs (C4, C1-INH level/function) if recurrent angioedema without urticaria is present. If HAE, give C1-INH, icatibant, or ecallantide early. If ACE inhibitor–related, stop the drug and support. If histaminergic, treat with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids as indicated. Observe for progression, provide action plans and on-demand access, and arrange appropriate follow-up and prophylaxis planning [^25fcbbb1] [^8da1f693] [^e4371fba] [^f213a5cf].

---

Acute angioedema management centers on **airway protection** and **mechanism-specific therapy**. For suspected anaphylaxis, give **epinephrine immediately** [^8ab97bc6], then H1/H2 antihistamines and corticosteroids [^f213a5cf]. For hereditary angioedema (HAE), use **C1-inhibitor replacement**, icatibant, or ecallantide as early as possible [^8da1f693]; avoid epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids, which are ineffective [^21991763]. For ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema, stop the ACE inhibitor and support the airway; no medication reliably reverses bradykinin-mediated swelling [^e4371fba]. Intubate early if there is any sign of airway compromise, and monitor all patients with upper airway involvement for at least 12–24 hours [^notfound].

---

## Initial assessment and airway management

- **Airway assessment**: Immediate evaluation for tongue, lip, or oropharyngeal swelling, stridor, dysphonia, or dyspnea [^0a6451f2].

- **Early intubation**: If there is progressive upper airway edema, intubate early using awake fiberoptic techniques when feasible [^2515ed9c].

- **Observation**: Monitor all patients with upper airway involvement for 12–24 hours due to risk of delayed deterioration [^notfound].

## Differentiating angioedema mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Common causes** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Histaminergic (allergic) | - Foods <br/> - Drugs <br/> - Insect stings | - Urticaria <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Rapid onset <br/> - Responds to epinephrine [^f213a5cf] |
| Bradykinin-mediated | - HAE <br/> - ACE inhibitor–induced <br/> - Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency | - Non-pruritic <br/> - No urticaria <br/> - Slow onset <br/> - Poor response to epinephrine [^6a2bb389] |

---

## Management of histaminergic angioedema (allergic)

- **Epinephrine**: 0.3–0.5 mg IM (0.01 mg/kg in children) every 5–15 minutes if needed [^notfound].

- **Antihistamines**: H1 blocker (e.g. diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV/IM) and H2 blocker (e.g. ranitidine 50 mg IV) [^a67609a3].

- **Corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV or prednisone 40–60 mg PO [^a67609a3].

---

## Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE)

- **First-line therapies**: Early use of C1-inhibitor replacement (plasma-derived or recombinant), icatibant (bradykinin B2 antagonist), or ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor) [^8da1f693] [^4c720453].

- **Avoid**: Epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are ineffective for HAE [^21991763].

- **Supportive care**: Analgesics, antiemetics, and hydration for abdominal attacks [^0a6451f2].

---

## Management of ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema

- **Discontinue ACE inhibitor**: Stop the offending drug immediately [^e4371fba].

- **Supportive care**: Airway support and observation; no medication reliably reverses bradykinin-mediated swelling [^e4371fba].

- **Alternative therapy**: Consider ARBs cautiously after recovery; recurrence risk persists [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Use weight-based dosing; plasma-derived C1-inhibitor is approved for children [^0ad394db].

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer C1-inhibitor replacement; avoid androgens and tranexamic acid [^30a59338].

- **Resource-limited settings**: Fresh frozen plasma may be used if specific therapies are unavailable, with caution [^5479d422].

---

## Follow-up and prevention

Ensure **specialist referral** to allergy/immunology or hepatology for HAE or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. Educate patients on trigger avoidance, early recognition, and use of on-demand therapy, and provide an **emergency action plan** with access to medication and medical alert identification [^d6917c3c] [^148a145f].

---

Acute angioedema management requires **rapid airway assessment**, mechanism-specific therapy, and close observation. Early intubation for airway compromise, epinephrine for allergic reactions, and HAE-specific agents for bradykinin-mediated swelling are critical to outcomes.

### Clinical practice statement: what is the emergency department management of patients with angioedema secondary to an ACE-inhibitor? [^e4371fba]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema is a complication that has been reported in up to 1.0% of individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Importantly, the onset of angioedema can occur anywhere from hours to several years after initiation of therapy with ACE-Is. Although most cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema (ACE-I-AE) are self-limiting, a major clinical concern is development of airway compromise, which can potentially require emergent airway management. The underlying pathophysiology of ACE-I-AE is incompletely understood, but is considered to be due in large part to excess bradykinin. Numerous medications have been proposed for the treatment of ACE-I-AE. This article is an update to the 2011 Clinical Practice Committee (CPC) statement from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

Methods

A literature search in PubMed was performed with search terms angioedema and ACE inhibitors from August 1, 2012 to May 13, 2019. Following CPC guidelines, articles written in English were identified and then underwent a structured review for evaluation.

Results

The search parameters resulted in 323 articles. The abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by the reviewers, who determined there were 63 articles that were specific to ACE-I-AE, of which 46 were deemed appropriate for grading in the final focused review.

Conclusions

The primary focus for the treatment of ACE-I-AE is airway management. In the absence of high-quality evidence, no specific medication therapy is recommended for its treatment. If, however, the treating physician feels the patient's presentation is more typical of an acute allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, it may be appropriate to treat for those conditions. Any patient with suspected ACE-I-AE should immediately discontinue that medication.

### Acute management of hereditary angioedema attacks [^4c720453]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Several treatment modalities have become available for management of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in the last 15 years. Most are now available to patients in North America, Europe, United Kingdom, and Australia, but few options exist in developing countries. Preferred contemporary use of the treatments to be discussed is "on demand", because control remains with the patient and delays in treatment access avoided. Four treatments-plasma-derived C1 inhibitor concentrate, recombinant C1 inhibitor concentrate, ecallantide, and icatibant-are reviewed in this article. All have been shown to be superior to placebo and effective in the management of all HAE attacks.

### A consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema in the emergency department [^25fcbbb1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively common occurrence and life-threatening potential, the management of angioedema in the emergency department (ED) is lacking in terms of a structured approach. It is paramount to distinguish the different etiologies of angioedema from one another and more specifically differentiate histaminergic-mediated angioedema from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, especially in lieu of the more novel treatments that have recently become available for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. With this background in mind, this consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema attempts to provide a working framework for emergency physicians (EPs) in approaching the patient with angioedema in terms of diagnosis and management in the ED. This consensus parameter was developed from a collaborative effort among a group of EPs and leading allergists with expertise in angioedema. After rigorous debate, review of the literature, and expert opinion, the following consensus guideline document was created. The document has been endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema: an emergency medicine perspective [^c8637670]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and often debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the absence of appropriate intervention. An underlying deficiency in functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein induces a vulnerability to unchecked activation of the complement, contact, and coagulation/fibrinolytic systems. The clinical consequence is a pattern of recurring attacks of non-pitting, non-pruritic edema, the urgency of which varies by the affected site. Laryngeal edema can escalate rapidly to asphyxiation, and severe cases of abdominal swelling can lead to hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

This report reviews the emergency diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema and the impact of recently introduced treatments on treatment in the United States.

Discussion

Until recently, emergency physicians in the United States were hindered by the lack of rapidly effective treatment options for HAE attacks. In this article, general clinical and laboratory diagnostic procedures are reviewed against the backdrop of two case studies: one patient presenting with a known history of HAE and one with previously undiagnosed HAE. In many countries outside the United States, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate has for decades been the first-line treatment for acute attacks. The end of 2009 ushered in a new era in the pharmacologic management of HAE attacks in the United States with the approval of two new treatment options for acute treatment: a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate and a kallikrein inhibitor.

Conclusion

With access to targeted and effective treatments, emergency physicians are now better equipped for successful and rapid intervention in urgent HAE cases.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^f213a5cf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Angioedema [^c9db4cb4]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening occurrence that is encountered by critical care providers. The mechanistic understanding of angioedema syndromes has improved in recent years, and novel medications are available that improve outcomes from these syndromes. This clinically focused review will describe the underlying genetics, pathophysiology, classification and treatment of angioedema syndromes, with an emphasis on the novel pharmacologic agents that have recently become available for acute treatment.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted with the MeSH terms angioedema, acquired angioedema, hereditary angioedema type III, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema.

Study Selection

Selected publications describing angioedema, clinical trials, diagnosis, management, and genetics were retrieved (reviews, guidelines, clinical trials, case series), and their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify relevant publications.

Data Extraction

Data from the relevant publications were reviewed, summarized and the information synthesized.

Data Synthesis

The data obtained were used to describe the current state of diagnosis and management of various angioedema syndromes.

Conclusions

Angioedema is a life-threatening syndrome with multiple subtypes, each with a distinct pathophysiology. We present an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and suggested management of various subtypes of angioedema. Securing the airway remains the most important intervention, followed by administration of both established and more novel pharmacologic interventions based on disease pathology.

### C1 inhibitor deficiency: 2014 United Kingdom consensus document [^2830dbf4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

C1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare disorder manifesting with recurrent attacks of disabling and potentially life-threatening angioedema. Here we present an updated 2014 United Kingdom consensus document for the management of C1 inhibitor-deficient patients, representing a joint venture between the United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network and Hereditary Angioedema UK. To develop the consensus, we assembled a multi-disciplinary steering group of clinicians, nurses and a patient representative. This steering group first met in 2012, developing a total of 48 recommendations across 11 themes. The statements were distributed to relevant clinicians and a representative group of patients to be scored for agreement on a Likert scale. All 48 statements achieved a high degree of consensus, indicating strong alignment of opinion. The recommendations have evolved significantly since the 2005 document, with particularly notable developments including an improved evidence base to guide dosing and indications for acute treatment, greater emphasis on home therapy for acute attacks and a strong focus on service organization.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^14bb5282]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Urticaria/angioedema follow-up and treatment adjustment — timing and frequency: Follow-up in 2 to 6 weeks as symptoms and treatment response dictate, because management of urticaria/angioedema requires frequent follow-up visits to determine whether the intervention, treatment, or both is effective, and modifying treatment (step down or discontinue) based on patient response is necessary after 2 to 6 weeks to determine whether hives are persistent and likely to become chronic.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^07989f1d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### Hereditary angioedema: imaging manifestations and clinical management [^cf7123a7]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a genetic disorder typically related to insufficient or dysfunctional C1-esterase inhibitor. Patients present with episodic swelling of various body parts, such as the face, neck, bowel, genitals, and extremities. Acute or severe symptoms can lead to patients presenting to the emergency room, particularly when the neck and abdominopelvic regions are affected, which is often accompanied by radiologic imaging evaluation. Patients with hereditary angioedema can pose a diagnostic challenge for emergency department physicians and radiologists at initial presentation, and the correct diagnosis may be missed or delayed, due to lack of clinical awareness of the disease or lack of its consideration in the radiologic differential diagnosis. Timely diagnosis of hereditary angioedema and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy can avoid potentially life-threatening complications. This article focuses on the spectrum of common and characteristic acute imaging manifestations of hereditary angioedema and provides an update on important recent developments in its clinical management and treatment.

### Outcome measures in randomized controlled studies of acute therapy for hereditary angioedema: a systematic review [^b0afb9b1]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by recurrent swellings of subcutaneous and mucosal tissue. Access to effective on demand medication to treat acute attacks is vital for every HAE patient. Clinical trials investigating new acute treatment options focus on increased efficacy, easier routes of administration, and reduced side effects. The outcome measures that have been reported in these studies have been varied. The existence of this range of efficacy outcomes is, at least partly, caused by the difficulty in developing an unique uniform outcome measure that captures the heterogeneity in attack location, symptoms, severity, and temporal patterns. In addition, these efficacy outcomes have to depend heavily on patient‐reported outcomes, since sensations such as relief of discomfort, disability, and pain cannot be measured objectively by clinicians. The heterogeneity in outcome measures hinders trial comparison, leads to selective outcome reporting bias, and the large quantity of outcome measures used in a single trial puts a significant burden on participants. It is unclear which primary outcome parameters best reflect the efficacy of the investigated acute treatment options. These issues can be addressed with a Core Outcome Set (COS); "an agreed standardized collection of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area". This systematic review aims to summarize the efficacy outcome measures reported in studies evaluating acute treatment in HAE patients as a first step in the development of a COS.

### Mitigating disparity in health-care resources between countries for management of hereditary angioedema [^313216d5]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of skin and mucosal edema. The main treatment goal is to enable a "normal life" for all patients. However, due to high costs, there are limited options for the management of HAE in most developing and low-income countries. As a result, most of the recommended first-line treatments are not available. In this review, we attempt to highlight the disparities in health-care resources for the management of patients with HAE amongst different countries. Data was collected from HAE experts in countries who provide tabulated information regarding management and availability of HAE treatments in their countries. We reviewed the two most recent international HAE guidelines. Using India, the world's second most populous country, as a paradigm for HAE management in lower-income countries, we reviewed the evidence for second-line and non-recommended practices reported by HAE experts. Results suggest significant inequities in provision of HAE services and treatments. HAE patients in low-income countries do not have access to life-saving acute drugs or recently developed highly effective prophylactic medications. Most low-income countries do not have specialized HAE services or diagnostic facilities, resulting in consequent long delays in diagnosis. Suggestions for optimizing the use of limited resources as a basis for future discussion and reaching a global consensus are provided. There is an urgent need to improve HAE services, diagnostics and treatments currently available to lower-income countries. We recommend that all HAE stakeholders support the need for global equity and access to these essential measures.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria guidelines: what is new? [^a0c31cba]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that can be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. Very recently, the newest update and revision of the international European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma Clinical Immunology guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria was published. It aims to help primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations approach to developing consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then discussed in a Delphi conference that included more than 250 specialists in the field, and they are endorsed by more than 50 international societies. Here, we highlight changes from previous versions of the international urticaria guideline and their impact on clinical practice.

### Emergency department management of patients with ACE-inhibitor angioedema [^16732ca2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are one of the most prescribed medications worldwide. Angioedema is a well-recognized adverse effect of this class of medications, with a reported incidence of ACEI angioedema of up to 1.0%. Of importance to note, ACEI angioedema is a class effect and is not dose dependent. The primary goal of this literature search was to determine the appropriate Emergency Department management of patients with ACEI angioedema.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search from January 1990 to August 2012 and limited to human studies written in English for articles with keywords of ACEI angioedema. Guideline statements and non-systematic reviews were excluded. Studies identified then underwent a structured review from which results could be evaluated.

Results

Five hundred sixty-two papers on ACEI angioedema were screened and 27 appropriate articles were rigorously reviewed in detail and recommendations given.

Conclusion

The literature search did not support any specific treatment protocol with a high level of evidence due to the limited — and limitations of the — available studies.

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^20acebfa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by Allergy and Immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach to management of patients using dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines followed by use of omalizumab and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases. In select patients (those with refractory chronic urticaria), nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals may have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often managed similar to chronic spontaneous urticaria. Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies of targeted therapies have been generally disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for management of hereditary angioedema. Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema". If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)". When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria". If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10". If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions", otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy".

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^0ad394db]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment Options for Pediatric Patients

The principles guiding pharmacologic management of HAE include the following:1

Availability of effective on-demand acute therapy for all patients;
Early treatment to prevent attack progression;
Treatment of attacks irrespective of the site of swelling;
Incorporation of long-term prophylaxis (LTP) based on shared decision-making.

Children with HAE should have access to ≥ 2 standard doses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicines to treat unpredictable angioedema episodes. While on-demand treatment alone can be sufficient for some patients, first-line prophylactic therapy together with on-demand treatment of breakthrough attacks may be indicated for others.

Currently, 7 products are approved by the FDA for use in pediatric populations: 3 are indicated for acute HAE attacks (on-demand treatment), and 4 are indicated for prophylaxis. Therapies approved in the United States for treatment of HAE in pediatric patients are listed in Table 2.

Table 2.
On-Demand and Prophylaxis Medications Approved in the United States and Recommended by Guidelines for Treatment of HAE in Pediatric Patients.

On-Demand Treatment

The goal of on-demand acute therapy for HAE is to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality from an ongoing swelling episode. While on-demand treatments prevent swelling from progressing, it may take between 30 minutes and 2 hours for swelling to resolve after the medication is administered. It is imperative to convey to parents that early treatment leads to better symptom control. A second dose generally is not needed unless the swelling continues to worsen.

Based on improved understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanism of swelling in HAE-C1-INH,3 products have been approved for on-demand treatment in pediatric populations (Table 2). Each product has been shown in randomized, controlled studies to be effective and safe,- and these findings have been confirmed in subsequent open-label extension studies and patient registries.-

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^738d48d7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute management emphasizes avoidance of ineffective therapies, selective use of plasma, and access to on-demand agents: Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE; fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating attacks but might actually exacerbate some attacks and therefore requires caution; management can include symptomatic treatment based on the region of body swelling; neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs are likely effective for acute attacks; guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and evidence from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials demonstrates efficacy and safety for treatment with C1INH concentrates, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### The international WAO / EAACI guideline for the management of hereditary angioedema-the 2017 revision and update [^4b2bf278]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare and disabling disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential. This update and revision of the global guideline for HAE provides up-to-date consensus recommendations for the management of HAE. In the development of this update and revision of the guideline, an international expert panel reviewed the existing evidence and developed 20 recommendations that were discussed, finalized and consented during the guideline consensus conference in June 2016 in Vienna. The final version of this update and revision of the guideline incorporates the contributions of a board of expert reviewers and the endorsing societies. The goal of this guideline update and revision is to provide clinicians and their patients with guidance that will assist them in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1-inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1-inhibitor (type 2). The key clinical questions covered by these recommendations are: (1) How should HAE-1/2 be defined and classified?, (2) How should HAE-1/2 be diagnosed?, (3) Should HAE-1/2 patients receive prophylactic and/or on-demand treatment and what treatment options should be used?, (4) Should HAE-1/2 management be different for special HAE-1/2 patient groups such as pregnant/lactating women or children?, and (5) Should HAE-1/2 management incorporate self-administration of therapies and patient support measures?

### Hereditary angioedema: a review of the current and evolving treatment landscape [^4de60b25]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by sudden and often unprovoked episodes of swelling that can be potentially life-threatening when it involves the upper airway. The treatment options for both acute episodes of HAE and LTP, used to minimize the frequency and severity of angioedema attacks, were limited historically to very few options, had considerable side effects, and/or had considerable burden of treatment. Fortunately, through the elucidation of the pathophysiology of HAE, the development of newer targeted therapies has been possible both for acute therapy and long-term prophylaxis and even more are on the horizon. Because of the rapid development of these therapies, it can be challenging for clinicians to keep abreast of newer and developing treatments for HAE. This review article will outline the current and potential future treatments for HAE. It will also highlight important considerations when treating special HAE patient populations including women and pediatric patients.

### Creating a comprehensive treatment plan for hereditary angioedema [^ba5abfe6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has changed dramatically in recent years because of the availability of several HAE-specific medications. This paradigm shift in therapy provides the opportunity to dramatically improve the care of HAE patients, but has increased the complexity of treatment. Patient education and communication with health care providers is crucial. Early treatment of HAE attacks has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid and reliable treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence for best practices in HAE management, and suggests practical steps toward developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^418badb7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder; most cases are characterized by low plasma levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Clinical manifestations of HAE due to C1-INH deficiency include unpredictable, acute, recurrent episodes of nonpruritic swelling that can affect the face, trunk, limbs, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be disfiguring, disabling, painful, and even life-threatening if laryngeal swelling occurs. Symptoms of HAE generally manifest in childhood. Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children. However, evidence informing use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited. Hereditary angioedema management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address on-demand treatment for acute attacks and plans to prevent potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues. This article provides an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### Hereditary angioedema: diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^7afa8c98]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition. Effective management of HAE must consider routine/long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, eg, surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy, or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^ab834273]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — trigger identification and avoidance — Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by a detailed history and eliminated, if possible; management should focus on identifying specific triggers based on history with focused testing and symptomatic relief. A delayed syndrome has been recognized with acute urticaria/angioedema with a delay of 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of beef, pork, lamb, or venison. Medication-induced disease requires careful history: ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema after months or even years of therapy, and over-the-counter aspirin or NSAIDs (including aspirin-like remedies) can be associated with acute relapsing urticaria/angioedema; aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, as feasible, with substitution of an equally efficacious alternative not commonly associated with urticaria.

### US hereditary angioedema association medical advisory board 2013 recommendations for the management of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^5fcfa786]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has undergone dramatic changes as newer medicines have become available in recent years. Optimal care of these patients requires a comprehensive management plan. Although several consensus papers have been published concerning the diagnosis and treatment of HAE, guidelines for a comprehensive management plan have not been developed.

Objective

To develop state-of-the-art recommendations for the treatment and management of HAE due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency in the United States.

Methods

Members of the US Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board began by reviewing the literature concerning treatment of HAE. Preliminary recommendations were developed based on the literature review, discussions in a face-to-face meeting, and refinements in a series of drafts. Final recommendations reflect the unanimous consensus of the medical advisory board and the US Hereditary Angioedema Association leadership.

Results

Recommendations are provided regarding a comprehensive care plan for HAE, including the following: development of an overall management plan, treatment of angioedema attacks, prophylactic treatment, and patient monitoring.

Conclusion

A comprehensive individualized management plan developed between an expert HAE physician and the patient, in collaboration with local medical providers and emergency departments, can provide patients with the best opportunity to lead a normal life.

### A core outcome set for efficacy of acute treatment of hereditary angioedema [^878f872b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical trials investigating drugs for the acute treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks have assessed many different outcomes. This heterogeneity limits the comparability of trial results and may lead to selective outcome reporting bias and a high burden on trial participants.

Objective

To achieve consensus on a core outcome set composed of key outcomes that ideally should be used in all clinical efficacy trials involving the acute treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks.

Methods

We conducted a Delphi consensus study involving all relevant parties: patients with hereditary angioedema, hereditary angioedema expert clinicians and clinical researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory bodies. Two Internet-based survey rounds were conducted. In round 1, panelists indicated the importance of individual outcomes used in clinical trials on a 9-point Likert scale. Based on these results, a core outcome set was developed and voted on by panelists in round 2.

Results

A total of 58 worldwide panelists completed both rounds. The first round demonstrated high importance scores and substantial agreement among the panelists. In the second round, a consensus of 90% or greater was achieved on a core outcome set consisting of five key outcomes: change in overall symptom severity at one predetermined time point between 15 minutes and 4 hours after treatment, time to end of progression of all symptoms, the need for rescue medication during the entire attack, impairment of daily activities, and treatment satisfaction.

Conclusions

This international study obtained a high level of consensus on a core outcome set for the acute treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks, consisting of five key outcomes.

### International consensus on the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency [^8a40cc20]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

The consensus documents published to date on hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1‐‐) have focused on adult patients. Many of the previous recommendations have not been adapted to pediatric patients. We intended to produce consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with C1‐‐.

Methods

During an expert panel meeting that took place during the 9th C1 Inhibitor Deficiency Workshop in Budapest, 2015, pediatric data were presented and discussed and a consensus was developed by voting.

Results

The symptoms of C1‐‐often present in childhood. Differential diagnosis can be difficult as abdominal pain is common in pediatric C1‐‐, but also commonly occurs in the general pediatric population. The early onset of symptoms may predict a more severe subsequent course of the disease. Before the age of 1 year, C1‐levels may be lower than in adults; therefore, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis after the age of one year. All neonates/infants with an affected C1‐‐family member should be screened for C1‐deficiency. Pediatric patients should always carry a C1‐‐information card and medicine for emergency use. The regulatory approval status of the drugs for prophylaxis and for acute treatment is different in each country. Plasma‐derived C1‐, recombinant C1‐, and ecallantide are the only agents licensed for the acute treatment of pediatric patients. Clinical trials are underway with additional drugs. It is recommended to follow up patients in ancomprehensive care center.

Conclusions

The pediatric‐focused international consensus for the diagnosis and management of C1‐‐patients was created.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^67f38499]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — acute attack management — states that epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE, and neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs provide reliably effective treatment for acute attacks. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating HAE attacks but might acutely exacerbate some attacks, and caution is required; management can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of swelling. Guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and randomized trials demonstrate efficacy and safety for treatment of attacks with C1INH concentrate, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — biopsy and evaluation — Although skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases, it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders, and biopsy is rarely indicated when lesions are typical of urticaria with duration < 24 hours without bruising or purpura; biopsy might be indicated when mastocytosis or urticarial vasculitis is suspected. Most often acute urticaria is self-limiting and resolves in less than 6 weeks, and extensive evaluation for causes not suggested by history or examination is not cost-effective and has not been associated with improved outcomes.

### Acute urticaria and angioedema: diagnostic and treatment considerations [^1a92d838]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Urticaria is defined as wheals consisting of three features: (i) central swelling of various sizes, with or without surrounding erythema; (ii) pruritus or occasional burning sensations; and (iii) the skin returning to normal appearance, usually within 1–24 hours. Angioedema is defined as: (i) abrupt swelling of the lower dermis and subcutis; (ii) occasional pain instead of pruritus; (iii) commonly involving the mucous membranes; and (iv) skin returning to normal appearance, usually within 72 hours. Acute urticaria and angioedema is defined by its duration (< 6 weeks) compared with chronic urticaria and angioedema. The most common causes are infections, medications, and foods. The best tools in the evaluation of these patients are a comprehensive history and physical examination. There are a variety of skin conditions that may mimic acute urticaria and angioedema and the various reaction patterns associated with different drugs. Oral antihistamines are first-line treatment. In the event of a life-threatening reaction involving urticaria with angioedema, epinephrine may be needed to stabilize the patient. This review focuses on the value of a comprehensive clinical evaluation at the onset of symptoms. It underscores the importance of coordination of care among physicians, and the development of an action plan for evidence-based investigations, diagnosis, and therapy.

### Hereditary angioedema: current and emerging treatment options [^ccd2c104]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Angioedema can result from allergic, hereditary, and acquired conditions. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks are disabling at the time of occurrence and can be life threatening; they often result in hospitalization and intensive care unit admission. Although there are several variants of HAE, they share a final common pathway: unopposed activation of multiple kinins and mediators including kallikrein and bradykinin. This leads to increased vascular permeability, which in turn produces the edema after which the condition is named. Older treatment options licensed in the United States, anabolic steroids and antifibrinolytics, have troublesome side effect profiles and may not reverse a severe acute attack. In Europe, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates have been used since 1974 for both preventing and terminating attacks. Two of these have now been licensed in the United States for use in HAE patients, one for prophylaxis and the other for treating acute abdominal and facial HAE attacks. The first kinin pathway modulator, ecallantide, has also been licensed recently in the United States for treating HAE attacks. The objective of this article is to describe HAE and review the available options for managing patients, as well as different drugs currently under investigation. Specific attention is given to the perioperative management of patients with HAE.

### The international WAO / EAACI guideline for the management of hereditary angioedema-the 2021 revision and update [^5c0692bb]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and disabling disease for which early diagnosis and effective therapy are critical. This revision and update of the global WAO/EAACI guideline on the diagnosis and management of HAE provides up-to-date guidance for the management of HAE. For this update and revision of the guideline, an international panel of experts reviewed the existing evidence, developed 28 recommendations, and established consensus by an online DELPHI process. The goal of these recommendations and guideline is to help physicians and their patients in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1 inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (type 2), by providing guidance on common and important clinical issues, such as: (1) How should HAE be diagnosed? (2) When should HAE patients receive prophylactic on top of on-demand treatment and what treatments should be used? (3) What are the goals of treatment? (4) Should HAE management be different for special HAE patient groups such as children or pregnant/breast-feeding women? and (5) How should HAE patients monitor their disease activity, impact, and control? It is also the intention of this guideline to help establish global standards for the management of HAE and to encourage and facilitate the use of recommended diagnostics and therapies for all patients.

### Update on the use of C1-esterase inhibitor replacement therapy in the acute and prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema [^babef746]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the vast majority of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), angioedema attacks are due to the quantitative or functional deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), which leads to increased vascular permeability and unregulated release of bradykinin. Exogenous administration of C1-INH is a rational way to restore the concentration and functional activity of this protein, regulate the release of bradykinin, and attenuate or prevent subcutaneous and submucosal edema associated with HAE. Recent international guidelines for the management of HAE include C1-INH as an option for acute treatment of HAE. In addition, these guidelines recommend C1-INH as first-line treatment for long-term prophylaxis and as the therapy of choice for short-term/preprocedural prophylaxis. Several C1-INH products are available, with approved indications varying across regions. For the acute treatment of HAE, both plasma-derived and recombinant C1-INH formulations have been shown to be effective and well tolerated in adolescents and adults with HAE, with onset of relief within 30 min to a few hours. Plasma-derived C1-INH is approved for use in children, and recombinant C1-INH is being evaluated in this population. Intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations of C1-INH have been approved for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescents and adults. Both formulations when administered twice weekly have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of HAE attacks. The SC formulation of C1-INH obviates the need for repeated venous access and may facilitate self-administration of HAE prophylaxis at home, as recommended in HAE treatment guidelines. As with most rare diseases, the costs of HAE treatment are high; however, the development of additional acute and prophylactic medications for HAE may result in competitive pricing and help drive down the costs of HAE treatment.

Chronic urticaria — evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria should prioritize excluding complement-mediated and drug-associated causes before labeling idiopathic; specifically, patients "should be evaluated for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, or ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema before a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema is made", and when C1-inhibitor deficiency is suspected, "measurement of the C4 level is recommended as the best initial screening test", with "A normal C4 level during an episode of angioedema" strongly suggesting C1-inhibitor deficiency is unlikely; in contrast, for typical CU, "obtaining routine testing for C4 levels, C1-inhibitor levels, or functional assays is not appropriate".

Acute urticaria — diagnosis and management algorithm begins when a "Patient presents with possible acute urticaria and/or angioedema", prompting "DETAILED HISTORY INCLUDING REVIEW OF SYSTEMS" (including "Drug or biologic agent exposure(s)?" and "Physical triggers – evaluate with visual analog scale and itch severity scale") and "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION" (e.g., "Extent and characteristics of the urticaria/angioedema lesions" and "Presence of dermatographism"). When "Is the general evaluation listed in Box 2 suggestive of an underlying cause?" the next step is "SPECIFIC EVALUATION focused on the evaluation results of Box 2", followed by "Is specific evaluation suggestive of an underlying etiology?" and, if "Management of specific condition improves urticaria?", then "Follow up in 2–6 weeks, as symptoms and treatment response dictate: Modify (step down or discontinue) based on clinical response". If the general evaluation is not suggestive, the pathway states "MAY CONSIDER LIMITED NON-SPECIFIC EVALUATION" with labs that "May include CBC with diff, ESR, TSH, renal and liver profiles" and notes "Additional testing may be necessary depending on physician evaluation and patient circumstances", then proceed to "Initial Treatment" to "Remove/Avoid factors that may induce urticaria/angioedema", give "Antihistamines", consider "For moderate to severe cases oral glucocorticosteroids", and use "Epinephrine if potential for anaphylaxis".

### Hereditary angioedema [^4b2831cc]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^4f9c56f0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The median time from symptom onset to HAE diagnosis is estimated at 8.5 years. Diagnosis is often delayed, even among those with a family history of HAE. Diagnostic delays in pediatric patients may be due to the fact that HAE is a rare disorder and that many HAE symptoms can mimic those of more common conditions. Furthermore, 25% of patients have no family history of angioedema. Delays in diagnosis can defer effective treatment and result in inappropriate treatment or unnecessary surgical interventions.

Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children. However, evidence informing use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited because clinical trials of these agents have focused mostly on adults and have underrepresented pediatric patients.

Management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address treatment, on-demand treatment for acute attacks, and forestall potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including QoL and psychological issues.

The objective of this article is to provide an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### Review of select practice parameters, evidence-based treatment algorithms, and international guidelines for hereditary angioedema [^9381228f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare bradykinin-mediated disease that is characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema, which can be life threatening. HAE affects all ethnic groups equally and does not differentiate between age, sex, or race. However, the availability of therapies varies amongst countries resulting in a lack of uniformity of care. Not only is there a disparity of medication availability, but since HAE is a rare disease, it is frequently overlooked and the diagnosis is missed. Even with diagnosis, treatment and management is often less than optimal. For these reasons, it is essential to have practice parameters and guidelines. In this chapter, we focus on recent guidelines. These guidelines deal with recognition, diagnosis, medical care, patient management, and assessment, all which are essential to provide optimal care to people with a rare and orphan disease. The intent of the guidelines, and thus this chapter, is to reduce morbidity and mortality, and restore a normal quality of life for the patient with HAE. We will review the guidelines from various regions of the world as well as international group recommendations. In addition, specific patient populations such as the pregnant, elderly, and juvenile require modified treatment regimens, and for this reason, we have included these data as well. The intent of this chapter is to aid the practitioner in holistic care of the patient with HAE in order to ultimately provide the best standard of care possible.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^e17096ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria — evaluation and testing guidance emphasizes that patients with recurrent angioedema without urticaria should be assessed for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor–associated angioedema before labeling idiopathic angioedema; skin biopsy can be used selectively (refractory CU or suspected vasculitis) but routine biopsies are not required; and immediate hypersensitivity skin or serologic testing for food or other allergens is rarely useful and not recommended on a routine basis.

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach [^6f116d92]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria (i.e., pruritic, raised wheals) and angioedema (i.e., deep mucocutaneous swelling) occur in up to 25 percent of the U.S. population. Vasoactive mediators released from mast cells and basophils produce the classic wheal and flare reaction. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially if symptoms are chronic or minimally responsive to therapy. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and methodical investigation are necessary to uncover diagnostic clues. Although serious medical illness can occur concurrently with chronic urticaria, acute urticaria generally is benign and self-limited. The mainstay of therapy for urticaria is avoidance of known triggering agents, judicious use of oral corticosteroids, and treatment with long-acting second-generation antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory leukotriene antagonists. Consultation for investigative therapy may be necessary if symptoms continue despite a stepwise approach to diagnosis and therapy.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — oral corticosteroids — In severe cases oral corticosteroids might be necessary, and in patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course might be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing a treatment plan; a short course can be considered if symptoms are severe or not resolving with antihistamines. A randomized controlled study in adults showed that adding oral corticosteroids to antihistamines decreased time to resolution of acute urticaria symptoms in an emergency department setting, and a small study in adults and children showed more rapid resolution with oral corticosteroids than with antihistamines; however, these findings are not sufficient to warrant routine use of oral corticosteroids rather than antihistamines. Use of oral corticosteroids for acute urticaria/angioedema is common in an adult emergency department setting.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) treatment structure — The treatment of HAE can be classified into 2 approaches: treatment of acute attacks and prophylactic treatment (short-term and long-term). All patients with HAE, irrespective of their past history, are at risk for severe angioedema attacks, and patients with HAE should have an established plan in place regarding how to respond to a severe attack. Historical surveys suggest a mortality rate in patients with HAE caused by laryngeal angioedema of approximately 30% or higher.

### Current and prospective targets of pharmacologic treatment of hereditary angioedema types 1 and 2 [^2abf67b2]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease that causes episodic attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal edema, which can be painful, incapacitating, and potentially fatal. These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema.

### C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH-nf) for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks… [^0e43f6cc]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Study Overview Randomized subjects treated for a qualifying attack were eligible to receive rescue dosing with 1, 000 U of C1INH-nf if they did not achieve beginning of substantial relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours after initial treatment with blinded study drug, or if at any time the attack progressed to include airway compromise. A second 1, 000 U rescue dose was permitted 60 minutes after the initial rescue dose, if necessary. The study design also allowed for administration of open-label C1INH-nf for laryngeal angioedema attacks, which were non-randomizable events due to the presence of or potential for airway compromise. In addition, subjects were eligible to receive open-label C1INH-nf prior to emergency surgical procedures. A total of 83 subjects were enrolled in the study.

Seventy-one subjects experienced qualifying attacks and were randomized to blinded study drug; only the 71 randomized subjects were analyzed for efficacy. An additional 12 subjects were never randomized but received open-label C1INH-nf for treatment of laryngeal angioedema and/or prior to emergency surgical procedures. Of the 35 subjects randomized to placebo, 23 also received C1INH-nf. In total, 83 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and were analyzed for safety; 71 subjects were exposed to C1INH-nf and 12 subjects were exposed only to placebo.

Scientific and clinical progress together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence. Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, prophylactic treatment, special considerations for women and children, development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan, and assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^ec97eca3]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step‑care algorithm — treatment proceeds from Step 1 to Step 4 with defined actions and general principles. Step 1 is monotherapy with a second‑generation antihistamine with avoidance of triggers (e.g. NSAIDs) and relevant physical factors if physical urticaria/angioedema syndrome is present. Step 2 includes dose advancement of the second‑generation antihistamine used in Step 1, adding another second‑generation antihistamine, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and adding a first‑generation antihistamine to be taken at bedtime. Step 3 is dose advancement of a potent antihistamine (e.g., hydroxyzine or doxepin) as tolerated. Step 4 adds an alternative agent such as omalizumab or cyclosporine, with other anti‑inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, or biologics as options. The figure further states to begin treatment at the step appropriate for the patient's level of severity and previous treatment history, that at each level of the step‑approach medication(s) should be assessed for patient tolerance and efficacy, and that step‑down in treatment is appropriate at any step once consistent control of urticaria/angioedema is achieved.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^270561e3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

It is important to be aware of HAE as a cause of recurrent swelling in the absence of urticaria. The fact that 25% of patients do not have a family history is not an impediment to diagnosis because a C4 level and C1 inhibitor determination by protein and by function is diagnostic and has the potential to decrease the unnecessary lag time between clinical presentation and the initiation of appropriate therapy.

Hereditary angioedema cannot be cured, but effective treatments can reduce disease burden and improve QoL in children with HAE. Initial clinical symptoms of HAE typically occur in childhood. Early recognition by all health care professionals, particularly those caring for pediatric patients, reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality as well as unnecessary interventions. Alternative modalities, such as music therapy and other complementary therapies, can supplement medical management and improve a pediatric patient's treatment experience by facilitating administration and reducing the child's stress, anxiety, pain perception, and fear, and can relieve parental concerns about multiple injections. All these benefits contribute to an increased QoL for children with HAE.

Multiple therapies are available that can abort acute episodes of angioedema and therapy that can be administered regularly as prophylaxis to prevent them. These can be life-saving given the known mortality statistics when this disorder is untreated.

### Canadian physician survey on the medical management of hereditary angioedema [^87650291]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease that has significant morbidity and may be potentially fatal because of airway obstruction.

Objective

To determine practice patterns in physicians treating HAE.

Methods

A survey was designed to determine HAE practice patterns among Canadian physicians. These physicians were identified by sending the survey to members of 3 physician organizations (Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Network, Canadian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, and Canadian Hematology Society).

Results

Thirty-six physicians responded to the survey. Thirty-four physicians were included in the analysis. Most referrals to HAE-treating physicians were from family and emergency department physicians. The most common sites of swelling reported by patients to physicians were facial, peripheral, and abdominal. A mean of 53.9% of patients with type 1 and 2 HAE and 53.4% of patients with HAE with normal C1 esterase inhibitor were undergoing long-term prophylaxis. A mean of 41.9%, 19.4%, and 93.5% of respondents had some patients taking danazol, tranexamic acid, and C1-esterase inhibitor, respectively. Most physicians believed that severity and frequency of attacks were the most important determinants in deciding when to use prophylaxis. A mean of 88.2% of physicians used C1-esterase inhibitor to treat acute attacks and 79.4% used icatibant. All respondents were aware of HAE guidelines.

Conclusion

Physicians are using guidelines to support their practice and using agents suggested by guidelines with confidence. C1 inhibitor is being used widely for prophylaxis and treatment of acute attacks along with icatibant. However, certain special patient populations may require additional focus in future guidelines.

### Efficacy of treatment of non-hereditary angioedema [^e89fe416]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

We opted for a broad overview of the level of evidence of treatment options when performing this systematic review. This was deemed appropriate with regard to the research question and the therapeutic problems physicians face in daily practice. The results may be an overestimation since case reports generally represent one or few patients with positive effects of treatment, and only few cases without response are available possibly due to underreporting. Due to the use of different outcome measures, such as percentage of patients with response or the time to response, it was difficult to compare the results of the studies. Additionally, we found there to be a low level of prior research evidence. Fortunately, in the last couple of years, more extensive research has been published, allowing for the inclusion of several RCTs in this review. Still, our results illustrate the need for further research in these patient groups, including prospective cohort studies and controlled studies. The lack of available guidelines underlines this further. Not included in this review but worthy of mention is the fact that it is known that AE is known to have a detrimental effect on quality of life (QoL). While the impact on the QoL was not a part of this review, it is striking that this aspect was not addressed in many of the included studies. Disease-specific questionnaires have been developed for AE patients, both with regard to disease activity and QoL, and we consider QoL an important additional outcome measure both in acute attacks and prophylactic setting studies.

### C1 inhibitor deficiency: 2014 United Kingdom consensus document [^867b7f74]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (C1 inhibitor deficiency) is a rare disorder that may be genetic (hereditary angioedema, HAE)or less commonly acquired (acquired angioedema, AAE). The disease has an estimated prevalence of 1: 50 000; any ethnic group may be affected, and many cases are undiagnosed–. C1 inhibitor deficiency manifests with episodic attacks of bradykinin-mediated localized subcutaneous and/or submucosal swellings, with a predilection for the face, extremities, gut, genitals, oropharynx and upper respiratory tract. Abdominal attacks are extremely painful and disruptive, while laryngeal swelling is life-threatening and accounts for the very significant lifetime mortality reported from historical data–.

The evidence base for disease management has expanded significantly since the first UK consensus document was published in 2005. For acute therapy, extensive data are now available for two new drugs that target the bradykinin pathway–, for two established plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement products–and for a novel recombinant C1 inhibitor concentrate product–. Further evidence supports the use of home therapy for acute attacks, an approach with clear benefits for patients and the wider health economy–. The effectiveness of regular C1 inhibitor concentrate injections for long-term prophylaxis is now established more firmly, presenting an alternative to attenuated androgens for selected patients. In parallel with these advances in medical management, focused research efforts have revolutionized our understanding of the impact of C1 inhibitor deficiency on the physical, emotional and economic health of patients and their families. thus informing the application of this improved evidence base.

### The spectrum and treatment of angioedema [^10f9f864]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Angioedema manifests as episodes of localized swelling in the dermis and submucosa. The key to successful management is detection and avoidance of triggers, early recognition of attacks, and aggressive airway management when warranted. Review of a patient's medication list may identify drugs that include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers as the cause. Initial treatment in a patient presenting with most forms of angioedema includes antihistamines and glucocorticoids if required. Epinephrine should be administered if there is concern for laryngeal edema. Patients who have a known history of hereditary angioedema should receive C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^92684d8e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute HAE on-demand pharmacotherapy and airway management — There are currently 3 medications approved in the United States for the treatment of acute attacks of angioedema: plasma-derived C1INH, the B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant, and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, and on-demand treatment is most effective when administered as early as possible in an attack. Standard angioedema treatment modalities, such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, or antihistamines, do not have a significant effect on swelling; fresh frozen plasma can sometimes cause a sudden worsening and carries the inherent risk of viral transmission, and attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytic agents are not effective; the use of one of the newer specific medicines is preferred. If specific effective on-demand medication is not available, symptomatic care can include narcotic medications for abdominal pain, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and aggressive hydration; out-of-hospital use of potent narcotics, such as fentanyl patches or oxycodone, should be avoided. Management of oropharyngeal and laryngeal attacks is focused on maintaining airway patency; all such patients should be observed in a medical facility that can perform intubation or tracheostomy and should be closely monitored for change in voice, loss of ability to swallow, and difficulty breathing.

### Classification and treatment of angioedema without wheals: a Spanish Delphi consensus [^804721bb]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

General Considerations for the Treatment of Angioedema

The eight proposed items were agreed in the first round (ESM Table S4). Item 38, which stated that patients with recurrent angioedema with at least one episode per month, regardless of the mechanism, should be given preventive treatment, obtained the lowest agreement (69.4% agreement). The panelists provided various arguments. One of the most recurrent was that preventive treatment depends on the angioedema location, quality of life, and intensity of the flare-ups. It was also mentioned that some patients with this condition prefer on-demand treatment.

Another controversial issue was item 42, which stated that response to acute treatment is defined as no progression of angioedema within 2 h, or complete disappearance of angioedema in < 12 h (75% agreement). The panelists argued that in some cases, complete resolution within 12 h may be uncertain, even if response has been obtained. Furthermore, some of the panelists said that some episodes of mast cell-mediated angioedema may resolve spontaneously within 12–24 h and that failure to progress may be because the peak of the episode had been reached before treatment was administered.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — management of orolingual angioedema associated with IV alteplase prioritizes airway protection, cessation of alteplase and ACE inhibitors, and staged medications. Maintain airway; endotracheal intubation may not be necessary if edema is limited to anterior tongue and lips, but edema involving the larynx, palate, floor of mouth, or oropharynx with rapid progression (within 30 min) poses higher risk of requiring intubation; awake fiberoptic intubation is optimal, with nasal-tracheal intubation carrying epistaxis risk after IV alteplase and cricothyroidotomy rarely needed and also problematic after IV alteplase. Discontinue IV alteplase infusion and hold ACE inhibitors. Administer IV methylprednisolone 125 mg, IV diphenhydramine 50 mg, and ranitidine 50 mg IV or famotidine 20 mg IV. If angioedema progresses, administer epinephrine (0.1%) 0.3 mL subcutaneously or by nebulizer 0.5 mL. For refractory cases, icatibant 3 mL (30 mg) subcutaneously with the option for an additional 30 mg at intervals of 6 h not to exceed 3 injections in 24 h, or plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor 20 IU/kg, has been successfully used in hereditary angioedema and ACE inhibitor-related angioedema; provide supportive care.

### Mitigating disparity in health-care resources between countries for management of hereditary angioedema [^5479d422]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Other low-income countries are likely to face similar challenges and, in many countries, there are no immunologists or HAE specialists [HAE International (HAEi), personal communication]. Thus, wider physician recognition of HAE symptoms and clinical characteristics as well as access to pragmatic diagnostic pathways are urgently required in these countries.

We propose Box 1.

Box 1 Proposal for a Wider Physician Recognition of HAE Symptoms and Clinical Characteristics as Well as Access to Pragmatic Diagnostic Pathways

Treatment of Acute Attacks

Guidelines state that all attacks should be treated with C1-INH, icatibant or ecallantide and should be treated as early as possible, in order to minimize their duration and severity. Upper airway edema should be treated as a medical emergency. All patients should carry an acute attack treatment on their person and be trained on self-administration (with the exception of ecallantide).

The World Allergy Organization (WAO) guideline and emergency department (ED) guidelines emphasizes the need to consider early intubation or tracheotomy in the case of upper airway angioedema. Intubation or tracheotomy is rarely needed where first-line treatments are available but is likely to be of great importance where this is not the case. Guidelines also suggest that plasma may be used if first-line treatments are not available, depending on local availability and safety.

India Experience

Management of HAE in India is a daunting task for patients, families and treating physicians. Most patients have to self-support the cost of therapy for management of most diseases, including HAE. There is no universal health insurance, and only a few patients get financial support from their state or central government.

First-line treatments (C1-INH replacement, ecallantide and icatibant) are not available. These drugs may be imported from other countries and may be used on a compassionate basis for individual patients. However, the cost is prohibitively expensive for almost all patients. Options for acute treatment are limited to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and attenuated androgens which are often used despite lack of scientific evidence for their efficacy in acute treatment.

### Mitigating disparity in health-care resources between countries for management of hereditary angioedema [^65492cd9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an uncommon primary immunodeficiency disease characterized clinically by recurrent episodes of skin and mucosal edema. C1-INH deficiency leading to dysregulated bradykinin production is the most common cause. HAE is a chronic disorder and may occasionally lead to mortality due to laryngeal edema. Mortality in patients with HAE (caused by laryngeal edema) was approximately 30% in the past. However, with the availability and access to better treatment modalities for HAE, mortality has been significantly reduced, at least in high-income countries. C1-INH replacement therapy given subcutaneously or intravenously as long-term prophylaxis or intravenously to treat an acute episode is a highly effective and commonly used therapy. In addition, several other medications have been approved and are recommended for management of patients with HAE. These include icatibant and ecallantide for acute attacks and lanadelumab for prophylaxis. Because of the availability and access to these medications in most developed countries, mortality due to HAE has been significantly reduced. However, the mortality in undiagnosed patients has been found to be much higher as compared with diagnosed patients. As there is as yet no permanent cure for this disease, patients continue to experience impaired quality of life. However, quality of life and socioeconomic function appear to be improving thanks to better access to modern treatments.

In contrast, there are limited options for the management of HAE in most developing and low-income countries and often none of the first-line treatments are available. Epidemiological data on HAE is also not available from these countries. Patients with HAE in these countries are frequently managed prophylactically using attenuated androgens or tranexamic acid and for short-term prophylaxis and acute "on-demand" therapy with attenuated androgens and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), respectively. Thus, in these countries, it is not uncommon to see avoidable HAE-related mortality and increased morbidity.

In this review, we attempt to highlight the disparities in health-care resources for management of patients with HAE amongst different countries. We also suggest pragmatic solutions for improving care in lower-income countries where access to first-line treatments are currently not available.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^48a8a82a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema (DPUA) management — Management differs from other types of chronic urticaria/angioedema and is often very difficult to treat; additional pharmacotherapeutic treatment is frequently required with avoidance measures, and conventional antihistamine dosing frequently lacks efficacy. Patients should be made aware of pressure or trauma triggers and avoidance is a critical element. Antihistamines at conventional doses might be efficacious for chronic urticaria but are frequently ineffective for prevention of angioedema provoked by pressure; advancing doses beyond FDA‑approved levels might be associated with greater efficacy, including a double‑blind study of cetirizine at a dose of 30 mg/d. A short course of systemic corticosteroids might be required for ongoing episodes, although long‑term systemic corticosteroid treatment is not generally regarded as favorable. Reports on nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are mixed; no benefit was observed in a double‑blind trial of 25 mg of indomethacin 3 times daily, and COX‑1–inhibiting drugs can provoke a flare in aspirin‑exacerbated urticaria/angioedema, so prescribing aspirin or aspirin‑like drugs should be approached with caution. Uncontrolled reports describe salutary effects from agents including montelukast, sulfasalazine, chloroquine, dapsone, intravenous gamma globulin, sulindac, acitretin, and anti–TNF‑α, but randomized controlled trials are required to substantiate their utility.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^0a6451f2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute attack care — symptomatic and airway management: Summary Statement 17 states, "Management of HAE attacks can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of body swelling. (C)". If fresh frozen plasma is used for an acute attack, "it is recommended that he or she be prepared to deal with a paradoxical exacerbation of symptoms", and "the only indication for use of fresh frozen plasma for acute HAE attacks will be if the more effective specific therapy is not readily available". For abdominal attacks, "Moderate and severe abdominal attacks frequently require symptomatic treatment. Patients often require narcotic medications for control of pain and antiemetics for control of nausea and vomiting. Because third-space sequestration of fluid is typically a problem during abdominal attacks, aggressive hydration is usually required". Because "Narcotic addiction is a risk for patients with HAE who experience frequent attacks", "out-of-hospital use of potent narcotics, such as fentanyl patches or oxycodone, is a serious concern in these patients and should be avoided". For oropharyngeal/laryngeal attacks, "The management of oropharyngeal and laryngeal attacks is primarily focused on maintaining the patency of the airway. All patients experiencing oropharyngeal or laryngeal attacks should be observed in a medical facility that can perform intubation or tracheostomy should it become necessary". Such patients "should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of impending airway closure, including change in voice, loss of the ability to swallow, and difficulty breathing", and "the observation period should be individualized". During evaluation, "It is generally advisable not to directly visualize the airway because the trauma of the procedure can worsen the angioedema", and "If the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of impending airway closure, elective intubation should be considered". "Immediate availability of backup tracheostomy is necessary in case the intubation is not successful".
