## Question

What is the role of ammonia levels in the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of ammonia levels in the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, or pediatric acute liver failure. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about when to measure ammonia and how to interpret results. Next, I will examine the diagnostic value and limitations of ammonia, including pre-analytical pitfalls. After that, I should review special scenarios like acute liver failure and pediatrics where thresholds matter. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and confirm the bottom line with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the role of ammonia differs substantially across settings. In chronic liver disease with suspected overt hepatic encephalopathy, guidelines emphasize that diagnosis is clinical and exclusionary, whereas in acute liver failure and pediatric acute liver failure, ammonia levels carry prognostic and management implications and should be measured urgently, so I need to keep those distinctions front and center as I reason through this [^111UjLva] [^114Y9SQc] [^115SMrfP] [^112Txfat] [^115ynb5t].

> Next, I should review what the most authoritative guidelines say. Wait, let me verify the 2022 EASL guidance first. EASL recommends obtaining serum ammonia in patients with delirium or encephalopathy and liver disease, but with the key caveat that a normal value should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, which means ammonia is supportive rather than definitive in chronic disease contexts [^1159UJym]. I should also confirm the 2014 AASLD/EASL position, which states that increased blood ammonia alone does not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in chronic liver disease, and that a normal ammonia level in a patient with overt encephalopathy should trigger diagnostic reevaluation for alternative causes, reinforcing the same principle [^116fpXmX] [^1127WV7v] [^114zUApH]. Hold on, I should verify the 2024 AASLD acute-on-chronic liver failure guidance as well; it advises against routine ammonia testing in cirrhosis with altered mental status and notes that a low ammonia in coma or confusion should steer clinicians toward non-HE etiologies, which aligns with a more restrictive use of ammonia in chronic settings [^115KhUMC].

> I will now examine the diagnostic value and limitations so I do not overinterpret a single number. Let me think about the core principle: overt hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, graded by West Haven criteria and supported by the Glasgow Coma Scale in severe cases, and no laboratory test, including ammonia, establishes the diagnosis by itself in chronic liver disease [^114Y9SQc] [^115fuAbm] [^115Ey64Y]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while ammonia is mechanistically implicated and often elevated, its correlation with severity is inconsistent in chronic disease, so a high ammonia supports but does not confirm hepatic encephalopathy, and a normal ammonia should prompt a search for alternative causes such as sepsis, medications, alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte disturbances, or structural brain disease [^113BQ3jf] [^113sHnmu] [^114yfQW5].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture is acute liver failure or pediatric acute liver failure. I should double-check the thresholds that matter there. In acute liver failure, arterial ammonia above about 100–150 μmol/L is associated with intracranial hypertension risk, and levels above 200 μmol/L predict herniation; in this context, ammonia is not diagnostic of encephalopathy per se but is prognostic and guides aggressive management and transplant referral, so I need to ensure timely measurement and trending in these patients [^116uG6Ln] [^112Txfat] [^115SMrfP]. In pediatric acute liver failure, admission ammonia above 100 μmol/L independently predicts high-grade encephalopathy, and levels above 200 μmol/L are strongly associated with cerebral herniation; again, this argues for urgent ammonia testing and targeted neuroprotective strategies rather than using ammonia to make the diagnosis of encephalopathy itself [^115ynb5t] [^112uTW1D] [^115rZzKn].

> I need to check pre-analytical and methodologic pitfalls because misinterpretation often stems from poor sampling. Ammonia is volatile and labile; hemolysis, delayed processing, and use of tourniquets can falsely elevate values, and there is method variability across laboratories, so I should confirm proper collection on ice with rapid processing and interpret results in light of the clinical context rather than in isolation [^1127WV7v] [^116sTTtw]. Hold on, I should verify that in pediatrics, venous samples drawn and transported on ice are acceptable substitutes when arterial sampling is impractical, which supports feasibility while still demanding rigorous handling to avoid spurious elevations [^112uTW1D].

> Let me consider special scenarios where ammonia testing is mandatory outside classic hepatic encephalopathy. If a patient presents with unexplained encephalopathy or acute liver failure, I should measure ammonia to evaluate for urea cycle disorders or valproate-induced hyperammonemia, because missing these is consequential and treatment pathways differ; in suspected urea cycle disorders, emergency ammonia with rapid turnaround is recommended, and in valproate toxicity, prompt recognition and drug cessation are critical [^116sTTtw] [^1135Z5ox] [^1132iysu]. I should confirm that in these contexts, ammonia is indeed diagnostic of the underlying metabolic process, even though it remains adjunctive for diagnosing hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease [^116sTTtw] [^116fpXmX].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this at the bedside. In chronic liver disease with suspected overt hepatic encephalopathy, I should grade severity clinically using West Haven criteria and GCS, search for precipitating factors, and treat empirically while excluding mimics; ammonia can be measured selectively, and if it is normal in the face of significant encephalopathy, I must reevaluate for alternative diagnoses rather than anchoring on hepatic encephalopathy [^115fuAbm] [^115Ey64Y] [^117CEL1w] [^111UjLva]. In acute liver failure or pediatric acute liver failure, I should obtain ammonia urgently, trend it, and escalate neurocritical care and transplant evaluation as thresholds rise, recognizing that the number informs prognosis and management rather than confirming the encephalopathy diagnosis itself [^115SMrfP] [^115ynb5t].

> I should confirm the bottom line so there is no ambiguity. In chronic liver disease, ammonia is an adjunct: a clearly elevated level supports the clinical impression of hepatic encephalopathy, but a normal level argues against it and should prompt a search for other causes; ammonia is not diagnostic, not required for diagnosis, and should not be used for staging or prognosis in this setting [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym] [^115KhUMC]. In acute liver failure and pediatric acute liver failure, ammonia is prognostic and time-sensitive, with thresholds linked to intracranial hypertension risk; therefore, it should be measured, trended, and acted upon while still recognizing that the diagnosis of encephalopathy remains clinical and graded by bedside criteria [^112s2YH9] [^115ynb5t] [^112Txfat].

Ammonia levels are **not required** to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in chronic liver disease [^115KhUMC], as diagnosis is clinical and based on exclusion of other causes [^114Y9SQc] [^111UjLva]. Elevated ammonia alone is **nonspecific** and does not confirm HE, while normal ammonia does not exclude it [^1127WV7v]. However, in acute liver failure, **ammonia > 100–150 μmol/L** is a key risk factor for cerebral edema and guides urgent management [^112Txfat] [^115SMrfP]. Routine ammonia testing is not recommended in chronic HE; if measured, interpret with caution due to assay variability and pre-analytical errors [^1127WV7v] [^115KhUMC].

---

## Pathophysiological role of ammonia in HE

Ammonia is a key neurotoxin in HE, produced primarily by gut bacteria and normally cleared by the liver via urea cycle metabolism [^notfound]. In liver failure or portosystemic shunting, **ammonia clearance is impaired**, allowing it to cross the blood–brain barrier and cause astrocyte swelling, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter disturbances that drive HE symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic utility of ammonia levels in HE

### Chronic liver disease (CLD)

- **Clinical diagnosis**: HE in CLD is diagnosed clinically by excluding other causes; ammonia is not required and does not confirm or stage HE [^116fpXmX] [^114Y9SQc].

- **Limited specificity**: Elevated ammonia is common in CLD and correlates poorly with HE severity or prognosis [^116fpXmX] [^1127WV7v].

- **Normal ammonia**: A normal ammonia level in suspected HE should prompt evaluation for alternative causes, but does not exclude HE [^116fpXmX] [^1127WV7v].

- **Routine testing**: Not recommended due to nonspecificity and limited clinical utility [^116fpXmX] [^115KhUMC].

---

### Acute liver failure (ALF)

- **Risk marker**: Ammonia > 100–150 μmol/L is a strong predictor of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension [^112Txfat] [^115SMrfP].

- **Management guide**: Serial ammonia monitoring guides interventions (e.g. hypertonic saline, CRRT) to reduce cerebral edema risk [^112Txfat] [^116uG6Ln].

- **Thresholds**: Levels > 200 μmol/L are associated with herniation and mandate aggressive neurocritical care [^112Txfat] [^115ynb5t].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

| **Clinical context** | **Role of ammonia measurement** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic liver disease | - Not required for diagnosis <br/> - Limited utility | - Do not routinely measure <br/> - Clinical diagnosis [^115KhUMC] [^114Y9SQc] |
| Acute liver failure | - Strong prognostic marker <br/> - Guides management | - Measure serially <br/> - Use to guide therapy [^112Txfat] [^112s2YH9] |
| Minimal/covert HE | - Limited utility <br/> - Not diagnostic | - Not routinely recommended [^115KhUMC] |

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Assay variability**: Different methods yield variable results; pre-analytical errors (e.g. hemolysis, delayed processing) further limit reliability [^1127WV7v] [^116sTTtw].

- **Confounders**: Sepsis, GI bleeding, renal failure, and medications (e.g. valproate) can elevate ammonia irrespective of HE [^1132iysu].

- **Nonlinear correlation**: Ammonia levels do not reliably track HE severity or treatment response in CLD [^116fpXmX] [^116rkSew].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ammonia measurement is beneficial

- **Acute liver failure**: Serial ammonia informs risk of cerebral edema and guides neurocritical interventions [^112Txfat] [^112s2YH9].

- **Pediatric acute liver failure**: Ammonia > 100 μmol/L predicts high-grade HE; > 200 μmol/L predicts herniation and guides urgent therapy [^115ynb5t].

- **Urea cycle disorders**: Ammonia measurement is essential for diagnosis and management of hyperammonemia [^116sTTtw] [^1135Z5ox].

---

## Alternative diagnostic tools and biomarkers

- **Clinical scales**: West Haven criteria and Glasgow Coma Scale are standard for grading HE severity [^115Ey64Y] [^115fuAbm].

- **Psychometric tests**: PHES, CFF, and EEG help detect minimal/covert HE but are not specific for etiology [^111h8UJm] [^113GEUgu].

- **Imaging**: MRI/CT exclude structural lesions; MR spectroscopy and PET are investigational for HE [^114yfQW5].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Ammonia is not required to diagnose HE in chronic liver disease; diagnosis is clinical and exclusionary [^116fpXmX] [^114Y9SQc]. Elevated ammonia supports but does not confirm HE, and normal ammonia does not exclude it [^1127WV7v]. In acute liver failure, **serial ammonia measurement is critical** to assess cerebral edema risk and guide therapy [^112Txfat] [^112s2YH9]. Routine ammonia testing in chronic HE is not recommended; if measured, interpret cautiously due to variability and confounders [^115KhUMC] [^1127WV7v].

Laboratory testing — high blood-ammonia levels alone do not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in HE with chronic liver disease (CLD); if a patient with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE is in question. For ammonia-lowering drugs, repeated ammonia measurements may be helpful to test efficacy, but logistical challenges, specimen type differences, and method variability should be considered when interpreting results.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — diagnostic differentiation from other causes: Because HE shares symptoms with concomitant disorders, differentiating HE from other causes can be difficult, and a normal blood ammonia level in a patient suspected of HE calls for consideration; none of the diagnostic measures used at present has been evaluated for their ability to differentiate HE from other causes; psychometric tests detect functional deficits but cannot differentiate causes; brain imaging results for diagnosing HE are disappointing; nevertheless, brain imaging should be done in every patient with chronic liver disease (CLD) and unexplained alteration of brain function to exclude structural lesions; in rare cases, reversibility by flumazenil may be useful.

Pediatric acute liver failure — ammonia levels and encephalopathy risk note clinically important thresholds and cautions: Ammonia levels of > 100 µmol/L on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade HE, and a level of > 200 µmol/L is strongly associated with cerebral herniation; medical therapy targeting ammonia reduction is often prescribed; lactulose may be favored over rifaximin given its mechanism of action and shorter time to clinical effect, however no definitive data suggests that either impact clinical outcomes; mechanisms driving HE extend beyond ammonia so reliance upon a singular ammonia value to determine the presence of HE should be avoided, with its measurement supporting the clinical assessment at the bedside.

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^113BQ3jf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hepatic encephalopathy:

- **Definition**: HE is a reversible neuropsychiatric abnormality found in patients with chronic liver disease and/or portosystemic shunting.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of HE is multifactorial and involves agents such as ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, manganese deposition in the basal ganglia, and benzodiazepine-like compounds. Fecal microbiota and aromatic amino acids also play a role.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of hospital admission for HE is approximately 30 cases per 100,000 person-years. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the prevalence of HE is up to 20%.
- **Disease course**: HE is associated with clinical manifestations of neuronal dysfunction (delirium, seizures). If untreated, severe HE may result in brain edema, coma, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital mortality of patients with HE is estimated at 14.1–15.6%. Patients with cirrhosis who develop HE have an estimated 1-year survival probability of 42% and 3-year survival probability of 23%.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate [^111iTNaR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

A patient or carrier of these disorders should wear a Medic Alert tag stating the diagnosis. In the event that the patient has a sudden, rapid accumulation of ammonia in the blood, and, therefore, in the brain, leading to unconsciousness, the doctor will be alerted to treat the disease properly.

Periodically, depending upon the severity of a particular patient's urea cycle disorder, it will be necessary to perform blood tests. These include plasma ammonia, plasma amino acid levels, and other more routine blood tests to evaluate nutritional status.

What is sodium phenylbutyrate powder?

Sodium phenylbutyrate powder is a drug that helps to prevent ammonia from accumulating in the blood. Sodium phenylbutyrate powder aids the body in eliminating substances that produce ammonia. However, despite drug treatment, blood ammonia levels may become elevated periodically and there may be episodes of altered brain function in association with these ammonia elevations. Patients who have disease onset as newborns have a high incidence of mental retardation. Medical attention should be obtained as soon as signs appear (see above under "What are urea cycle disorders?"). Sodium phenylbutyrate powder may be used as life-long therapy or as a temporary measure until liver transplantation is performed.

What diet should I or my child follow?

In addition to taking sodium phenylbutyrate powder, it is equally important that a prescribed diet be followed. Because there is great variability in the severity of urea cycle disorders, each patient's diet should be custom designed by a physician and a nutritionist. Because the diet is so important, it is recommended that the prescribed diet be discussed with a nutritionist who is familiar with urea cycle disorders.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl) [^11658bZ1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

A patient or carrier of these disorders should wear a Medic Alert tag stating the diagnosis. In the event that the patient has a sudden, rapid accumulation of ammonia in the blood, and, therefore, in the brain, leading to unconsciousness, the doctor will be alerted to treat the disease properly.

Periodically, depending upon the severity of a particular patient's urea cycle disorder, it will be necessary to perform blood tests. These include plasma ammonia, plasma amino acid levels, and other more routine blood tests to evaluate nutritional status.

What is BUPHENYL?

BUPHENYL is a drug that helps to prevent ammonia from accumulating in the blood. BUPHENYL aids the body in eliminating substances that produce ammonia. However, despite drug treatment, blood ammonia levels may become elevated periodically and there may be episodes of altered brain function in association with these ammonia elevations. Patients who have disease onset as newborns have a high incidence of mental retardation. Medical attention should be obtained as soon as signs appear (see above under " What are urea cycle disorders? "). BUPHENYL may be used as lifelong therapy or as a temporary measure until liver transplantation is performed.

What diet should I or my child follow?

In addition to taking BUPHENYL, it is equally important that a prescribed diet be followed. Because there is great variability in the severity of urea cycle disorders, each patient's diet should be custom designed by a physician and a nutritionist.

Hepatic encephalopathy guideline (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD] and European Association for the Study of the Liver [EASL]) — recommendation grading and scope are defined as follows: the AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelines Subcommittee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup, with minor modifications (Table 1). The classifications and recommendations are based on three categories: the source of evidence levels I through III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate (B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendation classified as strong (1) or weak (2). Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care, and they are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case; specific recommendations are based on relevant published information.

Hepatic encephalopathy management strategy — Patients with higher grades of HE who are at risk or unable to protect their airway need more intensive monitoring and are ideally managed in an intensive care setting, and alternative causes of encephalopathy are not infrequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Controlling precipitating factors in the management of OHE is of paramount importance, because nearly 90% of patients can be treated with just correction of the precipitating factor, and careful attention to this issue is still the cornerstone of HE management.

A patient or carrier of these disorders should wear a Medic Alert tag stating the diagnosis. In the event that the patient has a sudden, rapid accumulation of ammonia in the blood, and, therefore, in the brain, leading to unconsciousness, the doctor will be alerted to treat the disease properly.

Periodically, depending upon the severity of a particular patient's urea cycle disorder, it will be necessary to perform blood tests. These include plasma ammonia, plasma amino acid levels, and other more routine blood tests to evaluate nutritional status.

What is sodium phenylbutyrate tablets?

Sodium phenylbutyrate tablets is a drug that helps to prevent ammonia from accumulating in the blood. Sodium phenylbutyrate tablets aids the body in eliminating substances that produce ammonia. However, despite drug treatment, blood ammonia levels may become elevated periodically and there may be episodes of altered brain function in association with these ammonia elevations. Patients who have disease onset as newborns have a high incidence of mental retardation. Medical attention should be obtained as soon as signs appear (see above under "What are urea cycle disorders?"). Sodium phenylbutyrate tablets may be used as life-long therapy or as a temporary measure until liver transplantation is performed.

What diet should I or my child follow?

In addition to taking sodium phenylbutyrate tablets, it is equally important that a prescribed diet be followed. Because there is great variability in the severity of urea cycle disorders, each patient's diet should be custom designed by a physician and a nutritionist. Because the diet is so important, it is recommended that the prescribed diet be discussed with a nutritionist who is familiar with urea cycle disorders.

Pediatric acute liver failure — intracranial hypertension and neurologic monitoring notes that ammonia level > 200 μmol/L is a known risk factor for mortality, and although an intracranial pressure (ICP) "bolt" is the most sensitive test to detect ICP elevations, it carries bleeding complications noted between 10% and 20%; given limited data and lack of evidence that bolt insertion affects outcomes, placement is often case-specific. Fever can contribute to cerebral hyperemia and can be treated with a cooling blanket to maintain euthermia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is indicated for any myoclonus/seizure-like activity, or sudden mental status deterioration, and hemodynamic support with dopamine or norepinephrine is implemented to assure a cerebral perfusion pressure adequate for age.

Diagnosis and testing for overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) — The diagnosis of OHE is based on a clinical examination and a clinical decision, and clinical scales are used to analyze its severity; specific quantitative tests are only needed in study settings, and the gold standard is the West Haven criteria (WHC). These scales are subjective with limited interobserver reliability, especially for grade 1 HE, whereas disorientation and asterixis have good inter-rater reliability and are used as marker symptoms; in significantly altered consciousness, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is widely employed. OHE remains a diagnosis of exclusion due to many alternative causes of mental status change, and radiological assessment for a patient with altered mental status in HE is warranted.

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) — hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and hyperammonemia: Clinical management includes head elevation and environmental/safety measures, specifically to elevate head to 30°, use a dim and quiet room with no sudden noises or unnecessary chatter, place pads on bed rails to prevent injury from sudden movements or combative behavior, and minimize tracheal suctioning if intubated. Medical management notes that the intraluminal environment favors conversion of ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+) thus decreasing intestinal absorption; rifaximin to alter intestinal microbiome and decrease NH3 production with efficacy comparable to lactulose in adults but very sparse data in children; there are conflicting studies on the efficacy of L-ornithine-L-aspartate in adults, but it has not been tested satisfactorily in children; and consideration of empiric antibiotics and extracorporeal support devices.

Attacks precipitated by intercurrent illness, fasting, and/or a high protein meal — vomiting induced by metabolic disorders often follows a catabolic state induced by acute illness, fasting, or a high protein meal. A symptomatic metabolic disorder constitutes a medical emergency with substantial risks for morbidity and mortality if appropriate treatment is not instituted promptly. If a metabolic disorder is suspected, then blood and urine for testing should be obtained immediately, followed by delivery of 10% dextrose-containing intravenous fluid at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance, and consultation with a metabolic specialist should be considered. In partial urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, ammonia accumulation may present following the ingestion of a high protein meal or with fasting, and a urea cycle disorder is suggested by a plasma ammonia level of ≥ 150 μmol/L when symptomatic.

Hepatic encephalopathy research priorities — research into clinical management should remain in close contact with pathophysiology research, and such collaboration should result in new causal and symptomatic treatment modalities that need and motivate clinical trials. There is a severe and unmet need for controlled clinical trials on treatment effects on all the different forms of HE, and decisive clinical studies are few despite high patient numbers and resource utilization. There are no data on which factors and patients represent the higher costs, creating an insufficient basis for allocating resources and establishing priority policies. Many drugs that were assessed for HE several decades ago were studied following an obsolete standard of care, so any study of treatment for HE should be reassessed or repeated using the current standard of care. It is critical to develop protocols to identify precipitating factors and ACLF.

Table 4. Differential diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — The differential diagnosis should include common disorders altering consciousness and precipitating factors. Examples listed are diabetic metabolic derangements, alcohol intoxication/withdrawal/Wernicke, drugs (benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, opioids), electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia and hypercalcemia), nonconvulsive epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, intracranial bleeding and stroke, severe medical stress, dementia, brain lesions, and obstructive sleep apnea. The recognition of precipitating factors for HE supports the diagnosis, and hyponatremia and sepsis can both produce encephalopathy per se and precipitate HE; in end-stage liver disease, uremic encephalopathy and HE may overlap.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma.

Controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces the blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50%; this is generally paralleled by an improvement in the patients' mental state and by an improvement in EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as that resulting from neomycin therapy. An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, Lactulose has been given for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^112s2YH9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — central nervous system management emphasizes ICU monitoring and airway protection by encephalopathy grade, structured ICP therapies, and careful sodium management. Patients with ALF with grade 2 or higher encephalopathy should be monitored in an ICU setting, and those with advanced grade 3–4 hepatic encephalopathy should undergo endotracheal intubation for airway protection; lactulose should be discontinued in this setting. First-line treatment of increased intracranial pressure includes hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline), hyperventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy, and hyponatremia should be avoided; it is a common practice to target serum sodium 145–150 mmol/L without supporting literature, and where correction is undertaken, it should be accomplished at a slow rate, not exceeding 6–8 mmol/L in 24 hours. General recommendations are for 3% saline as a 250–500 mL bolus or continuous infusion to maintain serum sodium levels below 160 mmol/L. Continuous renal replacement therapy has been shown to effectively lower ammonia levels in ALF, and reduced ammonia has been associated with reduced mortality and increased transplant-free survival at 21 days. Routine ICP monitor placement lacks conclusive evidence and may be considered only in centers with expertise and in highly selected patients; there is no conclusive evidence to recommend routine use of hypothermia to control ICP, and a review concluded it did not improve overall patient survival despite efficacy and a low risk of bleeding. There is also no conclusive evidence to recommend for or against lactulose or rifaximin for encephalopathy treatment in ALF.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) glutamine supplementation — evidence and safety across populations: In ESPEN's published clinical guidelines, use of PN glutamine supplementation "could not be recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal failure, or liver transplant due to insufficient evidence for benefit". Parenteral glutamine "has not been shown to be harmful and there are no absolute contraindications", and "No complications related to PN glutamine supplementation was reported in any of the meta-analyses reviewed for this position paper". In end stage hepatic failure, supplementation "has been reported to cause elevated serum ammonia levels and other liver function tests (LFT); therefore, it could cause or aggravate hepatic encephalopathy so it should be used with caution in these patients". A report adding "free L-glutamine at a dose of 0.285 g/kg" to PN "in 7 stable patients" noted a bilirubin rise described as "a minimal elevation (0.8 to 1.4 mg/dL)" with enzyme increases including AST "(10 times normal)", ALT "(2 to 4 times normal)", and LDH "(about 1.5 times normal)", and "All LFT and serum ammonium levels returned to normal within 2 weeks of cessation". Renal concerns remain theoretical — "this has not been shown to be clinically significant and is not a contraindication to PN glutamine supplementation". In severe head injury, a prospective cross-over study found PN glutamine dipeptide supplementation "did not increase plasma or intracerebral glutamate levels" and "There is no contraindication to PN glutamine supplementation in head injury patients".

5.9 Hyperammonemia

Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)].

During the placebo controlled pediatric mania trial, one (1) in twenty (20) adolescents (5%) treated with valproate developed increased plasma ammonia levels compared to no (0) patients treated with placebo.

Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.

5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use

Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.9)].

Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to < 35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.

### Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate [^115ND1kR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Administration

Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% is a concentrated solution and must be diluted before intravenous administration via a central venous catheter. Administration through a peripheral intravenous catheter may cause burns. Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% may not be administered by any other route.

Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% should be administered as a loading dose infusion over 90 to 120 minutes, followed by the same dose repeated as a maintenance infusion administered over 24 hours. Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies, repeat loading doses of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% should not be administered. Maintenance infusions may be continued until elevated plasma ammonia levels have been normalized or the patient can tolerate oral nutrition and medications. An antiemetic may be administered during Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% infusion to aid control of infusion-associated nausea and vomiting. Administration of analogous oral drugs, such as sodium phenylbutyrate, should be terminated prior to Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% infusion.

Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% infusion should be started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperammonemia is made. Treatment of hyperammonemia also requires caloric supplementation and restriction of dietary protein. Non-protein calories should be supplied principally as glucose (8–10 mg/kg/min) with an intravenous fat emulsion added. Attempts should be made to maintain a caloric intake of greater than 80 kcal/kg/day. During and after infusion of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, ongoing monitoring of the following clinical laboratory values is crucial: plasma ammonia, glutamine, quantitative plasma amino acids, blood glucose, electrolytes, venous or arterial blood gases, AST and ALT. On-going monitoring of the following clinical responses is also crucial to assess patient response to treatment: neurological status, Glasgow Coma Scale, tachypnea, CT or MRI scan or fundoscopic evidence of cerebral edema, and/or of gray matter and white matter damage. Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with severe hyperammonemia or who are not responsive to Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In the non-neonatal study patient population treated with Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, dialysis was required in 13% of hyperammonemic episodes. Standard hemodialysis was the most frequently used dialysis method. High levels of ammonia can be reduced quickly when Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% is used with hemodialysis, as the ammonia-scavenging of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% suppresses the production of ammonia from catabolism of endogenous protein and hemodialysis eliminates the ammonia and ammonia conjugates.

This calculator is applicable to patients with both acute and chronic liver disease who present with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, such as confusion, altered level of consciousness, and neuromuscular dysfunction.

The clinical utility of the West-Haven Criteria lies in its ability to grade the severity of hepatic encephalopathy on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 4 indicating coma. This grading system helps clinicians to monitor disease progression, guide treatment decisions, and assess prognosis.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the West-Haven Criteria. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is based on clinical observation and does not take into account laboratory parameters or imaging findings. Therefore, it may not be suitable for patients with atypical presentations or those with other conditions that can mimic the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy.

The West-Haven criteria calculator evaluates the severity of hepatic encephalopathy based on the user's assessment of consciousness, intellectual function, and behavior. The user selects one of four options that best describes the patient's condition. Each option corresponds to a specific grade of hepatic encephalopathy, ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 4, with escalating severity.

The computation proceeds by using the input selection to identify and assign a severity grade as follows:

1. "Changes in behavior with minimal change in level of consciousness" equates to Grade 1.
2. "Gross disorientation, drowsiness, possibly asterixis, inappropriate behavior" corresponds to Grade 2.
3. "Marked confusion, incoherent speech, sleeping most of the time but arousable to vocal stimuli" is classified as Grade 3.
4. "Comatose, unresponsive to pain; decorticate or decerebrate posturing" is considered Grade 4.

The calculator's logic identifies the selected input option and assigns the appropriate grade, which is then returned as the result. If no valid input is selected, the output will indicate the need for a complete input selection.

The determination process can be structured as follows:

| **Assessment option** | **Assigned grade** |
|-|-|
| Changes in behavior with minimal change in level of consciousness | Grade 1 |
| Gross disorientation, drowsiness, possibly asterixis, inappropriate behavior | Grade 2 |
| Marked confusion, incoherent speech, sleeping most of the time but arousable to vocal stimuli | Grade 3 |
| Comatose, unresponsive to pain; decorticate or decerebrate posturing | Grade 4 |

After evaluating the input against these criteria, the calculator outputs the corresponding grade, indicating the severity level of hepatic encephalopathy as assessed by the user's description of symptoms.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

OLPRUVA treatment should be supervised by a healthcare provider experienced in the treatment of urea cycle disorders.

The recommended dosage of OLPRUVA for patients with urea cycle disorders is 9.9–13 g/m2/day orally. Divide the calculated total daily dose into three to six doses. Administer as three to six divided doses and take with food.

Round each individual dose of OLPRUVA to the nearest available dosage strength. The maximum dosage is 20 grams per day. Combine OLPRUVA with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, amino acid supplementation (e.g., essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, and protein-free calorie supplements).

If a dose is missed, take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day.

2.2 Dosage Administration and Monitoring

Monitor plasma ammonia levels to determine the need for dosage adjustment. Adjust the OLPRUVA dosage to maintain the plasma ammonia level within the normal range for the patient's age, taking into consideration their clinical condition (e.g., nutritional requirements, protein intake, growth parameters, etc.).

Monitor patients for potential neurotoxicity and obtain measurements of plasma phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6)]. If neurologic symptoms (e.g., vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, or confusion) are present in the absence of high ammonia levels or other incurrent illnesses, consider reducing the dose of OLPRUVA.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

For patients with hepatic impairment, start at the lower end of the recommended dosing range and maintain patients on the lowest dose necessary to control plasma ammonia levels [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

2.4 Preparation and Administration Instructions

For oral administration only. Do not administer via gastrostomy or nasogastric tubes.

Pour the entire contents of the Mix-Aid packet into approximately 4 ounces of water in a cup and stir, forming a suspension.
Pour the entire contents of the OLPRUVA packet(s) into the suspension and stir.
Drink the entire suspension within 5 minutes after stirring to minimize dissolution of coating. After 30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded.
Pour another 4 ounces of water into the cup and drink to make sure that any OLPRUVA remaining in the cup is consumed.

5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use

Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. It is not known if topiramate monotherapy is associated with hyperammonemia. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.9)].

5.11 Hypothermia

Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to < 35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.

Therapies to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) in acute liver failure (ALF) — hypertonic saline use is conditionally suggested and practical targets are specified: "We suggest using hypertonic saline in critically ill ALF patients who are at risk of developing intracranial hypertension (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)". Risk factors include "hyperammonemia (> 150 umol/L), high-grade hepatic encephalopathy or evidence of multiple organ failure". In a single-center randomized controlled trial, "Thirty patients with ALF and grade III or IV encephalopathy were randomized. Patients in group 1 (n = 15) received the normal standard of care, patients in group 2 (n = 15) received standard care and hypertonic saline (30%) via infusion to maintain serum sodium levels of 145–155 mmol/L". Monitoring and effects included that "ICP was monitored in all patients with a subdural catheter for up to 72 hours after inclusion. Serum sodium levels became significantly different from the levels observed in the control group at 6 hours. ICP decreased significantly relative to baseline over the first 24 hours in the treatment group but not in the control group". Outcomes reported that "The occurrence rate of intracranial hypertension (ICP > 25 mm Hg or greater) was significantly higher in the control group. Mortality from intracranial hypertension was no different between group (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.13–3.44…)". Practical guidance notes that "Rise in serum sodium levels should be gradual", "3% saline can be used to raise sodium levels", and "Serum sodium levels should be maintained between 145 and 155 mmol/L as dictated by the clinical situation".

### Cysteine hydrochloride [^115oFxKK]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hepatobiliary Disorders

Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients, including neonates, without preexisting liver disease who receive parenteral nutrition, including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic failure. The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients.

Instances of asymptomatic hyperammonemia have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition without overt liver dysfunction. The mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly defined but may involve genetic defects and immature or subclinically impaired liver function [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]

Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants, as it can result in neurocognitive delays. Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia levels during treatment with cysteine hydrochloride injection, USP. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify possible causative and contributory factors, and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.

5.6 Aluminum Toxicity

Cysteine hydrochloride injection, USP contains aluminum that may be toxic.

Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Neonates and preterm infants are particularly at risk for aluminum toxicity because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which also contain aluminum.

Patients with renal impairment including neonates and preterm infants, who receive greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day of parenteral aluminum can accumulate aluminum to levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

Exposure to aluminum from cysteine hydrochloride injection, USP is not more than 0.25 mcg/kg/day when preterm and term neonates are administered the recommended maximum dosage of cysteine hydrochloride injection, USP (22 mg cysteine hydrochloride/g of amino acids and 4 g of amino acids/kg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. When prescribing cysteine hydrochloride injection, USP for use in parenteral nutrition containing other small volume parenteral products, the total daily patient exposure to aluminum from the admixture should be considered and maintained at no more than 5 mcg/kg/day [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.7 Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Monitor fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, ammonia levels, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate (Ammonul) [^1147Qkqv]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

2.2 Administration

AMMONUL is a concentrated solution and must be diluted before intravenous administration via a central venous catheter. Administration through a peripheral intravenous catheter may cause burns. AMMONUL may not be administered by any other route.

AMMONUL should be administered as a loading dose infusion over 90 to 120 minutes, followed by the same dose repeated as a maintenance infusion administered over 24 hours. Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies, repeat loading doses of AMMONUL should not be administered. Maintenance infusions may be continued until elevated plasma ammonia levels have been normalized or the patient can tolerate oral nutrition and medications. An antiemetic may be administered during AMMONUL infusion to aid control of infusion-associated nausea and vomiting. Administration of analogous oral drugs, such as sodium phenylbutyrate, should be terminated prior to AMMONUL infusion.

AMMONUL infusion should be started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperammonemia is made. Treatment of hyperammonemia also requires caloric supplementation and restriction of dietary protein. Non-protein calories should be supplied principally as glucose (8–10 mg/kg/min) with an intravenous fat emulsion added. Attempts should be made to maintain a caloric intake of greater than 80 kcal/kg/day. During and after infusion of AMMONUL, ongoing monitoring of the following clinical laboratory values is crucial: plasma ammonia, glutamine, quantitative plasma amino acids, blood glucose, electrolytes, venous or arterial blood gases, AST and ALT. On-going monitoring of the following clinical responses is also crucial to assess patient response to treatment: neurological status, Glasgow Coma Scale, tachypnea, CT or MRI scan or fundoscopic evidence of cerebral edema, and/or of gray matter and white matter damage. Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with severe hyperammonemia or who are not responsive to AMMONUL administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In the non-neonatal study patient population treated with AMMONUL, dialysis was required in 13% of hyperammonemic episodes. Standard hemodialysis was the most frequently used dialysis method. High levels of ammonia can be reduced quickly when AMMONUL is used with hemodialysis, as the ammonia-scavenging of AMMONUL suppresses the production of ammonia from catabolism of endogenous protein and hemodialysis eliminates the ammonia and ammonia conjugates.

5.7 Hepatobiliary Disorders

Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients without preexisting liver disease who receive parenteral nutrition, including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic failure. The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients.

Increase in blood ammonia levels and hyperammonemia may occur in patients receiving amino acid solutions. In some patients this may indicate hepatic insufficiency or the presence of an inborn error of amino acid metabolism [see Contraindications (4)].

Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia levels. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify possible causative and contributory factors, and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.

5.8 Aluminum Toxicity

CLINIMIX contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. The aluminum contained in CLINIMIX may reach toxic levels with prolonged administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at a greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

5.9 Risk of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease

Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) has been reported in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants, and can present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis. The exact etiology is unknown and is likely multifactorial. If CLINIMIX treated patients develop liver test abnormalities consider discontinuation or dosage reduction.

5.10 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload

Patients with abnormal renal function due to pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction, or intrinsic kidney disease may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance. Patients with cardiac insufficiency due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are susceptible to excess fluid accumulation. Use CLINIMIX with caution in patients with cardiac insufficiency or kidney disease. CLINIMIX dosage may require adjustment with specific attention to fluid, protein, and electrolyte content in these patients.

Monitor renal function parameters. Patients developing signs of kidney disease should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in kidney disease in order to determine the appropriate CLINIMIX dosage and other treatment options.

### Glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti) [^1139GhRv]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Active-Controlled, 4-Week, Noninferiority Study (Study 1)

A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, crossover, noninferiority study (Study 1) compared RAVICTI to sodium phenylbutyrate by evaluating ammonia levels in patients with UCDs who had been on sodium phenylbutyrate prior to enrollment for control of their UCD. Patients were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of UCD involving deficiencies of CPS, OTC, or ASS, confirmed via enzymatic, biochemical, or genetic testing. Patients had to have no clinical evidence of hyperammonemia at enrollment and were not allowed to receive drugs known to increase ammonia levels (e.g., valproate), increase protein catabolism (e.g., corticosteroids), or significantly affect renal clearance (e.g., probenecid).

The primary endpoint was the 24-hour AUC (a measure of exposure to ammonia over 24 hours) for venous ammonia on days 14 and 28 when the drugs were expected to be at steady state. Statistical noninferiority would be established if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the geometric means (RAVICTI/sodium phenylbutyrate) for the endpoint was 1.25 or less.

### Introduction to the revised American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases position paper on acute liver failure 2011 [^116YH6gz]. Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) diagnosis and initial evaluation — The diagnosis of ALF hinges on identifying that the patient has an acute insult and is encephalopathic, and imaging in recent years has suggested "cirrhosis", but this is often an overcall by radiology, because a regenerating massively necrotic liver will give the same nodular profile as cirrhosis. It is vital to promptly get viral hepatitis serologies, including A-E as well as autoimmune serologies. For fulminant Wilson's disease, diagnosis can be made most effectively by looking for bilirubin level (very high) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; very low), such that the bilirubin/ALP ratio exceeds 2.0, noting that ceruloplasmin levels can be low in half of all ALF patients. The availability of an assay that measures acetaminophen adducts has improved our clinical recognition of acetaminophen cases when the diagnosis is obscured by patient denial or encephalopathy, and any patient with very high aminotransferases and low bilirubin on admission with ALF very likely has acetaminophen overdose, with the one possible exception being those patients who enter with ischemic injury. Obtaining autoantibodies should be routine and a low threshold for biopsy in patients with indeterminate ALF should be standard, given that autoimmune hepatitis may be the largest category of indeterminate, after unrecognized acetaminophen poisoning.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### Ammonia n-13 (ammonia) [^116fqB6B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ammonia N 13 Injection is a radiolabeled analog of ammonia that is distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. It is extracted from the blood in the coronary capillaries into the myocardial cells where it is metabolized to glutamine N 13 and retained in the cells. The presence of ammonia N 13 and glutamine N 13 in the myocardium allows for PET imaging of the myocardium.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following intravenous injection, ammonia N 13 enters the myocardium through the coronary arteries. The PET technique measures myocardial blood flow based on the assumption of a three-compartmental disposition of intravenous ammonia N 13 in the myocardium. In this model, the value of the rate constant, which represents the delivery of blood to myocardium, and the fraction of ammonia N 13 extracted into the myocardial cells, is a measure of myocardial blood flow. Optimal PET imaging of the myocardium is generally achieved between 10 to 20 minutes after administration.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following intravenous injection, Ammonia N 13 Injection is cleared from the blood with a biologic half-life of about 2.84 minutes (effective half-life of about 2.21 minutes). In the myocardium, its biologic half-life has been estimated to be less than 2 minutes (effective half-life less than 1.67 minutes).

The mass dose of Ammonia N 13 Injection is very small as compared to the normal range of ammonia in the blood (0.72–3.30 mg) in a healthy adult man [see Description (11.1)].

Plasma protein binding of ammonia N 13 or its N 13 metabolites has not been studied.

Ammonia N 13 undergoes a five-enzyme step metabolism in the liver to yield urea N 13 (the main circulating metabolite). It is also metabolized to glutamine N 13 (the main metabolite in tissues) by glutamine synthesis in the skeletal muscles, liver, brain, myocardium, and other organs. Other metabolites of ammonia N 13 include small amounts of N 13 amino acid anions (acidic amino acids) in the forms of glutamate N 13 or aspartate N 13.

Ammonia N 13 is eliminated from the body by urinary excretion mainly as urea N 13.

The pharmacokinetics of Ammonia N 13 Injection have not been studied in renally impaired, hepatically impaired, or pediatric patients.

It is also metabolized to glutamine N 13 (the main metabolite in tissues) by glutamine synthesis in the skeletal muscles, liver, brain, myocardium, and other organs. Other metabolites of ammonia N 13 include small amounts of N 13 amino acid anions (acidic amino acids) in the forms of glutamate N 13 or aspartate N 13.

Ammonia N 13 is eliminated from the body by urinary excretion mainly as urea N 13.

The pharmacokinetics of Ammonia N 13 Injection have not been studied in renally impaired, hepatically impaired, or pediatric patients.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ammonia N 13 Injection is a radiolabeled analog of ammonia that is distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. It is extracted from the blood in the coronary capillaries into the myocardial cells where it is metabolized to glutamine N 13 and retained in the cells. The presence of ammonia N 13 and glutamine N 13 in the myocardium allows for PET imaging of the myocardium.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following intravenous injection, ammonia N 13 enters the myocardium through the coronary arteries. The PET technique measures myocardial blood flow based on the assumption of a three-compartmental disposition of intravenous ammonia N 13 in the myocardium. In this model, the value of the rate constant, which represents the delivery of blood to myocardium, and the fraction of ammonia N 13 extracted into the myocardial cells, is a measure of myocardial blood flow. Optimal PET imaging of the myocardium is generally achieved between 10 to 20 minutes after administration.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following intravenous injection, Ammonia N 13 Injection is cleared from the blood with a biologic half-life of about 2.84 minutes (effective half-life of about 2.21 minutes). In the myocardium, its biologic half-life has been estimated to be less than 2 minutes (effective half-life less than 1.67 minutes).

The mass dose of Ammonia N 13 Injection is very small as compared to the normal range of ammonia in the blood (0.72–3.30 mg) in a healthy adult man [see Description (11.1)]

Plasma protein binding of ammonia N 13 or its N 13 metabolites has not been studied.

Ammonia N 13 undergoes a five-enzyme step metabolism in the liver to yield urea N 13 (the main circulating metabolite).

### Do ammonia levels correlate with hepatic encephalopathy?… [^111L5xag]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver dysfunction is believed to be caused by a failure of the liver to clear toxic products from the stomach. The exact toxins that cause hepatic encephalopathy have not been established, but ammonia may be involved. Many physicians determine ammonia levels to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy and as a guide to treatment. However, studies have shown that the correlation between serum ammonia levels and severity of hepatic encephalopathy is inconsistent. A recent study suggested that the partial pressure of ammonia may correlate more closely with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy than the total plasma ammonia level. Ong and associates evaluated the correlation between plasma ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

They also determined the best of the four types of ammonia measurements for this correlation by comparing arterial total ammonia, venous total ammonia, arterial partial pressure of ammonia, and venous partial pressure of ammonia. Consecutive patients who were admitted to a tertiary care center with the diagnosis of cirrhosis between September 1998 and December 1999 were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was established by biopsy or by signs of portal hypertension such as gastroesophageal varices, previous variceal bleeding, or ascites. Researchers collected clinical and laboratory data at the time of admission. The mental status of the patients was assessed using the West Haven Criteria for grading of mental status. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was established when the patients' mental status was altered and other causes of mental status changes had been excluded.

After diagnosis, fasting arterial and venous blood samples were obtained, and total ammonia and partial pressure of ammonia were determined. All four measurements of ammonia increased with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The arterial total ammonia level had the highest correlation, but it was not statistically significant. Other variables that had a correlation to the severity of hepatic encephalopathy included International Normalized Ratio values, serum creatinine levels, bilirubin levels, and lactulose use. A multivariable ordered logistic regression analysis revealed that only serum ammonia levels and INR values were independently associated with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The authors conclude that venous total ammonia levels do correlate with severity of hepatic encephalopathy and should be adequate in evaluating patients with this condition.

Total arterial ammonia levels and partial pressure of ammonia levels had similar correlation but did not prove to be better markers than venous total ammonia levels.

### Recognition and treatment of alterations in ammonia metabolism… [^111ZxnRE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

As clinical and experimental knowledge of ammonia metabolism increases, the relationship between increased concentrations of ammonia in the blood and the clinical state of "hepatic coma" becomes apparent. The occurrence of significantly increased concentrations of ammonia in the blood of patients with "hepatic coma" and the clearing of the sensorium that follows a reduction of the blood ammonia concentration both indicate that ammonia intoxication is an important factor in the production of hepatic encephalopathies. Further confirmation of an etiologic role of ammonia in "hepatic coma" is to be found in the fact that this syndrome can be reproduced in both experimental animals and human subjects by increasing the blood ammonia, either by the administration of ammonium salts or by the feeding of high-protein diets or urea. In patients who have had vascular shunting procedures done for portal hypertension, or in patients in whom chronic liver disease is associated with gastrointestinal.

### Reye's syndrome… [^1159quXv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Blood ammonia levels were measured in 40 of 43 cases of Reye's syndrome; the blood ammonia level was elevated in 32 cases. The level of blood ammonia was directly related to the level of consciousness and survival. There was no correlation between subsequent changes in the blood ammonia level and the clinical course. We conclude that ammonia intoxication contributes to the encephalopathy of Reye's syndrome, and, probably, that other factors secondary to hepatic dysfunction are also important. In the presence of encephalopathy, biochemical criteria indicating hepatic dysfunction appear to provide a rational, nonhistologic basis for the diagnosis of Reye's syndrome.
