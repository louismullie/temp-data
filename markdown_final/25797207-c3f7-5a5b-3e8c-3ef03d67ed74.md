## Question

Pleurisy prednisone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prednisone should be used for pleurisy and, if so, in what situations, doses, and with what cautions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "pleurisy" actually represents clinically and what the major etiologies are. Then, I should verify the evidence base for prednisone in tuberculous pleurisy, including benefits, harms, and guideline positions. Next, I will examine non-tuberculous causes like parapneumonic effusions, sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, and autoimmune serositis. After that, I need to check dosing patterns and safety monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight exceptions where prednisone may be appropriate despite general cautions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Pleurisy is essentially pleuritic chest pain, most often due to pleural inflammation from effusion or dry pleurisy, and the etiologies span infectious, malignant, autoimmune, and granulomatous diseases; importantly, prednisone is not a treatment for pleurisy per se but may be used for the underlying inflammatory driver when indicated, so I need to anchor on diagnosis before therapy [^110fc743].

> Now, I will examine tuberculous pleurisy, where the steroid question is most debated. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction of benefit. Cochrane reviews suggest faster resolution of pleural effusion and less residual pleural thickening with adjunctive corticosteroids, but these are low-certainty findings and do not translate into improved long-term lung function or mortality benefit, which are the outcomes that matter most to patients [^410ba46f] [^7b12d311] [^7d40083b]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions. The ATS/CDC/IDSA guideline concludes there is no evidence to support routine adjunctive corticosteroids in tuberculous pleurisy and notes potential harm, particularly in HIV-associated disease, so routine use is not recommended [^f847643c]. I should double-check the HIV signal. In a randomized trial of HIV-associated pleural TB, prednisolone did not improve survival and was associated with increased Kaposi sarcoma, reinforcing caution in this population [^bf85d906].

> Next, I should review non-tuberculous infectious pleurisy, especially parapneumonic effusions. The STOPPE pilot RCT tested dexamethasone in adults with pneumonia-related pleural effusions and found no signal for faster clinical stabilization, fewer drainage procedures, or shorter hospitalization, and hyperglycemia was more common; thus, there is no role for routine corticosteroids in parapneumonic effusions at this time [^b66e4c48] [^e7f41e68]. But wait, what if the effusion is part of a broader immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV-TB co-infection? In that specific scenario, guidelines allow corticosteroids for severe IRIS with pleural effusion, but that is a different pathophysiology and should not be generalized to uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions [^9a31b590] [^759c4690].

> I will now examine sarcoidosis-associated pleural effusion. Let me think about the natural history and treatment response. SAPE is uncommon but steroid-responsive; case series and reviews indicate that prednisone leads to rapid clinical and radiographic improvement, often with short courses, and recurrence is relatively infrequent compared with other sarcoid manifestations, supporting a role for corticosteroids when symptomatic or progressive [^b8c669ba] [^8ede0390] [^545ec8ea]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to isolated pleural disease; yes, even isolated pleural sarcoidosis responds to steroids, though biopsy confirmation is ideal when feasible [^b8c669ba].

> Next, I should review IgG4-related pleural disease. Let me verify the dosing and outcomes. Japanese consensus and contemporary reviews support prednisolone 0.5–0.6 mg/kg/day with taper over months, with high response rates for pleural effusions and thickening; rituximab is a reasonable alternative or steroid-sparing option in relapsing disease, which is important given the high recurrence risk with glucocorticoids alone [^72b931ca] [^f484d1dd]. I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize; IgG4 pleural disease is a distinct entity and should be diagnosed with compatible histology and immunostaining when possible before committing to long-term immunosuppression [^f484d1dd].

> For autoimmune serositis, such as lupus pleuritis, I should confirm the stepwise approach. Current rheumatology guidance favors NSAIDs and colchicine as first-line for mild disease, with a low threshold to escalate to glucocorticoids for moderate to severe or refractory cases; prednisone is appropriate when serositis is part of a systemic lupus flare or when NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, with attention to tapering and steroid-sparing strategies to minimize exposure [^35a72ac3]. Let me reconsider whether there is a specific prednisone dose endorsed; the ACR guidance emphasizes escalation rather than a fixed dose, so clinical judgment and severity-based dosing are key here [^35a72ac3].

> I should confirm dosing patterns used across conditions to inform practical prescribing. In tuberculous pleurisy trials, typical regimens used prednisone or prednisolone around 0.75–1 mg/kg/day for 6–12 weeks with taper, but again, this is not a recommendation for routine use given the lack of hard outcomes benefit and potential harms; rather, it illustrates the dosing schema studied historically [^fe5ceb6e]. For IRIS with pleural involvement, prednisone 1.25 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks with a 6–12 week taper is suggested in guidelines, reflecting the different inflammatory pathophysiology and the need to balance immune modulation with infection control [^9a31b590] [^759c4690]. For IgG4-related disease, 0.5–0.6 mg/kg/day with a slow taper over months is standard, often with maintenance low-dose therapy to mitigate relapse [^72b931ca]. For sarcoid pleural effusions, shorter courses of 1–2 months are often sufficient given the low recurrence rate in this manifestation [^b8c669ba].

> Safety monitoring is essential whenever prednisone is used. I need to ensure we address infection risk, metabolic effects, and bone health. Hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyspepsia, mood changes, and increased susceptibility to infection are well-described, and prolonged use at or above 20 mg/day warrants Pneumocystis prophylaxis and osteoporosis prevention in many adults; tapering is necessary after more than a week to avoid adrenal insufficiency, and patients should be counseled on early recognition of complications [^91253bb7] [^94f44895]. Hold on, I should verify the TB-specific concern: in HIV-associated pleural TB, the signal for Kaposi sarcoma with prednisolone reinforces the need to avoid routine steroids in that subgroup unless there is a compelling indication like severe IRIS, and even then, careful risk–benefit assessment is required [^bf85d906] [^f847643c].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm the etiology of pleurisy with appropriate diagnostics, because prednisone is never first-line for undifferentiated pleuritic pain and may mask infection or delay definitive therapy. NSAIDs are the initial analgesic and anti-inflammatory for most noninfectious inflammatory pleuritides while the workup proceeds [^e99b995a]. Second, if tuberculous pleurisy is diagnosed, do not add routine prednisone; prioritize standard 6-month antituberculous therapy and reserve steroids only for exceptional scenarios such as severe IRIS with pleural involvement after discussing risks, including potential Kaposi sarcoma in HIV [^cf38c5c0] [^9a31b590] [^f847643c]. Third, for parapneumonic effusions, avoid corticosteroids outside of a trial or a clearly defined IRIS context, as there is no proven benefit and potential harm [^b66e4c48]. Fourth, in sarcoidosis-associated pleural effusion, IgG4-related pleural disease, or lupus serositis, prednisone is reasonable when disease is symptomatic, progressive, or refractory to first-line measures, using condition-appropriate dosing and taper with close follow-up and steroid-sparing plans when indicated [^b8c669ba] [^72b931ca] [^35a72ac3].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Prednisone is not indicated for pleurisy in general and should not be used empirically without a steroid-responsive diagnosis. It may be appropriate as disease-specific therapy in select entities such as sarcoidosis, IgG4-related pleural disease, autoimmune serositis, and occasionally severe IRIS with pleural involvement, but routine use in tuberculous pleurisy or parapneumonic effusions is unsupported and may be harmful, so decisions must be individualized and evidence-aligned [^f847643c] [^b66e4c48] [^b8c669ba] [^72b931ca] [^35a72ac3].

Prednisone is **not routinely recommended** for pleurisy because most cases are viral or idiopathic and resolve with NSAIDs and supportive care [^110fc743] [^e99b995a]. Prednisone is only considered when pleurisy is due to **steroid-responsive conditions** (e.g. lupus, sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease) or when NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective [^35a72ac3] [^b8c669ba] [^72b931ca]. It is **not indicated for tuberculous pleurisy** [^f847643c] or parapneumonic effusions [^b66e4c48], where risks outweigh benefits. If used, typical dosing is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day with a slow taper over 2–4 weeks, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

---

## Indications for prednisone in pleurisy

Prednisone is **not first-line** for pleurisy; it is reserved for specific indications:

- **Autoimmune serositis**: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases causing pleuritis [^35a72ac3].
- **Sarcoidosis**: Pleural involvement responsive to corticosteroids [^b8c669ba].
- **IgG4-related disease**: Pleural effusions or thickening respond to steroids [^72b931ca].
- **NSAID contraindication**: Patients with NSAID intolerance or contraindications may receive steroids as an alternative.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting prednisone use

Evidence is **limited** and condition-specific:

- **SLE serositis**: NSAIDs are first-line; prednisone is added for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^35a72ac3].
- **Sarcoidosis**: Steroids are effective for pleural sarcoidosis, often with rapid improvement [^b8c669ba].
- **IgG4-related disease**: Steroids improve pleural effusions and thickening [^72b931ca].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

When indicated, **typical dosing** is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) for 2–4 weeks, then taper over 2–4 weeks as symptoms resolve. Dosing should be individualized based on response and adverse effects.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Prednisone carries **significant risks**, especially with prolonged use:

- **Infection risk**: Increased susceptibility, including opportunistic infections [^91253bb7].
- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, weight gain, adrenal suppression [^91253bb7].
- **Musculoskeletal**: Osteoporosis, myopathy, avascular necrosis [^91253bb7].
- **Psychiatric**: Mood changes, insomnia, psychosis [^91253bb7].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Peptic ulcer disease, GI bleeding [^91253bb7].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Prednisone is **contraindicated or requires caution** in:

- **Active infection**: Especially untreated bacterial, fungal, or viral infections [^notfound].
- **Systemic fungal infections**: Contraindicated.
- **Live vaccines**: Avoid during therapy.
- **Pregnancy**: Use only if clearly indicated.
- **Diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis**: Use with caution and monitor closely [^notfound].

## Comparison with alternative treatments

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | First-line for most pleurisy | Effective for pain and inflammation | GI bleeding, renal effects |
| Colchicine | Alternative for autoimmune serositis | Effective in some cases | GI upset, myelosuppression |
| Prednisone | Steroid-responsive pleurisy | Rapid symptom control | Significant adverse effects |
| Antibiotics | Bacterial pleurisy | Effective for infection | Resistance, allergies |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **NSAIDs as first-line** for pleurisy [^e99b995a]; prednisone is reserved for steroid-responsive diseases or NSAID intolerance. Routine use in tuberculous pleurisy [^f847643c] or parapneumonic effusions is not recommended [^b66e4c48].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prednisone is **not routine** for pleurisy and should be reserved for specific steroid-responsive etiologies or when NSAIDs are contraindicated. Use the lowest effective dose with a short taper, and monitor for adverse effects. For most cases, NSAIDs and supportive care remain the cornerstone of therapy [^110fc743].

Background

Corticosteroids used in addition to antituberculous therapy have been reported to benefit people with tuberculous pleurisy. However, research findings are inconsistent and raise doubt as to whether such treatment is worthwhile. There is also concern regarding the potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in HIV-positive people.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of adding corticosteroids to drug regimens for tuberculous pleural effusion.

Search Methods

In April 2016, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Current Controlled Trials, and the reference lists of articles identified by the literature search.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared any corticosteroid with no treatment, placebo, or other active treatment (both groups should have received the same antituberculous drug regimen) in people diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data from the included trials, and assessed trial methodological quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We applied the fixed-effect model in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

Six trials with 590 participants met the inclusion criteria, which were conducted in Asia (three trials), Africa (two trials), and Europe (one trial). Two trials were in HIV-negative people, one trial was in HIV-positive people, and three trials did not report HIV status. Corticosteroids may reduce the time to resolution of pleural effusion. Risk of residual pleural effusion on chest X-ray was reduced by 45% at eight weeks (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; 237 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence), and 65% at 24 weeks (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66; 237 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). Compared with control, corticosteroids may reduce the risk of having pleural changes (such as pleural thickening or pleural adhesions), on chest X-ray at the end of follow-up by almost one third (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 393 participants, 5 trials, low certainty evidence), which translates to an absolute risk reduction of 16%. One trial reported deaths in people that were HIV-positive, with no obvious difference between the groups; the trial authors' analysis suggests that the deaths observed in this trial were related to HIV disease rather than pleural TB (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 197 participants, 1 trial). We found limited data on long-term functional respiratory impairment on 187 people in two trials, which reported that average percentage predicted forced vital capacity was similar in the group receiving prednisolone and in the control group (very low certainty evidence). The risk of adverse events that led to discontinuation of the trial drug was higher in people with pleural TB receiving corticosteroids (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.94; 587 participants, 6 trials, low certainty evidence). The trial in HIV-positive people reported on six different HIV-related infections, with no obvious differences. However, cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were only seen in the corticosteroid group (with 6/99 cases in the steroid group compared to 0/98 in the control group) (very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term respiratory function is potentially the most important outcome for assessing the effects of adjunctive treatments for people with pleural TB. However, the information on the impact of pleural TB on long-term respiratory function is unknown and could be eclipsed by other risk factors, such as concurrent pulmonary TB, smoking, and HIV. This probably needs to be quantified to help decide whether further trials of corticosteroids for pleural TB would be worthwhile.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^73450475]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids used in addition to antituberculous therapy have been reported to benefit people with tuberculous pleurisy. However, research findings are inconsistent, raising doubt as to whether such treatment is worthwhile. Concern also exists regarding the potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in HIV-positive people.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of adding corticosteroids to drug regimens for tuberculous pleural effusion.

Search Strategy

In May 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Current Controlled Trials, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any corticosteroid with no treatment, placebo, or other active treatment (both groups should receive the same antituberculous drug regimen) in people diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial methodological quality and extracted data. Data were analysed using relative risks (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The fixed-effect model was applied in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

Six trials with 633 participants met the inclusion criteria; one trial included only HIV-positive people. Compared to control, corticosteroid use was associated with less residual pleural fluid at four weeks (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; 394 participants, 3 trials) and reduced pleural thickening (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94; 309 participants, 4 trials). We found no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on death from any cause (194 participants, 1 trial), respiratory function (191 participants, 2 trials), residual pleural fluid at eight weeks (399 participants, 4 trials), or pleural adhesions (123 participants, 2 trials). Although discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events was more frequent in participants receiving corticosteroids than placebo (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.12 to 6.98; 586 participants, 6 trials), the effects were generally mild. The risk of Kaposi sarcoma may be increased in HIV-positive people receiving corticosteroids (RR 13.00, 95% CI 0.74 to 227.63; 194 participants, 1 trial).

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data to support evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of adjunctive corticosteroids in people with tuberculous pleurisy. Randomized controlled trials that are sufficiently powered to evaluate the effects of corticosteroids on both morbidity and mortality are needed. The effects of corticosteroids on HIV-related complications, such as Kaposi sarcoma, should be assessed in people co-infected with HIV.

Abstract

Background

Corticosteroids used in addition to antituberculous therapy have been reported to benefit people with tuberculous pleurisy. However, research findings are inconsistent and raise doubt as to whether such treatment is worthwhile. There is also concern regarding the potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in HIV‐positive people.

Tuberculous pleurisy — adjunctive corticosteroids show no routine benefit and potential harm: Prednisone/prednisolone did not improve residual pleural thickening or other long-term pleural sequelae, one study noted increased Kaposi sarcoma risk with prednisolone in HIV-associated pleurisy, and there is "no evidence to support the routine use of adjunctive corticosteroids" in tuberculous pleurisy.

Why it is important to do this review

Studies of adjunctive corticosteroids for the treatment of tuberculous pleural effusion show conflicting results. Non‐randomized studies in the pre‐HIV era found that corticosteroids led to more rapid resolution of the effusion and reduced likelihood of residual pleural thickening and pleural adhesions (Menon 1964; Singh 1965). An observational study of 165 HIV‐positive participants with tuberculous pleural effusion found that prednisolone was associated with decreasing rates of lymphadenopathy and cough as well as improved survival (Elliott 1992; Elliott personal communication).

In contrast, a critical appraisal of published studies demonstrated beneficial effects of corticosteroids on acute symptoms, but it found no benefit for chronic endpoints such as fibrosis, irrespective of dose (Dooley 1997). The authors noted that many of the studies lacked rigour and clinical correlations. The previous version of this Cochrane review (Engel 2007), which included six trials and 633 participants, concluded that data were insufficient to support the use of corticosteroids in pleural TB.

In addition to the uncertainty about benefits of corticosteroid therapy, there is concern about potential risks. In immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with HIV, corticosteroids may further constrain the immune system leading to an increased frequency of opportunistic infections and tumours such as Kaposi's sarcoma, a vascular tumour accompanied by numerous unconnected lesions of the skin and associated with human herpes virus‐8 infection (Ensoli 2001). More generally, adverse effects of corticosteroids such as fluid retention and gastrointestinal disturbances have also been documented in people with TB (Anonymous 1983). Other adverse effects associated with corticosteroids include high blood pressure, high blood glucose or exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus, weight gain, increased susceptibility to infection, gastrointestinal bleeding and in long‐term use osteoporosis and changes to the skin and face.

We updated this review with the aim of adding any new evidence that may have been published since the previous search in 2007. For this version, we revised the protocol, and in particular altered the outcomes of interest. This was informed by discussions with expert clinicians which took place during the development of a new guideline on extrapulmonary TB in India, the INDEX‐TB guidelines (INDEX‐TB 2016).

### Corticosteroids for pleural infection: should we STOPPE studying? [^7f7837d3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Without a trend toward benefit from steroids in parapneumonic effusions, does this shut the door on any future trials in this area? We would argue that it should not. As a first-of-its-kind pilot study, its authors should be commended. Interventional pleural studies are inherently difficult, as evidenced by the attrition from screening to randomization owing to patient factors alone. As a pilot study should, it has generated many questions that need addressing before future trials are performed.

A key issue is that of the optimal target population. In an era of large platform trials, overly restrictive inclusion criteria should be avoided. However, the spectrum of parapneumonic effusions is so wide that the fundamental aim of steroid therapy is affected. Are we trying to prevent the development of pleural infection? In that case, we should target only simple parapneumonic effusions at the earliest possible time point, especially given that corticosteroids seem to benefit adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia with or without an effusion. This is a valid approach, but only a minority of simple parapneumonic effusions progress to pleural infection, so the trial size needed to demonstrate a difference would be large, and the potential benefit-to-risk ratio of steroids could be marginal. Alternatively, one could argue for an approach of targeting established cases of pleural infection to augment the inflammation that is driving fluid production and loculation. Such a trial might include patients in whom initial medical management had already been performed, and the potential role of steroids would be to reduce ongoing symptoms, or hospital length of stay, or persistent pleural thickening, all endpoints that were deemed feasible to collect within the STOPPE trial.

Beyond trial design, the choice of steroid, dosing, and route is an important area. The investigators very reasonably chose dexamethasone for its strong antiinflammatory effects with minimal mineralocorticoid effect and long duration of action. However, 8 mg daily in divided doses is a relatively small dose compared with other inflammatory conditions related to infection, such as bacterial meningitis, for which 40 mg daily is administered. The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial demonstrated that just 6 mg daily reduced mortality in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but is currently testing doses of 20 mg daily after promising results from other trials. In addition, the intravenous route might not be necessary, given the bioavailability of oral dexamethasone, which would reduce adverse effects (e.g. phlebitis), costs, and complexity of intravenous administration.

### Corticosteroids for pleural infection: should we STOPPE studying? [^e7f41e68]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, as the first of its kind, the STOPPE trial has shown that it is both safe and feasible to randomize adult patients with parapneumonic effusions to steroids. Future trials are certainly indicated, but careful consideration should be given to their aim. Should we aim to prevent pleural infection development, or instead attempt to dampen inflammation in already established disease to reduce immediate symptom burden and/or improve longer-term outcomes?

Other potential sources of bias

We did not find enough trials that met the inclusion criteria for us to conduct a funnel plot to look for possible publication bias.

Effects of interventions

See: Table 1

Time to resolution of clinical symptoms

Due to the different units of measurement used in the trials, and insufficient reported data, it was not possible to combine the effects in a meta‐analysis for this outcome. We have presented the results from the included trials in Table 6. Qualitatively, corticosteroids appear to be associated with more rapid resolution of symptoms, but we were unable to assess the relative effect of corticosteroids statistically.

How the intervention might work

Therapeutic options for pleural space infections include intravenous antibiotic administration, chest tube drainage, intrapleural administration of a fibrinolytic agent to dissolve fibrous adhesions, thoracotomy to remove fibrinous and infected tissue, and steroid therapy (Chapman 2004).

The theoretical basis for using corticosteroids is that they suppress the delayed type hypersensitivity inflammatory response triggered by the release of tubercular antigens into the pleural space which is believed to be responsible for tuberculous pleurisy. One corticosteroid is prednisone, which is converted in the liver into the active drug, prednisolone. Prednisolone is recommended at a daily dose of about 1 mg/kg gradually reducing after one to two weeks, with a total treatment course sometimes being as long as three months (Lemaistre 1951; Mathur 1960; Morehead 1998; Blumberg 2003).

Corticosteroids have anti‐inflammatory properties, produced mainly via suppression of pro‐inflammatory gene expression and activation of anti‐inflammatory genes (Barnes 2006). While the inflammatory response is necessary to control the infection, excessive inflammation can lead to tissue damage and fibrosis, which could cause long‐term morbidity. Suppression of the inflammatory response in pleural TB could reduce the symptoms and signs associated with the inflammatory process: fever, progression of the pleural effusion, malaise. Corticosteroids could therefore reduce the duration or severity of symptoms in the short term, and also reduce the risk of tissue damage leading to lung impairment in the long term.

Summary of main results

See 'Summary of findings' table 1 (Table 1).

Six trials met the inclusion criteria; we have not included any new trials since the 2007 version of this Cochrane Review (Engel 2007), and we did not find any trials in progress that address this question.

There was a trend towards faster resolution of symptoms, such as fever and chest pain, with corticosteroids across all included trials, but the trials reported insufficient data to produce a meta‐analysis addressing time to resolution of symptoms, and there were variations across studies in terms of which symptoms were reported and who the participants were monitored and assessed.

Corticosteroids probably reduce the time to resolution of pleural effusion.

Corticosteroids may reduce risk of pleural changes on chest X‐ray at the end of treatment by 28% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 393 participants, 5 trials, low certainty evidence). On average, half the participants in the control group had pleural changes at the end of at least six months, giving an estimated absolute risk reduction of 14% with corticosteroids.

There was insufficient data to draw conclusions about the effect of corticosteroids on respiratory function after treatment, and none of the included trials reported on disability after treatment. Only one trial reported on death (Elliott 2004), and the trial authors' analysis suggests that death was related to low CD4+ cell counts, which implied that death was related to severity of HIV disease. Corticosteroids had no effect on all‐cause mortality in this trial (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 197 participants, 1 trial).

Corticosteroids may increase risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.94; 587 participants, 6 trials, low certainty evidence). Commonly reported adverse effects included epigastric pain, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia.

Only one trial included HIV‐positive people and reported on HIV‐associated adverse events (Elliott 2004). While there was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and placebo groups for any of the conditions observed, Kaposi's sarcoma was only observed in the group receiving steroids: 6/99 in the corticosteroid group developed Kaposi's sarcoma compared with 0/98 in the placebo group (RR 12.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 225.40; 197 participants, 1 trial, very low certainty evidence).

Potential biases in the review process

We attempted to limit bias in the review process. Vittoria Lutje, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Information Specialist, conducted the literature searches, and it is unlikely that these searches missed any major trials; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that we missed some small unpublished trials. The funnel plot did not assist with this because there were too few included trials. To limit bias in the trial selection process and data extraction, we independently examined the search results, determined study selection, and extracted data.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

There are relatively few studies and reviews on this topic in the literature. We could find no other systematic reviews that address this question. Chapman 2004, a narrative review of the diagnosis and management of pleural space infection, comments that the role of steroids is uncertain as study findings are conflicting, and do not provide information about the effect of steroids on long‐term lung function and mortality. Another narrative review, Ferreiro 2014, drew similar conclusions, and noted that the conflicting results between studies and the possibility raised by Elliott 2004 that use of corticosteroids in HIV‐positive patients with TB pleurisy may lead to increased risk of Kaposi's sarcoma. Kadhiravan 2010 commented on the previous version of this review (Engel 2007), and noted that while there appears to be an effect of corticosteroids on pleural thickening, the available evidence does not show an effect on lung function.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the use of prednisolone as an adjunct to treatment in HIV-1-associated pleural tuberculosis [^bf85d906]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Active tuberculosis may accelerate progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by promoting viral replication in activated lymphocytes. Glucocorticoids are used in pleural tuberculosis to reduce inflammation-induced pathology, and their use also might reduce progression of HIV by suppressing immune activation. We examined the effect that prednisolone has on survival in HIV-1-associated pleural tuberculosis.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of prednisolone as an adjunct to tuberculosis treatment, in adults with HIV-1-associated pleural tuberculosis. The primary outcome was death. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Results

Of 197 participants, 99 were assigned to the prednisolone group and 98 to the placebo group. The mortality rate was 21 deaths/100 person-years (pyr) in the prednisolone group and 25 deaths/100 pyr in the placebo group (age-, sex-, and initial CD4+ T cell count-adjusted mortality rate ratio, 0.99 [95% confidence interval, 0.62–1.56] [P = 0.95]). Resolution of tuberculosis was faster in the prednisolone group, but recurrence rates were slightly (though not significantly) higher, and use of prednisolone was associated with a significantly higher incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (4.2 cases/100 pyr, compared with 0 cases/100 pyr [P = 0.02]).

Conclusions

In view of the lack of survival benefit and the increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma, the use of prednisolone in HIV-associated tuberculous pleurisy is not recommended.

Quality of the evidence

We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Jüni 2001), and reported the outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table (Table 1).

For time to resolution of pleural effusion, we combined data on residual pleural fluid on chest X‐ray from four trials. As described in the results section, after exploring high unexplained statistical heterogeneity for this outcome, we chose to exclude the two trials that were at high risk of selection bias from the final analysis to avoid a misleading summary estimate of effect. The exclusion of studies from the meta analysis generates uncertainty, and therefore we chose to downgrade by one because of this. We also downgraded for imprecision; the number of participants and events is small, the meta analysis is probably underpowered.

We graded the summary effects estimate for pleural changes at the end of treatment as low certainty evidence, and downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias relating to randomization and allocation methods, and for imprecision relating to the relatively small number of events and participants.

For long‐term functional respiratory impairment, we graded the quality of the evidence as very low. Meta‐analysis was not possible for this outcome due to insufficient reporting of data, and we reported the available data in Table 8. Although two trials reported the mean percentage predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) at the end of treatment (Galarza 1995, Wyser 1996), neither the results per participant nor the variance were reported.

For adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial drug, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low. We downgraded for risk of bias relating to randomization and allocation concealment, and also reporting as some trials did not report on adverse events in detail. Also a few only referred to adverse effects associated with steroids in the steroid group, which raised the concern that adverse events in the control group were not detected or reported.

For adverse events relating to HIV, we graded the estimates of effect relating to two serious, life‐threatening HIV‐related diseases — cryptococcal meningitis and Kaposi's sarcoma — and judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded by two for imprecision caused by the small number of events and participants, and also by one for indirectness as the participants were all from one single‐centre trial and none were on antiretroviral therapy. These estimates of effect may not be applicable to HIV‐positive people in other settings or those taking antiretroviral therapy.

### The use of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of pericardial, pleural and meningeal tuberculosis: do they improve outcome? [^444cc9b9]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity on a global scale. Effective anti-tuberculous chemotherapy has improved outcomes for individuals suffering from tuberculosis, although the disease often results in significant and permanent damage to organs. The use of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment has been studied with a view to demonstrating a reduction in inflammatory events that may improve outcomes for both mortality and morbidity. Cochrane reviews have summarized the evidence for adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of tuberculous pericarditis, meningitis and pleural effusion. These reviews have shown improved mortality for pericarditis and meningitis, but inconclusive effects for pericardial constriction and ongoing neurological disability. Rapid improvements in clinical parameters for pleural effusion were not supported by any lasting improved outcomes for these patients.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^91253bb7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Corticosteroids are hormones produced by the adrenal cortex which have a variety of physiological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, regulation of electrolytes, the stress response and control of inflammation. Corticosteroids induce their anti‐inflammatory effect through the regulation of gene expression in cells, leading to increased expression of genes which inhibit inflammatory pathways, and repression of genes encoding pro‐inflammatory proteins (Barnes 2006). Multiple synthetic forms of these hormones have been produced and are used in the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid derived from cortisol, and prednisone is a pro‐drug that is converted into the active form prednisolone by the liver. Several formulations of each drug are used for different conditions and diseases; in TB pleurisy patients are usually offered them in tablet form.

Corticosteroids have been used in medicine for many decades, and have well‐characterised adverse effect profiles. Adverse effects for medium to long‐term use include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, gastric ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, thinning of the skin, proximal myopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and development of moon face, striae and acne (Cushing's syndrome). The use of synthetic corticosteroids can induce adrenocorticoid insufficiency, and so patients receiving more than one week's treatment must have the dose slowly reduced to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency causing hypotension and hypoglycaemia which can be life‐threatening (BNF 2016).

Selection of studies

The review authors screened the results of the search for potentially relevant studies. We independently applied eligibility criteria and resolved differences in opinion through discussion. Where the abstracts were unclear or if there was any other reason for uncertainty, we obtained the full‐text article before we made a decision on study eligibility, and we contacted the study authors where necessary. We consulted translators when abstracts were unavailable in English. We assessed the full‐text articles of potentially relevant studies and included trials that met the inclusion criteria. We listed studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria and stated the reason for exclusion in a ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table. We constructed a PRISMA diagram to illustrate the study selection process.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (PD and HR) independently extracted data from the included trials on participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, HIV status, antituberculous drug regimen, corticosteroid regimen, and outcome measures using a pre‐piloted data extraction form. One review author (JY) extracted data from Bang 1997 and Lee 1999 as both trial reports were in Korean. We resolved disagreements through discussion and contacted the corresponding trial author in the case of unclear or missing data.

For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the number of participants that experienced the event and the number of participants in each treatment group. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations for each treatment group together with the numbers of participants in each group.

### Emerging concepts in pleural infection [^975202ec]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural infection remains an important pulmonary disease, causing significant morbidity and mortality. There is a resurgence of disease burden despite introduction of antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccines. A revisit of the pathogenesis and update on intervention may improve the care of pleural infection.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have uncovered the prognostic implication of the presence of a pleural effusion in patients with pneumonia. Identifying where the bacteria lives may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Over-exaggerated pleural inflammation may underlie development of parapneumonic effusion as indirect evidence and a randomized study in children raised a role of corticosteroids in parapneumonic pleural effusions, but data are lacking for adults. Optimization of the delivery regimen of intrapleural fibrinolytic and deoxyribonuclease therapy is ongoing.

Summary

The review aims to review the current practice and explore new directions of treatment on pleural infection.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^779c4dab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. In 2014 approximately 9.6 million people newly developed the disease and there were 1.5 million deaths globally (WHO 2015). TB infects the lungs, and is transmitted by droplet spread from coughing people with active pulmonary TB, but it can also spread to other body sites and cause extrapulmonary TB (EPTB).

Description of the condition

Pleural TB is one of the most common forms of EPTB, with an incidence of 3% to 25% of people with TB (Light 2010; Sharma 2004). The incidence is higher in high TB prevalence settings (Jeon 2014). Immune compromise is an important risk factor for all forms of TB, and evidence suggests that pleural TB is more common in people living with HIV (Batungwanayo 1993; Frye 1997; Pozniak 1995; Saks 1992). Pleural TB can be a manifestation of TB disease post‐primary infection, or due to reactivation of latent TB (Light 2010).

Clinically, pleural TB presents as an acute illness consisting of cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath (Morehead 1998), and usually a pleural effusion is demonstrated on chest X‐ray. Pleural TB usually resolves without treatment of any kind, but untreated patients may experience longer duration of the acute symptoms and risk recurrence of active TB at a later point in time (Light 2010). Pleural TB can be complicated by massive effusion leading to respiratory compromise in the short term, and pleural thickening, fibrosis, and pleural adhesions causing impaired respiratory function in the medium‐ to long‐term.

Interventions

We have summarized the antituberculous therapy (ATT) regimens used in the included trials in Table 3, and the corticosteroid regimens used in Table 5.

4
Corticosteroid regimens in included studies

Four trials compared either prednisone or prednisolone with placebo as an adjunct to an established antituberculous regimen containing at least isoniazid and rifampicin (Elliott 2004; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Wyser 1996). Bang 1997 and Lee 1999 did not use any comparative treatment in the control group.

Four trials used weight‐based dosing of corticosteroids; Bang 1997 started at 1.0 mg/kg twice daily, Galarza 1995 started at 1.0 mg/kg/day, and Lee 1988 and Wyser 1996 started at 0.75 mg/kg/day. Elliott 2004 started at 50 mg/day for all participants, and Lee 1999 started at 30 mg four times daily. Lee 1988 and Wyser 1996 tapered the dose of corticosteroid according to the participant's clinical progress; the other included trials either had fixed tapering regimens or did not describe the tapering regimen.

All included trials described performing diagnostic pleural aspiration (thoracocentesis) as part of eligibility screening and diagnosis of pleural TB. Two trials also performed therapeutic thoracocentesis (Galarza 1995; Wyser 1996). In Galarza 1995, pleural fluid was drained in all participants before discharge "until a third of the hemithorax was observed to be occupied in a standard chest radiograph". In Wyser 1996, thoracoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in all participants under general anaesthesia at admission, and chest drains were left in situ for 48 hours following the procedure to drain remaining pleural fluid.

Pleural changes on chest X‐ray at the end of treatment

Five trials reported on chest X‐ray changes to the pleura at the end of treatment (Bang 1997; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Lee 1999; Wyser 1996). The terms 'pleural thickening' and 'pleural adhesions' were used to describe these changes, and in some cases seemed to be used interchangeably. We found that corticosteroids may reduce the risk of having pleural changes on chest X‐ray after at least six months by 28% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92; 393 participants, 5 trials, low certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2).

One trial, Galarza 1995, attempted to quantify the degree of pleural thickening by measuring the maximal pleural thickening in millimetres at 1, 6, and 12 months after enrolment, and reported the mean maximal pleural thickness for each treatment group. The prednisolone group had a mean maximal pleural thickness of 1.77 mm (range 0 to 40 mm), and for the placebo group 2.23 mm (0 to 15 mm), with a P value of more than 0.05.

Wyser 1996 also performed high resolution CT scan of the chest in most participants, and found 17/32 participants in the prednisolone group and 21/35 participants in the placebo group had pleural thickening at the end of treatment using this test (P = 0.52).

None of the included trials looked at the extent of pleural changes on chest X‐ray in terms of area of pleural change.

Change in respiratory function

Two trials with 191 participants measured improvement in respiratory function and found no difference between the groups (Galarza 1995; Wyser 1996). We have summarized the results in Table 8.

7
Pulmonary function at the end of treatment

In Galarza 1995, mean forced vital capacity (FVC) was 95% in both the treatment and control groups at the end of treatment; in Wyser 1996 it was 85% in the corticosteroids group and 80% in the placebo group (P = 0.65). We could not perform a meta‐analysis due to insufficient reported data.

Disability

None of the included trials looked at disability or functional impairment after treatment for TB pleurisy.

### Steroid therapy and outcome of parapneumonic pleural effusions (STOPPE): a pilot randomized clinical trial [^b66e4c48]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Pleural effusion commonly complicates community-acquired pneumonia and is associated with intense pleural inflammation. Whether antiinflammatory treatment with corticosteroids improves outcomes is unknown. Objectives: To assess the effects of corticosteroids in an adult population with pneumonia-related pleural effusion. Methods: The STOPPE (Steroid Therapy and Outcome of Parapneumonic Pleural Effusions) trial was a pilot, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving six Australian centers. Patients with community-acquired pneumonia and pleural effusion were randomized (2:1) to intravenous dexamethasone (4 mg twice daily for 48 h) or placebo and followed for 30 days. Given the diverse effects of corticosteroids, a comprehensive range of clinical, serological, and imaging outcomes were assessed in this pilot trial (ACTRN12618000947202). Measurements and Main Results: Eighty patients were randomized (one withdrawn before treatment) and received dexamethasone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 28). This pilot trial found no preliminary evidence of benefits of dexamethasone in improving time to sustained (> 12 h) normalization of vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, heart, and respiratory rates): median, 41.0 (95% confidence interval, 32.3–54.5) versus 27.8 (15.4–49.5) hours in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.729 [95% confidence interval, 0.453–1.173]; P = 0.193). Similarly, no differences in C-reactive protein or leukocyte counts were observed, except for a higher leukocyte count in the dexamethasone group at Day 3. Pleural drainage procedures were performed in 49.0% of dexamethasone-treated and 42.9% of placebo-treated patients (P = 0.60). Radiographic pleural opacification decreased over time with no consistent intergroup differences. Mean duration of antibiotic therapy (22.4 [SD, 15.4] vs. 20.4 [SD, 13.8] d) and median hospitalization (6.0 [interquartile range, 5.0–10.0] vs. 5.5 [interquartile range, 5.0–8.0] d) were similar between the dexamethasone and placebo groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 25.5% of dexamethasone-treated and 21.4% of placebo-treated patients. Transient hyperglycemia more commonly affected the dexamethasone group (15.6% vs. 7.1%). Conclusions: Systemic corticosteroids showed no preliminary benefits in adults with parapneumonic effusions. Clinical trial registered with www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN12618000947202).

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^4a733553]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Time to resolution of pleural effusion

Five trials reported on time to resolution of pleural effusion (Bang 1997; Elliott 2004; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Lee 1999). We combined data for the number of participants with a residual pleural effusion on chest X‐ray in each treatment group from four trials. Bang 1997, Elliott 2004, and Lee 1988 reported data across three time points (4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks), and Lee 1999 reported data for two time points (8 weeks and 24 weeks). Galarza 1995 presented the mean reabsorption index for each treatment group at four weeks, and so we could not use data from this trial in the meta‐analysis. We have presented the results from each trial in Table 7. Wyser 1996 reported on recurrence of pleural effusion, as all participants had drainage of their pleural effusions at admission to the trial, and reported no recurrences of pleural effusion in either group.

6
Time to resolution of pleural effusion on chest X‐ray

The initial meta‐analysis, which includes data from Bang 1997, Elliott 2004, Lee 1988, and Lee 1999, found substantial statistical heterogeneity at all three time points, and we conducted a subgroup analysis to explore this (Analysis 2.1; Analysis 2.2). When we excluded trials that were at high risk of bias for selection bias (randomization and allocation concealment) from the meta‐analysis, the statistical heterogeneity resolved. In these two trials it is possible that the trial investigators allocated a greater proportion of participants with more severe pleural effusions to the corticosteroid group, believing that corticosteroids would be of benefit to them (Bang 1997; Lee 1999). This would lead to bias towards the null, and a misleading summary effects estimate. For this reason, we excluded the trials that were at high risk of selection bias from the meta‐analysis.

The results showed a reduction in the risk of having residual pleural fluid on chest X‐ray at all three time points in participants treated with corticosteroids: by 36% at four weeks (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84; 237 participants, 2 trials), 45% at eight weeks (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; 237 participants, 2 trials), and 65% at 24 weeks (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66; 237 participants, 2 trials).

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^ad16129d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural TB is thought to be caused by a delayed type (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction following release of mycobacterial antigens into the pleural space (Rossi 1987), as a result of rupture of a subpleural focus of TB infection in the lung (Stead 1955). This explains the tendency towards resolution of the effusion and associated symptoms with or without treatment of the TB infection, and the fact that culture of pleural fluid is nearly always negative for M. tuberculosis. There appears to be a spectrum of disease in pleural TB in terms of the extent of the underlying lung infection, which could be important in terms of patient outcomes and the potential for corticosteroids to be effective (Table 2). A systematic review that includes 18 trials and 3816 participants suggests that corticosteroids probably do not improve mortality rates, sputum smear or culture conversion in people with pulmonary TB (Critchley 2014). One cohort study of people with pleural TB in Spain reported evidence of pulmonary TB infection on chest X‐ray in 20% of 254 participants (Valdés 1998). Pulmonary involvement rose to 86% in another cohort where computed tomography (CT) scanning was used (Kim 2006). Shu 2011 demonstrated that pulmonary involvement (as defined by positive sputum culture and/or chest X‐ray appearances) was an important predictor of mortality in hospitalised pleural TB patients in Korea, and was associated with a longer hospital stay.

Theoretical framework describing differences between isolated tuberculous pleurisy and pulmonary TB with tuberculous pleurisy (pleuro‐pulmonary TB)

Diagnosis of pleural TB can be challenging with traditional microscopy and culture methods being relatively insensitive when used on pleural fluid, and newer modalities such as Xpert® MTB/RIF have similar limitations (Denkinger 2014). Histopathological examination and mycobacterial culture performed on pleural biopsy samples are regarded as more reliable tests, and yielded a diagnosis in 227/248 patients (91%) in one cohort study (Valdés 1998).

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^7d9be7f3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Pericardial tuberculosis — antituberculous therapy and adjunctive corticosteroids: A 6-month regimen is adequate for patients with pericardial tuberculosis. A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with 1400 participants found no major difference in the combined primary endpoint (mortality, cardiac tamponade, or constrictive pericarditis) between adjunctive corticosteroids and placebo; a systematic review similarly did not find a statistically significant benefit in mortality or constrictive pericarditis, although a subgroup analysis suggested benefit in preventing constrictive pericarditis. Therefore, we suggest that adjunctive corticosteroids should not be used routinely in pericardial tuberculosis (Recommendation 7: conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence), while selective use in patients at highest risk for inflammatory complications might be appropriate, including those with large pericardial effusions, high inflammatory cells or markers in pericardial fluid, or early signs of constriction.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (PD and HR, or JY and HR) independently assessed the risk of bias for each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011). We resolved any differences of opinion through discussion with reference to the trial reports, and through discussion with the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Co‐ordinating Editor, Paul Garner. We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps had been taken to reduce the risk of bias across six domains.

Random sequence generation
Allocation concealment
Blinding of participants and personnel
Blinding of outcome assessors
Incomplete outcome data
Selective reporting
Other bias

When assessing risk of bias related to blinding (performance bias or detection bias), we planned to consider the implications of blinding separately for each outcome, as appropriate.

For assessment of bias related to incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), we used the following criteria to assess risk of bias.

Low risk: less than 5% of participants were lost to follow‐up
Unclear risk: between 5 and 10% of participants were lost to follow‐up
High risk: more than 10% of participants were lost to follow‐up

For selective reporting (reporting bias), we used the following criteria to determine the risk of bias.

Low risk: the trial authors stated in the introduction or method sections the outcomes they would look at, and they reported all of them in the results section
Unclear risk: the trial authors did not state in the introduction or method sections the outcomes they would look at
High risk: the trial authors stated the outcomes they would look at but they did not report all of them in the results section

We categorized these judgments as either at low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification if any details were unclear; where our judgement is recorded as 'unclear' we were unable to amend our judgement after we contacted the trial authors. The results of the 'Risk of bias' assessment are displayed in the ' Characteristics of included studies ' tables.

Measures of treatment effect

For dichotomous outcomes, we used relative risk as the measure of treatment effect for analysis. For continuous outcomes we planned to use mean difference, but this was not necessary in the final review draft.

Unit of analysis issues

There were no cluster‐RCTs amongst the included trials, so individual participants were the unit of analysis.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^2ad6d024]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

The six trials included male and female participants, who were mostly HIV‐negative adults. One trial included children over the age of 11 years (Galarza 1995), and one trial included only HIV‐positive adults (Elliott 2004). The trials reflected the fact that pleural TB is more common in adults, but HIV‐positive people are under‐represented in this review, and the results of the pooled estimates may be less applicable to HIV‐positive people. The included trials were all conducted in tertiary hospital settings, in a countries varying from low to high TB burden and HIV prevalence.

The method of diagnosis of pleural TB varied between the included trials (see Table 4), but were representative of diagnostic tests commonly available in high‐ and middle‐income settings. Culture and histopathology are less accessible in low‐income settings, where diagnosis may be based on clinical presentation and X‐ray findings alone.

The antituberculous treatment (ATT) that participants received varied across the included trials, and in some trials the treatment given was significantly different from widely recommended first‐line treatment for drug‐sensitive TB (see Table 3). Most notably, the older trials included either two drugs (Lee 1988), or three drugs (Galarza 1995; Wyser 1996), in their regimens rather than all four currently recommended first‐line drugs in the intensive phase of treatment. Participants were given at least six months of ATT in all trials. This variation in ATT was not associated with statistically significant heterogeneity in any of our analyses. As the more recent trials used regimens that are the same or very similar to currently recommended regimens for drug‐sensitive TB, it is unlikely that the variation in ATT regimens between the trials limits the applicability of the evidence.

For some outcomes, such as respiratory function and time to resolution of symptoms, incomplete reporting of data and differences in units meant that we could not combine data to generate a summary effects estimate.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^ce61d6ec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Dealing with missing data

The primary analysis was an intention‐to‐treat analysis where all participants randomized to treatment were included in the denominator, where possible. This analysis assumes that all losses to follow‐up have good outcomes. We planned to explore the effect of losses to follow‐up on the overall effect estimates by performing sensitivity analyses.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity by visually inspecting the forest plots to determine closeness of point estimates with each other and overlap of confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Chi² test with a P value of 0.10 to indicate statistical significance, and the I² statistic to assess heterogeneity with a value of 50% taken to indicate statistical heterogeneity. We planned to investigate heterogeneity through the following subgroup analyses: corticosteroid dose, HIV status, and methodological quality.

Assessment of reporting biases

We planned to look for publication bias by constructing a funnel plot, but there were too few studies to do this.

Data synthesis

We analysed the data using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (Review Manager 5). For outcomes where it was possible to combine data and clinical heterogeneity was low, we decided to perform a meta‐analysis. We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs and the fixed‐effect model. For outcomes where it was not possible to combine data, we described the results in tables. We summarized the adverse event data in tables and performed meta‐analysis for adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial drug, and HIV‐associated adverse events.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Where there was substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity, we carried out subgroup analyses to investigate possible causes.

Sensitivity analysis

To explore the possible effect of losses to follow‐up, we planned to conduct a worst case scenario analysis and compare it with an available‐case analysis for the outcome pleural changes at the end of treatment. There were few losses to follow‐up in the included trials, and the two trials with the highest number of losses to follow‐up did not state which treatment groups these participants were randomized to. Therefore we did not conduct the sensitivity analysis as planned.

Quality of the evidence

We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Jüni 2001). We used GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) software to construct a 'Summary of findings' table (GRADEpro GDT 2014).

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^9a31b590]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV–tuberculosis co-infection — risk, timing, outcomes, and management are detailed: IRIS is more common with earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 50 cells/μL, and in the STRIDE study its occurrence was 7.6%, with the majority (69%) mild to moderate and 31% hospitalized; the relative risk of IRIS for patients who receive ART during tuberculosis therapy is 1.88 (95% CI, 1.31–2.69), with higher rates when ART starts within 2 weeks versus 8–12 weeks. In general, development of IRIS does not worsen treatment outcomes, but ART is not initiated in the first 8 weeks of antituberculosis therapy for patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis meningitis (or other central nervous system tuberculosis), even for patients with CD4 cell counts < 50 cells/μL, because early initiation (within 2 weeks) was associated with increased adverse events and higher mortality. Management is symptomatic; for most mild cases tuberculosis and antiretroviral therapies can be continued with anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, drainage may be necessary for worsening pleural effusions or abscesses, and for more severe cases corticosteroids are effective; prednisone 1.25 mg/kg/day may be given for 2–4 weeks (50–80 mg/day) with tapering over 6–12 weeks or longer.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^f5da9f8f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Blinding

Four trials described blinding of participants and personnel and we assessed them as at low risk of bias (Elliott 2004; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Wyser 1996). Bang 1997 and Lee 1999 did not mention blinding, and therefore we classified them as at unclear risk of bias.

Two trials specified blinding of outcome assessors and we assessed them as being at low risk of bias (Elliott 2004; Wyser 1996). None of the other trials reported whether or not outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation, and so we assessed them as at unclear risk of bias.

Incomplete outcome data

Three trials did not report any losses to follow‐up (Bang 1997; Galarza 1995; Lee 1999). Bang 1997 excluded one participant in the corticosteroid group from the analysis as the trial drug had to be stopped due to epigastric pain. Elliott 2004 reported 3/197 (1.5%) participants lost to follow‐up; one from the placebo group and two from the corticosteroid group. We categorised these trials as at low risk for attrition bias.

Wyser 1996 excluded 4/74 (5.4%) from the analysis; three due to noncompliance with treatment and one due to a diagnosis of oesophageal cancer during treatment. The authors do not report which groups the excluded participants were allocated to. We categorised this trial as at unclear risk of attrition bias.

Lee 1988 excluded 5/45 (11.1%) from the analysis; one due to a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma during treatment, and four were lost to follow‐up. We classified this trial as at high risk of attrition bias.

Selective reporting

Trial protocols were unavailable for all of the included trials. Five trials stated the outcomes clearly in the introduction and methods sections of the study reports, and reported all stated outcomes (Bang 1997; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Lee 1999; Wyser 1996).

Elliott 2004 reported that the hypothesis of the trial was that prednisolone would improve long‐term survival, and decrease HIV viral replication, but did not list the planned outcomes. We assessed this trial as at high risk of reporting bias because in the results section it implied that data on resolution of symptoms that did not demonstrate a statistically significant positive effect of prednisolone was not reported, whereas data were reported for the outcomes of anorexia, weight, and cough where a statistically significant positive effect was found.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^617f0d71]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Two trials reported on respiratory function (Galarza 1995; Wyser 1996). In Wyser 1996, spirometry and body plethysmography were performed at admission and at various points during follow‐up. In Galarza 1995, spirometry was performed at the start and end of treatment. Neither trial reported the complete data for this outcome.

Disability was not reported in any of the included trials. Only one trial reported any deaths (Elliott 2004).

Elliott 2004 reported on CD4+ cell count at enrolment to the trial and at 1, 2, 6, and 18 months after start of treatment. A subset of participants (N = 40) also had blood and pleural fluid specimens analysed for HIV viral load.

All trials reported adverse events, although there was variation in the level of detail. Elliott 2004 reported on HIV‐related disease as well as corticosteroid‐related adverse events.

Excluded studies

We have listed the reasons for excluding 22 studies in the ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' section.

Allocation

All included trials were reported as randomized. Elliott 2004 explicitly stated that random numbers were computer‐generated, which we considered to be low risk of bias. The other included trials did not indicate how the sequence was generated, and we assessed them as at unclear risk of bias.

One trial gave a detailed description of the method of allocation concealment and we assessed it as at low risk of bias; briefly, prednisolone and matching placebo tablets were packaged in identical sequentially numbered plastic bags labelled with the randomization code by two people unrelated to the trial (Elliott 2004). The rest did not describe the method of allocation concealment, and so we classified them as at unclear risk of bias.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^5e4a747c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-pneumonitis — knowledge gaps regarding corticosteroids and steroid-sparing therapies are emphasized, as the efficacy and timing of steroid-sparing agents remain unknown, and it is similarly unknown whether infliximab, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) would be useful in relapsing or steroid-dependent disease or adversely impact tumor response to ICIs. The statement notes that one could postulate that treatment with steroids may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response, and that steroids increase the risk of infection and may not affect progression to fibrotic lung disease, each of which could worsen patient outcomes. It further highlights that determining the additive effect of steroids versus withdrawal of therapy alone or targeted, steroid-sparing therapies would help answer these questions.

Outcomes

Follow‐up varied from six months to 24 months. Two trials did not clearly state the length of follow‐up (Bang 1997; Lee 1999).

None of the included trials reported all the outcome measures chosen for this review.

Five trials reported on resolution or improvement of clinical symptoms in some way. Bang 1997 and Wyser 1996 both used self‐reported questionnaires to assess the time until symptom improvement and resolution in all participants; Wyser 1996 asked participants to grade the severity of a range of symptoms on a visual analogue scale. Lee 1988 reported the time to resolution of symptoms "including fever, chest pain and dyspnoea" for all participants, but did not specify how this was assessed. Elliott 2004 reported on improvement of anorexia, weight loss, and cough, but data for other symptoms was not reported. Galarza 1995 reported on time to resolution of fever.

Five trials reported on time to resolution of pleural effusion (Bang 1997; Elliott 2004; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Lee 1999). Four trials reported the number of participants with residual pleural effusion at various time points during treatment (Bang 1997; Elliott 2004; Lee 1988; Lee 1999). Bang 1997 and Lee 1988 also reported the mean number of days to resolution of pleural effusion. Galarza 1995 reported the mean reabsorption index for all participants over time. The trial authors calculated the reabsorption index as follows: (length of affected hemithorax/length of healthy hemithorax) x 100. Wyser 1996 reported recurrence of pleural effusion, rather than time to resolution, as all participants had therapeutic thoracocentesis at the start of treatment.

Five trials reported on pleural changes at various time points throughout treatment and at the end of follow‐up (Bang 1997; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Lee 1999; Wyser 1996). Galarza 1995 and Wyser 1996 described the diagnostic criteria for pleural thickening on chest X‐ray (Wyser 1996 also used high‐resolution computed tomography). Three trials did not describe the criteria for classifying participants as having pleural adhesions or pleural thickening (Bang 1997; Lee 1988; Lee 1999).

Adjunctive treatment — corticosteroids for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and selected complications — is indicated for children with TBM (strong, moderate) and "can also be considered" for severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), airway compression, pleural effusion, or pericarditis (expert opinion); adjunctive corticosteroid use "appears to reduce long-term constrictive complications in TB pericarditis" and is "associated with more rapid symptom resolution in TB pleural effusion (relative indication)". Prednisone (1–2 mg/kg body weight/day) for 4 to 6 weeks is advisable, with tapered dosing during the final 2 weeks, and evidence suggests corticosteroids in TBM "reduces mortality and long-term neurologic impairment".

HIV‐associated adverse events

Only Elliott 2004 included HIV‐positive participants. The trial reported adverse events related to HIV, including candidiasis, herpes simplex and herpes zoster, cryptococcal meningitis, gastroenteritis, and Kaposi's sarcoma (summarized in Table 10). For most of these adverse events there was no difference between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. For Kaposi's sarcoma, there was a statistically non‐significant trend towards increased risk with corticosteroids: 6/99 in the corticosteroid group developed Kaposi's sarcoma compared with 0/98 in the placebo group (RR 12.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 225.40; 197 participants, 1 trial, very low certainty evidence).

Participants

All participants were adults except in one trial, Galarza 1995, which included people aged 11 years and older. All trials included participants of both sexes; overall 59% were male, with a range of 51% to 64% across trials.

One trial included only HIV‐positive participants (Elliott 2004), two trials excluded HIV‐positive participants (Galarza 1995; Wyser 1996), while the other included trials did not mention the HIV status of the participants.

All but one trial, Galarza 1995, specified the exclusion of participants with co‐morbidities that may be exacerbated by the use of corticosteroids, particularly hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and peptic ulcer disease. Elliott 2004 also specified the exclusion of participants with another major HIV‐related disease.

We have described the diagnostic tests performed in each included trial in Table 4. Diagnosis of pleural TB was made on the basis of either characteristic histopathological features on pleural biopsy or positive culture or acid‐fast bacilli (AFB) on smear microscopy staining from pleural fluid, biopsy or sputum in three trials (Elliott 2004; Lee 1999; Wyser 1996). Galarza 1995 also included participants with a diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy based on a combination of at least two of: reactive Mantoux test, lymphocytic pleural fluid, and raised adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid. Bang 1997 only included participants who had positive microscopy for AFB from sputum, pleural fluid, or pleural biopsy. Lee 1988 included participants with pleural biopsy "reported as pleural tuberculosis or chronic granulomatous inflammation".

### Short-term systemic corticosteroids: appropriate use in primary care… [^5bcf8b36]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute Bronchitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed for patients with acute bronchitis. Patients were randomly prescribed prednisolone or placebo for five days and followed for up to 28 days. There was no improvement on any clinical parameters, including the duration of cough, severity of cough, use of medications, or patient satisfaction. 6 Approximately 40% had a peak flow rate less than 80% of predicted at study entry, but even in this subgroup, those receiving corticosteroids had no greater improvement in any outcomes compared with placebo, including duration of abnormal peak flow. Acute Pharyngitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids may provide some benefit for patients with peritonsillar abscess. 10 The adults were randomized to receive one dose of oral dexamethasone or placebo. The primary outcome — the proportion of patients with resolution of symptoms at 24 hours — was not found to be different between treatment groups.

Thus, steroid use for adults with mild to moderate pharyngitis is not supported by evidence. The results showed equivalence of pain control at rest and with activity for the study's 14 days of follow-up. No serious adverse effects occurred in either group, but nausea and vomiting were significantly more common in patients who were prescribed indomethacin, whereas skin rash was more common in patients who were prescribed prednisolone. Bell Palsy Two large well-designed RCTs with 551 and 829 patients, respectively, showed effectiveness of a 10-day oral prednisolone course for Bell/facial nerve palsy. 27, 28 Current guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation recommend short-term oral steroids for idiopathic facial nerve palsy within three days of symptom onset.
29. 30 whereas the second trial randomized 400 patients to receive acyclovir with prednisolone or placebo.

31 In both studies, healing of rash, acute pain, and development of postherpetic neuralgia were assessed. In one study, prednisone did not help decrease time for rash healing, but it did help decrease acute pain level at one month. 30 In the other study, prednisolone may have helped with rash healing and acute pain at seven and 14 days but not beyond. 31 Neither study showed that steroids decreased the risk for postherpetic neuralgia. 32 Adverse effects of corticosteroids were reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, and edema.

### Pleurisy [^110fc743]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is a common presenting symptom and has many causes, which range from life-threatening to benign, self-limited conditions. Pulmonary embolism is the most common potentially life-threatening cause, found in 5 to 20 percent of patients who present to the emergency department with pleuritic pain. Other clinically significant conditions that may cause pleuritic pain include pericarditis, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and pneumothorax. Patients should be evaluated appropriately for these conditions before an alternative diagnosis is made. History, physical examination, and chest radiography are recommended for all patients with pleuritic chest pain. Electrocardiography is helpful, especially if there is clinical suspicion of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pericarditis. When these other significant causes of pleuritic pain have been excluded, the diagnosis of pleurisy can be made. There are numerous causes of pleurisy, with viral pleurisy among the most common. Other etiologies may be evaluated through additional diagnostic testing in selected patients. Treatment of pleurisy typically consists of pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as specific treatments targeted at the underlying cause.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^72b931ca]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT

Treatment of pleural effusion depends on the severity of symptoms. Isolated pleural involvement of IgG4-RD without multisystem disorder usually follows a benign course, and a watchful waiting with radiographic follow-up is appropriate in patients with small and asymptomatic effusions. On the other hand, patients with pleural effusion accompanying involvement of vital organs, including aortitis, pericarditis, pancreatic enlargement and tubulointerstitial nephritis should be treated urgently because delay in treatment may result in irreversible organ dysfunction. For active IgG4-RD, glucocorticoids are recognized as the first-line treatment and are shown to improve pleural fluids and respiratory symptoms in patients with IgG4-related pleural lesion. Japanese consensus criteria recommends prednisolone of 0.5–0.6 mg/kg/day as the initial dose, and this dose can be gradually weaned over subsequent months, depending on the improvement of clinical, laboratory and radiographic features. There is no significant difference in remission induction between high (0.8–1.0 mg/kg/day) and medium doses of glucocorticoids (0.5–0.6 mg/kg/day). However, the high relapse rate both during and after glucocorticoid tapers in IgG4-RD is a hindrance to this therapy, and a maintenance dose of 5–10 mg/day of prednisolone is recommended for more than 1 year. As an alternative to glucocorticoids, B-cell depletion with rituximab (1 g at days 0 and 15) has been assessed in a prospective open-label trial with 30 IgG4-RD patients, showing disease responses in 97% of patients. A French retrospective study with 33 IgG4-RD patients showed the effectiveness of rituximab for both remission induction and retreatment for relapse and increased relapse-free survival. The rituximab treatment resulted in a concomitant decrease in the numbers of circulating plasmablasts and CD4+ SLAMF7+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes but not CD4+ GATA3+ T H 2 cells or CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in peripheral blood of IgG4-RD patients. These findings contribute to a better understanding of this novel immune-mediated disorder as well as other autoimmune diseases.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^03ff4118]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous pericarditis — adjunctive corticosteroids should not be used routinely is supported by a randomized trial and a systematic review; a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with 1400 participants did not find a difference in the combined primary endpoint between adjunctive corticosteroids and placebo, and a systematic review did not find a statistically significant benefit in either mortality or constrictive pericarditis; therefore, we suggest that adjunctive corticosteroids should not be used routinely in the treatment of patients with pericardial tuberculosis, and we suggest initial adjunctive corticosteroid therapy not be routinely used in patients with tuberculous pericarditis (conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence), although selective use in patients at the highest risk for inflammatory complications might be appropriate.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV/tuberculosis — risk, features, and management: Patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis "are at increased risk of paradoxical worsening of symptoms and signs" after starting tuberculosis and/or antiretroviral treatments, attributed to "immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)". "Tuberculosis IRIS has not been noted to be more common in participants with earlier ART initiation and CD4+ cell counts < 50 cells/μL". Signs may include "high fevers, worsening respiratory symptoms", lymph node enlargement, central nervous system lesions, pulmonary infiltrations, pleural effusions, and intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal abscesses. Management is symptomatic: for mild IRIS, therapies "can be continued with the addition of anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen", drainage may be needed for effusions or abscesses, and "for more severe cases of IRIS, treatment with corticosteroids is effective".

### Sarcoidosis associated pleural effusion: clinical aspects [^b8c669ba]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A sarcoidosis associated pleural effusion (SAPE) is a pleural effusion caused by active granulomatous inflammation from sarcoidosis. We describe the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic approach, treatment strategies and outcome of this condition. SAPE occurs in approximately 1% of sarcoidosis patients. The condition most commonly occurs at the initial presentation of sarcoidosis or within the first year. Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom. Although a definitive diagnosis of SAPE requires a pleural biopsy, the diagnosis may be established on the basis of clinical features alone provided that alternative conditions can be reliably excluded. Pleural fluid analysis is essential in establishing the clinical diagnosis of SAPE. Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice for SAPE, and they are usually rapidly effective with courses of therapy often lasting less than two months. SAPE tends to have a low rate of recurrence that appears be to lower than for many other forms of sarcoidosis.

### Therapeutic intervention: assessing the role of the international consensus guidelines [^6858eaec]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The consensus statement released by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society has provided guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with IPF. These guidelines suggest the use of conventional treatment options including therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. The guidelines statement acknowledged the fact that there is little good-quality evidence to support the safety and efficacy of such therapies in patients with IPF. The statement was published in 2000 and was based on an extensive review of the literature up to and including December 1998. The goal of this review is to reexamine the treatment recommendations of the guidelines statement in the context of data that has since become available.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis: a review [^9289d0a2]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (< 0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (< 3%) can be life-threatening.

Observations

Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with presence of 2 or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine (≈90%); new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression (≈25%-50%); a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small (≈60%); or a pericardial friction rub (< 30%). In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis. Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%). With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least 6 months. Corticosteroids are often used if pericarditis does not improve with NSAIDs and colchicine. In certain patients with multiple recurrences, which can occur for several years, interleukin 1 (IL-1) blockers have demonstrated efficacy and may be preferred to corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Acute pericarditis is a common cause of nonischemic chest pain. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of pericarditis in endemic areas and is treated with antitubercular therapy. In North America and Western Europe, pericarditis is typically idiopathic, develops after a viral infection, or develops following cardiac procedures or surgery. Treatment with NSAIDs and colchicine leads to a favorable prognosis in most patients, although 15% to 30% of patients develop recurrence. Patients with multiple recurrent pericarditis can have a disease duration of several years or more, are often treated with corticosteroids, and IL-1 blockers may be used for selected patients as steroid-sparing therapy.

### Predictors of low disease activity and clinical remission following belimumab treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus [^df7a24f5]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we demonstrated that organ damage accrued prior to initiation of treatment with belimumab resulted in reduced likelihood of attaining low disease activity, either the complete LLDAS definition or SLEDAI-2K ≤ 4 with no renal activity, no pleurisy, no pericarditis and no fever, as well as clinical remission defined as a cSLEDAI-2K score of zero. Interestingly, addition of a CS dose restriction of a daily prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) dose of ≤ 7.5 mg revealed that SLE patients with positive anti-dsDNA titres at the time of treatment initiation were more likely to achieve the outcome.

Previous analysis of BLISS data comparing belimumab-treated SLE patients with patients who received placebo revealed superiority of belimumab over placebo in serologically active patients, more specifically patients with positive anti-dsDNA titres or low C3/C4 levels at baseline, based on the SRI-4, which was recently also corroborated regarding the attainment of LLDAS. Our analysis was non-comparative; we investigated the performance of baseline factors as predictors of LLDAS or cSLEDAI-2K = 0 attainment in the belimumab 10 mg/kg arm only, i.e. the dose approved by regulatory agencies for use in clinical practice. In this analysis, established organ damage prior to treatment initiation was the strongest and most consistent baseline predictor of failure to attain low SLE disease activity and clinical remission at the 52-week follow-up visit. The finding is in conformity with previous reports of established organ damage reducing belimumab efficacy, both in real-life and clinical trial settings. In accordance with another real-life setting, serological activity at treatment initiation was not found to impact the likelihood of attaining LLDAS.

### Adjunctive steroid therapy for managing pulmonary tuberculosis [^1949c0ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis causes approximately 8.6 million disease episodes and 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. Although curable with standardized treatment, outcomes for some forms of tuberculosis are improved with adjunctive corticosteroid therapy. Whether corticosteroid therapy would be beneficial in treating people with pulmonary tuberculosis is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate whether adjunctive corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality, accelerates clinical recovery or accelerates microbiological recovery in people with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We identified studies indexed from 1966 up to May 2014 by searching: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS using comparative search terms. We handsearched reference lists of all identified studies and previous reviews and contacted relevant researchers, organizations and companies to identify grey literature.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized control trials of recognized antimicrobial combination regimens and corticosteroid therapy of any dose or duration compared with either no corticosteroid therapy or placebo in people with pulmonary tuberculosis were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two investigators independently assessed trial quality and collected data using pre-specified data extraction forms. Findings were reported as narrative or within tables. If appropriate, Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses models were used to calculate risk ratios.

Main Results

We identified 18 trials, including 3816 participants, that met inclusion criteria. When compared to taking placebo or no steroid, corticosteroid use was not shown to to reduce all-cause mortality, or result in higher sputum conversion at 2 months or at 6 months (mortality: RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.15, 3815 participants, 18 studies, low quality evidence; sputum conversion at 2 months RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.09, 2750 participants, 12 studies; at 6 months; RR1.01, 95%CI 1.01, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.04, 2150 participants, 9 studies, both low quality evidence). However, corticosteroid use was found to increase weight gain (data not pooled, eight trials, 1203 participants, low quality evidence), decrease length of hospital stay (data not pooled, three trials, participants 379, very low quality of evidence) and increase clinical improvement within one month (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24; five trials, 497 participants, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

It is unlikely that adjunctive corticosteroid treatment provides major benefits for people with pulmonary tuberculosis. Short term clinical benefits found did not appear to be maintained in the long term. However, evidence available to date is of low quality. In order to evaluate whether adjunctive corticosteroids reduce mortality, or accelerate clinical or microbiological recovery in people with pulmonary tuberculosis further large randomized control trials sufficiently powered to detect changes in such outcomes are needed.

### Corticosteroids in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^a80b6fe5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids were the mainstay of therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for more than four decades, but their efficacy is unproven and toxicities are substantial. The course of IPF is characterized by progressive respiratory insufficiency, leading to death within 3 to 8 years from the onset of symptoms. Although a subset (10–20%) of patients survives more than 10 years, there is no evidence that any form of therapy alters the natural history of the disease. Nonetheless, given the poor prognosis, a trial of corticosteroids is often given. Because of the rarity of IPF, randomized, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials have not been done. Further, no studies have compared differing dosages or duration of corticosteroid in matched patients. Interpretation of therapy efficacy is obscured by several factors including heterogeneous patient populations, inclusion of patients with histologic entities other than usual interstitial pneumonia, lack of objective, validated endpoints, different criteria for "response". We review published data regarding corticosteroid therapy for IPF and present a rationale for stratifying therapy based on host, demographic, and clinical factors that influence prognosis as well as risk for corticosteroid complications.

### Managing pulmonary toxicities associated with immunotherapy: a case discussion [^99c3bfb8]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy has changed the field of oncology around the world with the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for a number of tumor types over the last 5years. However, immune-mediated adverse events can be challenging and difficult to treat, with one of the most dire consequences being immune-mediated pneumonitis. KEY POINTS: Rapid intervention and aggressive management for grade 3 or greater pneumonitisSlow taper of steroids and also recommend pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxisMonitor carefully for a pneumonitis flare with steroid taper, which can occur in the absence of resuming anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) [1], and do not resume anti-PD-1 therapy until completely off steroids and no clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrenceConsider observation without anti-PD-1 resumption-in this case, durable response was maintained even without resuming anti-PD-1 therapy.

We present a case of a 50-year-old man who presented with progressive shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and weight loss. His computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a left-sided pleural effusion, subpleural and peribronchovascular nodules, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopaties. Traasbronchial biopsies of the lung parenchyma and Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) with pleural biopsies revealed the presence of noncaseating granulomas. A diagnosis of stage 2 sarcoidosis with pleural involvement was made and treatment with prednisone was started. The patient continued with persistent dyspnea and a left-sided pleural effusion. Steroid treatment was tapered and leflunomide therapy was initiated. A significant improvement of his clinical condition was seen after 1 month on treatment.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^f484d1dd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The causes of exudative pleural effusions are diverse and frequently remain unclear despite exhaustive examinations. Recently recognized IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibroinflammatory disorder that can affect nearly any organ including the lungs. This review will focus on the involvement of IgG4 in exudative pleural effusion of unknown cause.

Recent Findings

IgG4 is found to be involved in a proportion of patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions. Pleural involvement in IgG4-RD can be seen in isolation or association with other organ disease. Pleural thickening and/or effusion are common clinical features of IgG4-related pleural lesions, and this condition is histologically characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells in the pleura. Although the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD is poorly understood, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates an antigen-driven process requiring T-cell and B-cell interaction in which autoantibodies, plasmablasts, follicular helper T cells and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes participate.

Summary

The possibility of IgG4-related pleural lesion should be considered in patients with pleural effusion of unexplained cause when lymphoplasmacytic infiltration is seen in a pleural biopsy specimen. This condition is responsive to systemic steroid therapy.

### Six-week oral prednisolone therapy for immune-related pneumonitis: a single-arm phase II study [^7286da23]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, the treatment approach of irP depends on each physician, and thus, the dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy can vary widely among patients. For example, a retrospective cohort study in the USA and Australia reported that patients with irP received a median prednisone dose of 50 mg (range, 20–80 mg) for a median duration of 68 days (range, 20–154 days). Our retrospective cohort study in Japan reported a median prednisolone dose of 30 mg (range, 20–60 mg) and a median duration of 91 days (IQR, 49.5–180.5 days) for treating irP. Insufficient corticosteroid therapy has potential risk of treatment failure. Conversely, an overlong duration of corticosteroid therapy is potentially harmful by increasing adverse events and interruption of subsequent cancer treatment. Elucidation of optimal corticosteroid therapy for irP in a prospective clinical trial is needed.

We hypothesized that high-dose corticosteroid therapy, tapered over fixed duration, would be efficacious of irP. The aim of this single-arm phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 6-week tapering schedule of prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for patients with cancer with irP.

### Diagnostic procedure for idiopathic eosinophilic pleural effusion: a single-center experience [^05bdc996]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exploratory treatment and follow-up

After the initial diagnosis of IEPE, patients were treated with glucocorticoid (initial prednisone dose: 1 mg/kg of body weight per day). If the glucocorticoid resolved symptoms and abnormal pleural pulmonary radiographic signs, consecutive reduction of 10 mg per month was made. Physical examination with chest radiography, ultrasound and/or CT were followed up after the use of glucocorticoid.

The median follow-up was 14.4 months (range, 8–16 months). All the patients showed total regression of the pleural effusion, without re-occurrence. These patients remained stable during follow-up and did not receive any additional therapy. Figure 2 shows the follow-up chest CT of a patient (case 3).

Fig. 2
Follow-up chest CT scan of case 3. Total regression of PE, consolidation in the lower right lung and pericardial effusion with no recurrences

Preliminary diagnostic procedure of IEPE

IEPE is a diagnosis of exclusion. Complete medical and surgical histories should be obtained from patients with EPE of unknown aetiology. It is recommended the patients should be followed up after receiving glucocorticoid, until the effusion resolves or a known cause becomes apparent. A preliminary diagnostic procedure of IEPE was developed and is shown in Fig. 3.

### The effect of corticosteroids on pleurodesis induced by doxycycline in rabbits [^3549356a]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine if the administration of systemic corticosteroids diminishes the effectiveness of the pleurodesis induced by the intrapleural injection of doxycycline.

Study Design

Thirty New Zealand white male rabbits were classified into three groups (n = 10 rabbits), all of which received doxycycline, 10 mg/kg intrapleurally, in a volume of 2 mL. Rabbits in the control group received only the intrapleural injection of doxycycline; the steroid-once group received triamcinolone, 0.8 mg/kg IM, 24 h before the intrapleural injection; and the steroid-weekly group received triamcinolone, 0.8 mg/kg IM, 24 h before the intrapleural injection and weekly over the next 3 weeks. All rabbits had a chest tube placed before the intrapleural administration of doxycycline and underwent pleural fluid aspiration twice daily. The rabbits were killed after 28 days, and the pleura and lungs were examined macroscopically and microscopically.

Results

The administration of corticosteroids resulted in both a significant decrease in the macroscopic adhesion score (p < 0.001) and a tendency toward a decreased microscopic fibrosis score (p = 0.056) after 28 days. Animals receiving weekly corticosteroid injections had lower scores than animals receiving only one injection.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the administration of corticosteroids (triamcinolone, 0.8 mg/kg) 24 h before the intrapleural injection of doxycycline, 10 mg/kg, decreases the effectiveness of pleurodesis in rabbits. Weekly injections decreased the effectiveness even more. If these results can be extrapolated to humans, efforts should be made to minimize the administration of exogenous corticosteroids when pleurodesis is attempted.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^206df315]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### 2025 ESC guidelines for the management of myocarditis and pericarditis [^218268eb]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pericarditis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering low- to medium-dose corticosteroids in patients with pericarditis only in cases of contraindication or failure of aspirin, NSAIDs, and colchicine, or when there is a specific indication to control symptoms and reduce recurrences.
Dosing in acute and recurrent pericarditis for prednisone is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks, tapered over several months based on prednisone daily dose:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
| > 50 mg|- 10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks|
|50–25 mg|- 5–10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks|

Pericarditis — corticosteroids and adjunct therapies include prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/d with wks to mo duration, tapering Several mo, Monitoring Needed, and LOE B; the text similarly notes prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day initiated and maintained until clinical remission followed by slow tapering over months. Azathioprine starts with 1 mg/kg per d then gradually increased to 2–3 mg/kg/d, with Several mo treatment and Several mo tapering (Monitoring Needed; LOE C). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is listed as 400 to 500 mg/kg IV daily for 5 d with a 5 d duration and Not required tapering (Monitoring Needed; LOE C). Because of steroid adverse effects, pharmacological prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia and osteoporosis should be considered for patients requiring glucocorticoid doses equivalent to > 20 mg of prednisone for 1 month or longer, and risks include infections, gastrointestinal ulcers, and adrenal suppression.

### Corticosteroids in sarcoidosis [^5269fb96]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are the drug of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis. Because the natural course of sarcoidosis may be self-limiting and/or cause no long-term harm, treatment is not mandatory. Corticosteroids are usually effective for all forms of sarcoidosis, and they work quickly. However, because of the potential toxicities of corticosteroids, alternative medications often need to be considered. Efforts should be made to minimize the corticosteroid dose while keeping the risk of toxicity as low as possible. This article outlines the indications for corticosteroid therapy for sarcoidosis, discusses various dosing regimens, and suggests when alternative corticosteroid agents should be considered.

For intervention arm participants, IPC drainages will be performed by a trained healthcare professional, a minimum of 5 times per week until the first clinic review at 14 days. Participants will be advised to report to the local trial team if PF drains < 50 mL on three consecutive drainages. Following this, a clinical review within 7 days will be arranged to consider repeat imaging and IPC removal, which should take place any time up to 14 days after this point. Any patient who has their IPC removed will continue to undergo planned follow-up for the full 12 weeks.

All participants will be given patient diaries to capture visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for breathlessness and chest pain, recorded two times a week over 4 weeks post procedure. Diaries will also capture interaction with healthcare providers. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will record IPC drainage volumes. An extract of the patient diary is included in online supplemental appendix B.

All concomitant medications (other than other intrapleural pleurodesis agents) are permitted in this trial. Use of medications which are thought to reduce pleurodesis success (such as steroids) are permitted but will be recorded on CRFs. There are no trial restrictions, and participants can take part in other (non-pleural interventional) studies if the other trial protocols permit this. Participants in the non-IPC arm are permitted use of IPCs during the post pleurodesis phase if PF becomes recurrent, and this will be recorded on the CRFs. All other forms of pleurodesis (including via the IPC if present) are not permitted during the first month of follow-up.

Follow-up visits

Participants will be followed up for 12 weeks after the trial procedure, or until death. Trial visits will take place at 2 weeks ± 3 days, 4 weeks ± 3 days and 12 weeks ± 7 days post procedure. At each visit, participants will undergo a standard clinical assessment, including CXR and thoracic USS. QoL questionnaires (EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level(EQ5D-5L) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life of cancer patients (EORTC QLQc30) will be completed at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) will also be recorded. Loss to follow-up will be minimised by diligent liaison with the patient, their oncology team and general practitioner. Any loss to follow-up will be recorded on the withdrawal CRF. The reason for withdrawal (if known) will be recorded.

### Interventions for treating tuberculous pericarditis [^d393d8d1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculous pericarditis - tuberculosis infection of the pericardial membrane (pericardium) covering the heart - is becoming more common. The infection can result in fluid around the heart or fibrosis of the pericardium, which can be fatal.

Objectives

In people with tuberculous pericarditis, to evaluate the effects on death, life-threatening conditions, and persistent disability of: (1) 6-month antituberculous drug regimens compared with regimens of 9 months or more; (2) corticosteroids; (3) pericardial drainage; and (4) pericardiectomy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (June 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2002), EMBASE (1980 to May 2002), and checked the reference lists of existing reviews. We also contacted organizations and individuals working in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Meta-analysis using fixed effects models calculated summary statistics, provided there was no statistically significant heterogeneity, and expressed results as relative risk. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Four trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 469 participants. Treatments tested were adjuvant steroids and surgical drainage. Two trials with a total of 383 participants tested adjuvant steroids in participants with suspected tuberculous pericarditis in the pre-HIV era. Fewer participants died in the intervention group, but numbers were small (relative risk [RR] 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 1.16, n = 350). One small trial tested steroids in HIV positive participants with effusion showed a similar pattern (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.28, n = 58). One trial examined open surgical drainage compared with conservative management, and showed surgery relieved cardiac tamponade.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Steroids could have important clinical benefits, but the trials published to date are too small to demonstrate an effect. This requires large placebo controlled trials. Subgroup analysis could explore whether effusion or fibrosis modify the effects. Therapeutic pericardiocentesis under local anaesthesia and pericardiectomy also require further evaluation.

Objectives

To identify predictors of low disease activity and clinical remission following belimumab treatment in SLE.

Methods

SLE patients who received belimumab 10 mg/kg (N = 563) in the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 clinical trials were surveyed. The performance of baseline factors in predicting attainment of low disease activity (defined as Lupus Low Disease Activity State) or clinical remission [defined as clinical (c)SLEDAI-2K = 0] at week 52 from treatment initiation was evaluated using logistic regression. Organ damage was assessed using the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI).

Results

We demonstrated a negative impact of established organ damage on attainment of Lupus Low Disease Activity State [SDI > 0; odds ratio (OR): 0.44; 95% CI 0.22, 0.90; P = 0.024] and the primary Lupus Low Disease Activity State condition, i.e. SLEDAI-2K ≤ 4 with no renal activity, pleurisy, pericarditis or fever (SDI > 1; OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.27, 0.77; P = 0.004); cognitive impairment/psychosis was found to mainly account for the latter association. Baseline SDI scores > 1 predicted failure to attain cSLEDAI-2K = 0 (OR: 0.53; 95% CI 0.30, 0.94; P = 0.030), with cutaneous damage mainly driving this association. Anti-dsDNA positivity increased (OR: 1.82; 95% CI 1.08, 3.06; P = 0.025) and cardiovascular damage reduced (OR: 0.13; 95% CI 0.02, 0.97; P = 0.047) the probability of attaining cSLEDAI-2K = 0 along with a daily prednisone equivalent intake restricted to ≤ 7.5 mg.

Conclusion

Belimumab might be expected to be more efficacious in inducing low disease activity and clinical remission in SLE patients with limited or no organ damage accrued prior to treatment initiation. Patients with positive anti-dsDNA titres might be more likely to achieve clinical remission along with limited or no CS use.

Definitions

We applied the LLDAS and cSLEDAI-2K = 0 definitions as previously described. In brief, for the complete LLDAS we required that the following four conditions were met: (i) a SLEDAI-2K score of ≤ 4 with no activity in the renal descriptors (proteinuria, pyuria, haematuria, cellular casts), no pleurisy, no pericarditis and no fever, based on evaluations at week 52 from treatment initiation, (ii) no new features of SLE activity, defined as no new moderate or severe flare according to the SELENA-SLEDAI flare index from baseline through the 52-week follow-up visit, (iii) a SELENA-SLEDAI Physician's Global Assessment score of ≤ 1 at week 52, and (iv) a daily prednisone or prednisone equivalent dose of ≤ 7.5 mg at week 52. Due to low attainment rates of the complete LLDAS, we analysed the main condition of LLDAS (LLDAS condition 1: a SLEDAI-2K score of ≤ 4 with no activity in the renal descriptors, no pleurisy, no pericarditis and no fever) separately.

Moreover, we analysed the combination of cSLEDAI-2K = 0 together with a daily prednisone equivalent dose of ≤ 7.5 mg (LLDAS condition 4). It is worth noting that while the serological SLEDAI-2K items (positive anti-dsDNA titres and low complement levels) are suppressed in the cSLEDAI-2K, they are both retained in the SLEDAI-2K condition of LLDAS (condition 1). In cases of persistent or new onset of serological activity, LLDAS may thus constitute an even more stringent outcome measure compared with the cSLEDAI-2K = 0. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the two measures reflect dissimilar states of SLE disease activity.

Levels of anti-dsDNA immunoglobulin G ⩾30 IU/ml (detectable range of the assay: 30–3600 IU/ml) indicated positivity, and baseline C3 and C4 complement levels were dichotomized into low and normal/high. Organ damage was assessed using the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI).
