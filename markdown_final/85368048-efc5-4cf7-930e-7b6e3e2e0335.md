## Question

estrogen dosage for menopausal patient without uterus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about estrogen dosing for a menopausal patient without a uterus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle of using estrogen-only therapy after hysterectomy. Then, I should verify the timing-of-initiation window and baseline risk assessment. Next, I will review formulation and route selection, followed by concrete starting doses for common products. After that, I need to ensure a titration and monitoring plan, including when to check estradiol levels. Finally, I should consider special populations, duration and discontinuation strategy, and summarize a practical dosing recommendation with safety caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: in a postmenopausal patient without a uterus, estrogen-only therapy is appropriate because there is no need for endometrial protection, and adding a progestogen would increase breast cancer risk without improving symptom control, so I should avoid progestogen unless there is a compelling indication such as a history of endometriosis or endometrial neoplasia, in which case progestogen may be considered on a case-by-case basis [^111q3rop] [^112UYgJk] [^112FEeUF] [^115XFJPh].

> Wait, let me verify the timing-of-initiation guidance before I anchor on dosing; the most favorable risk–benefit profile is generally when therapy is started in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause, whereas initiation in older or more remote postmenopausal women carries higher cardiovascular and thrombotic risks, so I should confirm age and time-since-menopause before prescribing and screen for cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, liver disease, and breast cancer risk factors as part of shared decision-making [^1134k2WV] [^116ub51F] [^112BccEB].

> I will now examine formulation and route, because this affects both efficacy and safety; for women at increased VTE risk or with higher baseline cardiovascular risk, a non-oral transdermal route at the lowest effective dose is preferred to mitigate thrombotic risk, whereas oral therapy remains acceptable for appropriately selected candidates without excess VTE risk, so I should tailor route to individual risk and preference while keeping the dose minimal [^113r69Zv] [^116QZs7m] [^114dXc9d].

> Let me think about concrete starting doses; for transdermal patches, common low starting doses are 0.0375 mg twice weekly (for example, Vivelle-Dot or DOTTI), with titration based on symptom control, and for transdermal gel, starting at 0.25 g daily of estradiol 0.1% gel with titration up to 1.25 g as needed is reasonable, while for oral conjugated equine estrogen, a conservative start at 0.3 mg daily with upward titration is FDA-labeled and aligns with the lowest-effective-dose principle, so I should start low and adjust to effect rather than beginning at higher doses [^115XFJPh] [^116Bdf6s] [^115haVm2] [^1113U8YL].

> Hold on, I should verify the titration cadence and monitoring plan; reassessment at 3 to 6 month intervals is appropriate to judge efficacy and tolerability, with attempts to taper or discontinue at similar intervals once symptoms are stable, and routine estradiol level monitoring is not generally required unless symptoms persist despite dose escalation or when switching formulations, in which case checking a trough estradiol can guide further adjustments, so I will avoid unnecessary labs while staying responsive to clinical response [^1134k2WV] [^114qpx3S] [^112FEeUF] [^115vZyd6].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population; for surgical menopause or primary ovarian insufficiency, symptom burden is often higher and a higher initial transdermal dose such as 100 micrograms may be justified with subsequent taper toward physiologic replacement as tolerated, whereas in patients with a history of endometriosis or endometrial neoplasia I should reconsider adding a progestogen despite the absence of a uterus, and in those with a history of breast cancer, systemic estrogen is generally avoided and decisions about local vaginal estrogen should be individualized with oncology input, so I need to ensure I capture surgical history, endometrial pathology, and oncologic history before finalizing the regimen [^1134k2WV] [^112UYgJk] [^115uKnuE] [^1156dK5a].

> I should double-check the duration and discontinuation strategy; while there is no universal stopping rule, annual reassessment of risks and benefits is advised, and for many women a trial of tapering after 1 to 5 years is reasonable, recognizing that longer durations of estrogen-alone therapy have been associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk after 10 to 15 years in observational cohorts, so shared decisions about continuation versus tapering should be documented and revisited regularly [^114UWJ1K] [^111sdCaC].

> Let me reconsider the overall dosing recommendation to ensure internal consistency; for a typical postmenopausal patient without a uterus, under 60 years or within 10 years of menopause, without excess VTE or breast cancer risk, I would start transdermal estradiol 0.0375 mg twice weekly or estradiol gel 0.25 g daily, or oral conjugated estrogen 0.3 mg daily if transdermal is not preferred, then titrate every 3 to 6 months to the lowest dose that controls vasomotor symptoms while planning periodic attempts to taper, and I would avoid adding a progestogen unless there is a specific indication such as prior endometriosis or endometrial neoplasia, documenting the rationale if an exception is made [^115XFJPh] [^116Bdf6s] [^115haVm2] [^1113U8YL] [^111q3rop].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety counseling is explicit; I should confirm that estrogen is not indicated for primary prevention of chronic conditions, reinforce age and time-since-menopause considerations, discuss breast cancer risk nuances showing lower risk with estrogen-alone compared with combined therapy in WHI analyses, and provide clear instructions for application of transdermal products and expectations for bleeding patterns, arranging follow-up at 6 to 12 months to reassess risks, benefits, and the need for ongoing therapy [^115P3vka] [^1148X84h] [^115XFJPh] [^115vZyd6].

---

For a menopausal patient without a uterus, **estrogen-alone therapy is indicated** [^111q3rop] and **progestogen is not required** [^112UYgJk]. Start with the **lowest effective dose** [^1134k2WV] and titrate to symptom control; typical starting doses include transdermal estradiol 0.0375–0.05 mg twice weekly [^115XFJPh] [^116Bdf6s] or oral estradiol 0.5–1 mg daily. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration [^1113U8YL], with periodic reassessment [^114UWJ1K]; consider transdermal therapy for patients at higher VTE risk [^113r69Zv] [^114dXc9d]. Local vaginal estrogen is preferred for genitourinary symptoms [^1146ThMd].

---

## Indications for estrogen therapy in patients without a uterus

Estrogen therapy is indicated for **moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms** (hot flashes, night sweats) [^115TEqN9] and for **vulvovaginal atrophy** (dryness, itching, dyspareunia) [^115TEqN9]. It also helps prevent osteoporosis in high-risk women [^114zbvE8] [^114hT7ZK].

---

## Recommended estrogen formulations and routes of administration

Estrogen therapy is available in **multiple formulations and routes**; selection should be individualized based on patient preference, risk profile, and clinical context [^114dwtC8].

| **Formulation** | **Route of administration** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Transdermal patch | Skin | - Estradiol patch (Vivelle-Dot [^115XFJPh], Climara) [^notfound] |
| Transdermal gel | Skin | - Estradiol gel (Estrogel) [^115haVm2] |
| Oral tablet | Oral | - Estradiol oral tablet [^notfound] <br/> - Conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin) [^1113U8YL] |
| Vaginal cream | Local vaginal | - Estradiol vaginal cream [^113pNF6t] [^11189jwN] |
| Vaginal tablet | Local vaginal | - Vagifem [^117SxDzU] |
| Vaginal ring | Local vaginal | - Estring [^notfound] |

---

Transdermal patches and gels are preferred for patients at **increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)** [^113r69Zv] because they have a lower risk of thrombotic events than oral formulations [^notfound].

---

## Recommended starting doses and titration

The principle of "lowest effective dose" should guide therapy [^1134k2WV], with **dose adjustments** based on clinical response and symptom control [^1134k2WV].

| **Formulation** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Titration** |
|-|-|-|
| Transdermal patch | 0.0375–0.05 mg twice weekly [^notfound] | Adjust based on symptom control |
| Transdermal gel | 0.25–0.5 mg daily [^notfound] | Adjust based on symptom control |
| Oral estradiol | 0.5–1 mg daily [^notfound] | Adjust based on symptom control |
| Conjugated equine estrogen | 0.3–0.625 mg daily [^notfound] | Adjust based on symptom control |

---

Dose adjustments should be made at **3–6 month intervals** [^114UWJ1K] based on symptom control and side effects.

---

## Duration of therapy

The duration of **estrogen therapy** should be individualized, balancing benefits and risks [^114UWJ1K]. Short-term use **(≤ 5 years)** is generally recommended for symptom control, with annual reassessment of ongoing need [^114UWJ1K]. Long-term use (> 5 years) may be considered for persistent symptoms or **osteoporosis prevention**, with careful risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^114UWJ1K].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess efficacy, safety, and adherence [^115vZyd6]. Clinical assessments should occur **every 6–12 months**, evaluating symptom control, side effects, and adherence. Laboratory monitoring is not routinely required but may be considered in select cases (e.g. poor symptom control, suspicion of non-adherence) [^1134k2WV]. Imaging, such as routine pelvic ultrasound, is not indicated in asymptomatic patients without a uterus.

## Risks and benefits of estrogen therapy in patients without a uterus

### Benefits

Benefits include **effective relief** of vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms [^115TEqN9] and improved bone mineral density with reduced fracture risk [^114zbvE8] [^114hT7ZK]. Observational data also suggest a reduced risk of breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy compared to combined therapy [^1148X84h] [^113AbKhG].

---

### Risks

- Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly with oral formulations [^113r69Zv] [^111ZzYLd].
- Slightly increased risk of stroke, especially in older women or those with cardiovascular risk factors [^113hwBKz] [^112BccEB].
- Long-term use may be associated with a modest increase in breast cancer risk, though lower than with combined estrogen-progestin therapy [^1148X84h] [^114Xa453].

---

## Special considerations

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Use transdermal formulations in patients at increased VTE risk [^112LUkkN] [^113r69Zv].
- **Breast cancer risk**: Individualize therapy and consider patient-specific risk factors [^1134k2WV] [^115TEqN9].
- **Genitourinary symptoms**: Consider local vaginal estrogen therapy as first-line treatment [^1146ThMd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Estrogen-alone therapy** is appropriate for menopausal patients without a uterus [^111q3rop].
- **Progestogen is not required** in the absence of a uterus [^112UYgJk].
- **Start with the lowest effective dose** and titrate based on symptom control [^1134k2WV].
- **Prefer transdermal formulations** in patients at increased VTE risk [^113r69Zv] [^114dXc9d].
- **Reassess therapy annually**, balancing benefits and risks [^114UWJ1K].

---

Estrogen therapy is effective for menopausal symptom management in patients without a uterus, with **estrogen-alone therapy** being the preferred approach. Therapy should be individualized, starting with the lowest effective dose and adjusted based on clinical response, with regular monitoring and reassessment of ongoing need.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to administer estrogen-progestogen regimens either continuously (estrogen-progestogen taken every day) or following a cyclic regimen, with estrogen taken every day and progestogen taken for 12–14 days every month. Consider administering estrogen alone taken every day in patients with hysterectomy.

### Options for hormone therapy in women who have had a hysterectomy [^112UYgJk]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review postmenopausal hormone therapy for women who have undergone hysterectomy with or without bilateral oophorectomy and to make clinical recommendations regarding changes in regimens compared with those for women with their uterus in place.

Design

We conducted a literature review, including a review of current guidelines.

Results

When the uterus is absent, estrogen treatment is all that is needed when hot flashes and/or genital atrophic symptoms are associated with surgical or natural menopause. Reasons to add a progestogen to an estrogen-only therapy regimen after hysterectomy include the need to reduce the risk for unopposed estrogen-dependent conditions, chief among which are endometriosis or endometrial neoplasia. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that regimens containing both estrogen and progestogen versus estrogen alone are associated with a greater relative risk of breast cancer without additional improvement in relief of hot flashes or vaginal symptoms. When a bilateral oophorectomy is performed before natural menopause, the onset of menopausal symptoms, primarily vasomotor symptoms, genital tract atrophy, and/or a decline in sexual function, is rapid, and the symptoms are more severe. Thus, the need for a decision on the use of hormone therapy is accelerated.

Conclusions

The decision to use or not use menopausal hormone therapy in women without a uterus should involve an individualized risk/benefit analysis just as it should when the uterus is present. After hysterectomy, for most patients, current literature results favor not including a progestogen. Data suggest an attenuation of the potential cardiovascular benefit of estrogen therapy in this situation, yet no better protection against bone fractures and an increase in the risk for breast cancer when both estrogen and progestogen are used.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114TgzZq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned a review of the literature to update evidence about the benefits and harms of using menopausal hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions, as well as whether the benefits and harms of hormone therapy differ by population subgroups defined by age; the presence of comorbid medical conditions; and the type, dose, and method of hormonal delivery.

Population

This recommendation applies to postmenopausal women who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness. It also does not apply to women younger than 50 years who have had surgical menopause.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. (Grade D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. (Grade D recommendation).

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, NAMS 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- estrogen therapy carries a class effect risk of VTE

- low-dose vaginal estrogen may carry a very low risk but there has been no report of an increased risk in the vaginal estrogen clinical trials

- insufficient evidence in high-risk patients.

---

### Managing menopause [^11282Kge]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, more specifically with respect to patients with early menopause, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to add cyclic (at least 12 days/month) or continuous progestogen therapy to estrogen therapy in patients with an intact uterus, and monitor adherence to the progestogen therapy.

---

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116ub51F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of vasomotor symptoms, hormonal therapy, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider initiating estrogen therapy (after hysterectomy) or estrogen plus progestogen therapy (without hysterectomy) in menopausal patients < 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause with bothersome vasomotor symptoms (with or without additional climacteric symptoms) not having contraindications or excess cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and willing to take menopausal hormone therapy.

---

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115P3vka]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Menopause occurs at a median age of 51.3 years, and the average US woman who reaches menopause is expected to live another 30 years. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disease, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase with age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publication of findings from the Women's Health Initiative that hormone therapy use is associated with serious adverse health effects in postmenopausal women, use of menopausal hormone therapy has declined.

Objective

To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on the use of menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups or by timing of intervention after menopause. The review did not address hormone therapy for preventing or treating menopausal symptoms.

Findings

Although the use of hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal women is associated with some benefits, there are also well-documented harms. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of both the benefits and the harms of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women is small to moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that combined estrogen and progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions for most postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and that estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions for most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. (D recommendation).

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, more specifically with respect to patients with breast cancer, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend vaginal estrogens in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors (where the goal of adjuvant therapy is a complete absence of estrogen at the tissue level). Its use in this circumstance needs to be dictated by quality-of-life concerns after discussion of possible risks.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.

One ring inserted into the vagina for 3 months. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. (2.1, 2.2)

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

Start therapy with 0.05 mg/day. Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response.

Therapy should be started at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.

2.2 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy due to Menopause.

Start therapy with 0.05 mg/day. Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response.

Therapy should be started at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^114hT7ZK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) recommendation — In postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture and with the patient characteristics below, we suggest menopausal HT, using estrogen only in women with hysterectomy, to prevent all types of fractures. Patient characteristics include: Under 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause; at low risk of DVT; those in whom bisphosphonates or denosumab are not appropriate; with bothersome vasomotor symptoms; without contraindications; without prior myocardial infarction or stroke; without breast cancer; willing to take menopausal HT.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy: risks and benefits [^112LUkkN]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal hormone therapy (PMHT) is used for the relief of menopausal symptoms, but the dosage has varied greatly throughout its existence. By the end of the 1990s, PMHT was mainly used to prevent chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, coronary heart disease and dementia, and large prevention trials were undertaken in this context. Following the initial negative reports of these trials, use of PMHT dramatically decreased. These reports noted surprisingly increased risks, notably of coronary heart disease, stroke and breast cancer, in people who used PMHT. Nowadays, considering the currently available data, it seems that an important distinction should be made between the treatment of climacteric symptoms in young, generally healthy, postmenopausal women and the prevention of chronic diseases in elderly women. PMHT seems to be beneficial and safe for postmenopausal symptomatic women aged < 60 years. Treatments with a high safety profile should be the preferred option, including low-dose PMHT, oestrogen-only therapy in women who have had a hysterectomy, and vaginal oestrogen therapy for women with atrophic vaginitis. Nonandrogenic progestin might have a reduced thrombotic and breast cancer risk, and transdermal oestrogen could have a reduced thrombotic risk. Nevertheless, PMHT should not be used for the prevention of chronic diseases in the elderly (> 70 years old) owing to the increased risk of stroke and breast cancer in these patients.

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114cs6Gh]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle. It is defined retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period. Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, is the few-year time period preceding a person's final menstrual period and is characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea, and often symptoms such as vasomotor dysfunction. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and fracture) increase with age, and US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years.

Objective

To update its 2017 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons and whether outcomes vary by age or by timing of intervention after menopause.

Population

Asymptomatic postmenopausal persons who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons with an intact uterus has no net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy. (D recommendation).

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1156bYVs]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) hormone therapy — primary prevention in postmenopausal persons: For the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons, the USPSTF states "Do not use combined estrogen and progestin. Grade D". For postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy, the USPSTF states "Do not use estrogen alone. Grade D". The recommendation applies to "asymptomatic, postmenopausal persons who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions" and "does not apply to persons who are considering hormone therapy for the management of perimenopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness" or to those who "have had premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) or surgical menopause". Implementation language reiterates "Do not use combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons" and "Do not use estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy".

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^111sdCaC]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

Generally, a woman without a uterus, does not need a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine whether treatment is still necessary.

Daily administration of 0.25 to 1.25 grams of estradiol gel 0.1% to the right or left upper thigh on alternating days. Women should be started with the lowest effective dose and the dose should be evaluated periodically (2).

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

Start therapy with the 0.25 grams applied once daily on the skin of either the right or left upper thigh. Adjust the dose up to a maximum of 1.25 grams, as needed.

The application surface area should be about 5 by 7 inches (approximately the size of two palm prints). The entire contents of a unit dose packet should be applied each day. To avoid potential skin irritation, apply estradiol gel 0.1% to the right or left upper thigh on alternating days. Do not apply estradiol gel 0.1% on the face, breasts, or irritated skin or in or around the vagina. Allow gel to dry after application before dressing. Do not wash the

application site within 1 hour after applying estradiol gel 0.1%. Avoid contact of the gel with eyes. Wash hands after application.

### Estrogen and androgen hormone therapy and well-being in surgically postmenopausal women [^1114hiRj]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Women undergoing surgical menopause experience an abrupt drop in gonadal hormones and are more likely to have symptoms that negatively impact well-being, including hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, psychological problems, and testosterone deficiency. The purpose of this review was to examine the effects of hormone therapies on well-being among surgically menopausal women.

Methods

Studies were retrieved using both Cochrane and PubMed searches. A systematic literature review was performed to identify double-blind randomized controlled trials of the effects of menopausal hormone therapies on quality of life and well-being among women who have undergone hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Two studies meeting these criteria were included for review.

Results

For each study reviewed, the following aspects were examined: type of hormonal therapies used, inclusion/exclusion criteria, overall changes, and changes in specific parameters of well-being. General well-being improved from baseline with certain types and doses of estrogen or estrogen plus testosterone therapy, with no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Estrogen with or without testosterone may improve general well-being in some groups of surgically menopausal women. Levels of serum estrogen achieved in these studies were within a normal range for premenopausal women. Adding testosterone to estrogen therapy may provide additional improvements in well-being in some women, but only at supraphysiological levels of total testosterone and physiological levels of free testosterone. It is recommended that the clinician discuss the potential benefits and risks with each woman and devise an individualized plan based on shared decision making.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen therapy is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer [see Boxed Warning].

A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.16)].

Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.

PREMARIN may be taken without regard to meals.

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose. Generally, women should be started at 0.3 mg PREMARIN daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider.

PREMARIN therapy may be given continuously, with no interruption in therapy, or in cyclical regimens (regimens such as 25 days on drug followed by 5 days off drug), as is medically appropriate on an individual basis.

Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endometrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose, and different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen (sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associations with health outcomes; patient preference can and should be considered because many women will opt for regimens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^11751s9S]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

There is a long-held notion that estrogen exposure will increase the risk for breast cancer. Conversely, a body of emerging clinical and basic research evidence suggests that progestogens (synthetic or endogenous progesterone) are most likely the primary hormonal factor underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Progestogens appear to be the principal hormone driving the development and recurrence of breast cancer, while estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk by amplifying progesterone signaling.

It has been well recognized that HRT provides an array of health benefits — including alleviation of menopausal symptoms, mood improvement, weight control, and prevention of bone fractures. There are, however, risks that need to be weighed for HRT use. Estrogen-alone HRT may increase endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, while estrogen-plus-progestin therapy could increase breast cancer risk in these women. Therefore, the risks and benefits of HRT should be carefully assessed for individual women. If a woman with an average risk for breast cancer and an intact uterus, for instance, experiences significant menopausal symptoms, she may opt for estrogen, combined with minimal use of micronized progesterone or progestin–IUD to counter potential endometrial hyperplasia. If she is more concerned about breast cancer risk than endometrial cancer risk, she may choose estrogen alone at a lower dose and regularly monitor endometrial growth. In postmenopausal women seeking HRT after a hysterectomy alone or in combination with an oophorectomy, estrogen alone would relieve menopausal symptoms with minimal cancer risks.

Overall, current scientific evidence suggests that estrogen therapy, coupled with minimal use of a progestogen, is likely to offer net health benefits in women in need of HRT.

### Estradiol (Estrace) [^113pNF6t]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use of ESTRACE alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should reevaluate periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. For treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible. For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, including directed and random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.

Usual Dosage: The usual dosage range is 2 to 4 g (marked on the applicator) daily for one or two weeks, then gradually reduced to one half initial dosage for a similar period. A maintenance dosage of 1 g, one to three times a week, may be used after restoration of the vaginal mucosa has been achieved.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women [^111chydf]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

MHT remains the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, and professional societies in North America recommend it primarily for managing vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndromes, and bone loss arising from menopause, though not for the prevention of coronary heart diseases or any other chronic conditions. They also recommend starting MHT as early as possible before 60 years of age when the risk-benefit ratio is favorable, as well as using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to manage symptoms and tailoring MHT use to each woman with a periodic risk-benefit reassessment.

The present study showed that although estrogen-only formulations are still the most widely prescribed MHT, the use of combined estrogen plus progestogen is gaining ground once more, accounting for more than one-third of current MHT use. MHT formulations are associated with different risk profiles, with a better safety profile for estrogen only. Long-term follow-up from Women's Health Initiative trials showed an elevated risk of breast cancer among women with a uterus assigned to conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, but a reduced risk among women with prior hysterectomy assigned to conjugated equine estrogen alone.

Although menopausal symptoms affect women of all races and ethnicities, racial differences in menopausal transition have been documented, with non-Hispanic Black women having an earlier start and longer duration of transition than non-Hispanic White women. Additionally, non-Hispanic Black women are more likely to experience severe menopausal symptoms but less likely to receive treatment for these symptoms. These symptoms not only considerably impair women's quality of life, but also lead to an estimated $1.8 billion in annual cost due to adverse outcomes in the US. Studies are needed to determine which of the current MHTs are safest and most acceptable for use among women with symptomatic menopausal transition.

If contraindications are present, consider alternative nonhormonal therapy. If no contraindications are present, the ideal candidate for starting MHT is defined by all of the following: 1) < 60 y of age; 2) Within 10 years since menopause onset; 3) No elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, or breast cancer. For oral formulations, if previous hysterectomy use estrogen only; if uterus intact use estrogen plus progesterone or bazedoxifene, and during MHT use monitor for abnormal vaginal bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia.

WARNINGS and WARNINGS .) For women who have a uterus, adequate
diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be
undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a
uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial
cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone
or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and
for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the
individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically
appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is
still necessary (See BOXED

### Current and evolving approaches to individualizing estrogen receptor-based therapy for menopausal women [^113Ykdiy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Adding progestogens to estrogens changes the risk profile of hormonal therapy for menopausal women, and recent data support the need for progestogen-free options. Several current and evolving approaches to managing estrogen deficiency allow for progestogen omission. We review the mechanisms of estrogen activity and provide an overview of emerging and available estrogen receptor (ER)-based therapies.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for relevant English-language articles using keywords pertaining to estrogen deficiency, menopause, hormone therapy, and estrogen-only therapy. Pivotal or recent randomized controlled trials, large observational studies, comprehensive meta-analyses, and established therapeutic guidelines were compiled.

Evidence Synthesis

Advances in our understanding of ER pharmacology have led to therapies designed to optimize ER activity, including selective ER modulators (SERMs) and tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSECs). Each estrogen, SERM, and TSEC exhibits a unique profile of tissue-specific activity, spanning the spectrum from ER agonism to antagonism. Systemic estrogens unopposed by progestogens effectively manage menopausal symptoms in hysterectomized postmenopausal women but require progestogen use in postmenopausal women with a uterus. SERMs are effective for managing certain aspects of estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women, but data suggest that pairing a SERM with estrogens to form a TSEC provides a more optimal therapeutic profile for women with a uterus.

Conclusions

Treating signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency requires an individualized approach based on a woman's goals and the purported risks of different therapies. New and emerging agents have demonstrated efficacy in postmenopausal women with a uterus, while allowing these women to avoid progestogens and their possible adverse effects.

### Menopausal hormone therapy influence on breast cancer outcomes in the women's health initiative [^113AbKhG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

The Woman's Health Initiative has conducted 2 full-scale, placebo-controlled clinical trials to determine the influence of menopausal therapy on breast cancer incidence and outcome. Estrogen plus progestin use in postmenopausal women with a uterus increases breast cancer incidence and deaths from breast cancer. Despite a short-term reduction in risk after stopping estrogen plus progestin use, an increase in breast cancer risk persists postintervention. Estrogen-alone use in postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy reduces breast cancer incidence and reduces deaths from breast cancer. The reduced breast cancer risk persists for several years after stopping estrogen-alone use but is lost in late postintervention. These findings suggest recalibration of breast cancer risk and benefit consideration for both regimens, with estrogen plus progestin use associated with greater risk and estrogen-alone use associated with greater benefit. Use of either regimen in clinical practice requires careful consideration of all clinical risks and benefits.

### Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women's health outcomes by types, routes, and doses [^113yr3Mr]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial reported that menopausal estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT) in menopausal women average age 63 years increased the occurrence of invasive breast cancer, stroke, and coronary heart disease, although it reduced fractures. The press presented the negative outcomes in a dramatic manner that some described as misleading. However, most of these negative results lost significance when corrected for multiple testing. The second WHI study in 2004 examined the effect of estrogen therapy (ET) on these same outcomes in similar aged but hysterectomized women and reported a near significant reduction in breast cancer, which became a significant 22% reduction in WHI's long-term follow-up of that study. However, these positive results got little press attention and did little to reduce the fears about hormone therapy (HT) that had been already implanted in the public's mind. The US Food and Drug Administration has required all estrogen-containing products to include a black-box warning for serious adverse events associated with its use, even though the WHI trials only studied one type (conjugated estrogen), dosage (0.625 mg), and route (oral) of estrogen alone and in combination with one type of progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg). Furthermore, continuing or initiating HT after 65 years is rarely recommended. Until recently, it was often thought that women do not need hormone therapy much after menopause because no serious menopausal symptoms persist in women aged 65 years or older. However, studies reported that menopausal vasomotor symptoms persisted for 7–12 years in many women, and some vasomotor symptoms persisted in 42.1% of women aged 60–65 years, which suggests that not few numbers of women continue to suffer from vasomotor symptoms even after age 65 years. According to the 2022 HT position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), there is no general rule for stopping HT in a woman aged 65 years. For healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms, continuing HT beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling and regular assessment of risks and benefits. Moreover, the mitigation of risks through the choice of low dose, nonoral, and different estrogen and progestogen becomes increasingly important as women age. However, information on the effects of different HT formulation, dosing, and route of administration is lacking.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer: what is the true size of the increased risk? [^115MQtnX]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) provides effective relief from climacteric symptoms but some are associated with increased risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. The MHT prescribing decreased rapidly after its adverse effects on risk of breast cancer were highlighted in reports from the Women's Health Initiative trial and the Million Women Study, but nevertheless it continues to be used by many women worldwide.

Accurate information about the risks (and benefits) of MHT is essential to allow women to make informed decisions about their health, and evidence from observational studies is important because it is no longer justifiable to conduct long-term trials of MHT safety. There are, however, shortfalls in the way information has been collected and analysed in most published epidemiological studies. In prospective studies that only collect information on MHT up to the time of recruitment (e.g. cohort studies with no follow-up questionnaires) current use of MHT and duration of use may be misclassified because some never users of MHT will become users during follow-up, and some users will become ex-users; this may lead to biased assessment of breast cancer risk in relation to MHT use but the extent has not been assessed empirically. In addition, analyses that include women who have had simple hysterectomy (i.e. without oophorectomy) before natural menopause will also lead to biased results but many case–control and cohort studies include such women. Thus, although the epidemiological evidence clearly shows an increased risk of breast cancer with MHT use, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the risk.

To address these issues we used serial questionnaire information from the Breakthrough Generations Study (BGS), which has ascertained MHT use and menopausal status at entry and during prospective follow-up, to estimate the relative risk of breast cancer in relation to MHT use among women whose age at menopause was known. We also assessed the likely extent of the biases that occur when only baseline questionnaire information is available and if women with simple hysterectomy are included in analyses.

### Norethindrone acetate / ethinyl estradiol (femhrt) [^11493cQo]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Patients should be evaluated for breast abnormalities in accordance with good clinical practice.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose.

femhrt therapy consists of a single tablet taken once daily.

1. For the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms associated with the menopause

femhrt should be given once daily for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. Patients should be reevaluated at 3 to 6 month intervals to determine if treatment is still necessary.

2. For Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

When prescribing solely of the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, femhrt should only be prescribed to postmenopausal women who are at significant risk of osteoporosis. Non-estrogen medications should be carefully considered. Risk factors for osteoporosis include low bone mineral density, low estrogen levels, family history of osteoporosis, previous fracture, small frame (low BMI), light skin color, smoking, and alcohol intake. Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. Response to therapy can be assessed during treatment by measuring biochemical markers of bone formation/resorption, and/or bone mineral density.

NCCN Uterine neoplasms — hormone therapy for hypoestrogenism: After BSO, hypoestrogenism is associated with hot flashes, mood lability, vaginal dryness, pelvic soft tissue atrophy, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although patients who have had BSO for endometrioid adenocarcinoma have usually been denied estrogen therapy and estrogen therapy for such patients remains controversial, it has never been proven that relapse rates are higher in patients with endometrial cancer who receive estrogen therapy after hysterectomy; several retrospective trials have shown no increase in tumor recurrence or cancer-related deaths. In females with stage I to II endometrial cancer who had hysterectomy, a randomized trial of estrogen therapy versus placebo did not find an increased rate of recurrence or new malignancy; the median follow-up was 35.7 months. Outside the cancer context, estrogen therapy trials in postmenopausal females without a history of malignancy have demonstrated a significantly increased risk for breast cancer; in the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen-Alone Trial in hysterectomized females (n = 10,739), the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease (eg, stroke) were increased and the trial was stopped.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### Estradiol (Estradiol vaginal) [^11189jwN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Use of Estradiol Vaginal Cream 0.01% alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should reevaluate periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. For treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible. For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, including directed and random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.

Usual Dosage: The usual dosage range is 2 to 4 g (marked on the applicator) daily for one or two weeks, then gradually reduced to one half initial dosage for a similar period. A maintenance dosage of 1 g, one to three times a week, may be used after restoration of the vaginal mucosa has been achieved. NOTE: The number of doses per tube will vary with dosage requirements and patient handling.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: analyses of data from 2 women's health initiative randomized clinical trials [^1148X84h]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice, but reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use.

Objective

To report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the 2 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010.

Interventions

A total of 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years, and 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and postintervention phases in the 2 HT trials.

Results

In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for 2 years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout intervention, becoming significantly increased for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early postintervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence in the combined HT group, though the HR remained higher than 1 (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.90–1.70). During the late postintervention phase (requiring patient re-consent), the HR for breast cancer risk remained higher than 1 through 5.5 years (median) of additional follow-up (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06–1.77). In the estrogen alone trial, the HR for invasive breast cancer risk was lower than 1 throughout the intervention phase (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.02) and remained lower than 1 in the early postintervention phase (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34–0.89), but risk reduction was not observed during the late postintervention follow-up (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.73–1.87). Characteristics of breast cancers diagnosed during early and late postintervention phases differed in both trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the E+P trial, the higher breast cancer risk seen during intervention was followed by a substantial drop in risk in the early postintervention phase, but a higher breast cancer risk remained during the late postintervention follow-up. In the estrogen alone trial, the lower breast cancer risk seen during intervention was sustained in the early postintervention phase but was not evident during the late postintervention follow-up.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Changing concepts: menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer [^114PeAjA]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Hormone therapy is still used by millions of women for menopausal symptoms. Concerns regarding hormone therapy and breast cancer were initially based on case reports and retrospective case-control studies. However, recent results from large prospective cohort studies and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized placebo-controlled hormone therapy trials have substantially changed concepts regarding how estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin influence breast cancer. The preponderance of observational studies suggested that estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin both increased the risk of breast cancer, with cancers commonly diagnosed at an early stage. However, substantially different results emerged from the WHI randomized hormone therapy trials. In the WHI trial evaluating estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, combined hormone therapy statistically significantly increased the risk of breast cancer and hindered breast cancer detection, leading to delayed diagnosis and a statistically significant increase in breast cancer mortality. By contrast, estrogen alone use by postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy in the WHI trial did not substantially interfere with breast cancer detection and statistically significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer. Differential mammography usage patterns may explain differences between observational study and randomized trial results. In clinical practice, hormone therapy users have mammograms more frequently than nonusers, leading to more and earlier stage cancer detection. By contrast, in the WHI randomized trials, mammogram frequency was protocol mandated and balanced between comparison groups. Currently, the different effects of estrogen plus progestin vs estrogen alone on breast cancer are not completely understood.

### Surgical versus natural menopause: cognitive issues [^111XWb2R]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Women who undergo both natural and surgical menopause experience the loss of cyclic ovarian production of estrogen, but hormonal and demographic differences distinguish these two groups of women. Our objective was to review published evidence on whether the premature cessation of endogenous estrogen production in women who underwent a surgical menopause has deleterious consequences for cognitive aging and to determine whether consequences differ for women if they undergo natural menopause. Studies of estrogen-containing hormone therapy are relevant to this issue.

Design

We reviewed evidence-based research, including the systematic identification of randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy with cognitive outcomes that included an objective measure of episodic memory.

Results

As inferred from very small, short-term, randomized, controlled trials of high-dose estrogen treatment, surgical menopause may be accompanied by cognitive impairment that primarily affects verbal episodic memory. Observational evidence suggests that the natural menopausal transition is not accompanied by substantial changes in cognitive abilities. For initiation of hormone therapy during perimenopause or early postmenopause when the ovaries are intact, limited clinical trial data provide no consistent evidence of short-term benefit or harm. There is stronger clinical trial evidence that initiation of hormone therapy in late postmenopause does not benefit episodic memory or other cognitive skills.

Conclusions

Further research is needed on the long-term cognitive consequences of surgical menopause and long-term cognitive consequences of hormone therapy initiated near the time of surgical or natural menopause. A potential short-term cognitive benefit might be weighed when a premenopausal woman considers initiation of estrogen therapy at the time of, or soon after, hysterectomy and oophorectomy for benign conditions, although data are still quite limited and estrogen is not approved for this indication. Older postmenopausal women should not initiate hormone therapy to improve or maintain cognitive skills.

### The women's health initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy: lessons learned [^116xRGvZ]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) assessed oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) taken with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for prevention of chronic disease in postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years.

Methods

Women with an intact uterus (n = 16,608) were randomized to CEE+ MPA therapy or placebo for a median of 5.6 years; women with hysterectomy (n = 10,739) were randomized to CEE-alone therapy or placebo for a median of 7.2 years. Both cohorts have been followed for 18 years.

Results

In the overall study population (mean age, 63 y), neither estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) nor estrogen-only therapy prevented coronary heart disease or led to a favorable balance of chronic-disease benefits and risks. Subgroup analyses, however, suggest that timing of hormone therapy (HT) initiation influences the relation between HT and coronary risk, as well as its overall benefit-risk balance, with more favorable effects in women who are younger (age < 60 year) or recently menopausal (within 10 year) than in women who are older or further past the menopausal transition. In younger women who entered the trial of estrogen-only therapy with oophorectomy, the intervention was associated with a significant 32% reduction in all-cause mortality over long-term follow-up.

Conclusions

WHI findings indicate important differences in HT-related clinical outcomes by age and time since menopause. Systemic HT has an acceptable safety profile for menopause management when initiated among healthy women who are younger (or recently menopausal) and not at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease or breast cancer. Initiation of treatment in older women who are distant from menopause onset, however, should be avoided. Other HT formulations and routes of delivery warrant further study.(WHI clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00000611).

### A theory of eu-estrogenemia: a unifying concept [^112iCdrs]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The numerous observational studies of the 1980s, which concluded that estrogen reduced the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis, were affected by the prevailing surgical and medical attitude of the time. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was preferable to high-dose OCs to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. (Generally, physicians did not prescribe OC pills in women over age 35 years.) Hysterectomy with BSO would be recommended for an abnormal PAP smear in a woman desiring permanent contraception, and also in women with pelvic organ prolapse (during an era of Cesarean section rates of < 10%) or dysmenorrhea, or with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), before the 1986 introduction of fluoxetine, the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

But why oophorectomy you ask? As explained by Mattingly in TeLinde's fifth edition of Operative Gynecology, the "effect of castration on atherosclerosis or osteoporosis is not yet settled. physical activity has the greater role on osteoid deposition and reabsorption than any other factor. menopausal and post-menopausal ovaries produce androgen primarily. androgen is converted to estrogen (estrone) in extragonal tissue". "(Studies) support… removing both ovaries after the age of between 40 and 45 who are undergoing a hysterectomy. Against the disagreeable symptoms of the menopause, one must balance the possibility of malignancy developing in retained ovaries". He wrote that the 1970's annual US death rate was 10,000 lives from ovarian malignancy alone (1% risk in women over 40.) "Retained ovaries leave the patient at risk for pelvic pain, cystic degeneration, and asymptomatic enlargement" (thus a concern for malignancy). "Should the premature ovarian castration be performed at the age between 40 and 35, it is considered advisable that most women should receive temporary substitutional estrogen therapy, preferably with naturally occurring estrogen, to avoid estrogen withdrawal symptoms". "… estrogen replacement until the average age of menopause seems a reasonable solution to the debate of the possible increased risk of coronary artery disease and osteoporosis in patients with premature castration".

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

1. **Given cyclically for short-term use only**:

For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause in patients not improved by estrogen alone.

The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible.

Administration should be cyclic (e.g., three weeks on and one week off). Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at three to six month intervals.

Usual Dosage Range

1 tablet of ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE FULL STRENGTH or 1 to 2 tablets of ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE HALF STRENGTH daily as recommended by the physician.

Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely for signs of endometrial cancer and appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy in the event of persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

### Esterified estrogens and methytestesterone [^114za6U2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary. (See BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS .) For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Given cyclically for short-term use only:

For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause in patients not improved by estrogen alone.

The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible.

Administration should be cyclic (e.g., three weeks on and one week off). Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at three- to six month intervals.

Usual Dosage Range:

1 tablet of Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone Tablets or 1 to 2 tablets of Esterified Estrogens and Methyltestosterone Tablets H.S. daily as recommended by the physician.

Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely for signs of endometrial cancer and appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy in the event of persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

### Menopausal symptom management in patients after risk-reducing oophorectomy [^114nWVuD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations face difficult decisions on pursuing risk-reducing (and lifesaving) surgery, especially because of concerns about the safety of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk. However, observational data suggest that systemic menopausal hormone therapy does not elevate breast cancer risk among patients with pathogenic mutations with intact breasts who have undergone risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before age 45 years. Accordingly, such individuals should be considered for menopausal hormone therapy to improve quality of life and to decrease health risks associated with premature menopause. Given emerging data on the potential of estrogen-only therapy to reduce breast cancer risk, clinicians caring for women with BRCA1/2 mutations could consider offering hysterectomy along with BSO as part of risk-reducing surgery.

Areas of scientific uncertainty — Although observational studies, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and smaller RCTs with surrogate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers suggest benefit when hormone therapy is initiated in women younger than 60 years and/or within 10 years of menopause onset, "significant research gaps remain regarding dose, formulation, route of delivery, and duration of use".

### Low-dose topical estrogen for vaginal atrophy treatment… [^117DDxWa]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Background: Endogenous estradiol levels fall significantly after menopause, leading estrogen-dependent tissues to gradually atrophy. Vaginal atrophy can cause dryness, soreness, irritation, and dyspareunia, and may contribute to vaginal and bladder infections. Estrogen therapy can reduce these symptoms. Locally administered estrogen is recommended over systemic estrogen therapy for treating vaginal atrophy, and may be continued for as long as symptoms are bothersome. The typical dose is 25 mcg of estradiol, administered via vaginal tablet or vaginal gel, initially daily and then twice weekly for maintenance. Reports from other studies have indicated that lower doses of estrogen may be as effective for treating vaginal atrophy. Simon and associates studied the effectiveness and safety of a 10-mcg vaginal tablet for treating vaginal atrophy.

The Study: Conducted at 49 sites in the United States and Canada, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled postmenopausal women to receive the 10-mcg dose or placebo. Participants were eligible if they were at least 45 years of age, were at least two years from their last menstrual cycle or from bilateral oophorectomy, and reported at least three urogenital symptoms, including vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, or soreness; dysuria; or dyspareunia and vaginal bleeding with sexual activity. Each patient was instructed to insert the vaginal tablet at the same time each day for 14 days and then twice a week. Symptoms were assessed at two, four, eight, 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks, with objective measures including vaginal pH and the percentage of premenopausal- to postmenopausal-type vaginal epithelium.

Using intention-to-treat analysis, it was determined that, starting at two weeks, vaginal health was statistically improved over placebo, and these improvements continued over the 52-week study. Urogenital complaints also trended toward improvement at two weeks and became statistically significant at 12 weeks. Side effects were mild and occurred at similar rates in both groups. Previously published comparisons report low systemic absorption with all vaginal estrogen preparations and no significant differences among them in the incidence of hyperplasia, endometrial thickness, and adverse events. Conclusion: The study results indicate that 10-mcg estradiol vaginal tablets appear to be effective for treating postmenopausal vaginal atrophy.

### Ultralow-dose estradiol and BMD in postmenopausal women… [^112NBBDt]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, the recommended treatment for menopausal symptoms is the shortest regimen and lowest possible dosage of postmenopausal hormone therapy. The estimated minimum dosage of estrogen necessary to preserve bone mass is based on studies of young women who have undergone oophorectomy. However, these estimates may be too high for post-menopausal women, because even low levels of endogenous plasma estradiol can increase bone density and reduce fracture risk in this group. Ettinger and colleagues studied the effect of an ultralow dosage of transdermal estradiol on bone density and endometrial hyperplasia in post-menopausal women. After intake assessment, 209 patients were randomized to receive placebo and 208 patients were randomized to receive an estradiol patch in a dosage of 0. 014 mg per day for two years. All patients received daily calcium and vitamin D supplements.

The authors assessed adverse effects and compliance at four-month follow-up visits, and endometrial biopsies were attempted annually. The primary outcomes were endometrial hyperplasia and change in lumbar spine BMD at two years. Secondary outcomes included incidence of fractures and biochemical markers of bone turnover. P = 0.17). Mean plasma estradiol levels increased significantly in the treatment group but were unchanged in the placebo group. Serious adverse events such as cancer, hospitalization, and death occurred with equal frequency in both groups. Three patients in the treatment group were diagnosed with endometrial polyps compared with two patients in the placebo group. One patient in the treatment group developed uterine adenosarcoma and one had focal atypical hyperplasia. The authors conclude that ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol therapy successfully improves BMD without increasing endometrial hyperplasia or inducing breast pathology in postmenopausal women.

They advocate redefining estrogen "deficiency" in this age group to levels closer to 5 to 10 pg per mL instead of the 50 to 200 pg per mL recommended for premenopausal women. Would sufficient numbers of women be willing to enroll in such studies to generate the statistical power needed for results on which we can reliably base these crucial decisions. — A. D. W.

### Conjugated estrogens / bazedoxifene (duavee) for menopausal… [^113GsSPR]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene combines conjugated estrogen with bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Bazedoxifene stimulates estrogen receptors in bone and has antagonistic effects in the breast and uterus. 1 Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene is labeled for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
2. 2 However, in studies of 7, 487 patients, there was no increase in endometrial hyperplasia. There is not enough research to directly evaluate the effect of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene on thrombotic or cardiovascular events. 1, 3, 4 Because of established risks of estrogen agonists/antagonists, conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene should not be used with other estrogen preparations or in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, breast cancer, estrogen-dependent neoplasia, venous or arterial thromboembolism, liver disease, or thrombophilic disorders.

EFFECTIVENESS Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene reduces the number and severity of hot flashes, decreases pain with intercourse, and reduces vaginal dryness vs. placebo. 1, 3, 6 Also, use of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene results in statistically significant improvements in sexual functioning, menopause-related quality of life, sleep quality, and satisfaction with treatment. 7–9 Improvements in sleep quality and quality of life are similar to those seen with conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone.
9. For the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene will maintain or slightly increase bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and hip. Its effect on vertebral, hip, or overall fracture rate is not known. 4, 5, 10 Although conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene does not affect breast density, studies have not examined its use for the prevention of breast cancer.
11.

Bottom Line Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene is effective for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and may be better tolerated than conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone. It will maintain bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and hip, but its effect on fractures is not known. Cardiovascular safety beyond two years is not known.
