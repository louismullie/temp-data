## Question

What is the infected dental socket and its treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what an infected dental socket is and how it is treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and distinguishing it from look-alikes like dry socket and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and imaging approach. Next, I will review risk factors and pathophysiology to guide prevention. After that, I need to outline evidence-based treatment, including local and systemic measures, and when to escalate to surgery. Finally, I should consider special populations, antibiotic stewardship, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its boundaries. An infected dental socket, also termed an acutely infected socket or alveolar osteitis with secondary infection, presents with severe pain, localized erythema, swelling, purulent drainage, and sometimes halitosis, typically arising within 2–3 days after extraction, and it must be differentiated from sterile alveolar osteitis (dry socket) and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), which are pathobiologically distinct and managed differently [^114Hwy4Z] [^1139Sw4V].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria and imaging approach before jumping to treatment. Clinically, I should look for pain out of proportion, localized warmth and swelling, purulence, and sometimes a foul odor. Radiographs are often normal early but may show ill-defined lucency if osteomyelitis is evolving, whereas CT is more sensitive for cortical destruction, sequestra, and sinus tracts, and MRI can detect marrow changes earlier in osteomyelitis. I should also remember that MRONJ requires exposed or probeable bone persisting beyond 8 weeks in patients on antiresorptives, so I need to check medication history carefully [^111gKNz7] [^111bVNVP] [^117T5LYH].

> Hold on, let's not conflate entities. Dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is primarily a painful, noninfectious fibrinolytic failure of clot organization without purulence. An infected socket adds bacterial infection and purulence to that milieu, whereas MRONJ reflects nonhealing exposed necrotic bone in antiresorptive therapy and is not a simple post-extraction infection. I should confirm these distinctions because they change management substantially [^114Hwy4Z] [^117T5LYH].

> Next, I should review risk factors to anticipate who is vulnerable and tailor prevention. Traumatic extractions, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing periapical or periodontal infection, smoking, and immunocompromise increase risk; female hormonal factors such as oral contraceptive use and menstrual timing have also been implicated in some cohorts, and posterior mandibular sites carry higher risk than anterior or maxillary sites; I need to check for these at the chairside and document them pre-op [^114s8f6r] [^114W3UPp] [^114Hwy4Z].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to connect mechanism to therapy. In an infected socket, bacterial contamination supervenes on a compromised clot, with mixed oral flora including streptococci and anaerobes. If unchecked, infection can extend into alveolar bone causing osteomyelitis, so source control via debridement and antimicrobial therapy is essential rather than relying on antibiotics alone [^116k1M3x] [^111bVNVP].

> Let me think about immediate local management because this is foundational. Gentle irrigation with sterile saline to remove purulent debris, careful mechanical debridement of necrotic tissue, and placement of a medicated dressing such as zinc oxide eugenol or Alvogyl (eugenol plus butamben and iodoform) provide analgesia and antisepsis. I should confirm that Alvogyl has limited but very low-certainty evidence for superior pain reduction versus zinc oxide eugenol at day 7, and I should avoid traumatic packing that could further disrupt clot or irritate bone [^11333evY] [^113Pr49y].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to routinely add systemic antibiotics for all infected sockets, but I should double-check the strength of evidence and stewardship guidance. For immunocompetent adults with localized odontogenic infection confined to the socket, definitive local drainage and debridement are primary, and antibiotics are adjunctive if there is spreading cellulitis, systemic signs, or host compromise; ADA guidance advises against routine systemic antibiotics for pulpal-periapical pain without systemic features, and Cochrane suggests prophylactic antibiotics reduce infection and dry socket in third molar surgery but with low certainty and potential harms, so I should individualize rather than default to antibiotics in every case [^112N51Ma] [^1159vLbT] [^117UB5P6].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or the infection is spreading? In that scenario, I should escalate to systemic antibiotics targeting oral flora, such as amoxicillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or clindamycin in penicillin allergy, and I should reassess within 48–72 hours; if MRONJ is suspected, stage-based management includes antibacterial rinses, systemic antibiotics for infection, and conservative debridement, with close follow-up and coordination with oncology [^116k1M3x] [^111Jievz].

> I need to ensure I address analgesia and supportive care adequately. NSAIDs are first-line for pain, and short courses of opioids can be considered for severe pain after local measures; I should also reinforce oral hygiene instructions, saltwater or chlorhexidine rinses after 24 hours if tolerated, and avoidance of smoking, vigorous rinsing, or suction that could dislodge clot; let me verify that chlorhexidine rinses have moderate-certainty evidence for preventing dry socket in third molar extractions, which supports their post-extraction rinse use even if the current problem is infected rather than sterile [^114Hwy4Z] [^11333evY].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to surgical management. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, progressive swelling or trismus, suspected osteomyelitis, or sequestrum formation, I should obtain CT imaging and plan surgical drainage, removal of necrotic bone, and possibly stabilization. In MRONJ, staged debridement or resection may be required for advanced disease, coordinated with oncology and restorative planning [^111bVNVP] [^1139Sw4V].

> Hold on, I should verify special population considerations that modify risk and timing. In patients facing hematologic therapy or transplant, extractions should be completed ideally 2–3 weeks pre-therapy to allow epithelial healing, and during cytopenia, management should be conservative with antibiotics and local care, reserving procedures for exceptional cases with hematology input. In patients with prosthetic joints, elective arthroplasty should be delayed until active dental infection is definitively treated and verified resolved, with timing guidance from orthopedic-dental collaboration [^113sWCSj] [^116etJiV] [^113ajTrQ].

> I should confirm antibiotic stewardship principles and follow-up checkpoints. Prescriptions should be indication-specific, duration minimized, and patients instructed to stop when systemic signs resolve; re-evaluation at 48–72 hours is prudent, and I must counsel on safe disposal of unused antibiotics; these practices align with ADA guidance and broader stewardship frameworks to mitigate resistance and adverse effects [^114pCM8F] [^111XQ6x7].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Diagnose infected socket by clinical features and exclude dry socket and MRONJ. Initiate local irrigation and debridement with medicated dressing. Reserve systemic antibiotics for spreading infection, systemic signs, or host compromise. Escalate to imaging and surgery if no improvement or if osteomyelitis/MRONJ is suspected. Tailor prevention and perioperative care to risk factors. And embed follow-up and stewardship into routine care, adjusting for special populations as above [^114Hwy4Z] [^1139Sw4V] [^112N51Ma].

An infected dental socket (alveolar osteitis with secondary infection) is a post-extraction complication marked by **severe pain, halitosis, and exposed bone** [^114Hwy4Z] due to loss or infection of the blood clot, with risk rising in mandibular molars, smokers, and immunocompromised patients [^11333evY]. Management centers on **local debridement and irrigation** with saline or chlorhexidine, placement of a medicated dressing (e.g. Alvogyl or zinc oxide eugenol) [^11333evY], and **systemic antibiotics** when there is spreading infection or systemic signs [^111J8XFr]. Pain control with NSAIDs and cold compresses is essential, and healing typically takes 7–14 days with close follow-up to monitor for osteomyelitis or persistent infection.

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Infected dental socket presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Severe pain**: Typically radiating to the ear, temple, or neck, starting 2–3 days post-extraction [^114Hwy4Z].

- **Halitosis**: Foul odor from the socket due to bacterial overgrowth [^11333evY].

- **Exposed bone**: Partial or total loss of the blood clot, exposing the alveolar bone [^11333evY].

- **Local inflammation**: Erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the surrounding soft tissues [^notfound].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy may occur in severe cases [^notfound].

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and examination; radiographs are not routinely indicated but may be used to exclude retained root fragments or foreign bodies [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of **infected dental socket**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Smoking | Significantly increases risk due to impaired healing and reduced blood supply [^notfound] |
| Poor oral hygiene | Increases bacterial load and infection risk [^114s8f6r] |
| Traumatic extraction | Excessive tissue damage and bone exposure [^114s8f6r] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Reduced immune response and healing capacity [^115iqAkJ] |
| Mandibular molars | Higher incidence compared to other teeth [^114Hwy4Z] |
| Female hormonal factors | Oral contraceptive use and menstrual cycle timing [^114s8f6r] |

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology involves **loss or infection of the blood clot** that normally forms after extraction, exposing bone and allowing bacterial colonization — predominantly anaerobes such as Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium species [^11333evY]. This leads to inflammation, pain, and delayed healing [^11333evY].

---

## Treatment strategies

Effective management of infected dental socket requires a **combination of local and systemic interventions**:

---

### Local management

- **Irrigation**: Thorough irrigation with sterile saline or chlorhexidine solution to remove debris and bacteria [^114Hwy4Z].

- **Debridement**: Gentle mechanical debridement of the socket to remove necrotic tissue and promote healing [^115CswJF].

- **Medicated dressings**: Placement of medicated dressings such as Alvogyl (eugenol, butamben, and iodoform) or zinc oxide eugenol paste to provide analgesia, antiseptic effect, and protect the socket [^11333evY].

- **Suturing**: Primary closure of the socket may be considered in selected cases to promote healing [^115CswJF].

---

### Systemic management

Systemic antibiotics are indicated for patients with **spreading infection**, **immunocompromised status**, or **systemic symptoms** [^111J8XFr]. Common regimens include amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, or metronidazole combined with penicillin, tailored to culture results when available [^111bVNVP].

---

### Pain management

Pain control is essential and typically achieved with **NSAIDs** (ibuprofen, naproxen) and acetaminophen; opioids may be reserved for severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs [^notfound].

---

## Prevention

Preventive measures focus on **minimizing risk factors** and optimizing surgical technique:

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended before and after extraction [^116hy5ip].

- **Oral hygiene**: Preoperative and postoperative chlorhexidine rinses reduce bacterial load [^115iqAkJ].

- **Atraumatic technique**: Minimizing tissue trauma and bone exposure during extraction [^114s8f6r].

- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Controversial; may be considered in high-risk patients (e.g. immunocompromised, extensive surgery) [^117UB5P6].

---

## Prognosis and complications

With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is **generally favorable**, with healing typically occurring within 7–14 days. However, complications may occur, including:

- **Osteomyelitis**: Chronic bone infection requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy and possible surgical intervention [^111bVNVP].

- **Delayed healing**: Persistent pain and delayed socket closure [^111DTZYS].

- **Chronic infection**: Recurrent or persistent infection requiring further treatment [^113KLmQV].

---

Infected dental socket is a preventable and treatable complication of tooth extraction, characterized by severe pain, halitosis, and exposed bone. Management centers on **local debridement, irrigation, medicated dressings, and antibiotics** when indicated, with pain control and close follow-up to monitor healing and prevent complications [^11333evY].

Postoperative bone healing after oral surgical procedures occurs uneventfully in most cases. However, in certain patients, the normal process of healing can be delayed and, in some cases, often because of multiple coexisting factors, the sites can become infected, with extension of the infection into medullary bone. This process is termed osteomyelitis. This article outlines the pathogenesis, microbiology, and surgical and medical therapies of this condition and specifically addresses osteomyelitis cases related to patients with no documented history of radiation or bisphosphonate exposure and in whom the principal factor in the development of the condition is infection by pyogenic microorganisms.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw — operational clinical characterization and classification is as follows: ORN of the jaw should be operationally characterized as: radiographic lytic or mixed sclerotic lesion of bone and/or visibly exposed bone and/or probe through a periodontal pocket or fistula (Figs 1A and 1B) occurring within an anatomical site previously exposed to a therapeutic dose of head and neck RT. To facilitate clinical implementation of the enclosed recommendations, the Panel has adopted the ClinRad classification system, which the Panel favored as "designed in order to be comprehensive enough to be used across providers and specialties" and "yet simple enough to communicate a stable intrinsic description of ORN as a recognizable disease state". Unlike other necrotic states, direct biopsy or tissue sampling is neither routinely used nor recommended by this Panel, as the biopsy or tissue excision itself might engender disease progression.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^113R5igW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) — general objectives and procedural considerations specify that treatment objectives for patients with an established diagnosis of MRONJ are to eliminate pain, control infection of the soft and hard tissues, and minimize the progression or occurrence of bone necrosis, and patients with established MRONJ should avoid elective dentoalveolar surgical procedures; there have been several reports of successful treatment outcomes for all stages after operative therapy and nonoperative therapy, and, with the exception of the more advanced cases of stage 3 disease or cases with a well-defined sequestrum, a more prudent approach is to consider operative therapies when nonoperative strategies have failed. Regardless of stage, areas of superficial necrotic bone that are an ongoing source of soft tissue irritation and loose bony sequestra should be removed or recontoured to optimize soft tissue healing, extraction of symptomatic teeth within exposed, necrotic bone should be considered, and most affected patients experience osteonecrosis of the jaw after dentoalveolar surgery.

### Actinomycotic osteomyelitis of mandible [^113KLmQV]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is an infection of filamentous, gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. Actinomycosis of jaw bone is rare and the diagnosis is often difficult. The aim of this patient report is to present an actinomycotic osteomyelitis of mandible in a 30-year-old male patient. The patient presented with a chief complaint of pain and unhealed dental socket after mandibular teeth extractions. Radiographs showed ill-defined radiolucencies and perforation of buccal and lingual cortical plate; several biopsies and different therapy could not improve the lesion because of fault diagnosis and improper treatment. Finally, the authors' histopathological examination revealed granulation tissue surrounded bacterial colonies compatible with actinomycotic colonies. Follow-up examinations showed that the patient was well 6 months after prolonged treatment without any pain and discharge from dental socket.

### A clinical evaluation of dry socket in a Nigerian teaching hospital [^113Pr49y]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine the incidence of dry socket in a Nigerian teaching hospital and to evaluate the patients' demographic pattern, predisposing factors, the treatment given, and treatment outcome.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective review of records of dental extractions complicated by dry socket in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, between January 1996 and December 2000 was undertaken. Information retrieved included patient sociodemographic data, indications for extraction, tooth extracted, status of attending surgeon, onset of symptoms, relevant findings of the examining clinician, interval before presentation, treatment given, and its outcome.

Results

Of the 3,319 dental extractions performed in 3,008 patients, 136 (4.1%) were complicated by dry socket. The patients' mean age was 33.4 (15.4) years and a peak age incidence of 21 to 30 years was found. A slight female preponderance (1.4:1) was observed. The majority of patients were in the low-income group, and presentation in the hospital was prompt in the high-income group. Mandibular teeth were affected 3 times more than maxillary teeth (P = 0.00080). Most cases of dry socket resulted from extractions performed by undergraduates and house officers. Various underlying systemic conditions were found in 11.0% of cases, none of which included use of oral contraceptives. Treatment was usually the use of zinc oxide eugenol dressing in an irrigated socket, combined with antibiotic therapy in 45.3% of cases. No adverse reaction to zinc oxide eugenol was observed.

Conclusion

The incidence of dry socket in our hospital is 4.1%. The mandible was involved 3 times more than the maxilla. With the use of zinc oxide eugenol dressing, 70.6% of patients completed treatment satisfactorily and 29.2% were lost to follow-up.

### Coronectomy in lower third molar surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ecz4h]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Coronectomy is an alternative approach to the complete removal of an impacted mandibular third molar. The present study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare coronectomy with extraction concerning complications associated with the inferior alveolar nerve injury (IANI).

Methods

This review followed the principles of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of 5 databases according to PRISMA guidelines. Research articles published in English before April 30, 2024 were reviewed. The keywords consisted of "coronectomy and lower third molar". In this study, Rayyan online software was used to identify and eliminate duplicate articles, and another reviewer was invited to screen the articles independently. The included articles' data were extracted, and conclusions were drawn after cross-comparison. The forest plot was drawn after analysis by the R program (JJ Allaire, Boston, Massachusetts, USA). The primary outcome variable of the present study was evaluating the incidence of IANI, and secondly, the lingual nerve injury (LNI), dry socket, postoperative infection, the necessity for surgical reintervention, root migration, root extraction, and coronectomy failure rate. These assessments were made concerning patients' chosen operative technique for managing third molars, either coronectomy or extraction, as predictor variables.

Results

After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 of the 564 articles were included in this study (24 cohort studies and 10 case‒control studies), with 7,115 wisdom teeth from 4,477 patients in different countries. Meta-analysis showed that coronectomy reduced the risk of IANI: relative risk (RR): 0.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0–0.2; I² (inconsistency index) = 0%; P < .0001, the risk of LNI (RR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0–0.7; I² = 0%; p = 0.01), dry socket (RR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3–0.7; I² = 0%; p = 0.002), and postoperative infection (RR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.5–2.1; I² = 27%; p = 0.9). However, coronectomy exhibited a higher risk of surgical reintervention of 3.63% (111 of 3,055), root exposure of 2.66% (61 of 2,290), and a specific failure rate of 2.79% (119 of 4,261).

Conclusion

When the mandibular third molar with a higher risk of IANI needs to be removed, coronectomy can reduce the risk of IANI and LNI and the incidence of dry socket compared with traditional extraction. There was no significant difference in postoperative infection between the 2 groups. However, coronectomy exhibited a specific failure rate and higher odds of secondary surgical intervention. Guided bone regeneration can slow down the movement of residual roots and reduce the incidence of secondary surgery.

### Alveolar osteitis: a review of current concepts [^114bMUuh]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of the present review was to explore the pathogenesis and etiology of alveolar osteitis (AO) to obtain a more intuitive understanding of the clinical prevention and management of the condition. The different treatment modalities were discussed through both the mechanistic understanding of AO and the evidence regarding the different modes of prevention and management.

Materials and Methods

The Ovid Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register online databases were used to complete an advanced search using the MeSH term "dry socket", generating 756 results.

Results

A total of 8 studies on the prevention of AO were included, with 66 studies included for review of the reported data overall. The information was categorized into incidence, etiology and pathogenesis, prevention, and management. The relevant background information and evidence for each category were summarized.

Conclusions

Understanding of the pathogenesis and etiology of AO has improved in recent years, which has been helpful for developing effective evidence-based treatment and prevention of the condition. Clinicians should be aware of the complexity and multifactorial nature of the etiology of AO and the current concepts regarding the prevention and treatment of AO.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^113X1GSC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

3 CASE 2: DENTAL EXTRACTIONS AND RISK OF BLEEDING

A 60‐year‐old woman with decompensated cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis C infection is under evaluation for liver transplantation. She has extensive dental caries and prior to transplantation needs multiple tooth extractions. She has no history of excessive spontaneous or surgical bleeding and tolerated dental work prior to onset of her cirrhosis without complications. She has CTP C cirrhosis, MELD 24, with ascites and intermittent hepatic encephalopathy. Her PT is 23 s, INR is 1.9, and platelet count 41 000/µl. Following multidisciplinary discussion, the dental extractions are performed without hemostatic support. There is no intra‐operative excess bleeding. However, she returns the following day with persistent oozing from an open socket.

Dental decay is a potential source of infection post liver transplantation. Formal dental evaluation (and extractions where necessary) are therefore recommended as part of the liver transplantation work up. The prevalence of periodontal disease in this group is reported to be as high as 75%.

Procedural bleeding risk can be classified as high or low based on the estimated incidence of major bleeding and its potential consequence. By definition, a low bleeding risk procedure carries a risk of major bleeding of < 1.5% or where bleeding can be easily controlled with local measures. Conversely, high risk is defined as major bleeding risk of > 1.5% and/or where bleeding (in its event) would be difficult to control (e.g. non compressible site) and/or of significant consequence (e.g. intracerebral bleeding). Observational cohorts report bleeding rates following simple dental extraction of 2.9%–6% in patients with chronic liver disease. All bleeds were successfully controlled with local interventions with no patients requiring hospitalization. Hemoglobin values were not reported in this study but it is unlikely these bleeds met criteria for major bleeding. Dental extractions should therefore be considered low bleeding risk procedures. Similarly, whilst the incidence of bleeding post dental extraction is higher than that reported in patients without liver disease (estimated at 1%), it is comparable to that reported in patients on anticoagulation, where a higher bleeding risk of 4%–9% is accepted.

Management of superficial odontogenic infections (vestibular or buccal space infections).
Management of minor intraoral lacerations (without involvement of a nerve or salivary tissue).
Management of extraoral lacerations < 2 cm in length (no foreign bodies or burns).
Stabilisation of closed jaw fractures with bridle wires in preparation for transport to oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS).

Expeditionary dentistry is treatment at the point of need, overcoming the challenges of static facilities in providing care to deployed forces. The practice of expeditionary dentistry offers a scalable solution to bridge the capability gaps presented by LSCO. Advances in portable dental equipment have expanded what expeditionary dentistry can offer the warfighter. Expeditionary dental teams, empowered to operate in any environment, provide care at the point of need to accomplish rapid return to duty. This is the end state of a ready dental force and executed by dental officers and enlisted dental assistants who are technically proficient and tactically prepared.

### Healing of postextraction sockets preserved with autologous platelet concentrates. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112QDkMr]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The true benefit of autologous platelet concentrates (APCs) for enhancing the healing of postextraction sites is still a matter of debate, and in recent years several clinical trials have addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an APC adjunct in the preservation of fresh extraction sockets.

Materials and Methods

An electronic search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Only controlled clinical trials or randomized clinical trials were included. Selected articles underwent risk-of-bias assessment. The outcomes were complications and adverse events, discomfort and quality of life, bone healing and remodeling assessed by histologic and radiographic techniques, and soft tissue healing.

Results

Thirty-three comparative studies were included. Nine articles had a parallel design and 24 had a split-mouth design. Twenty studies were considered to have a low risk of bias and 13 were considered to have a high risk. Overall, 1,193 teeth were extracted from 911 patients. Meta-analysis showed that soft tissue healing, probing depth at 3 months, and bone density at 1, 3, and 6 months were statistically better for the APC group. Qualitative analysis suggested that APCs might be associated with a decrease in swelling and trismus. However, no relevant difference among groups was found for probing depth at 1 month, incidence of alveolar osteitis, acute inflammation or infection, percentage of new bone, and indirect measurement of bone metabolism.

Conclusion

APCs should be used in postextraction sites to improve clinical and radiographic outcomes such as bone density and soft tissue healing and postoperative symptoms. The actual benefit of APCs on decreasing pain in extraction sockets is still not quantifiable.

Definitions of certainty in the evidence and strength of recommendations — levels of certainty and user-facing implications are specified as follows: High certainty is defined as "We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect"; moderate certainty as "We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; low certainty as "Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; and very low certainty as "We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect". For implications of strong versus conditional recommendations, patients: strong — "Most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; patients: conditional — "Most patients in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". Clinicians: strong — "Most patients should receive the intervention. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator"; clinicians: conditional — "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". Policy makers: strong — "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations"; policy makers: conditional — "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: imaging and clinical laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^116zZurD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging — differential diagnosis

Imaging tests play an important role during the diagnostic process and may help differentiate MRONJ from other pathologies.
A PA radiograph may help rule out pathosis from adjacent dental or bony structures. ○ A PA view may identify a periapical rarefication (granuloma or cyst), vertically fractured root, impacted tooth, residual root, or periodontal disease that may explain the local symptoms. ○ In the presence of a fistula, a PA view using a tracer (e.g. gutta-percha) through the fistula may help detect the source of infection.
Panoramic radiographs may identify an incidental finding of abnormal alveolar trabeculation without a diagnostic clinical presentation of MRONJ. The differential diagnosis of bone metastasis versus MRONJ should be considered. A bone biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless, it poses a risk for MRONJ development or its worsening and should be discussed with the patient and the patient's oncologist. Radiologic follow-up is advised to assess the behavior of the bony lesion over time. If symptoms develop, empiric antibiotics may assist in the differential diagnosis.
Like plain radiology, at present, 3D imaging, such as CBCT, CT, and MRI, is often unable to differentiate between MRONJ and bone metastasis.
Bone scans (e.g. conventional scintigraphy, SPECT or SPECT/CT) and most types of PET-CT (e.g. FDG-PET/CT, NaF-PET/CT) show bone activity but are not specific imaging modalities for MRONJ since they demonstrate increased uptake in both inflammatory process as well as metastasis.
Recent technological advancements suggest that PET-CT with new tracers, such as ligands that bind to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), may be able to differentiate prostate cancer metastasis from osteonecrosis. In this technique, gallium-68 (68 Ga)-labelled PSMA ligands have higher avidity to metastasis compared to inflammatory processes in the jawbone. As PSMA is expressed in solid cancers other than prostate, the potential of PSMA-PET/CT techniques to identify metastatic disease may have implications for MRONJ diagnosis in other solid cancer patients.
In some PET-CT imaging, the normal uptake in the salivary glands may obscure mandibular pathology. The clinician is advised to cross-check the imaging in various planes.
Combined use of imaging may aid in the differential diagnosis of MRONJ in patients with multiple myeloma: Tc-99 m-sestamibi shows no uptake and FDG-PET/CT shows focal uptake in MRONJ.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: infection and trauma of the dentition [^111bVNVP]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is defined as inflammation of the bone. It commonly involves the bone marrow, and has a tendency for progression to the cortical bone as well as the periosteum. This term encompasses a broad range of pathologies, the most common of which (and most relevant for plastic surgeons), is suppurative osteomyelitis, which arises as a result of bacterial infection of the bone.

Patients who are immunosuppressed, have chronic disease or decreased bony vascularity are at increased risk of developing osteomyelitis. Suppurative osteomyelitis arises as a result of bacterial infection and is classified as either acute or chronic. The acute phase is characterized by rapid spread of infection accompanied by pain, fever, lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, with timeline usually less than 1 month. Conversely, the chronic variant is characterized by the formation of scar and granulation tissue around the infection, with a smoldering clinical course. Plain or panoramic films may demonstrate a nonspecific radiolucency, however, these findings typically lag several weeks behind clinical symptoms as cortical bone involvement is required for radiographic changes to be evident. Once these cortical changes occur, the classic "moth eaten" appearance is often visible. Computed tomography imaging, which is the largely the standard in evaluating maxillofacial pathology, may reveal a sequestrum (segment of dead bone isolated from surrounding bone) and/or and involucrum (sequestrum that has been surrounded by new bone). A computed tomography scan, like a plain film, requires 30% to 50% demineralization of bone before radiographic changes can be appreciated and this may delay diagnosis. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging may allow an earlier diagnosis during the acute phase due to changes in the signal attenuation of the marrow. These changes on magnetic resonance imaging are visible before cortical disruption or sequestrum formation is evident. The mainstay of treatment for both acute and chronic suppurative osteomyelitis is surgical drainage of any associated abscess with excision of all dead and infected bone, and culture-directed antimicrobial therapy. Weakened bone may require stabilization, and osseous defects may require reconstruction after the infection has been eradicated.

### Is It safe to remove teeth in liver transplant patients without antibiotics? A retrospective study of 346 patients [^111DTZYS]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Eradication of oral infectious foci is essential for liver transplant candidates. The main issue is whether antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary for all dental extractions despite the possible fostering of resistant bacteria. To overcome the scarcity of evidence-based data, our study analyzed the background and outcomes of a large number of routine extractions performed in our institution without antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with different liver pathologies.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, the outcome of interest was the occurrence of local infections and minor complications during the 7-day follow-up period after extraction; the predictors were the demographic and clinical variables of the patients (age, gender, liver pathology, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, international normalized ratio) and the extraction variables (single vs multiple extractions, isolated vs contiguous teeth, single-rooted vs multirooted teeth). The statistical analysis used univariate nonparametric tests and binary multivariate logistic regressions.

Results

The 346 liver transplant candidates (mean age, 53 ± 8 years; 24% women) underwent 662 routine extraction sessions involving 1,329 teeth. The 7-day dental follow-up detected no signs of postoperative wound infection (rate = 0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0 to 0.9%]). Accordingly, the 2-week post-extraction clinical monitoring excluded symptoms of systemic infection attributable to the dental procedure. Minor complications (mild bleeding, slow healing, inflamed socket) occurred in 50 patients (rate = 14% [95% CI, 11 to 18%]) in the 3 days after extraction. Significant risk factors for minor complications were refractory ascites (P < .0001; OR = 8 [95% CI, 3 to 20]), extraction of multirooted contiguous teeth (P < 0.0001; OR = 5 [95% CI, 2.5 to 9]), and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 18 (P = 0.01; OR = 2.4 [95% CI, 1.2 to 5]).

Conclusions

Our study showed that routine extractions without antibiotic prophylaxis can be performed safely in liver transplant candidates, even in the presence of 1 or more non-controllable risk factors. Using atraumatic techniques, we achieved satisfactory healing of the gingiva and socket in all patients in a week, without any signs of local infection. The few minor complications were readily managed and resolved within 3 days after extraction.

Lead extraction — follow-up and infection outcomes specify that procedural outcomes are as standard reported for a 30-day period and should be the minimum follow-up duration, while ideally outcomes should be tracked for a much longer period (e.g. 1 year). For patients undergoing extraction for a systemic-related device infection, the page notes they have close to a 25% 1 year mortality, despite successful extraction, and that preliminary data suggests early extraction for infection improves 1 year survival.

### Local interventions for the management of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) [^114Hwy4Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions and occurs more commonly in extractions involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of blood clot and in some patients there may be a complaint of halitosis. It can result in an increase in postoperative visits.

Objectives

To assess the effects of local interventions for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 29 October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 29 October 2012) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 29 October 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. We also searched the reference lists of articles and contacted experts and organisations to identify any further studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket post-extraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques for the management of dry socket because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook risk of bias assessment and data extraction in duplicate for included studies using pre-designed proformas. Any reports of adverse events were recorded and summarised into a table when these were available. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. We followed The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For some of the split-mouth studies with sparse data it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio instead. We used the GRADE tool to assess the quality of the body of evidence.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials with 2570 participants met the inclusion criteria; 18 trials with 2376 participants for the prevention of dry socket and three studies with 194 participants for the treatment of dry socket. The risk of bias assessment identified six studies at high risk of bias, 14 studies at unclear risk of bias and one studies at low risk of bias. When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12% and 0.2% concentrations) both before and after extraction(s) prevented approximately 42% of dry socket(s) with a RR of 0.58 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; P < 0.001) (four trials, 750 participants, moderate quality of evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varied from 1% to 5% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated with (0.12% and 0.2%) chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket (NNT) was 232 (95% CI 176 to 417), 47 (95% CI 35 to 84) and 8 (95% CI 6 to 14) for control prevalences of dry socket of 1%, 5% and 30% respectively. Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) after extractions prevented approximately 58% of dry socket(s) with a RR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.87; P = 0.02) (two trials, in 133 participants, moderate quality of evidence). The number of patients needed to be treated with chlorhexidine gel to prevent one patient having dry socket (NNT) was 173 (95% CI 127 to 770), 35 (95% CI 25 to 154) and 6 (95% CI 5 to 26) for control prevalences of dry socket of 1%, 5% and 30% respectively. A further 10 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and therefore there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Five interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in a total of three studies providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Most tooth extractions are undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but three studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is some evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% and 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, provides a benefit in preventing dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 10 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of any of the interventions to treat dry socket. The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12%, 0.2% and 2% chlorhexidine mouthrinses, though most studies were not designed to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket (though previous allergy to chlorhexidine was an exclusion criterion in these trials). In view of recent reports in the UK of two cases of serious adverse events associated with irrigation of dry socket with chlorhexidine mouthrinse, it is recommended that all members of the dental team prescribing chlorhexidine products are aware of the potential for both minor and serious adverse side effects.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following Tooth extractions [^117UB5P6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions, generally performed by general dental practitioners, are dental caries and periodontal infections. Systemic antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To determine the effect of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevention of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 16 April 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 16 April 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 16 April 2020), and LILACS (1982 to 16 April 2020). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included studies. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for key outcomes as high, moderate, low, or very low, using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials that randomised approximately 3206 participants (2583 analysed) to prophylactic antibiotics or placebo. Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, only one of the trials evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in groups of patients affected by those clinical conditions. We assessed 16 trials as being at high risk of bias, three at low risk, and four as unclear. Compared to placebo, antibiotics may reduce the risk of postsurgical infectious complications in patients undergoing third molar extractions by approximately 66% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64; 1728 participants; 12 studies; low-certainty evidence), which means that 19 people (95% CI 15 to 34) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. Antibiotics may also reduce the risk of dry socket by 34% (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; 1882 participants; 13 studies; low-certainty evidence), which means that 46 people (95% CI 29 to 62) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. The evidence for our other outcomes is uncertain: pain, whether measured dichotomously as presence or absence (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.12; 675 participants; 3 studies) or continuously using a visual analogue scale (0-to-10-centimetre scale, where 0 is no pain) (MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.07; 422 participants; 4 studies); fever (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.79; 475 participants; 4 studies); and adverse effects, which were mild and transient (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.64; 1277 participants; 8 studies) (very low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence that the timing of antibiotic administration (preoperative, postoperative, or both) was important. The included studies enrolled a subset of patients undergoing dental extractions, that is healthy people who had surgical extraction of third molars. Consequently, the results of this review may not be generalisable to all people undergoing tooth extractions.

Authors' Conclusions

The vast majority (21 out of 23) of the trials included in this review included only healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. None of the studies evaluated tooth extraction in immunocompromised patients. We found low-certainty evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of infection and dry socket following third molar extraction when compared to placebo, and very low-certainty evidence of no increase in the risk of adverse effects. On average, treating 19 healthy patients with prophylactic antibiotics may stop one person from getting an infection. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to patients with concomitant illnesses or patients at a higher risk of infection. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic treatment, clinicians should evaluate if and when to prescribe prophylactic antibiotic therapy before a dental extraction for each patient on the basis of the patient's clinical conditions (healthy or affected by systemic pathology) and level of risk from infective complications. Immunocompromised patients, in particular, need an individualised approach in consultation with their treating medical specialist.

### Osteomyelitis risk in patients with transfemoral amputations treated with osseointegration prostheses [^111DgL78]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In individuals with transfemoral amputations, especially with a short or malformed residual limb, socket prostheses cause substantial disadvantages for many including discomfort, skin problems, and poor function. These problems are reduced substantially when the prosthetic limb is attached to a percutaneous osseointegrated implant. However, the long-term risk of implant-associated infection and its clinical effect are not known with this method. In the first 96 patients treated with this novel method, we estimated that the cumulative risk of implant-associated osteomyelitis was 20% and the risk of implant extraction attributable to infection was 9% during a 10-year implant period. In four of the six patients for whom infection did not lead to extraction, prosthetic use was impaired. Resolution of osteomyelitis was attainable with prolonged combined antibiotics in one-quarter of the patients.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. Comorbidities associated with risk of poor healing and infection (arterial disease and complicated diabetes) are underrepresented in the patient cohort owing to preoperative selection. BMI, uncomplicated diabetes, and smoking were recorded only at the time of implantation, and no adjustments were made owing to changes in these variables with time which would only permit detection of a very strong relationship. The data were extracted retrospectively from medical charts by one author (JT) and reexamined by all authors before being added to the final dataset. We acknowledge the difficulty of defining method-typical osteomyelitis. Our definitions, although not validated, avoid excluding patients with culture-negative results with a high overall likelihood of osteomyelitis. Any overestimation is likely small as osteomyelitis was definite in 75% of the patients. Furthermore, the reliability of the method-specific tissue sampling is not known. Although less invasive than percutaneous bone tissue biopsies, bone marrow aspirations through the fixture possibly are more vulnerable to sample contamination, and it is uncertain if multiple samples add to diagnostic precision, as contaminants and true pathogens alike disperse in the liquid phase. Functional impairment could be graded only approximately owing to the 20-year retrospective span. Six patients were lost to followup including one patient with method-unrelated death, but all patients from the early phase (1990–1998) of the method development (custom-design period) have been included. Since then, several modifications have been made leading to standardized implants, surgical technique, and a strict rehabilitation protocol. This may result in reduced infectious complications. Outcome improvement also can be expected with standardized diagnostic protocols and early treatment with biofilm-effective antibiotics.

### The evaluation of objective and subjective fate of teeth in the mandible fracture line and the management – A center's experience [^115K61aT]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Also, there are some reports showing that the extraction of the impacted tooth near the fracture line can increase the risk of postoperative infection and lead to further impact. Indeed, the extraction of the tooth can reduce the contact area between the fragments leading to the decrease of stability of osteosynthesis, and further causing micro-mobility and complications. Besides extraction, the tooth may also cause additional trauma to the fractured bone and the fragments. Further, conserving the tooth can contribute to avoiding the difficulty of maintaining the three-dimensional structure of an empty socket during fixation, and may offer more space for treatment, which was also one of the key considerations of our delay or preservation choice-making reasons. In this way, the tooth may also benefit from the prevention of the possible dislocation of the proximal fragment. Furthermore, for the mandibular angle fracture, which mostly happened, based on the previous report if there is a possibility that optimal reduction and immobility of mandibular fractures can be achieved without removing the third molar tooth, if it exists, the risk of infection can be decreased. In contrast, if the third molar were extracted, during the bone healing procedure, the muscle dynamic may in risk of leading to mobility of the fragments which may result in complicated fracture healing and other complications during the recovery.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: dental implants in fresh extraction sockets (immediate, immediate-delayed and delayed implants) [^112jendA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dental implants can be placed in fresh sockets just after tooth extraction. These are called 'immediate' implants. 'Immediate-delayed' implants are those implants inserted after weeks up to about a couple of months to allow for soft tissue healing. 'Delayed' implants are those placed thereafter in partially or completely healed bone. The advantages of immediate implants are that treatment time can be shortened and that bone height might be maintained thus possibly improving the aesthetic results. The potential disadvantages are an increased risk of infection and failures of the immediately placed implants.

Objectives

To evaluate success, function, complications and patient satisfaction between 'immediate', 'immediate-delayed' and 'delayed' implants.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Several dental journals were handsearched. The bibliographies of review articles were checked, and personal references were searched. More than 55 implant manufacturing companies were also contacted. Last electronic search was conducted on 7 August 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and preference RCT evaluating immediate, immediate-delayed, and delayed implants, reporting the outcome of the interventions to at least 1 year after functional loading.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. Authors were contacted for any missing information. Results were expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical unit of the analysis was the patient.

Main Results

Two RCTs were included. One RCT compared immediate implants placed in periapical infected sites versus delayed implants in 50 patients and after 1 year found no statistically significant differences. The second RCT compared immediate-delayed versus immediate implants in 46 patients. After 1 year and a half there were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures, complications, aesthetics assessed by the patient and the papilla height assessed by the dentist. However, patients in the delayed group perceiving the period between tooth extraction and insertion of the crown significantly longer than patients in the immediate-delayed group, mean difference of VAS -20.30 (95% CI -33.36 to -7.24). There was also statistically significantly higher patient satisfaction in the immediate-delayed group, mean difference (VAS) -6.51 (95% CI -12.63 to -0.39). An independent blinded assessor judged the level of the perimplant marginal mucosa in relation to that of the adjacent teeth as more appropriate in the immediate-delayed group, with risk ratio (RR) 1.68 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.72).

Authors' Conclusions

Despite that the evidence is derived from only two RCTs with a limited number of patients, it is possible to suggest that immediate implants and immediate-delayed implants may offer some advantages over conventional implants in healed sites in terms of patient satisfaction and aesthetics possibly by preserving alveolar bone. Immediate implants can work and are able to shorten treatment periods, however properly designed RCTs are still needed to fully evaluate the potential advantages and risks of this treatment modality since more complications and failures may occur.

### Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates [^116FFhXQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of ONJ remains obscure. Local oversuppression of bone turnover in the jaw, and inhibition of angiogenesis by high doses of potent amino-bisphosphonates complicating trauma and infection of the jaw are the most likely contributing factors, but a definite causal relationship between bisphosphonate use and ONJ remains uncertain and complicated by factors that may increase the risk of developing the condition, such as the concomitant use of cancer treatments and/or corticosteroids, requirements for dental surgery and comorbidities, such as anaemia and diabetes. Seventy-five percent occur following a dental extraction or jaw surgery. Histopathologically exposed necrotic bone, usually with an inflammatory inflitrate and evidence of infection with a mixed bacterial growth often containing actinomyces species, is observed.

Information on ONJ from randomised clinical trials is very limited. A retrospective analysis of over 3000 patients included in the zoledronic acid development programme identified a maximum of six patients who might, in hindsight, have experienced ONJ, although some of these individuals may have had osteomyelitis or other dental conditions. In a recent randomised trial of IV zoledronic acid, given to treat osteoporosis, there were two possible cases of ONJ, one in the placebo arm and one in the group receiving active treatment.

Prospective research is required to determine the causes of ONJ and the frequency of the condition using a consistent definition in cancer patients treated with and without bisphosphonates. The relationships, if any, with the type, dose and duration of bisphosphonate treatment need to be defined, as do the strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and subsequent treatment. In the meantime, patients should have regular inspection of the mouth, undergo dental checkups every 6–12 months and avoid invasive dental surgery unless no alternative is available.

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^112pVq3u]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) characterization — nonsyndromic, observable criteria and diagnostic emphasis are specified as follows: "The characterization should be nonsyndromic and include directly observable physical examination or radiographic features, rather than including associated patient- or clinician-reported symptoms (eg, pain) [objective]". It also states that "The characterization should be sufficiently broad to be integrated within both Panel-derived and independent severity scales and staging systems [flexible]" and "The characterization should be sufficiently descriptive as to encompass disease states reasonably attributable as ORN across human- and machine-interpretable nomenclatures and/or ontologies [scalable and interoperable]", and "The characterization should be based on meeting one or more of the listed criteria, rather than a diagnosis of exclusion (eg, "non-septic and unrelated to synchronous malignancy") [affirmative]". Panel consensus "was a consensus to place emphasis on clinical signs and symptoms in conjunction with radiographic findings as a practical approach in diagnosing ORN", with the characterization "rooted on post-RT consequential injury that centers around observable loss of bone and periosteal integrity" and defined "toward ORN as a distinct clinical condition, without using a time factor or duration, nor incorporating "syndromic" definitions by requiring the presence or absence of commonly associated signs (eg, mucosal ulceration, or frank mandible fracture) or frequently noted consequential symptoms (ie, the presence or absence of associated pain or trismus)". Figure 1 illustrates subtle clinical presentation and aided visualization: "Fistula present in edentulous anterior left mandible (arrow), without using a dental instrument probe. The lesion is subtle in clinical presentation. (B) The same fistulous lesion seen in (A), using a dental instrument probe to facilitate clinical visualization".

Scientific Title The effect of Plasma Rich in Growth Factors on the treatment of an infected socket following tooth extraction Study objectives Background: Dry socket or alveolar osteitis is one of the most common and unpleasant complications that occurs following the extraction of teeth either by general dental surgeons or by specialist oral surgeons. Dry socket may be defined as the postoperative pain inside and. around an extraction site, which increases in severity at any time between the first and third day after the extraction, accompanied by a partial or total disintegration of the blood clot within the tooth socket, with or without halitosis. Patients usually present with localised severe pain one to three days after extraction. The. /Endoret®) supports the predictable treatment of dry sockets arising after the extraction of teeth by measuring clinical parameters in approximately 40 patients.

The secondary objective is to determine whether the use of PRGF in the treatment of dry sockets is more effective than a conventional approach alone in. Interventions Treatment of the dry socket will be performed using debridement and dressing under a local anaesthetic. Following the debridement, the socket will irrigated and plugged with either the Alvogyl® or the PRGF as per the treatment randomisation schedule and then sutured. Where the socket is randomised to receive the use of Alvogyl®, approximately 0. 20g of paste. will be inserted to fill the socket as per the manufacturer's instructions. The socket margins will then be sutured. Where the defect is randomised to receive the use of PRGF, a PRGF clot will be inserted to fill the dry socket. A fibrin membrane will then be applied to cover.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^116voAvn]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute and chronic osteomyelitis definitions and course classifications define acute osteomyelitis as diagnosis of bone infection within 4 weeks after the onset of clinical manifestations in a previously uninfected bone, and chronic osteomyelitis as a more protracted, often indolent process with presence of a sequestrum and/or relapse of infection in the same site weeks to years after apparently successful treatment. Acute osteomyelitis presentations may be relatively mild or "subacute", and chronic osteomyelitis, while rare in childhood and adolescence in North America, can occur as an initial presentation or as a complication of AHO. The panel recognizes presentations that do not fit cleanly into the acute vs chronic dichotomy, such as Brodie abscess or indolent presentations with onset of symptoms or signs > 4 weeks before diagnosis without clear evidence of chronic osteomyelitis, and states that management of such presentations should be determined on a case-by-case basis and influenced by clinical and imaging response. Uncomplicated vs complicated designations are based on features of the clinical presentation and treatment course, and complicated infections are more likely to require additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and a longer duration of therapy.

### Postoperative prophylactic antibiotic treatment in third molar surgery – a necessity? [^113e3oFj]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the need for prophylactic postoperative oral antibiotic treatment in the removal of asymptomatic third molars.

Materials and Methods

In a prospective study of more than 30 months, a total of 528 impacted lower third molars were surgically removed in 288 patients. All patients were referred to our department by a dentist or a general practitioner. No patient showed any sign of pain, inflammation, or swelling at the time of removal. Three groups were established. In the first group, antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as an oral medication was carried out for 5 days postoperatively. In the second group, we used clindamycin. In the third group, the patients received no antibiotic treatment. Clinical and radiologic factors were recorded for each case, and the rationale for assigning the patients to the groups was strictly random. The surgical technique was the same in all cases, and the follow-up period was 4 weeks. Parameters that were evaluated were pain, differences in mouth opening, infection, the occurrence of dry socket, and adverse postoperative side effects.

Results

We could not find any significant difference between the 3 groups regarding the evaluated parameters, but in 69.6% of the patients with dry socket, the teeth were partially erupted, which showed a significant difference.

Conclusions

The results of our study show that specific postoperative oral prophylactic antibiotic treatment after the removal of lower third molars does not contribute to a better wound healing, less pain, or increased mouth opening and could not prevent the cases of inflammatory problems after surgery, respectively, and therefore is not recommended for routine use.

### Immediate placement of dental implants into debrided infected dentoalveolar sockets [^114goEHM]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a protocol for the immediate placement of endosseous implants into debrided infected dentoalveolar sockets.

Patients and Methods

A total of 30 implants were immediately placed into debrided infected sites in 20 patients. The pathology at the receptacle dentoalveolar sockets varied, and included subacute periodontal infection, perio-endo infection, chronic periodontal infection, chronic periapical lesion, and a periodontal cyst. The immediate placement protocol emphasized the meticulous debridement of the infected tissues in combination with peripheral ostectomy of the alveoli. Guided bone regeneration was accomplished to support bony healing of alveolar defects surrounding the implantation site. Pre- and postsurgical antibiotic therapy was administered.

Results

All implants but 1 were osseointegrated and functional when followed up after 12 to 72 months. One implant was mobile after its immediate restoration and was removed. Complications were related to the use of guided bone regeneration. Deficiency of the attached gingiva was noted in 1 case. The treatment approach is illustrated in 2 anterior maxilla cases with 3-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Successful immediate implantation in debrided infected alveoli depends on the complete removal of all contaminated tissue and the controlled regeneration of the alveolar defect. With this proposed clinical approach, experienced clinicians may consider immediate implants as a viable treatment option in patients presenting with dentoalveolar infections.

### Are sterile gloves necessary in nonsurgical dental extractions? [^113a8kHc]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to compare the incidence of healing complications of extraction socket with the use of sterile or clean nonsterile gloves during nonsurgical dental extractions.

Material and Methods

This was a randomized prospective study conducted at the exodontia clinic of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (Nigeria), between October 2002 and January 2003. Patients who were referred for nonsurgical extractions of permanent teeth and who satisfied the inclusion criteria into the study were randomly allocated into 2 groups. One group had their extractions performed with the surgeon wearing a pair of sterile gloves and the second group had their extractions performed with the surgeon wearing a pair of clean nonsterile gloves. Two hundred sixty-nine patients who had 301 teeth extracted and satisfied the inclusion criteria for socket healing assessment were assessed for postoperative socket healing.

Results

Three different types of socket healing complications were identified (dry socket, acutely inflamed socket, and acutely infected socket). A total of 32 patients (11.9%) developed socket healing complications. Nineteen of 122 patients in the sterile glove group and 13 of 147 patients in the clean nonsterile glove group developed socket healing complications (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

The study confirmed that the use of sterile surgical gloves offers no advantage over clean nonsterile gloves in minimizing extraction socket healing complications following dental extraction. Therefore, nonsurgical dental extraction can be safely performed with the surgeon wearing clean nonsterile gloves.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: dental evaluation and management prior to treatment for hematologic malignancies and CAR T-cell therapy [^116etJiV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

MASCC/ISOO dental infection and emergency management around CAR T-cell therapy emphasizes conservative care prior to immune reconstitution and conditional use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). If an acute dentoalveolar infection develops prior to immune reconstitution, nonsurgical intervention including systemic antibiotics and local antimicrobials are the mainstay of treatment, and intervention during cancer therapy before immune reconstitution is reserved for exceptional cases and requires consultation with the hematologist. Following CAR T-cell therapy, if prolonged cytopenia persists and infection is not controlled by topical and systemic antibiotics, dental treatment may be delivered as a last resort; in such cases, administration of G-CSF may be considered to support dental interventions if there is no concurrent cytokine release syndrome. Given the unpredictable risk for cytopenia, patients should be motivated to practice good oral hygiene especially when routine dental treatment cannot be performed.

### Prevention of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy [^1126Gyxw]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Importance of oral health care inpatients with

Consensus and stability were gained between the three rounds of the Delphi study on the need for standardized oral health assessment (OHA) and management for all patients with HNC before RT (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Level of consensus for clinical oral health care and management pre‐ and post‐treatment and stability between three rounds of Delphi study (R1, R2, and R3 = Delphi round 1, 2, and 3, Q1 = Quartile 1 and Q3 = Quartile 3).

In the Delphi study 97.9% (n = 32) of the sample agreed that oral health assessment (OHA) and management should be mandatory before RT for patients with HNC. The OHA should include instructions for oral health care before and after RT, use of fluoridated mouthwash and fluoridated toothpaste, fluoride application, dental assessments including Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) score, periodontal charting, tooth mobility, and sialometry.

In the patient survey, 69.6% (n = 16) of participants were aware of ORN and its associated risk factors, and were able to give a detailed explanation of these, some having personal experience:

ORN is damage to the jawbone due to exposure to radiation treatment, to the point where the bone dies, which can lead to serious issues with teeth and gums, infections, reduced effectiveness of treatments such as antibiotics, and potentially having to have bone removed which can affect speech, eating and appearance.

After jaw radiation for a tumour some teeth fell out leaving unhealed sockets, the jaw bone died off and over a few years cracked into pieces and exited through the open sockets, usually accompanied with a jaw infection.

If I don't mind my teeth (and they are currently heavily filled) it will lead to having an extraction as my only option.

Radiation treatment to the jaw bone is the primary factor. After that poor hygiene and lack of dental and gum care can trigger problems, and the fact of having had radiation means they are much much harder to treat.

### Imaging of dental infections [^111gKNz7]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dental infections are a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). To help guide clinical management for these infections, the radiologist must be familiar with the anatomy of the oral cavity and neighboring structures, the range of appearance of dental infections, and the routes along which they may spread. Computed tomography (CT) is often performed when severe dental infections are suspected. This pictorial essay reviews the anatomy pertinent to the imaging evaluation of dental infections and depicts a spectrum of pathology that may be encountered, ranging from simple dentoalveolar infections to complex multispatial infections.

FIGURE 2
Apical periodontitis.

Inflammation near the root may stimulate proliferation of the periapical epithelial cells, resulting in formation of a periapical cyst (Fig. 3). These cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium and filled with protein-rich fluid and cellular debris. They slowly enlarge and are often asymptomatic, although symptoms may arise if inflammation increases or if the cyst grows significantly. Treatment of periapical cysts is the same as that for periapical granulomas. Residual periapical cysts (which persist after removal of the affected tooth) should be excised. Periapical abscesses may develop de novo or from chronic periapical granuloma transformation, and are characterized by collection of inflammatory cells and infected tissue at the apex of a non-vital tooth. If the abscess extends into the alveolus, the patient may experience progressive pain, tenderness, sensitivity to percussion, swelling of adjacent tissue, extrusion of the affected tooth, and systemic signs of infection. Radiographs often demonstrate apical periodontal ligament broadening and an ill-defined radiolucency, but no significant bony defects. Sequelae of an inappropriately treated or untreated abscess include intraoral sinus tract formation, head and neck fascial space abscesses or cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. Management of periapical abscess focuses on drainage, possible tooth extraction with curettage of the cavity, or endodontic therapy if the tooth is thought to be salvageable. Antibiotics are usually unnecessary for treatment of localized abscesses unless there are systemic symptoms, involvement of fascial spaces or osteomyelitis. Intraoral sinus tracts often resolve spontaneously after appropriate treatment of the offending tooth, and require no further intervention.

FIGURE 3
Periapical cyst.

Complications of Pulpal and Periapical Disease

If a periapical abscess is not drained (either surgically or spontaneously), it can perforate through the cortical bone of the maxilla or mandible and extend along soft tissue fascial planes. The head and neck have multiple fascial spaces delineated by different anatomic structures, including muscles, bone, tendons, ligaments, and so on. Odontogenic infections have the potential to spread into these spaces and result in superficial or deep space infection. Depending on their anatomic location and surrounding structures, these infections have varying degrees of severity and propensity to cause systemic harm. The most common complication and most frequent cause of death from odontogenic infections is airway compromise. Additional complications may also include, but are not limited to, visual disturbances/blindness, sinusitis, mediastinitis, septic thrombus formation, and systemic sepsis.

Delay vs. no delay of dental procedure after a hip/knee arthroplasty — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that the decision to delay a dental procedure after hip or knee replacement surgery is based on the risk of transient bacteremia, the occurrence of an invasive surgical procedure, or treatment of an active dental infection. Quality of Evidence: Consensus. Strength of Option: Consensus. There is no supporting evidence, or limited level evidence was downgraded due to major concerns addressed in the EtD framework. In the absence of sufficient evidence, the guideline work group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Livvt]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids vs placebo for acute dental adverse effects — postoperative infection occurred in 1.3% with no treatment and 2.4% with corticosteroids, with a difference of 0% fewer (1% fewer to 1% more) and certainty Low, and the table states "There may be no difference". For alveolar osteitis, rates were 1.2% with no treatment and 0.8% with corticosteroids, with a difference of 0% fewer (3% fewer to 4% more) and certainty Very low. For gastrointestinal events (nausea/vomiting), rates were 21.4% with no treatment and 7.8% with corticosteroids, with a difference of 19% fewer (54% fewer to 16% more) and certainty Very low. Participant totals were 1,630 (21 RCTs) for postoperative infection, 410 (8 RCTs) for alveolar osteitis, and 120 (3 RCTs) for gastrointestinal outcomes.

FIGURE 15
Extrusive luxation.

FIGURE 16
Lateral luxation.

Avulsion (Fig. 17) consists of an injury that causes complete tooth loss. If the tooth is re-implanted appropriately within 1 hour after injury, normal tooth attachment is highly probable. After this period of time, however, periodontal structures will not survive, and root resorption and ankylosis may present. Patients with an avulsed tooth should be instructed to find the tooth, grasp it by the crown without manipulating the root, rinse it under running tap water, insert the tooth back into the socket or place it into cow's milk or normal saline, and then seek emergency dental treatment. Endodontic therapy will be required after tooth replantation and immobilization.

FIGURE 17
Tooth avulsion.

Alveolar fractures (Fig. 18) may be associated with multiple fractured or displaced teeth, but vary in regards to the grade of displacement and mobility of the involved segment. Patients usually present with pain and malocclusion. Radiographs confirm the diagnosis and treatment involves manual reduction and fixation. Care should be taken to preserve as much of the alveolar bone as possible because it is difficult to restore properly.

FIGURE 18
Alveolar fracture.

If oral injuries occur during permanent tooth development, the full extent of injuries following trauma cannot be elucidated until the eruption of all permanent teeth occurs. Injuries of the developing teeth may include white or yellow-brown enamel hypomineralization (Fig. 19) and crown dilaceration (Fig. 20), which consists of an abrupt deviation of the crown along its long axis, shifting previously formed hard tissue in the midst of developing soft tissue. Root development anomalies and eruption disturbances may also occur. Treatment options include micro-abrasion, resin or porcelain restoration, conservative measures, surgical exposure with orthodontic realignment, extraction, and splinting.

### What strategies are helpful in the operative management of third molars? [^116hy5ip]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this review was to investigate and report strategies that might improve patient recovery after third molar (M3) surgery.

Materials and Methods

This was a literature review on various topics to identify the methods of improving outcomes after M3 removal. Numerous topics were reviewed, including patient age, flap design, effect of smoking, use of antibacterial rinses, pre-emptive analgesia, and the role of antibiotics and corticosteroids in recovery.

Results

Increased patient age appears to be a factor in a higher complication rate, but the literature is sparse. The results of studies on flap design are contradictory, but there is no difference in long-term periodontal health. Systematic reviews clearly show that longer periods of smoking cessation decrease surgical complications, but few studies have addressed M3 surgery. Likewise, the role of pre-emptive analgesia, although beneficial in a general surgical setting, has not been studied thoroughly with regard to M3 surgery. The use of chlorhexidine rinses to prevent alveolar osteitis and surgical site infection has been studied extensively, but meta-analyses have not convincingly proved this effect. The evidence is convincing that antibiotics decrease alveolar osteitis and surgical site infection. Similarly, it is clear that corticosteroids decrease postoperative trismus and edema; however, the role of steroids in decreasing pain is not proved.

Conclusion

This review found various factors associated with improving recovery and minimizing complications in M3 surgery.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: dental evaluation and management prior to treatment for hematologic malignancies and CAR T-cell therapy [^1126LmAi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Dental management with abnormal blood counts — bleeding risk — If extraction is needed, primary closure without placement of intra-alveolar materials is preferable, and there is no evidence in the literature about the safety of bone graft insertion prior to other chemotherapy, HCT (hematopoietic cell transplantation) or CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy, so the risk associated with alveolar ridge preservation is unknown. To control bleeding in invasive procedures local pressure and/or sutures should be applied and topical hemostatic agents are an important adjunct; if intra-socket hemostatic agents are considered, rapidly resorbable agents are preferred over long-standing agents as the latter may delay healing and may be a nidus for infection. In cases of extremely low platelet count, the care provider should weigh benefits and risks and any surgery must be planned and coordinated with the hemato-oncologist to assess risk versus benefit; platelet or fresh frozen plasma transfusion may be needed prior and subsequent to the dental procedure, and if platelet refractoriness is diagnosed, complete blood count should be tested following the platelet transfusion and prior to the dental treatment to confirm sufficient platelet count at baseline. Coagulation testing and hemostatic measures may be required before and during dental interventions, respectively, in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy.

### Reconstruction of the extraction socket: methods, manipulations, and management [^1113WNMY]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Extensive reviews have concluded that grafting of the socket reduces bone loss regardless of product or method. However, nothing has been shown to reliably and completely maintain alveolar dimensions. We advocate a biologically driven and anatomically based approach for reconstruction of the socket. There are various socket manipulations that we have found to predictably prepare a site for dental implant. The combination of graft construct design and socket management maximizes graft success for any practitioner. Each socket should be treated individually, and products or methods used that are coincident with the complexity of the defect in question.

### The evaluation of objective and subjective fate of teeth in the mandible fracture line and the management – A center's experience [^113p1Rby]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Maxillofacial fracture is a common clinical issue, especially in accidents, traffic accidents, fall damage, etc. The treatment of maxillofacial area fractures is still regarded as an important topic in clinical research till now. Top of the most heated debating critical topics in this field is mainly related to the preservation or removal choice of the existing teeth in or near the mandibular fracture line and its further treatment, it may be highly related to the overall treatment effectiveness with the tooth extraction or preservation decision. No matter if it happens in teenagers or adults, fractures in the tooth-bearing areas in the mandible also show the risk of communication with the oral cavity through the periodontal ligament or tooth socket which may lead to severe infection and results. It should be a concern that apart from the treatment of fracture, more should be paid to attention when it made troubles, it could lead to such as the tooth in the fracture line may progress to various results. This may result in pulp necrosis, root fracture or surface exposure, tooth subluxation or avulsion, etc. Furthermore, the previous existing disease related to the fracture line cross-linked tooth, such as pulp or other periodontal troubles, could be severely aggravated much advanced after the bone fracture. The key point may come from the infection treatment and complications. Take the third molar as an example, usually, it is highly concern as it is tightly connected to mandibular angle fracture, and still, the fate of the tooth can be complicated, especially combined with a cited fracture with high risks, also, sometimes it could be a key factor in the decision of the further treatment design and outcome hint. – However, still many other situations may be related to tooth fate and patients' subjective evaluations.

### Is dental treatment of an infected Tooth a risk factor for locally invasive spread of infection? [^114L69qn]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the impact of antecedent dental procedures and dental health on the course of odontogenic maxillofacial infections requiring hospital care.

Patients and Methods

In this retrospective cohort study in a referral center, we evaluated medical records and panoramic radiographs of all patients admitted because of odontogenic maxillofacial infection (n = 84). The predictor variables were preceding dental treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and dental health. The outcome variables comprised infection parameters, length of stay, need for intensive care, and management during hospitalization.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 43.2 ± 16.5 years and 60% were men. Dental procedure preceded the spread of the infection in 49 cases (58%): endodontic treatment (n = 22), tooth extraction (n = 19), and minor first aid (n = 8). Twenty-seven patients had not received any dental or antimicrobial treatment in the recent past. Antimicrobial treatment alone had been given to 8 patients. Patients without preceding treatment had the highest C-reactive protein levels on admission and at maximum (P = 0.020 and P = 0.011) and the highest white blood cell counts on admission (P = 0.011). Their length of stay was also longer, and they needed intensive care more often than the other patients. Maximum C-reactive protein levels and white blood cell counts between treatment groups did not significantly differ from each other.

Conclusions

The systemic response to the infection was strongest and the course of the infection most severe in the absence of preceding dental treatment and in patients with poor dental health. All types of dental treatment contributed to a less severe course of infection.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^115jNXbM]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation framework — recommendations versus good practice statements (GPS) and strength: Recommendations are informed by a comprehensive search for the best available evidence and a formal process for assessing the certainty of the evidence, whereas GPS are appropriate when there is an excess of indirect evidence suggesting that their implementation will result in large and unequivocal net positive or negative consequences; recommendations are associated with a certainty of the evidence in contrast to GPS. The expert panel graded the strength of recommendations (that is, strong or conditional) and these recommendations and GPS aim to help clinicians, policy makers, and patients make decisions about antibiotic use for immunocompetent adults (most typical patients) who have the target conditions; clinicians should use informed clinical judgement to identify the appropriate course of action in situations that deviate from these recommendations and GPS.

### The issue with incidence: a scoping review of reported medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) incidence around the globe [^117T5LYH]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Definition of MRONJ

For patients to be diagnosed with MRONJ as per AAOMS guidance, they must satisfy all the following characteristics:

"Current or previous treatment with antiresorptive therapy alone or in combination with immune modulators or antiangiogenic medications.
Exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an intraoral or extraoral fistula in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for longer than 8 weeks
No history of radiation therapy to the jaws or obvious metastatic disease to the jaws".

MRONJ can significantly affect patients' quality of life with symptoms such as pain, infection and even fractured jaws. It can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by dental extractions, poor-fitting dentures or periodontal treatment.MRONJ can also lead to interruption of the patient's vital medications as they may be stopped with the development of MRONJ.

While AAOMS provides an excellent review of the epidemiology, risk factors, and management strategies based on staging, the recommendations lack specificity, and there are well-reported gaps in knowledge leading to uncertainty among clinicians on how to manage the condition. General Dental Practitioners also report a lack of confidence in managing at-risk patients due to a lack of data and guidance, which may result in increased unnecessary referrals to secondary care. This highlights additional areas of much-needed further research.

MRONJ is generally considered to be rare; however, reported incidence rates in literature are largely estimated due to acknowledged difficulties in MRONJ research, such as small patient numbers, heterogeneity in studies and multiple variables thought to influence MRONJ development. Therefore, true incidence rates have yet to be ascertained, echoed in both the AAOMS position paper 2022 and by the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP), a leading body on evidence-based management of clinical issues in dentistry, with a statement on the need for increased epidemiological data in this area. Without true incidence data, we cannot confidently provide patients with evidence relating to risk when prescribing these medications or undertaking procedures at risk of causing MRONJ. We furthermore cannot ensure resources are correctly allocated in services to meet population needs with clear implications for patient care and utilisation of services.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) — stage 2 management includes antibacterial oral rinses and systemic antibiotic therapy, acknowledging that although infection is not the main cause of MRONJ, bacterial accumulation in the necrotic area is commonly observed and is usually controlled by antimicrobials. Formation of a bacterial membrane has been reported to interfere with the efficacy of systemic antibiotics, pain control should be addressed with analgesics, and removal of bone fragments that irritate the soft tissue should be considered in a conservative yet definitive surgical approach; patient education about meticulous oral care, compliance to antibiotic therapy, and modifiable risk factors should be discussed and communicated with the medical oncologist, dental specialist, and primary care physician.

Accordingly, "elective TJA surgery should be postponed until dental and antibiotic treatment has concluded with subsequent verification that the oral infection has been eradicated".

American Dental Association guideline — follow-up and duration of antibiotic therapy: There is little to no evidence supporting the common belief that a shortened course of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance; clinicians should reevaluate or follow up with their patient after 3 days to assess if there is resolution of systemic signs and symptoms, and if the patient's signs and symptoms begin to resolve, clinicians should instruct the patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 days; prescription medications, including antibiotics, should not be saved for later use nor shared with others, and the panel emphasizes the importance of patients' discarding antibiotics safely at local disposal centers.

Dry socket, or alveolar osteitis, can occur because of the removal of teeth. No clear etiology has been acknowledged; however, numerous risk factors have been proposed and tested. We report on the results of a prospective, multicenter study of the incidence and factors affecting the occurrence of alveolar osteitis at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne and Community Dental Clinics in Melbourne, Australia. Ethics approval was gained from the University of Melbourne and Dental Health Services Victoria. The data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion, and the factors affecting alveolar osteitis were assessed using logistic regression analysis. The incidence of alveolar osteitis was 2.3% of all teeth extracted, with 4.2% of all patients experiencing alveolar osteitis in a public dental setting. Multivariate analysis revealed operator experience, perioperative crown and root fractures, periodontal disease, posterior teeth, and, interestingly, the use of mental health medications to be significant independent risk factors for the development of alveolar osteitis. No alveolar osteitis was reported in patients taking antibiotics, the oral contraceptive pill, bisphosphonates, or oral steroid drugs. Smoking and extraction technique (either operative or nonoperative) were also not found to significantly affect the development of alveolar osteitis.

### Controversies in the management of oral and maxillofacial infections [^114qh9yE]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The management and treatment of odontogenic infection, and its frequent extension into the head and neck, remains an important section of oral and maxillofacial surgical practice. This area of maxillofacial expertise is widely recognized by the medical community and an essential component to the hospital referral system. Although the general principles of infection management have not changed, there have been modifications in the timing of treatment sequences and treatment techniques. These modifications are influenced by the development of diagnostic methods and advances in bacterial genetics and antibiotic usage. This article reviews treatment considerations and controversies surrounding this subject.

### Fracture-related infection: a consensus on definition from an international expert group [^114m2xiy]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Fracture-related infection (FRI) is a common and serious complication in trauma surgery. Accurately estimating the impact of this complication has been hampered by the lack of a clear definition. The absence of a working definition of FRI renders existing studies difficult to evaluate or compare. In order to address this issue, an expert group comprised of a number of scientific and medical organizations has been convened, with the support of the AO Foundation, in order to develop a consensus definition. The process that led to this proposed definition started with a systematic literature review, which revealed that the majority of randomized controlled trials in fracture care do not use a standardized definition of FRI. In response to this conclusion, an international survey on the need for and key components of a definition of FRI was distributed amongst all registered AOTrauma users. Approximately 90% of the more than 2000 surgeons who responded suggested that a definition of FRI is required. As a final step, a consensus meeting was held with an expert panel. The outcome of this process led to a consensus definition of FRI. Two levels of certainty around diagnostic features were defined. Criteria could be confirmatory (infection definitely present) or suggestive. Four confirmatory criteria were defined: Fistula, sinus or wound breakdown; Purulent drainage from the wound or presence of pus during surgery; Phenotypically indistinguishable pathogens identified by culture from at least two separate deep tissue/implant specimens; Presence of microorganisms in deep tissue taken during an operative intervention, as confirmed by histopathological examination. Furthermore, a list of suggestive criteria was defined. These require further investigations in order to look for confirmatory criteria. In the current paper, an overview is provided of the proposed definition and a rationale for each component and decision. The intention of establishing this definition of FRI was to offer clinicians the opportunity to standardize clinical reports and improve the quality of published literature. It is important to note that the proposed definition was not designed to guide treatment of FRI and should be validated by prospective data collection in the future.

### Multiple myeloma and pulmonary aspergillosis: dental treatment prior to chemotherapy and management of post extraction complications [^115k54Xg]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

This case study discusses the dental management of a patient with a history of multiple myeloma and pulmonary aspergillosis, whom was referred to a hospital-based dental service for urgent dental review. The patient had received a dental assessment in primary care prior to commencement of chemotherapy and had four teeth extracted without complications. However, following the commencement of chemotherapy, he presented with a significant infection associated with two of his wisdom teeth resulting in extraction. Despite atraumatic extraction, the upper right wisdom tooth socket developed an oroantral fistula. A multidisciplinary team approach was required to enable effective patient management in this complex patient regarding myeloma, aspergillosis and the medications used including bisphosphonates and chemotherapy. It highlights the higher risk of oral complications that can arise in myelosuppressed patients and emphasises the need to identify potential sources of dental infection prior to the commencement of chemotherapy.

### Update on antimicrobial therapy in management of acute odontogenic infection in oral and maxillofacial surgery [^116k1M3x]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This article focuses on the antimicrobial therapy of head and neck infections from odontogenic origin. Odontogenic infections are among the most common infections of the oral cavity. They are sourced primarily from dental caries and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Many odontogenic infections are self-limiting and may drain spontaneously. However, these infections may drain into the anatomic spaces adjacent to the oral cavity and spread along the contiguous facial planes, leading to more serious infections. Antibiotics are an important aspect of care of the patient with an acute odontogenic infection. Antibiotics are not a substitute for definitive surgical management.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: dental implants in fresh extraction sockets (immediate, immediate-delayed and delayed implants) [^116LYcxG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

'Immediate' implants are placed in dental sockets just after tooth extraction. 'Immediate-delayed' implants are those implants inserted after weeks up to about a couple of months to allow for soft tissue healing. 'Delayed' implants are those placed thereafter in partially or completely healed bone. The potential advantages of immediate implants are that treatment time can be shortened and that bone volumes might be partially maintained thus possibly providing good aesthetic results. The potential disadvantages are an increased risk of infection and failures. After implant placement in postextractive sites, gaps can be present between the implant and the bony walls. It is possible to fill these gaps and to augment bone simultaneously to implant placement. There are many techniques to achieve this but it is unclear when augmentation is needed and which could be the best augmentation technique.

Objectives

To evaluate success, complications, aesthetics and patient satisfaction between 'immediate', 'immediate-delayed' and 'delayed' implants. To evaluate whether and when augmentation procedures are necessary and which is the most effective technique.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 2 June 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950–2 June 2010) and EMBASE via OVID (1980–2 June 2010) were searched. Several dental journals were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing immediate, immediate-delayed, and delayed implants, or comparing various bone augmentation procedures around the inserted implants, reporting the outcome of the interventions to at least 1 year after functional loading.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. Trial authors were contacted for any missing information. Results were expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical unit of the analysis was the patient.

Main Results

Fourteen eligible RCTs were identified but only seven trials could be included. Four RCTs evaluated implant placement timing. Two RCTs compared immediate versus delayed implants in 126 patients and found no statistically significant differences. One RCT compared immediate-delayed versus delayed implants in 46 patients. After 2 years patients in the immediate-delayed group perceived the time to functional loading significantly shorter, were more satisfied and independent blinded assessor judged the level of the perimplant marginal mucosa in relation to that of the adjacent teeth as more appropriate (RR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.72). These differences disappeared 5 years after loading but significantly more complications occurred in the immediate-delayed group (RR = 4.20; 95% CI 1.01 to 17.43). One RCT compared immediate with immediately delayed implants in 16 patients for 2 years and found no differences. Three RCTs evaluated different techniques of bone grafting for implants immediately placed in extraction sockets. No statistically significant difference was observed when evaluating whether autogenous bone is needed in postextractive sites (1 trial with 26 patients) or which was the most effective augmentation technique (2 trials with 56 patients).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants, therefore these preliminary conclusions are based on few underpowered trials often judged to be at high risk of bias. There is a suggestion that immediate and immediate-delayed implants may be at higher risks of implant failures and complications than delayed implants on the other hand the aesthetic outcome might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction. There is not enough reliable evidence supporting or refuting the need for augmentation procedures at immediate implants placed in fresh extraction sockets or whether any of the augmentation techniques is superior to the others.

### Local interventions for the management of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) [^11333evY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions more often involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively with or without halitosis, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of a blood clot, and increased postoperative visits. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2012. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction.

Search Methods

An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket postextraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We followed Cochrane statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For some of the split-mouth studies with sparse data, it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio (OR) instead. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence.

Main Results

We included 49 trials with 6771 participants; 39 trials (with 6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 studies (with 552 participants) looked at the treatment of dry socket. 16 studies were at high risk of bias, 30 studies at unclear risk of bias, and 3 studies at low risk of bias. Chlorhexidine in the prevention of dry socket When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12% and 0.2% concentrations) both before and 24 hours after extraction(s) substantially reduced the risk of developing dry socket with an OR of 0.38 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.58; P < 0.00001; 6 trials, 1547 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varies from 1% to 5% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) with chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket was 162 (95% CI 155 to 240), 33 (95% CI 27 to 49), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 10) for control prevalence of dry socket 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel intrasocket after extractions reduced the odds of developing a dry socket by 58% with an OR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 trials, 753 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The NNT with chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) to prevent one patient developing dry socket was 180 (95% CI 137 to 347), 37 (95% CI 28 to 72), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 15) for control prevalence of dry socket of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to chlorhexidine rinse (0.12%), placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) intrasocket after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of dry socket (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 trials, 383 participants; low-certainty evidence). The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12%, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinses (alteration in taste, staining of teeth, stomatitis) though most studies were not designed explicitly to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket. Platelet rich plasma in the prevention of dry socket Compared to placebo, placing platelet rich plasma after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of having a dry socket (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 127 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A further 21 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Zinc oxide eugenol versus Alvogyl in the treatment of dry socket Two studies, with 80 participants, showed that Alvogyl (old formulation) is more effective than zinc oxide eugenol at reducing pain at day 7 (mean difference (MD) -1.40, 95% CI -1.75 to -1.04; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence) A further nine interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in single studies, providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is moderate-certainty evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% and 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, probably results in a reduction in dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 21 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was limited evidence of very low certainty that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol.

### Managing mandibular osteoradionecrosis [^111v7ppm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Treatment

Treatment paradigms are based on the disease stage. In early or moderate disease, options include (1) close observation, (2) early surgical sequestrectomy or saucerization, (3) HBOT, and more recently, (4) targeted medical therapy. Unfortunately, no robust trials support these options as gold‐standard therapy. When treatment options are ineffective for early disease, progression necessitates segmental resection and microvascular reconstruction with osteocutaneous free flaps. While effective in controlling ORN and restoring mandibular continuity, this intervention incurs high morbidity.

The management of MORN ranges widely. Traditionally, treatment has leaned toward conservative measures due to evidence that manipulation of the site often leads to further trauma, which further exacerbates an already compromised wound. Adopting a "watch and wait" policy, however, must be practiced with caution for 2 reasons: (1) delaying treatment risks disease progression, and (2) the everchanging definitions of ORN have led to heterogeneity within the literature concerning diagnosis; therefore, previously‐reported spontaneous resolution rates may be overestimated. To date, no large‐scale studies have evaluated the efficacy of nonsurgical and nonhyperbaric conservative management of MORN.

In treating advanced disease, the established gold standard is segmental resection with osteocutaneous free‐flap reconstruction. Necrotic bone is excised to native bleeding bone and replaced with nonirradiated well‐vascularized bone. This surgery introduces a robust blood supply to the region, allowing wound healing and symptomatic resolution. Although nearly 90% effective, the morbidity of the osteocutaneous flap is not inconsequential. Patients with ORN are at higher risk for flap complications (21%‐60%) and flap loss (as high as 20%).,

Evolution of ORN Management

In 1970, Meyer first described antibiotics with or without surgical debridement as a viable option in managing MORN. This model shifted in 1983 when Marx introduced his pathophysiologic theory and staging system centered around the use of HBOT. The paradigm of ORN management remained relatively stagnant until Delanian and Lefaix introduced the RIF theory in 2004. Their findings suggested a role for antioxidant and antifibrotic agents in the nonsurgical management of MORN. As such, several targeted pharmacologic therapies — notably, pentoxifylline, tocopherol (vitamin‐E), and clodronate (PENTOCLO) — have since been investigated for treatment. In addition to expanding available pharmacotherapy, the landscape of MORN has continued to shift concerning the utility of HBOT and novel surgical techniques.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic joint infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy following exchange arthroplasty (staphylococcal PJI), IDSA 2013 guidelines recommend to consider initiating indefinite chronic oral antimicrobial suppression with either cephalexin, dicloxacillin, co-trimoxazole, or minocycline or doxycycline based on in vitro susceptibility, allergies, or intolerances, following the above regimen.

American Dental Association antibiotic use guideline — evidence selection and limitations describe that the selection criteria specified any person of any age in any dental setting in the United States with exposure defined as any systemic antibiotics versus no systemic antibiotics, and the guideline uses Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) with definitions for high certainty and moderate certainty. Considerations for included studies note potential over-diagnosis or overestimation of C. difficile infection due to highly sensitive diagnostic tests with poor distinction between colonization and disease, reliance on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes instead of laboratory results with possible coding bias, and generalizability concerns with a potential overestimate and possible underestimation of anaphylaxis owing to lack of tryptase confirmation, exclusion of certain electronic health record codes, and uncertainty about whether cases resulted in death.

### Changes in antibiotic prescribing by dentists in the United States, 2012–2019 [^111XQ6x7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. The IQVIA LRx data set did not include characteristics of dental visits or patient comorbidities. Thus, we could not evaluate the appropriateness of the antibiotic prescribed. Furthermore, we included all prescriptions dispensed, but we could not determine whether patients actually took the antibiotic. Finally, the data included in this study may not include all patients receiving dental care because the LRx database only contains information on dispensed prescriptions.

Regardless, our results are relevant to public health efforts to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics. Obtaining data identifying the indication for a dental antibiotic is challenging. Population-level prescription data sets, such as IQVIA LRx, can be used to monitor the need for and effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship strategies. The CDC Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship recommend the use of prescribing data to inform stewardship efforts. Although dentists are included as a targeted group to implement the Core Elements, there are few examples of the implementation of antibiotic stewardship in dental practices. These antibiotic stewardship strategies should be tailored to the practice of dental specialists, especially oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Future monitoring should assess overall antibiotic prescribing rates, trends by dental specialists, and the impact of removing clindamycin from the 2021 update to the AHA infective endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines. Before-and-after analyses specific to guideline changes and/or stewardship efforts that are implemented as a result of these data can also be monitored with the use of IQVIA LRx to determine whether these strategies have made a significant impact. Using these data in this manner can be an effective monitoring strategy in future dental stewardship efforts. Antibiotics are commonly used as premedication to prevent complications from tooth extractions and dental implants. Although data are mixed on the effectiveness of this practice, guidelines recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for extractions and implants are not available. The United Kingdom does not recommend antibiotics to prevent postoperative infection or dry socket associated with tooth extraction and only recommends antibiotics to prevent dental implant complications when bone augmentation is part of the procedure. Finally, the impact of the 2015 ADA guidelines removing antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations in patients with prosthetic joints appears to have minimal, if any, impact on overall antibiotic prescribing rates by dentists.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: infection and trauma of the dentition [^111nQm1d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Trauma of the Alveolar Bone

Periodontal and alveolar bone injury following trauma typically presents as mobile, displaced teeth and may be classified as concussion, subluxation, luxation, and avulsion. Concussions refer to injuries that cause only edema and hemorrhage of the periodontal ligament without its rupture. Affected teeth are neither mobile nor displaced but do exhibit increased sensitivity to percussion. Most tooth concussions require no treatment and resolve completely. Subluxation is a type of injury that causes rupture of the periodontal ligament fibers with mild to moderate horizontal and/or vertical mobility of tooth-supporting structures, but there is no displacement of the teeth themselves. These injuries are usually associated with hemorrhage at the gingival margin. Often times these teeth do not require treatment.

There are different types of tooth luxation; mainly classified based on the direction of displacement. Intrusion or intrusive luxation (Fig. 14) causes a tooth to become pushed up into its socket, sometimes to the point where they are no longer visible clinically. Extrusion or extrusive luxation (Fig. 15) partially displaces a tooth from its socket towards the outside showing a vertically displaced, elongated, and excessively mobile tooth. Lateral luxation (Fig. 16) also involves partial displacement of a tooth, but horizontal directionality with or without axial displacement is noted, with the affected teeth usually displaced in a palatal-lingual or labial direction. They are typically immobile, and produce a high, metallic sound upon percussion. This pattern of injury is frequently associated with concurrent fracture of the alveolar process. Radiographs are indicated if intrusion, extrusion or lateral luxation injuries are suspected. The specific treatment of each of these varies slightly and is beyond the scope of this article, but is focused on prompt evaluation, repositioning, and fixation. Each of these injuries commonly affect the dental pulp, with the highest incidence of pulpal necrosis occurring with intrusion injuries. It is important to have these teeth monitored regularly by a dentist for tooth necrosis, in which case endodontic therapy is required. If a primary tooth is involved, extraction of the tooth may be the best treatment modality. However, recommendations vary based on the degree and direction of displacement as well as the patients dental age.

MRONJ risk factors with low-dose BMAs

Identifying risk factors for MRONJ in patients with osteoporosis receiving low-dose BMAs is challenging, as evidence is limited due to the very low frequency of MRONJ. In the FREEDOM extension study, which involved 3591 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, there were only 12 cases of MRONJ after up to 7 years of low-dose denosumab (plus 3 years of denosumab in the main FREEDOM study). Nearly half the women had undergone at least one invasive oral procedure, and the incidence of MRONJ was higher in these women compared with those that did not (0.68 versus 0.05%). A systematic review identified 680 cases of MRONJ in patients with osteoporosis from 44 studies. Duration of anti-absorptive drug treatment was found to be a MRONJ risk factor, as was concomitant corticosteroid/immunosuppressive treatment. Dental extractions followed by dentoalveolar surgery were the most frequent events prior to MRONJ, occurring in 48.5% and 21.1% of patients, respectively. In these cases, MRONJ was likely triggered by an underlying chronic local infection, which resulted in dental extraction, rather than the procedure. Infection may develop as a consequence of the dental procedure, when bacteria gain access to bone because extraction sockets are left open to heal spontaneously or when wound healing is incomplete. Alternatively, infection may be the reason for the tooth extraction. Indeed, a retrospective study of patients with osteoporosis and/or malignant tumors treated with bisphosphonates undergoing tooth extraction or surgical tooth removal revealed that in 69% of cases, osteomyelitic or osteonecrotic changes were already present at the time of the extraction.

### Jaw osteomyelitis [^113xQsB5]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Mandibular osteomyelitis is caused most commonly by members of the oral flora in the setting of dental infection or dental manipulation, often in patients with underlying mandible pathology. Recognizing and treating mandible infections is especially challenging when they are associated with osteonecrotic conditions that are themselves difficult to manage and that may be associated with symptoms and testing results that mimic infection. Optimized diagnosis and management of mandible infections require collaboration between specialists in surgical and medical aspects of care, with the goal of clearing or controlling infection while maximizing function.

➤ The number of patients with end-stage osteoarthritis is increasing, and treatment with hip and knee arthroplasty is expected to increase over the next several decades. ➤ Dental disease has long been anecdotally associated with increased periprosthetic joint infections, although case-control studies do not support this relationship. ➤ While most recent guidelines for the prevention of endocarditis have favored treatment of fewer patients, the most recent recommendations for prevention of periprosthetic joint infection have increased the number of patients who would receive antibiotics before a dental procedure. ➤ Antibiotics given before a dental procedure decrease the risk of bacteremia from the oral cavity, but this is of uncertain clinical importance. ➤ The number of patients who would require antibiotics before dental procedures to prevent one periprosthetic joint infection greatly outnumbers the number of patients who would experience an adverse event associated with antibiotics given before a dental procedure.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^111jiUDp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline summary on prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures emphasizes that "Periprosthetic joint infection is recognized as a devastating complication after total joint arthroplasty associated with increased morbidity and mortality", and that the consensus opinion "tries to weigh concerns for balancing infection in the mouth and infection risk potential for the new joint during the early phase post-arthroplasty". Regarding cost/resource use, "There is limited evidence to support cost effectiveness; however, this opinion does not accelerate resource utilization but rather considers delay and timing of delay in resource utilization". On acceptability, "This consensus opinion aims to give guidance that can be considered by the health care team members to maximize access to dental healthcare while minimizing any potential risk of transient bacteremia seeding a new joint replacement in the early prosthetic joint healing phase". For feasibility, "After dissemination of the clinical practice guideline, there should be limited obstacles to wider spread adoption", and "Communication between dentists and orthopedic surgeons is essential for care coordination". Operational considerations note that "For dental management of acute dental infection immediately after TJA while the patient is still in the hospital, this may assume the hospital or surgical facility has access to a dentist/oral and maxillofacial surgeon who will provide care in the hospital setting", and, after discharge, "this may warrant additional time delay in scheduling definitive dental invasive intervention to resolve dental infection while the patient is maintained on intravenous antibiotics". Future research needs are identified: "As limited research was available, investigations documenting dental treatment and type (grouped by hematogenous bacteremia potential) undertaken at specific time points after TJA in the early healing phase, then correlated with PJI outcomes, would be of benefit".

Management

The identification and management of dental needs prior to initiating hemato-oncologic therapy are prudent for all patients, including those who regularly receive oral health care. The dental evaluation should include a clinical and radiological assessment. Ideally, periodontal assessment should be performed if the medical background and blood counts permit (see below).
The pre-cancer dental management is determined by the following goals: o To eliminate dental sources of infection to the extent of reducing the risk of acute dental infection or reactivation of chronic infection until immune reconstitution occurs and to prevent systemic spread of dental and oral pathogenic micro-organisms during this period. o To reduce oral discomfort or pain that may be a burden during cancer treatment. o To reduce local irritation from the teeth, dental restorations or prostheses to the oral mucosa while the tissue is at risk for OM. o To reduce the risk for aspiration of loose dental structures. o To educate the patient about the importance of self-care, oral hygiene during the hemato-oncologic cancer therapy, and briefly prepare the patient for common anticipated oral complications. o Ultimately, to improve oral intake, reduce pain, prevent interruption in cancer therapy, improve quality of life, and possibly reduce mortality. Indirectly, this may also reduce costs of care.
Accordingly, the treatment plan should prioritize dental needs that may develop into active infection, may cause uncontrolled pain or irritation of the oral mucosa during the immunosuppression, or pose a risk for aspiration.
Examples of dental needs at high priority to be addressed pre hemato-oncologic therapy include symptomatic teeth, advanced dental caries approaching the pulp, unrestorable teeth, inflamed or necrotic pulp, symptomatic apical periodontitis, symptomatic apical abscess, gingival or periodontal abscess, advanced chronic periodontitis with purulent exudate or with severe tooth mobility, periimplantitis with purulent exudate or with severe implant mobility, pericoronitis during the last three months, loose contact point with food impaction, a sharp structure (e.g. fractured tooth or restoration and ill-fitting prosthesis or orthodontic appliances) that are traumatic to the soft tissue, or pathologies that typically deem an immediate excision. A "symptomatic" dental need denotes symptoms occurring within the last three months.
Poor oral hygiene (OH) is an aggravating factor for oral infection that drives more determinative dental treatment decisions. OH instruction (OHI) and professional OH treatment are key elements in the dental treatment plan that will help to set a healthy plaque-control at baseline and educate the patient on how to maintain it. Given that fatigue is a common complication following hemato-oncologic treatments, particularly CAR T-cell therapy, as part of their education, patients should be encouraged to maintain good OH despite this challenge.
There is no reservation regarding continuing tooth brushing. Inter-dental brushing/flossing should be continued during the HCT or cytopenia period if a patient is proficient with these techniques. The toothbrush should be rinsed thoroughly with water and allowed to air-dry and should be replaced at the first signs of bristle wear. Removable dentures or appliances should be cleaned daily mechanically and with agents specifically designated for this purpose. Chlorhexidine (CHX) rinse may be an effective adjunct in plaque control. Alcohol-free CHX may be used if the oral mucosa is sensitive to standard CHX preparation.
Fluoride application, either office-based or home-based, may be offered as a preventive measure in dentate patients.
The time constraints prior to initiation of cancer therapy dictate modifications to the dental treatment plan. The burden of the dental disease, the urgency of the cancer treatment, and the risk of complications due to the dental treatment are the main considerations in prioritizing the dental treatment before the initiation of the cancer therapy. Insufficient time for post-operative healing or for re-treatment if the first attempt fails drives a more determinative approach over a conventional dental treatment plan in healthy patients. Multi-visit, time-consuming endodontic treatment is unfavored, especially when additional high-priority dental needs are present.
The dental treatment plan should address present dental needs as well as dental conditions that are anticipated to deteriorate within 6–12 months following the hemato-oncologic therapy, until routine dental treatment may be resumed (see below the section about the considerations to restart routine dental care).
Considering the time constraints, efforts should be made to consolidate multiple treatments into a single session to efficiently manage the limited timeframe available. It is advised to schedule dental extractions as early as possible to maximize the postoperative healing period before the initiation of the hemato-oncologic therapy. Ideally, tooth extractions should be performed with sufficient time before hemato-oncologic therapy to allow the socket to heal with epithelium, thereby reducing the risk of pathogen penetration. This is estimated to happen within 2–3 weeks following the extraction.
The decision about tooth extraction is a delicate balance, and the dentist should be mindful of its impact. Post-extraction adverse sequelae (e.g. infection and dry socket) may potentially postpone the oncologic treatment. Additionally, a radical treatment plan may negatively impact oral function in the immediate term. Furthermore, the patient may have compromised oral function for a long term because routine dental care is held.
Ideally, if time allows, a dental treatment plan should extend beyond mere tooth extraction to include restorative treatment, which may potentially reduce the risk of bacteremia and would improve the patient's quality of life.
If time constraints do not allow delivering all planned dental care, the patient should be informed about unresolved dental needs posing a low risk of immediate complications. These dental needs should be addressed following the hemato-oncologic therapy when the medical condition permits, for example during the next remission phase. For unresolved incipient dental caries, an in-office fluoridation and at-home high-concentration fluoride toothpaste may be offered. There may be geographic variation in the availability of these fluoride agents.
The hematologist should be informed about the dental needs which pose a high risk of complications and should be addressed in the immediate term. Communication about the invasiveness of the planned treatment and expected healing time is of great value in order for the physician to advise on the delivery of the dental treatment or to postpone the chemotherapy, HCT, or CAR T-cell therapy.
When dental treatment is deemed necessary prior to the hemato-oncologic therapy, adjustment of the treatment plan may be needed based on the patient's hematologic profile and medical status.
Risk of spread of oral pathogenic micro-organisms during dental treatment. Clinician discretion regarding antibiotic prophylaxis in dental patients at risk for infection is needed (Table 1).
Risk of bleeding. In thrombocytopenic patients, major bleeding may develop following surgical or non-surgical intervention, such as scaling (Table). In addition, cancer patients are at risk of coagulation disorders, and some may receive anti-coagulant treatment. The clinician should assess the bleeding risk and prepare for intra-operative and post-operative bleeding complications.
Risk of anemia-related complications. Patients with anemia may experience fatigue and dizziness, especially upon position change (Table). Additionally, anemia may also delay healing.
Approach to indwelling catheter. Often patients prior to hemato-oncologic therapy undergo indwelling catheter insertion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated prior to dental intervention in immunocompetent patients with indwelling catheter. o Risk of osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The radiotherapy dose in patients with orofacial lymphoma or plasmacytoma is relatively low. However, if the cumulative dose to the jawbone at the site of extraction exceeds 44 Gy, ORN may develop. Thus, the treatment approach for these hematologic patients will be similar to patients with head and neck cancer. It is advised to assess if extraction is needed prior to the radiotherapy and complete the extractions > 2 weeks prior to the radiotherapy. Dosimetry mapping may assist in determining the risk of developing ORN in a particular jaw segment, and accordingly in the planning of dental treatment. o Comorbidities. The patient's medical records may identify medical comorbidities and medications that require additional modifications in the dental treatment plan. For example, history of treatment with bone modifying agents (e.g. bisphosphonates and denosumab) poses a higher risk for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), and therefore, the dental treatment plan should be adjusted according to standard recommendations.
Given the complexity of the decision-making in the dental management of hemato-oncology patients prior to the cancer therapy, a consultation with an oral medicine specialist or a hospital dentist with expertise in managing this patient population is advised.
The dental practitioner should educate the patient on managing the common oral complications associated with upcoming hemato-oncologic therapy. Detailed information on these complications is outside the scope of this CPS paper; clinicians are referred to other MASCC/ISOO publications for guidance on managing these issues (see Suggested Reading as Electronic Supplementary Material).
Routine dental treatment may be resumed after immune reconstitution.
In hemato-oncologic patients treated with chemotherapy, bone marrow recovery is expected within about 2–3 weeks following the last dose of chemotherapy, as can be indicated by the white blood cell (WBC) count, and particularly neutrophil counts.
In patients undergoing HCT, the immune reconstitution status is usually substantiated by the WBC, CD4 count, and immunoglobulin levels, among other tests. Often, this is attained at about 3 months post autologous HCT and about 6 months post allogeneic HCT. The transplant physician may choose to postpone the dental intervention beyond this period to assure the patient's immunocompetence and ability to undergo dental treatment safely.
In the setting of CAR T-cell therapy, cytopenia may develop later and last longer than post conventional HCT. Blood counts should be tested prior to invasive dental treatment during the first 2 years following the CAR T-cell therapy. Given the unpredictable risk for cytopenia, the patient should be motivated to practice good oral hygiene especially while routine dental treatment cannot be performed.
If an acute dentoalveolar infection develops prior to immune reconstitution, nonsurgical intervention including systemic antibiotics and local antimicrobials are the mainstay of treatment. Intervention for dental complications during cancer therapy and prior to immune reconstitution is reserved for exceptional cases and requires a consultation between the dental care provider and the hematologist.
Following CAR T-cell therapy, if a dental emergency develops while the patient suffers prolonged cytopenia, and topical antimicrobial and systemic antibiotic treatment is ineffective in controlling the infection, dental treatment may be delivered as a last resort. In such cases, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be considered to support dental interventions, provided that the patient does not have a concurrent diagnosis of cytokine release syndrome.
Preparatory treatment with G-CSF may be considered on an individual basis in other neutropenic patients in need of dental intervention, for example, patients post HCT with delayed engraftment. When G-CSF treatment is considered, the hematologist should be consulted.
In pediatric patients, there are a few unique considerations prior to chemotherapy or HCT in addition to the removal of foci of infection:
Oral hygiene aids should be adjusted to the patient's age. The parents should be actively involved in the daily oral hygiene care. In younger or critically ill pediatric patients who are unable to brush teeth or use mouth rinses, the dental plaque can be mechanically removed by gently massaging the gumline with a gauze soaked with saline or CHX.
Primary teeth should be allowed to exfoliate naturally. However, extremely mobile teeth should be removed as part of the dental clearance. The rationale is to reduce the risk for pain, ensure oral intake, and avoid potential bleeding during thrombocytopenia.
Given the time constraints and behavioral challenges in pediatric patients, silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may be considered a non-restorative treatment to arrest superficial carious lesions on primary teeth. Patients and their parents should be informed about the possible side effects of SDF treatment and that future restoration will be needed to restore the cavitated tooth or that SDF treatment may need to be repeated periodically.
The treatment delivery should be adjusted to the pediatric patient population in order to achieve the patient's collaboration. For example, behavioral-cognitive techniques, sedation, or involvement of supporting services (medical clowns, animal-therapy). When there is an abundance of dental needs, general anesthesia may be required. Pediatric dental specialists are well experienced and equipped to manage this patient population.
Orthodontic brackets and appliances that may be plaque-retentive or traumatic to the soft tissues should be removed.
In elderly patients, there are a few unique considerations prior to chemotherapy or HCT in addition to the removal of foci of infection:
Removable dentures and implant-based prostheses are common in elderly patients.
In removable denture users, denture-induced traumatic contacts on a mucosal-bearing area should be removed prior to cancer therapy. Relining may be needed to fix ill-fitting/unstable dentures.
Patient should be educated about the optimal care for the denture. Briefly, regular rinses of the dentures in water are recommended. Additionally, periodic decontamination of the dentures with sodium bicarbonate, CHX, or other commercial products designated for denture cleaning is advised. Likewise, the patient should be educated about the adequate use of the denture specifically the removal of the denture at night.
In patients with implant-based fixed prostheses, the importance of self-oral hygiene adjacent to the dental implants should be stressed, and adjusted dental hygiene aids should be recommended.

### Surgical techniques for the removal of mandibular wisdom teeth [^117W6mzf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The surgical removal of mandibular wisdom teeth is one of the most common operations undertaken in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The most common indication for surgery is infection about a partially erupted tooth that is impacted against bone or soft tissues. Other indications include unrestorable caries, pulpal and periapical pathology, fracture of the tooth and cyst development, amongst others. Most commonly the benefits of surgical removal of a wisdom tooth include alleviation of the symptoms and signs of pericoronitis and its potential consequences. However, surgery is frequently associated with postoperative pain, swelling and trismus. Less commonly complications include infection, including dry socket, trigeminal nerve injuries and rarely fracture of the mandible.

Objectives

To compare the relative benefits and risks of different techniques for undertaking various aspects or stages of the surgical extraction of mandibular wisdom teeth.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 March 2014), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 21 March 2014) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 21 March 2014). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing surgical techniques for removal of mandibular wisdom teeth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted assessment of relevance, risk of bias and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information. RRs were used for dichotomous data and MDs for continuous data, unless the event rate was very low and Peto ORs were used. The pairing of the split-mouth studies was taken into account in the analysis for both dichotomous and continuous outcomes, and parallel group and split-mouth studies were combined using the generic inverse variance method. Random-effects models were used provided there were more than three studies (fixed-effect models otherwise).

Main Results

A total of 35 trials (2569 patients) were included. The interventions under consideration fell into seven broad categories, with many comparisons including only a small number of trials. Twenty-one of the trials were assessed at high risk of bias, the remaining 14 as unclear. The results are described in the summary of findings tables. Triangular flaps were associated with a 71% reduction in alveolar osteitis at one week (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.78; three trials, moderate quality) and reduction in pain at 24 hours (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10; two trials, moderate quality) compared with envelope flaps. There was no evidence of a difference in overall infection rates, in maximum mouth opening or in permanent sensation. However, there was some evidence that residual swelling after one week was slightly increased in the triangular flap groups compared to envelope flap types (MD 0.66 mm, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.07; two trials, low quality). We found no data on temporary sensation, or adverse events. There was low quality evidence from two studies, looking at the use of a retractor during third molar surgery, to indicate more cases of temporary altered sensation (up to one month) when a retractor was used (Peto OR 5.19, 95% CI 1.38 to 19.49; two trials, low quality). One study reported that this did not persist for more than six months in either group. We found no data for use of a retractor on other primary outcomes or adverse effects (including fracture of the mandible). Due to the small number of studies, the different comparisons evaluated, the variable outcomes reported and the paucity of useful data for all primary outcomes we were not able to draw any conclusions concerning bone removal in third molar surgery. There was insufficient evidence from single studies of very low quality on irrigation method (manual versus mechanical) or irrigation volume (low or high) to determine whether there were differences or not for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis or postoperative infection. We found no data for any of the other primary outcomes. There was insufficient evidence (low to very low quality) that any wound closure technique (primary versus secondary) was superior to another for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis, postoperative infection or maximum mouth opening achieved after seven days, or reactionary bleeding. There was evidence that secondary wound closure was associated with reduced pain at 24 hours (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24; four trials, moderate quality) and slightly reduced swelling after one week (MD 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57; seven trials, moderate quality). We found no data on other primary outcomes. There was some evidence that the use of a surgical drain was associated with less postoperative swelling (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.19; five trials, moderate quality) and greater maximum mouth opening one week after surgery (MD 3.72 mm, 95% CI 2.84 to 4.59; two trials, moderate quality). There was insufficient evidence from a single study (low quality) to determine whether the presence of a drain made any difference to pain at 24 hours postoperation. There were no data for the other primary outcomes. Although two RCTs compared coronectomy with complete extraction, flaws in the design and the unit of analysis of these studies meant that there were no reliable data available for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The thirty-five included trials looked at a range of different surgical techniques. The comparisons related to seven broad aspects of the surgical procedures for impacted mandibular third molars: type of surgical flap raised, use of retractors, techniques for bone removal, wound irrigation, wound closure, wound drainage, and complete/incomplete tooth removal. The quality of the body of evidence for each of these comparisons was very low to moderate due to the small number of trials and patients, and the majority of the trials being at high risk of bias (65%) with the remainder at unclear risk of bias. The evidence for making changes to surgical practice is therefore limited. However, it is useful to describe the state of the research evidence supporting practice so that surgeons can make an informed choice in adopting new techniques, or continuing with established techniques.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^115tmnpH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 — suggested time intervals between dental procedures and total joint arthroplasty (TJA) surgery — lists minimum times before and after TJA by procedure category. Dental examination without probing is not considered invasive and has minimum timing of same day before and same day after TJA. Oral hygiene procedures require 1 day before and 3 months after. Orthodontic procedures require 1 day before and 3 months after. Other non-invasive procedures note that impressions may be taken digitally or with intraoral impression material in a tray and require 1 day before and 3 months after. Scaling and/or root planing (SRP) requires 1 week before and 3 months after. Dental extractions (with or without bone graft or platelet-rich fibrin for socket augmentation) require 3 weeks before and 3 months after. Oral surgery requires 3 weeks before and 3 months after. For treatment of active dental infection — antibiotics and oral surgery or endodontic treatment — the minimum time before TJA is 3 weeks after resolution of active infection and the minimum time after TJA is same day. Footnotes clarify that minimum time pre TJA is based on dental-procedure induced bacteremia and related procedure healing time, and minimum time post TJA is based on joint healing required for stability prior to dental-procedure induced bacteremia.

### Clinical concepts of dry socket [^114bgfSE]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Dry socket is one of the most studied complications in dentistry, and a great number of studies have searched for an effective and safe method for its prevention and treatment. One of the great clinical challenges since the first case was reported has been the inconsistency and differences in the various definitions of dry socket and the criteria used for diagnosis. The pathophysiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment of dry socket are very important in the practice of oral surgery. The aim of the present report was to review and discuss each aspect.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: infection and trauma of the dentition [^111doiMm]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Periodontal Disease

Periodontal disease refers to a group of pathologies that affect the supporting tissues of the teeth, namely the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. Local risk factors include malocclusions, traumatic dental injuries, conditions causing plaque retention, and ectopic tooth eruption. General risk factors include genetic, metabolic, and hematological conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and smoking. High levels of progesterone, stress, substance abuse, vitamin C deficiency, medications (calcium channel blockers, phenytoin, cyclosporine), and immune dysfunction may increase susceptibility to periodontal disease. The main management strategy of periodontal disease is optimizing gingival health, which involves eliminating causative factors, improving oral hygiene to reduce plaque, periodic professional plaque removal, and perhaps surgical recontouring of the affected gingiva. Two of the most common types of periodontal diseases are gingivitis and periodontitis.

Gingivitis (Fig. 6) refers to inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the teeth, excluding the alveolar ridge, periodontal ligament, and cementum.

FIGURE 6
Gingivitis.

There are many forms of gingivitis and an in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. However, there are 2 entities worth mentioning. One of the most severe forms of acute gingivitis is acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), also known as Vincent infection or trench mouth (Fig. 7). The most common causative organisms include fusiform bacteria, spirochetes, and gram negative anaerobes such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella species, and Selenomonas species. ANUG is associated with smoking, malnutrition, and stress, and characteristically presents with necrosis and ulceration in areas of pre-existing gingivitis, leading to halitosis, pain, spontaneous hemorrhage, and necrosis. If inadequately treated, ANUG will persist in a cyclic pattern of acute symptoms followed by chronic remission and may eventually spread to the alveolar crest, causing necrotizing periodontitis with bone resorption and gingival recession. In very rare cases, children and adults whom are extremely malnourished may develop an ANUG-like condition called necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis or Noma (Fig. 8). Unlike ANUG that is confined to the periodontium, NOMA may spread to the adjacent soft tissues causing necrosis of the cheeks and/or lips. However, ANUG usually demonstrates quick resolution with appropriate treatment including mechanical debridement, optimal oral hygiene, mouth rinses, and occasionally antimicrobials.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following Tooth extractions [^112HWQmf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions are dental caries and periodontal infections, and these extractions are generally done by general dental practitioners. Antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection.

Objectives

To determine the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the development of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 25 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1948 to 25 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 25 January 2012) and LILACS via BIREME (1982 to 25 January 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the body of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE tool.

Main Results

This review included 18 double-blind placebo-controlled trials with a total of 2456 participants. Five trials were assessed at unclear risk of bias, thirteen at high risk, and none at low risk of bias. Compared to placebo, antibiotics probably reduce the risk of infection in patients undergoing third molar extraction(s) by approximately 70% (RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.50) P < 0.0001, 1523 participants, moderate quality evidence) which means that 12 people (range 10–17) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. There is evidence that antibiotics may reduce the risk of dry socket by 38% (RR 0.62 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.95) P = 0.03, 1429 participants, moderate quality evidence) which means that 38 people (range 24–250) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. There is also some evidence that patients who have prophylactic antibiotics may have less pain (MD -8.17 (95% CI -11.90 to -4.45) P < 0.0001, 372 participants, moderate quality evidence) overall 7 days after the extraction compared to those receiving placebo, which may be a direct result of the lower risk of infection. There is no evidence of a difference between antibiotics and placebo in the outcomes of fever (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.99), swelling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.30) or trismus (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.71) 7 days after tooth extraction. Antibiotics are associated with an increase in generally mild and transient adverse effects compared to placebo (RR 1.98 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.59) P = 0.02) which means that for every 21 people (range 8–200) who receive antibiotics, an adverse effect is likely.

Authors' Conclusions

Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, there were no trials identified which evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in this group of patients in this setting. All of the trials included in this review included healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. There is evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of infection, dry socket and pain following third molar extraction and result in an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to those with concomitant illnesses or immunodeficiency, or those undergoing the extraction of teeth due to severe caries or periodontitis. However, patients at a higher risk of infection are more likely to benefit from prophylactic antibiotics, because infections in this group are likely to be more frequent, associated with complications and be more difficult to treat. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria which are resistant to treatment by currently available antibiotics, clinicians should consider carefully whether treating 12 healthy patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection is likely to do more harm than good.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: dental evaluation and management prior to treatment for hematologic malignancies and CAR T-cell therapy [^113sWCSj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

MASCC/ISOO dental treatment planning and timing before therapy: The time constraints prior to initiation of cancer therapy dictate modifications to the dental treatment plan, and multi-visit, time-consuming endodontic treatment is unfavored when additional high-priority needs are present. The dental treatment plan should address present needs and conditions anticipated to deteriorate within 6–12 months following the hemato-oncologic therapy, until routine dental treatment may be resumed. Considering time constraints, efforts should be made to consolidate multiple treatments into a single session. It is advised to schedule dental extractions as early as possible; ideally, extractions should be performed with sufficient time before hemato-oncologic therapy to allow epithelial healing of the socket, which is estimated to happen within 2–3 weeks following the extraction.

Laboratory workup — diagnosis states that because diagnosis is based primarily on clinical presentation, the role of lab workup is limited; clinicians should review the complete blood count to confirm the patient is not neutropenic or thrombocytopenic before penetrating or manipulating soft tissue, which is relevant when diagnosis is based on palpation of bone through a fistula using a hand instrument; and if neutrophil or platelet counts indicate infection or bleeding risk, the clinical examination should be adjusted accordingly.

Data extraction and management

We extracted and summarised details of the eligible studies using a data extraction sheet. Two review authors (two of CR, TS, GN, RA and AR) extracted data independently and resolved disagreements by discussion, drawing on a third review author (JD) where required. Where key data were missing from reports, we attempted to contact the study authors to obtain this information. Where a study with more than two intervention arms was included, we only extracted data from intervention and control groups that met the eligibility criteria.

We extracted the following data, where possible, by treatment group for the prespecified interventions and outcomes in this review. We planned to collect outcome data for relevant time points, as described in Types of outcome measures; in practice most studies reported only one time point.

### Surgical techniques for the removal of mandibular wisdom teeth [^117Bifr2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pathology relating to mandibular wisdom teeth is a frequent presentation to oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and surgical removal of mandibular wisdom teeth is a common operation. The indications for surgical removal of these teeth are alleviation of local pain, swelling and trismus, and also the prevention of spread of infection that may occasionally threaten life. Surgery is commonly associated with short-term postoperative pain, swelling and trismus. Less frequently, infection, dry socket (alveolar osteitis) and trigeminal nerve injuries may occur. This review focuses on the optimal methods in order to improve patient experience and minimise postoperative morbidity.

Objectives

To compare the relative benefits and risks of different techniques for surgical removal of mandibular wisdom teeth.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 8 July 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library; 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 July 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 July 2019). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical techniques for the removal of mandibular wisdom teeth.

Three review authors were involved in assessing the relevance of identified studies, evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and extracted data. We used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data in parallel-group trials (or Peto odds ratios if the event rate was low), odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data in cross-over or split-mouth studies, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We took into account the pairing of the split-mouth studies in our analyses, and combined parallel-group and split-mouth studies using the generic inverse-variance method. We used the fixed-effect model for three studies or fewer, and random-effects model for more than three studies.

Main Results

We included 62 trials with 4643 participants. Several of the trials excluded individuals who were not in excellent health. We assessed 33 of the studies (53%) as being at high risk of bias and 29 as unclear. We report results for our primary outcomes below. Comparisons of different suturing techniques and of drain versus no drain did not report any of our primary outcomes. No studies provided useable data for any of our primary outcomes in relation to coronectomy. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether envelope or triangular flap designs led to more alveolar osteitis (OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.23; 5 studies; low-certainty evidence), wound infection (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.06; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), or permanent altered tongue sensation (Peto OR 4.48, 95% CI 0.07 to 286.49; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). In terms of other adverse effects, two studies reported wound dehiscence at up to 30 days after surgery, but found no difference in risk between interventions. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of a lingual retractor affected the risk of permanent altered sensation compared to not using one (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.82; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). None of our other primary outcomes were reported by studies included in this comparison. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether lingual split with chisel is better than a surgical hand-piece for bone removal in terms of wound infection (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.21; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Alveolar osteitis, permanent altered sensation, and other adverse effects were not reported. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is any difference in alveolar osteitis according to irrigation method (mechanical versus manual: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.09; 1 study) or irrigation volume (high versus low; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.02; 1 study), or whether there is any difference in postoperative infection according to irrigation method (mechanical versus manual: RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.43; 1 study) or irrigation volume (low versus high; RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.37; 1 study) (all very low-certainty evidence). These studies did not report permanent altered sensation and adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether primary or secondary wound closure led to more alveolar osteitis (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), wound infection (RR 4.77, 95% CI 0.24 to 96.34; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), or adverse effects (bleeding) (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.47; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). These studies did not report permanent sensation changes. Placing platelet rich plasma (PRP) or platelet rich fibrin (PRF) in sockets may reduce the incidence of alveolar osteitis (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.67; 2 studies), but the evidence is of low certainty. Our other primary outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

In this 2020 update, we added 27 new studies to the original 35 in the 2014 review. Unfortunately, even with the addition of these studies, we have been unable to draw many meaningful conclusions. The small number of trials evaluating each comparison and reporting our primary outcomes, along with methodological biases in the included trials, means that the body of evidence for each of the nine comparisons evaluated is of low or very low certainty. Participant populations in the trials may not be representative of the general population, or even the population undergoing third molar surgery. Many trials excluded individuals who were not in good health, and several excluded those with active infection or who had deep impactions of their third molars. Consequently, we are unable to make firm recommendations to surgeons to inform their techniques for removal of mandibular third molars. The evidence is uncertain, though we note that there is some limited evidence that placing PRP or PRF in sockets may reduce the incidence of dry socket. The evidence provided in this review may be used as a guide for surgeons when selecting and refining their surgical techniques. Ongoing studies may allow us to provide more definitive conclusions in the future.

Osteomyelitis of the jaws is an uncommon infection of the maxillofacial area. The disease is often difficult to diagnose, and thus delays in treatment are common, increasing its morbidity. The clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings of the disease; its forms; and treatment modalities are reviewed. Suggestions for contemporary diagnosis and surgical treatment of acute and chronic suppurative osteomyelitis are discussed.

Chronic Anophthalmic Socket Pain

Persistent socket pain is related to different pathological entities and to psychological elements, and its incidence rate is difficult to assess for its subjective nature and the heterogeneity of the studies.

An inadequate prosthesis may determine mechanical damage and irritation by continually rubbing against the socket walls. A dry socket, caused by a reduced secretion of tears due to the absence of corneal reflex, can lead to socket pain. The eyelids of anophthalmic sockets have a reduced density of meibomian glands acinar units and a more inhomogeneous appearance of the periglandular interstices and the acinar unit walls; in these cases, patients benefit from the regular use of lubricants and anti-inflammatory drops. Pain may be due to trochleitis, to supraorbital nerve entrapment or to sensory infraorbital nerve compression.

Trochleitis is relatively rare and is caused by supratrochlear nerve compression. It should be suspected in case of pain evoked by palpation of trochlear region or by movement of the prosthesis. Treatment is based on the use of corticosteroids, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors and triamcinolone injections, or implant removal and DFG if due to implant migration.

In case of infraorbital nerve compression, a surgical nerve decompression can be proposed. Implant exposure, an infected orbital implant and persistent inflammation can also determine socket pain and may require implant replacement. Previous surgery may also be the cause of pain, if conjunctival cysts are present or if residues of a silicon band due to previous retinal detachment surgery had not been removed at the time of evisceration.

Socket pain could also be related to the presence of neuromas in the tissue surrounding the optic nerve and the implant junction. Neuromas can cause pain for mechanical irritation of the surrounding scar tissue or due to pressure derived from adjacent cysts; removal of both the neuroma and the orbital implant may resolve the pain.

### Dry socket: a prospective study of prevalent risk factors in a Nigerian population [^114s8f6r]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify major risk factors for developing dry socket in some Nigerians, and to formulate a nonpharmacologic protocol for its effective prevention.

Patients and Methods

Patients presenting with dry socket at the Oral Surgery Clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria, over an 18-month period were studied. Biographic data, preoperative diagnoses, teeth extracted, oral hygiene status, and history relevant to the extractions and presentations of dry socket were documented. Procedures were classified as traumatic or atraumatic. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) with simple descriptive statistics and the chi(2) test, as appropriate. P ≤ .05 was considered significant.

Results

Sixty-eight extraction sockets in 65 patients (46 females and 19 males) with a mean age of 33.48 (± SD 13.5) years were studied. All extracted teeth were posterior (17 maxillary, and 51 mandibular). Preoperative diagnoses were mainly of acute apical periodontitis secondary to carious lesion (30/68), chronic apical periodontitis (18/68), and chronic pulpitis (15/68). The use of an oral contraceptive was elicited in 25% of the females, and extractions were performed between days 1 and 22 of their menstrual cycle. Extraction was traumatic in 66.2% of cases. A ranking of the elicited risk factors suggests that a previously infected posterior tooth involves an equal risk in both genders. Poor oral hygiene and traumatic extraction in a mandibular tooth were prominent in males, whereas extractions performed between days 1 and 22 of the menstrual cycle were significant in females.

Conclusion

Control of preoperative infection, insistence on good oral hygiene, avoidance of trauma, and avoidance of surgery on days 1 to 22 of the menstrual cycle in nonmenopausal women may reduce the incidence of dry socket in the study population.
