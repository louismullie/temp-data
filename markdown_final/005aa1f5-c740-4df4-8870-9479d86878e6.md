## Question

Keppra status load dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the levetiracetam (Keppra) loading dose for status epilepticus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the role of levetiracetam after benzodiazepines. Then, I should verify authoritative dosing recommendations and reconcile any discrepancies. Next, I will cross-check with clinical evidence and pharmacokinetic principles to justify the loading strategy. After that, I need to evaluate safety, administration logistics, and special populations. Finally, I will formulate a concise, evidence-based recommendation and monitoring plan while confirming drug interaction considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and positioning of levetiracetam in status epilepticus management, since SE is a neurologic emergency where rapid parenteral therapy after benzodiazepines is standard, and levetiracetam is commonly used off-label due to safety, ease of administration, and minimal interactions; I should also acknowledge that SE is not an FDA-labeled indication even though it appears as an off-label use in compendia, and levetiracetam is widely adopted as a second-line agent in this setting [^113PymuA] [^115NA1Ef].

> I need to check the most authoritative dosing guidance presented here; the SPL lists a status epilepticus loading dose of 60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes with a maximum of 4,500 mg, which aligns with contemporary practice and provides a clear, weight-based bolus target for emergent control [^116x3BCf].

> Wait, let me verify potential conflicts, because another SPL entry suggests continuous infusion at 2–5 mg/kg/min to a total of 1,000–3,000 mg; this is notably lower than the 60 mg/kg load and could lead to underdosing in adults and larger children, so I should prioritize the explicit, weight-based bolus recommendation and contemporary clinical data favoring 40–60 mg/kg while recognizing that some compendia still list older lower ranges [^116CWkB5] [^116x3BCf].

> Next, I should review supporting clinical evidence; retrospective and prospective data in benzodiazepine-refractory SE show effective loading across 20–60 mg/kg (up to 4,500 mg), with no clear superiority among doses within that range, but with growing practice preference for 60 mg/kg for rapid attainment of therapeutic levels, and pediatric RCT data (EcLiPSE) support the safety and practicality of 40 mg/kg, including in children already on maintenance levetiracetam, while safety studies confirm rapid 5–6 minute administration is well tolerated [^116x3BCf] [^117Gy9R6] [^113Hw9Rr] [^117JykKe].

> Hold on, I should ensure the pharmacokinetic rationale really supports aggressive loading; levetiracetam has linear kinetics, minimal protein binding (< 10%), a volume of distribution approximating total body water, predominant renal elimination, and bioequivalence between IV and oral with rapid attainment of peak levels after IV infusion, all of which support a one-time weight-based bolus to promptly achieve therapeutic concentrations in brain tissue [^113KfR5h] [^113Zg911] [^114Ht3g4].

> I will now examine the safety profile at loading doses and the comparative advantages; unlike phenytoin, levetiracetam does not cause hypotension or clinically meaningful QT prolongation, rapid minimally diluted or even undiluted infusions to high mg/kg loads have shown excellent tolerability without hemodynamic instability or infusion site injury, and the most common adverse effects are somnolence and behavioral changes, which are generally manageable in the acute setting [^114k5kVa] [^117JykKe] [^113Hw9Rr] [^114nXYAA].

> Let me think about special populations; I should confirm that in renal impairment the emergent loading dose is typically not reduced, with dosing adjustments applied to maintenance and supplemental doses post-dialysis, given marked renal elimination and decreased clearance in CKD and the elderly; hepatic impairment generally does not require adjustment, pediatric patients clear the drug faster and thus justify similar or higher mg/kg maintenance after an appropriate load, and pregnancy is associated with falling levels over gestation, reinforcing the need to load appropriately and then monitor levels for maintenance [^113vcgba] [^114Ht3g4] [^116i72pP] [^11449osS] [^113NCSQ2] [^114z1ZDN] [^112RVAi6] [^112JXMky].

> Next, I should review administration logistics to avoid delays; IV is the route of choice in SE, the SPL supports 60 mg/kg over 10 minutes, while safety data support even faster infusion when clinically necessary, small volumes can be used, vials are 500 mg per 5 mL, and peripheral IV administration is generally well tolerated, which collectively streamlines rapid delivery in emergency settings [^116x3BCf] [^117W6TDa] [^117JykKe] [^113Hw9Rr].

> I should confirm efficacy expectations and how levetiracetam compares; as a second-line agent after benzodiazepines, levetiracetam achieves seizure termination in a substantial proportion of cases, with large pediatric RCT data demonstrating noninferiority to phenytoin and operational advantages in preparation and infusion, matching its pharmacologic profile and essential medicine arguments for ease of use and safety [^117Gy9R6] [^115NA1Ef].

> But wait, what if lower doses are given; data suggest 20–40 mg/kg may still be effective in some contexts, especially if the patient already has appreciable baseline levels, but the balance of evidence and modern practice favors aiming for 60 mg/kg in adults and adolescents to ensure rapid, adequate CNS exposure, and I should avoid exceeding 60 mg/kg or 4,500 mg given the lack of supporting evidence for higher loads [^1142mXiK] [^116x3BCf].

> I need to ensure I address drug–drug interactions, because in SE polytherapy is common; levetiracetam does not meaningfully affect concentrations of common antiseizure medicines and is not affected by them to a clinically significant extent, nor does it interact with digoxin or warfarin, which supports concurrent use with other emergent agents during SE [^111v7j5z] [^1136EDJa].

> Hold on, I should verify one potential misinterpretation; I initially read "maximum daily dose 4,500 mg" and almost applied that as a chronic cap, but in the SE context the intent is a one-time loading cap up to 4,500 mg with subsequent transition to maintenance adjusted for renal function rather than repeating high boluses, which aligns with IV-to-oral equivalence and standard maintenance pathways after stabilization [^116x3BCf] [^113KfR5h] [^113gLVwJ].

> Final recommendation with rationale: administer levetiracetam 60 mg/kg IV as a bolus over about 10 minutes, not to exceed 4,500 mg, recognizing that 40–60 mg/kg is supported by clinical data but 60 mg/kg most reliably achieves therapeutic levels rapidly in status epilepticus, followed by transition to maintenance dosing adjusted for renal function and clinical response, with monitoring for efficacy and expected sedation while leveraging its favorable hemodynamic and interaction profile [^116x3BCf] [^1142mXiK] [^117Gy9R6] [^113KfR5h] [^113gLVwJ].

---

The recommended Keppra (levetiracetam) loading dose for status epilepticus is **60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes** [^116x3BCf], with a **maximum loading dose of 4,500 mg** [^1142mXiK]. This dose is supported by FDA labeling [^116x3BCf] and is widely used in clinical practice [^117Gy9R6]. Levetiracetam is favored for its rapid administration, minimal drug interactions [^111v7j5z], and a favorable safety profile; common adverse effects include somnolence, fatigue, and behavioral changes [^114nXYAA] [^116fYfMn]. Dose adjustments are required in renal impairment, and **supplemental dosing is needed after dialysis** [^114Ht3g4] [^117N93KB].

---

## Recommended loading dose

For status epilepticus, the recommended loading regimen includes a **standard loading dose** of 60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes [^116x3BCf] and a **maximum loading dose** of 4,500 mg [^116x3BCf] [^1142mXiK].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting loading dose

The recommended loading dose is supported by clinical evidence demonstrating rapid achievement of therapeutic levels and **effective seizure control** [^117Gy9R6]. Levetiracetam's pharmacokinetics allow for rapid absorption and distribution, making it suitable for acute seizure management [^113KfR5h].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Levetiracetam exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption, and minimal protein binding, allowing for predictable dosing and rapid onset of action [^113KfR5h]. Its mechanism of action involves **binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A**, modulating neurotransmitter release and reducing neuronal excitability [^114k5kVa].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Levetiracetam is **generally well-tolerated**, with minimal adverse effects [^116fYfMn]. Common adverse reactions include somnolence, fatigue [^117N2m2X], and behavioral changes, and hematologic abnormalities [^114nXYAA]. Rapid infusion of levetiracetam has been shown to be safe, with minimal cardiovascular or respiratory adverse effects [^113Hw9Rr] [^117JykKe].

---

## Comparison with other antiepileptic drugs

Levetiracetam is increasingly used as an alternative to traditional antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and valproate due to its favorable safety profile, **minimal drug interactions**, and ease of administration [^115NA1Ef]. Unlike phenytoin, levetiracetam does not require cardiac monitoring during infusion and has fewer drug interactions [^111v7j5z] [^117Gy9R6] [^113Hw9Rr].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance [^114Ht3g4] [^113vcgba].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment is generally required, but caution is advised in severe hepatic impairment [^114Ht3g4] [^113NCSQ2].
- **Pregnancy**: Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy, requiring monitoring and dose adjustments [^112JXMky] [^112RVAi6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend levetiracetam as a **second-line agent** for status epilepticus, particularly in benzodiazepine-refractory cases [^113PymuA] [^115NA1Ef]. Its rapid administration, minimal drug interactions, and favorable safety profile make it a preferred choice in many clinical settings [^117Gy9R6].

### Keppra [^114Ht3g4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30–50 mL/min), and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase, or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. However, levetiracetam does…

### Keppra [^111v7j5z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Keppra (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption, its plasma clearance, or urinary excretion. There was also no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.

- **Other antiepileptic drugs**: Potential drug interactions between Keppra and other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and valproate were assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Effect of AEDs in pediatric patients**: There was about a 22% increase in apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

- **Oral contraceptives**: Keppra (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, nor did it affect luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

### Levetiracetam [^112RVAi6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Following a single-dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to pediatric patients with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. The half-life of levetiracetam in pediatric patients aged 1 month to < 4 years with epilepsy was shorter (5.3 hours) than in adults (7.2 hours), and the apparent clearance (1.5 mL/min/kg) was faster than in adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).

Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed a significant correlation between body weight and the clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased with an increase in body weight.

- **Pregnancy**: Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Gender**: Levetiracetam Cmax and AUC were 20% higher in women (N = 11) compared to men (N = 12). However, when adjusted for body weight, clearances were comparable.

- **Race**: Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N = 12) and Asians (N = 12), however, show that the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Since levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no significant racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

### Levetiracetam versus phenytoin for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus (EcLiPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^117Gy9R6]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Other treatment-related factors might be relevant to the interpretation of our findings. These include the widespread use of levetiracetam as maintenance therapy for many childhood epilepsies because of its broad-spectrum activity and safety profile. In the EcLiPSE trial participants, levetiracetam was the most commonly used oral antiepilepsy drug at the time of presentation. Anecdotally, clinicians are reluctant to give a loading dose of phenytoin to children in convulsive status epilepticus who are on oral maintenance phenytoin because of potential cardiovascular toxicity. There seemed to be no similar concerns for levetiracetam, and no increase in adverse events was observed when giving 40 mg/kg to children already receiving maintenance levetiracetam.

A substantial minority of children who present in convulsive status epilepticus for the first time are subsequently commenced on maintenance therapy. Levetiracetam is more likely than phenytoin to be used as maintenance therapy because of phenytoin's adverse event profile and complex pharmacokinetics. One observational study in adults showed that 8% of patients treated with intravenous fosphenytoin for convulsive status epilepticus were subsequently commenced on oral phenytoin, whereas 78% of those treated with intravenous levetiracetam were subsequently commenced on oral levetiracetam.

Ease of drug preparation and administration is also a factor in the management of convulsive status epilepticus. Throughout the EcLiPSE trial, levetiracetam was reported by clinical teams in the participating centres to be easier to prepare and administer.

Labeled indications for levetiracetam (also known as Keppra) include:

- **Adjunctive treatment**: For juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in adults.
- **Treatment**: For focal seizures in adults.
- **Adjunctive treatment**: For generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

Off-label indications for levetiracetam (also known as Keppra) include:

- **Adjunctive treatment**: For seizures in adults with alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
- **Treatment**: For status epilepticus in adults.

### Keppra [^114k5kVa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The precise mechanism by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A, which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The effect of Keppra on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of Keppra (1000 mg or 5000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds; therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.
	- **Metabolism**: Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group.

### Keppra [^117N2m2X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Somnolence and fatigue**: Keppra may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience with Keppra to assess whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

- **Somnolence**: In controlled trials of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of Keppra-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study with no titration, about 45% of patients receiving 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of Keppra-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. Approximately 3% of Keppra-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of Keppra-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the Keppra-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

- **Asthenia**: In controlled clinical studies of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of Keppra-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of Keppra-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of Keppra-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks.

### Evaluation of levetiracetam loading dose in adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus [^1142mXiK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency defined as continuous seizure activity lasting more than five minutes or seizure activity without a return to baseline. Benzodiazepine-refractory SE is characterized by continuous seizure activity despite treatment with a benzodiazepine. Treatment for benzodiazepine-refractory SE includes levetiracetam with loading doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 4500 mg. While levetiracetam generally has minimal adverse effects, there is currently a lack of studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of various loading doses of levetiracetam.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three loading doses of levetiracetam in the setting of benzodiazepine-refractory SE.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted on adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory SE who were treated with levetiracetam between April 1, 2016, and August 31, 2023. Excluded from the study were patients with documented hypersensitivity to levetiracetam, those who were pregnant or incarcerated, and patients who received an alternative antiepileptic drug (AED) prior to levetiracetam. Patients with other identifiable causes of SE, such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or those who were post-cardiac arrest, were also excluded. The patients were divided into three groups based on the loading dose of levetiracetam administered: ≤ 20 mg/kg (LEVlow), 21–39 mg/kg (LEVmed), or ≥ 40 mg/kg (LEVhigh). The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure termination, defined as the lack of need for an additional AED within 60 minutes.

### Safety and tolerability of rapid administration undiluted levetiracetam [^117JykKe]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic drug used widely in patients with a favorable safety profile. Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) LEV included volumes of at least 100 mL. Minimally diluted doses administered over 5–6 minutes were found to be both safe and effective. Given the complexities of admixing, this practice can be impractical and result in delays in antiepileptic therapy. This study aimed to retrospectively review the safety and tolerability of rapid administration of undiluted LEV doses ≤ 1000 mg.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study evaluating adverse drug reactions associated with undiluted LEV from January 1, 2018, to June 1, 2018. Patients were included if they received at least one dose of undiluted LEV and were ≥ 18 years old. Safety endpoints were reviewed and collected from the time of administration until hospital discharge. Endpoints included injection site pain and discomfort, injection site erythema, extravasation, IV line replacement, and any documented adverse effect leading to IV LEV discontinuation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.

- **Results**: A total of 199 patients were included in the study, totaling 1626 doses of LEV. Most patients were administered LEV 1000 mg (60.8%) through a peripheral line (64.3%), and were prescribed LEV for seizure prophylaxis (58.3%). Patients received a mean of 8.1 ± 8 doses for a mean duration of therapy of 5 ± 4.5 days. About 98.5% of patients did not experience an adverse effect, whereas 1.5% of patients experienced agitation, delirium, confusion, and/or le…

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^115NA1Ef]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is one antiepileptic seizure medication (ASM) that fulfills the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, it neither has the propensity to clinically relevant drug interactions nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward compared to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution, and injectable forms, making it suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalized epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, except in some situations such as pregnancy, adherence checks, critical illnesses, and extremes of age.

### Levetiracetam [^116fYfMn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the analysis of adverse reactions, Table 3 lists those that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving levetiracetam tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either levetiracetam or a placebo was added to existing conAED therapy.

- **Controlled adult clinical studies**: In these studies, 15% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 12% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. Table 4 lists the most common (> 1%) adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in levetiracetam-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.

- **Pediatric patients (4 to < 16 years)**: The adverse reaction data presented below was obtained from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies using an oral formulation in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were fatigue and aggression.

### Levetiracetam [^113KfR5h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (less than 10% bound), and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of the dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, and it is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. It is increased in the elderly due to impaired renal clearance and in subjects with renal impairment.

### Keppra [^113vcgba]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Studies of levetiracetam in juvenile rats, dosed on postnatal days 4 through 52, and dogs, dosed from postnatal weeks 3 through 7, at doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 and 24 times the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg/day on a mg/m² basis), did not demonstrate adverse effects on postnatal development.

- **Geriatric use**: There were 347 subjects in clinical studies of Keppra who were aged 65 and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, there were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of Keppra in these patients. Levetiracetam is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Renal impairment**: Clearance of levetiracetam is decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function, and supplemental doses should be given to patients after dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Keppra [^112JXMky]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Keppra, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking Keppra during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org.

- **Risk summary**: Prolonged experience with Keppra in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature that includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity, including increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, and neurobehavioral alterations in offspring, at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

- **Clinical considerations**: Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. A decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the later stages of pregnancy.

### Rapid infusion of a loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam with minimal dilution: A safety study [^113Hw9Rr]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous antiepileptic drugs are required for patients needing urgent treatment or those unable to take oral medication. The safety of intravenous levetiracetam has been established in prospective studies involving adult epilepsy and healthy participants. A prospective, single-center study was conducted to evaluate the safety of a rapid loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam. Patients were divided into three equal dosing groups (N = 15 each): 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg, corresponding to maximum doses of 1, 2, and 3 g. Electrocardiogram and safety assessments were performed during the infusion. The ages of participants ranged from 4 to 32 years. Post-infusion serum levetiracetam concentrations were between 14 to 189 microg/mL. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, no local infusion site reactions, and no electrocardiogram abnormalities. The study concluded that high serum levels of parenteral levetiracetam can be achieved rapidly and safely in a small infusion volume. This finding has important implications for the treatment of status epilepticus.

### Efficacy of levetiracetam as add-on therapy in the treatment of seizures in neonates [^116xSk6Q]. Neonatology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, in our cohort of neonates admitted with encephalopathy and EEG-confirmed seizures, the effect of 1–3 loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) as add-on therapy was limited based on low rates of seizure reduction and seizure freedom, as well as a high need for additional antiepileptic medications (ASM). This study argues in favor of promptly administering an additional ASM if LEV fails as add-on therapy in the treatment of symptomatic seizures in the neonate. Further research is needed to assess what is the best strategy and order of ASM to treat seizures in neonates.

### Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in patients with moderate to severe liver cirrhosis (child-pugh classes A, B, and C): characterization by dynamic liver function tests [^112xgCvL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug approved for use as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures. We sought to investigate possible changes in the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and its metabolite ucb L057 in patients with liver cirrhosis, who may require dose adjustments.

- **Methods**: A single dose of levetiracetam was administered to five healthy subjects and to patients with Child-Pugh class A (n = 5), B (n = 6), or C (n = 5) alcohol-induced cirrhosis. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and ucb L057 was measured and correlated with biochemical liver function parameters, with creatinine clearance, and with kinetics of caffeine, lidocaine, and d-sorbitol as probes for specific liver functions.

- **Results**: Dynamic liver function tests revealed a deterioration of liver function. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and its metabolite did not differ between healthy subjects and those with class A or B cirrhosis. However, in patients with class C cirrhosis, levetiracetam total clearance was reduced by 57% (90% confidence interval, 43%-67%; P < .001). The geometric mean ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for levetiracetam, Child-Pugh class C versus control, was 2.41 (90% CI, 1.80–3.23), and the geometric mean of the half-life ratio was 2.27 (90% CI, 1.74–2.97). This was explained by the deterioration of renal function in patients with severe hepatic disease.

- **Conclusions**: In pharmacokinetic studies of hepatic impairment, including all classes of cirrhosis may be more revealing than including only selected classes.

### Levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a critically ill anephric patient on intermittent hemodialysis [^1148GEGz]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

In patients requiring hemodialysis, the extracorporeal circuit is expected to remove the majority of serum levetiracetam. However, the preferred levetiracetam dosing regimen for critically ill patients with complex pharmacokinetic profiles undergoing hemodialysis is unknown. This case study describes levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a critically ill anephric patient receiving intermittent hemodialysis.

- **Methods**: This is a case report of a single patient.

- **Results**: A 43-year-old anephric female was admitted to the intensive care unit due to concerns about new onset seizure activity. She received a loading dose of 2000 mg levetiracetam followed by a maintenance dose of 750 mg daily. The levetiracetam volume of distribution was 0.48 L/kg, with an interdialytic elimination half-life of 31 hours. Hemodialysis removed nearly 85% of serum levetiracetam, and the patient showed slightly higher than expected non-renal elimination. Pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that a regimen of 500 mg daily with 750 mg post-dialysis supplements would likely reduce variability in serum levetiracetam concentrations and achieve therapeutic levels.

- **Conclusion**: Substantial elimination of levetiracetam by hemodialysis was observed in this case, and non-renal clearance was slightly higher than previous reports. Insufficient intradialytic or post-dialysis levetiracetam concentrations may place patients at risk of breakthrough seizures. This case indicates that dialysis patients on levetiracetam might require higher post-dialysis supplemental doses than currently recommended.

### SPL drug information for levetiracetam ER [^116wTWim]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of levetiracetam ER PO (also known as Keppra XR):

- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Behavioral or personality changes**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral changes, including aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, and personality disorder.

- **Exacerbation of seizures**: Do not discontinue abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus.

- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.

- **Incoordination**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of coordination difficulties, including ataxia, abnormal gait, and incoordination.

- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.

- **Somnolence**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of somnolence and fatigue.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk.

### Keppra [^113vqvSb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. This study focused on pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either Keppra or a placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (Keppra N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization.

- **Age stratification**: Randomization was stratified by age as follows:
	- 1 month to less than 6 months (N = 4 treated with Keppra)
	- 6 months to less than 1 year (N = 8 treated with Keppra)
	- 1 year to less than 2 years (N = 20 treated with Keppra)
	- 2 years to less than 4 years (N = 28 treated with Keppra)

- **Study design**: The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, including a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Keppra dosing was determined by age and weight:
	- Children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day.
	- Children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day.

The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate, defined as the percentage of patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline.

### Keppra XR [^113JKEck]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The overview of Keppra XR reveals that the bioavailability of Keppra XR tablets is similar to that of immediate-release Keppra tablets. The pharmacokinetics, particularly AUC and Cmax, were shown to be dose proportional following single-dose administration of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg of extended-release levetiracetam. The plasma half-life of extended-release levetiracetam is approximately 7 hours.

Levetiracetam is almost completely absorbed after oral administration, exhibiting linear and time-invariant pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject variability. It is not significantly protein-bound, with less than 10% being bound. The volume of distribution is comparable to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent of the dose is excreted unchanged through the kidneys. The primary metabolic pathway involves enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, accounting for 24% of the dose, and is not dependent on liver cytochrome P450. The metabolites are pharmacologically inactive and are also excreted renally. Across various studies, the plasma half-life of levetiracetam is approximately 6 to 8 hours. This half-life is extended in the elderly, primarily due to impaired renal clearance, and in individuals with renal impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam remain consistent whether it is employed as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

### Levetiracetam in pediatrics [^112AFyxk]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam is a new antiepileptic drug whose efficacy and tolerability are already well known in adults. Few studies are available in children. This review, based on the international literature, aims to identify and make known the possible indications for levetiracetam in childhood. Most studies suggest that levetiracetam is effective against partial and generalized epilepsy. In resistant partial epilepsy, the percentage of responders reaches 64%, with 8 to 23% seizure-free. Levetiracetam is used to treat symptomatic and idiopathic epilepsies.

The drug has also proven effective against photosensitivity and epileptic and nonepileptic myoclonus. The most frequent side effects involve the behavioral sphere and manifest mostly in patients with a history of behavioral problems. In some patients, levetiracetam increases the number of seizures, but this adverse reaction can be partially avoided with slow titration. Doses for children should be 130 to 140% of those advised for adults. Levetiracetam seems to have a broad spectrum of action and is, on the whole, well tolerated. Its efficacy against generalized epilepsy is particularly promising in childhood.

### Keppra [^114TnDZQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pattern of adverse reactions in the study on myoclonic seizures is slightly different from that observed in patients with partial-onset seizures. However, this discrepancy is likely due to the smaller number of patients involved in this study. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is expected to be essentially the same as for those with partial seizures.

In the controlled clinical study involving patients aged 12 years and older with myoclonic seizures [see Clinical studies (14.2)], the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Keppra in combination with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis, for events occurring more frequently than in the placebo group.

- **Adverse reactions**: Table 7 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy experiencing myoclonic seizures treated with Keppra and were more common than in those treated with placebo. In this study, either Keppra or placebo was added to concomitant AED therapy.

In the placebo-controlled study, 8% of patients receiving Keppra and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation or dose reduction, occurring more frequently in Keppra-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients, are detailed in Table 8.

- **Pediatric patients**:

- **1 month to < 6 months**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

- **6 months to < 4 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

- **4 years to < 16 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

- **For Keppra tablet dosing in pediatric patients**:

- **Weighing 20 to 40 kg**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 500 mg given as twice daily dosing (250 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 500 mg to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1500 mg (750 mg twice daily).

- **Weighing more than 40 kg**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day.

### Status epilepticus prognosis following levetiracetam administration: Analysis of loading doses [^117T5nhn]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Recommended loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) for status epilepticus (SE) treatment have increased over time. However, this was not evidence-based, and the benefit of the increase remains unclear. The effect of different LEV loading doses on SE prognosis was explored.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective analysis of an SE adult registry (January 2016-December 2021), including patients receiving LEV as a second-line SE treatment. Patients were stratified according to LEV loading doses (threshold 35 mg/kg). Main outcomes were global mortality, LEV use as last SE treatment, and return to baseline conditions at discharge, exploring LEV as a dichotomized or continuous dose.

- **Results**: Among 202 patients, 44 received LEV at ≥ 35 mg/kg and 158 below it. Global mortality, adjusted for SE severity and potentially fatal aetiology, was more frequent in the high LEV dose group (27.2% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.23–8.06; p = 0.017), whilst LEV prescription as last treatment and return to baseline conditions were comparable. Considering continuous LEV dosages or mortality in ongoing SE, however, no outcome reached statistical significance.

- **Conclusions**: Lower LEV loading doses do not seem to correlate with worse clinical outcome, challenging guidelines. Further studies, ideally prospective, are needed on this topic.

### Keppra [^1179r7Gt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to receive placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day of Keppra. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least one year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

- **Study 1**: Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States. It compared Keppra doses of 1000 mg/day (N = 97), 3000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95), given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^112a49wq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Children allocated to eLVT received the optimal dose identified in the dose-escalation study for 72 hours. PK data were assessed at t = 0, 7, 24 hours and 4–40 hours after the last dose. If clinical or electrographic seizures recurred/continued after the initial eLVT dose, an LVT level at the time of failure was captured. Escalation to the next dosing strata occurred, and more frequent PK assessments were conducted (t = 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 hours). Benzodiazepines (maximum 2 doses/24 hours) were given as needed for breakthrough seizures to allow time for eLVT absorption.

The dose escalation study was designed to identify the dose which would be effective for most patients but did not delineate what dose of eLVT might benefit a child with refractory seizures/status epilepticus. Escalating therapy for any selected antiepileptic is the most common approach to treating refractory seizures. Thus, given the established safety profile of eLVT in other populations, data from other populations indicating that higher doses can be beneficial for refractory seizures, our ability to rapidly cross over to PB if higher dose LVT was ineffective, and the value of having additional insights into the clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of escalating eLVT in this population, dose escalation of eLVT was undertaken for those children who failed the standard dose.

In RCT year 1, children randomized to 'usual care' received phenobarbital 20 mg/kg load, then 5 mg/kg Q12 hours for 72 hours. In RCT year 2, the Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommended that children randomized to 'usual care' receive phenoba.

### Keppra [^114z1ZDN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric patients

Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6–12 years) following a single dose (20 mg/kg). The body weight adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.

A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4–12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (UCB L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses with a Tmax of about 1 hour and a t1/2 of 5 hours across the three dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in children were linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase in apparent clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g. carbamazepine).

Following single-dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to children with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that the half-life was shorter (5.3 h) than for adults (7.2 h) and apparent clearance was faster (1.5 mL/min/kg) than for adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).

Absorption and distribution

Extended-release levetiracetam peak plasma concentrations occur in about 4 hours. The time to peak plasma concentrations is about 3 hours longer with extended-release levetiracetam than with immediate-release tablets. Single administration of two 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets once daily produced comparable maximal plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration versus time as did the administration of one 500 mg immediate-release tablet twice daily in fasting conditions. After multiple dose extended-release levetiracetam tablets intake, the extent of exposure (AUC0–24) was similar to the extent of exposure after multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. Cmax and Cmin were lower by 17% and 26% after multiple dose extended-release levetiracetam tablets intake in comparison to multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. Intake of a high fat, high calorie breakfast before the administration of extended-release levetiracetam tablets resulted in a higher peak concentration and a longer median time to peak. The median time to peak (Tmax) was 2 hours longer in the fed state. Two 750 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets were bioequivalent to a single administration of three 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets.

Metabolism

Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose), and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is…

- **Dosage and administration**: Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg once daily; increase by 1000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended dose of 3000 mg once daily. See full prescribing information for use in patients with impaired renal function.

- **Recommended dosing**: For adults and adolescent patients, the recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same, as outlined below:

	- **Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing 50 kg or more**: Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg once daily. The once-daily dosage may be adjusted in increments of 1000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg/day once daily.

- **Administration**: KEPPRA XR is administered once daily. KEPPRA XR tablets should be swallowed whole. The tablets should not be chewed, broken, or crushed.

- **Dosage adjustments in adult patients with renal impairment**: KEPPRA XR dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are provided in Table 1. To calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. An estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the appropriate formula. The CLcr is then adjusted for body surface area (BSA).

- **Discontinuation of KEPPRA XR**: Avoid abrupt withdrawal from KEPPRA XR to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.

### KeppraXR [^1115J58M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be instructed to only take Keppra XR once daily and to swallow the tablets whole. They should not be chewed, broken, or crushed. Inform patients that they should not be concerned if they occasionally notice something that looks like swollen pieces of the original tablet in their stool.

- **Withdrawal of Keppra**: Advise patients and caregivers not to discontinue use of Keppra XR without consulting with their healthcare provider. Keppra XR should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Pregnancy**: Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during Keppra therapy. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry if they become pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Levetiracetam [^113Zg911]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

- **Distribution**: The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution and infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at Tmax after an equivalent oral dose. It was demonstrated that a 1500 mg intravenous infusion of levetiracetam is equivalent to three 500 mg oral tablets. The time-independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following a 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC(0 to 12) at steady state was equivalent to AUCinf following an equivalent single dose. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; therefore, clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely.

- **Metabolism**: Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057, accounting for 24% of the dose and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy [^116fut3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 30% develop refractory seizures, particularly those with partial seizures. In this review, we summarise the evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam on seizures, side effects, quality of life, and cognition when used as an add-on treatment for patients with drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000). In addition, we contacted UCB SA (makers of levetiracetam) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials of levetiracetam in patients with drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. The following outcomes were assessed:
	- 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency
	- Treatment withdrawal (any reason)
	- Side effects
	- Cognitive effects
	- Quality of life

Primary analyses were intention-to-treat. Sensitivity best and worst case analyses were also undertaken. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for each outcome. Dose response was evaluated in trials.

### Levetiracetam [^1121KRab]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) experiencing myoclonic seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 6), conducted at 37 sites in 14 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of one antiepileptic drug (AED), experiencing one or more myoclonic seizures per day for at least eight days during the prospective eight-week baseline period, were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 60). Patients were titrated over four weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day over 12 weeks (evaluation period). The study drug was given in two divided doses.

The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in the number of days per week with one or more myoclonic seizures during the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods) compared to baseline. Table 14 displays the results for the 113 patients with JME in this study.

- **Figure and table clarifications**:
	- Figure 5 outlines the responder rate for all patients ages one month to less than four years, showing at least a 50% reduction from baseline in Study 5.
	- Table 14 details the responder rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) in myoclonic seizure days per week in Study 6.
	- Both figures indicate statistically significant results versus placebo.

The effectiveness of immediate-release KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Studies 2, 3, and 4). The tablet formulation was used in all three studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, KEPPRA 1000 mg, KEPPRA 2000 mg, or KEPPRA 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 2 or Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 4 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least one year and had taken one AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

- **Study 2**: Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States, comparing immediate-release KEPPRA 1000 mg/day (N = 97), immediate-release KEPPRA 3000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95), given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients in Study 2 were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were maintained.

### Levetiracetam [^112idQeK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of levetiracetam utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of levetiracetam injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see clinical pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Partial-onset seizures**: The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies.

	- In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least one year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

- **Study 1**: Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1000 mg/day (N = 97), and levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N = 101).

### Levetiracetam [^114eEw5J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the three treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 1.

- **Responder rate in study 1**: Figure 1 shows the responder rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) in Study 1. The results were statistically significant versus placebo.

- **Study 2**: Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted at 62 centers in Europe, comparing levetiracetam 1000 mg/day (N = 106), levetiracetam 2000 mg/day (N = 105), and placebo (N = 111) given in equally divided doses twice daily. The first part of the study (Period A) was designed to be analyzed as a parallel-group study. After a prospective baseline period of up to 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 16-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration period followed by a 12-week fixed-dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate, which is the incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency.

### Levetiracetam dosing optimization in neurocritical care population: Neuro-ARC study [^1169Kku8]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam, a first-line antiseizure medication, is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, with approximately 66% renal elimination. Its pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by kidney function. Augmented renal clearance (ARC), a condition characterized by renal hyperfiltration, is frequently observed in critical care settings and can profoundly impact the disposition of renally eliminated drugs such as levetiracetam. Our objectives were to characterize levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in neurocritical care patients, identify covariates significantly influencing drug clearance, and provide clinicians with optimal dosage recommendations in those with and without ARC.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study involving patients admitted to the participating centers with life-threatening neurological illnesses. Each participant had up to four plasma samples collected, and the samples were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The creatinine clearance (CL_CR) of enrolled participants was measured using the 8-hour urine collection method (measured CL_CR [mCL_CR]). Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using Monolix software. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to explore various dosage strategies and to suggest optimal levetiracetam regimens.

- **Results**: Our study included 50 patients, with 35 patients (70%) experiencing ARC. Trough levetiracetam levels were significantly lower in the ARC group compared with the no-ARC group (median [interquartile range] 4.4 [11.5] vs.

### Evaluation of levetiracetam dosing strategies for seizure prophylaxis following traumatic brain injury [^114NZ2dQ]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Low credibility.

Although levetiracetam has been increasingly used as an alternative to phenytoin for early posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis following traumatic brain injury (TBI), an optimal dosing strategy has not been elucidated. The objective of this study is to determine whether different dosing strategies of levetiracetam are associated with the incidence of early posttraumatic seizures when used as prophylaxis following TBI.

- **Methods**: This retrospective single-center cohort study included admitted patients ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of TBI and receiving levetiracetam for early posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis between July 1, 2013, and September 1, 2019. The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate three different dosing strategies of levetiracetam (≤ 1000 mg/day, 1500 mg/day, and ≥ 2000 mg/day) and associated rates of early posttraumatic seizures. Secondary outcomes were to summarize absolute total daily maintenance doses of levetiracetam among patients who experienced early posttraumatic seizures compared with those who did not, to determine the impact of three different dosing strategies on hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality, and to assess patient-specific variables on the occurrence of posttraumatic seizures. Overlap propensity score weighting was used to address the potential for confounding.

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^115HTPcm]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials including adults with refractory partial epilepsy. Two were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in which doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third consisted of the two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it was an independent parallel-group study.

A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation. It included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures. The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with regard to adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000.

### Keppra [^114Bv662]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 60 sites in North America. The study involved pediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, experienced at least four partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, and at least four partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods. They were randomized to receive either Keppra or a placebo.

The enrolled population included 198 patients (Keppra: N = 101, placebo: N = 97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period, followed by a 4-week titration period, and concluded with a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing began at 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, Keppra doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments at 2-week intervals to reach the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day.

- **Primary measure of effectiveness**: A between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to the placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period).

- **Secondary outcome variables**: The responder rate, defined as the incidence of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency per week.

### Levetiracetam [^1154prKF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosing for partial-onset seizures**: The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same as outlined below. There is no clinical study experience with the administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a period longer than four days.

- **Adults 16 years of age and older**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every two weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

- **Pediatric patients**:

	- **1 month to < 6 months**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in two divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

	- **6 months to < 4 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in two divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in two weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

	- **4 years to < 16 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in two divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily).

### Prospective open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous levetiracetam in children with epilepsy [^116DKerg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam, given via intravenous administration, has been shown to be an effective alternative in adults with epilepsy when oral administration is not feasible. This study was a prospective single-arm, multicenter study conducted to assess the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous levetiracetam in children with epilepsy. Children aged 1 month to 16 years who required intravenous levetiracetam were enrolled.

Assessments included vital signs, electrocardiogram, hematology, chemistry, plasma concentrations of antiepileptic medications, weight, and physical/neurological examinations.

A total of 52 patients were enrolled. Mild to moderate treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 63% of participants, with the most frequent being pyrexia and dry mouth. Most other treatment-emergent adverse events were considered unrelated to the intravenous administration of levetiracetam. Therefore, intravenous levetiracetam in the acute setting was overall well tolerated in children aged 1 month to 16 years.

### Keppra [^116AuDU7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients, on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period, were randomized to either Keppra or placebo. The baseline period included at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period.

Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. They were then maintained at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over a 20-week evaluation period. The study drug was administered in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for Keppra and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period, which included both titration and evaluation periods. The study population consisted of 164 patients (Keppra N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, predominantly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening.

### KeppraXR [^1136EDJa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Immediate-release Keppra tablets (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Warfarin**: Immediate-release Keppra tablets (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Probenecid**: Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily. Cssmax of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057. The effect of immediate-release Keppra tablets on probenecid was not studied.

### Keppra XR [^117Ts2cS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effects of Keppra XR on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Keppra XR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Keppra XR or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in patients 12 years of age and older have been established based on pharmacokinetic data in adults and adolescents using Keppra XR, and efficacy and safety data from controlled pediatric studies using immediate-release Keppra. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.

A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of immediate-release Keppra as adjunctive therapy in 98 pediatric patients with inadequately controlled partial seizures, ages 4 to 16 years (Keppra N = 64; placebo N = 34). The target dose of immediate-release Keppra was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects were measured by the Leiter-R Attention and Memory (AM) Battery, which assesses various aspects of a child's memory and attention. Although no substantive differences were observed between the placebo- and Keppra-treated groups in the median change from baseline in this battery, the study was not adequate to assess formal statistical non-inferiority.
