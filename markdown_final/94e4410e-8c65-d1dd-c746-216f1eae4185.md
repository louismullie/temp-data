## Question

How much prednisone should you give for a COPD exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much prednisone to give for a COPD exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of the exacerbation. Then, I should verify the optimal dose and duration from high-quality evidence and guidelines. Next, I will consider route of administration and whether tapering is needed. After that, I should review special populations and biomarker-guided strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and double-check safety trade-offs before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the dose and duration hinge on whether this is a mild outpatient exacerbation, a moderate event needing urgent care, or a severe hospitalization. Most COPD exacerbations are managed as outpatients, but severity guides intensity and setting of care, so I need to ensure I'm aligning the steroid plan with that framework [^27a42c82].

> Now, I should verify the optimal dose. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on 40 mg prednisone or equivalent daily as the standard dose for acute COPD exacerbations, with no advantage to higher doses and increased adverse effects at higher exposures, so 40 mg daily is the sweet spot I should recommend [^73e97173] [^bc848390] [^3978a790] [^42b13360].

> Wait, let me verify duration before I commit. Historically, 10–14 days was common, but the pivotal REDUCE randomized trial showed that 5 days of 40 mg prednisone daily is noninferior to 14 days for time to next exacerbation and reduced cumulative steroid exposure, and this has been echoed by subsequent meta-analyses and guidelines, so 5 days is the preferred duration in most patients [^73e97173] [^32827912] [^bc848390] [^53c9ba8b].

> Hold on, I should confirm the route of administration. Unless there is a compelling reason such as inability to take oral medications or severe GI dysfunction, oral prednisone is preferred because it achieves comparable outcomes to intravenous therapy and avoids the harms of parenteral administration; large observational data also suggest oral therapy is associated with similar or better outcomes than IV in non-ICU inpatients [^df05fec4] [^83ac2756].

> I need to check whether tapering is necessary. For a 5-day course at 40 mg daily, routine tapering is not required; tapering is generally reserved for courses longer than 2 weeks or when there has been prolonged prior steroid exposure, so I should avoid unnecessary tapers here [^73e97173] [^bc848390].

> Next, I should review special populations and modifiers. In ICU-level severity, some clinicians use higher initial IV doses, but observational data suggest worse outcomes with very high-dose regimens and support using the lowest effective dose; in patients with diabetes or high hyperglycemia risk, I should anticipate steroid-induced hyperglycemia and plan monitoring and management accordingly, recognizing that the shortest effective course minimizes harm [^887c3b6a] [^9efcaf82] [^f5aa9415].

> But wait, what if we could personalize therapy to reduce exposure. Biomarker-guided strategies using blood eosinophils can safely reduce steroid use in selected patients; the CORTICO-COP trial showed that giving prednisolone only on days when eosinophils were at least 0.3 × 10⁹/L reduced cumulative steroid exposure by about 60% without increasing treatment failure, and STARR2 demonstrated noninferiority of eosinophil-guided steroid use versus routine care, so in systems equipped for rapid eosinophil testing, this is a reasonable approach to minimize overtreatment [^0905abdf] [^006a2899].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation and double-check alignment with guidelines. For most patients with an acute COPD exacerbation, prescribe prednisone 40 mg orally once daily for 5 days without taper, ensuring concomitant bronchodilators and antibiotics when indicated; consider IV therapy only if oral is not feasible, and reserve higher doses for exceptional circumstances with close monitoring, keeping in mind that longer courses increase risks of pneumonia and mortality without added benefit [^bc848390] [^53c9ba8b] [^f5aa9415].

> I should confirm safety trade-offs explicitly. Systemic corticosteroids reduce treatment failure and improve lung function and recovery time but increase adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, weight gain, insomnia, and infection risk; limiting to 5 days at 40 mg balances benefit and harm, and in patients with repeated steroid bursts, the cumulative risk rises, reinforcing the principle of using the lowest effective dose and duration [^f9b201f2] [^f5aa9415].

> Final check and concise answer: Prednisone 40 mg orally once daily for 5 days is the standard, evidence-based regimen for acute COPD exacerbations, with oral preferred, no routine taper for 5-day courses, and consideration of eosinophil-guided strategies where available to reduce exposure; adjust only for specific contraindications or access issues, and avoid higher doses or longer durations that do not improve outcomes and increase harm [^73e97173] [^bc848390] [^3978a790] [^0905abdf].

For a COPD exacerbation, the recommended prednisone dose is **40 mg orally once daily for 5 days** [^73e97173] [^bc848390]. This regimen is supported by high-quality evidence showing noninferiority to longer courses and reduced steroid exposure [^73e97173] [^32827912]. Routine tapering is **not required** for 5-day courses, and oral therapy is preferred unless the patient cannot take oral medications [^df05fec4]. Higher doses or longer courses do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects such as hyperglycemia and infection risk [^1d875b23] [^f5aa9415].

---

## Recommended prednisone dose and duration

- **Standard dose**: 40 mg orally once daily [^73e97173] [^bc848390].
- **Duration**: 5 days [^73e97173] [^bc848390].
- **Route**: Oral preferred; intravenous only if oral intake is not feasible [^df05fec4] [^83ac2756].
- **Tapering**: Not required for 5-day courses [^73e97173].

---

## Evidence supporting the recommended regimen

The REDUCE randomized trial showed that a 5-day course of 40 mg prednisone daily was **noninferior to a 14-day course** for time to next exacerbation, with significantly less steroid exposure [^73e97173]. A Cochrane review likewise found no difference in treatment failure or relapse between short (≤ 7 days) and longer courses (10–15 days), supporting shorter courses [^32827912]. Meta-analyses indicate that low-dose regimens (≤ 40 mg/day) are as effective as higher doses for improving FEV1 and reducing treatment failure, with fewer adverse effects [^1d875b23].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with the recommended regimen

The 5-day, 40 mg prednisone regimen improves lung function (FEV1), oxygenation, and symptoms, and reduces treatment failure, early relapse, and length of hospital stay [^f9b201f2] [^bc848390]. It also shortens recovery time and is associated with fewer adverse effects than longer or higher-dose regimens [^bc848390] [^1d875b23].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Short-course prednisone is generally well tolerated, but adverse effects include hyperglycemia, insomnia, mood changes, and increased infection risk; these risks rise with longer courses or higher doses [^f9b201f2] [^f5aa9415]. Hyperglycemia is common, especially in patients with diabetes or prediabetes, and may require insulin management [^9efcaf82].

---

## Special considerations

- **Diabetes**: Monitor glucose closely and adjust antihyperglycemic therapy as needed [^9efcaf82].
- **Infection risk**: Use the lowest effective dose and duration; avoid prolonged or repeated courses when possible [^f5aa9415].
- **Eosinophil-guided therapy**: In hospitalized patients, eosinophil-guided steroid use can reduce exposure without increasing treatment failure [^0905abdf] [^006a2899].

## Comparison with alternative regimens

| **Regimen** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 40 mg daily for 5 days | High | High | High |
| 40 mg daily for 10–14 days | Similar efficacy | More adverse effects | High |
| Higher doses (> 40 mg/day) | No added benefit | More adverse effects | Moderate |
| IV corticosteroids | Similar efficacy | More adverse effects | Moderate |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from GOLD, VA/DoD, and ATS/ERS align on a **5-day course of 40 mg prednisone daily** for COPD exacerbations, with oral therapy preferred and no routine taper for short courses [^bc848390] [^f2e8d2f0] [^df05fec4].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Standard regimen**: 40 mg prednisone orally once daily for 5 days [^73e97173] [^bc848390].
- **Route**: Oral preferred; IV only if oral not feasible [^df05fec4] [^83ac2756].
- **Tapering**: Not required for 5-day courses [^73e97173].
- **Monitoring**: Check glucose in patients with diabetes or at risk; monitor for infection, mood changes, and insomnia [^9efcaf82] [^f9b201f2].
- **Avoid**: Prolonged or repeated courses when possible due to cumulative risks [^f5aa9415].

---

The recommended prednisone dose for COPD exacerbation is **40 mg orally once daily for 5 days**, balancing efficacy and safety; longer courses or higher doses do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects [^73e97173] [^bc848390].

### Improving adherence for management of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^09596490]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend 40–60 mg of prednisone equivalent for 10–14 days for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the amount of corticosteroid prescribed varies widely in clinical practice. Using the electronic health record, we implemented an evidence-based order set to standardize treatment of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Methods

This is a pre- and post-intervention study on patients hospitalized between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2012 with primary discharge diagnosis of COPD (International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) Revision code: 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496) and receipt of at least one dose of corticosteroid at our tertiary care hospital. Data on baseline demographics, dose of corticosteroid in prednisone equivalent administered during the first 48 hours and during the entire hospitalizations were collected from the electronic health record. Evidence-based guidelines were used to build and implement acute exacerbations of COPD management electronic ordersets in our electronic health record, Epic (Verona, WI). We divided the study into 2 time periods (January 1, 2009 through February 28, 2011 as pre- [n = 203] and March 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 as post-intervention periods [n = 217]). The primary outcome measure was corticosteroid dose administered in the first 48 hours. Secondary outcome measures were corticosteroid dosage during the entire hospitalization, length of stay, hospital follow-up rates, and 30-day readmission rates.

Results

A total of 420 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD were included in the study. In the post-intervention period, the median amount of corticosteroid used in the first 48 hours was significantly reduced (306.2 mg vs 156.25 mg, P < .0001), as was that used during the entire hospitalization (352.5 mg vs 175 mg, P < .0001). There was no difference in hospital follow-up rates, length of stay, or 30-day readmission rates between the 2 periods.

Conclusions

Evidence-based electronic ordersets improve compliance with clinical practice guidelines and reduce the total dose of corticosteroid administered in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter? [^3de1216a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

Recent Findings

Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^73e97173]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; P = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; P = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Do oral corticosteroids help exacerbations of COPD? [^055124bf]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Low-dose oral corticosteroids are often used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies of their usefulness in COPD patients who require hospital admission or emergency department treatment provide conflicting results, with some studies reporting improvement and others reporting no effect. Because corticosteroids can produce significant side effects, a benefit must be clearly demonstrated. Davies and colleagues conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral corticosteroids in patients admitted to the hospital because of an acute exacerbation of COPD. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 30 mg of prednisolone for 14 days or placebo. Patients maintained symptom diaries during the study. General health questionnaires were completed on the fifth day of admission and at discharge. Patients were reassessed six weeks after admission.

A total of 50 patients completed the study. The percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in one second before bronchodilation improved significantly more in the patients who received corticosteroids than in those who did not receive corticosteroids. In the placebo group, FEV 1 before bronchodilation rose from 21. 4 to 31 percent by the time of discharge. In the corticosteroid group, the percentage of predicted FEV 1 increased from 27. 4 to
38. 4 percent. After bronchodilation, FEV 1 in the placebo group increased from 25. 7 to
32. 2 percent. By contrast, it rose from 28. 2 to
41. 5 percent in the patients who received corticosteroid therapy. The improvements in FEV. 1 after bronchodilation were most impressive in the first five days of treatment. During this time, the increase in FEV 1 after bronchodilation was 90 mL per day in patients who received corticosteroid therapy and 30 mL per day in those who did not receive it.

Both groups reported rapid improvement in symptoms, with a trend toward greater improvement in patients treated with corticosteroids. The median length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients who received corticosteroid therapy. At six weeks, the percentage of predicted FEV 1 after bronchodilation did not differ significantly in the two treatment groups. The authors conclude that low-dose corticosteroid therapy provides short-term benefits in patients with severe exacerbations of COPD.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1def7614]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) be treated with systemic corticosteroids (SCs) for seven to 14 days. Intermittent SC use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could therefore reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven days or fewer) and longer-duration (more than seven days) SC treatment of acute COPD exacerbations in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials (to April 2011) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to April 2011), MEDLINE (from 1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (from 1980 to October 2010) and the reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of SC (seven days or fewer or more than seven days). Other interventions, e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardised; studies in other lung diseases were excluded, unless data on participants with COPD were available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data that were pooled them using Review Manager 5. We sought missing data from authors of studies published as abstracts only.

Main Results

We identified seven studies including 288 participants; two studies were fully published and five were published as abstracts. We obtained data for two studies published as abstracts from authors; these two abstracts and the two full papers contributed to meta-analysis. No study specified COPD diagnostic criteria and only one specified exacerbation criteria. Short course treatment varied between three and seven days and longer duration 10 to 15 days, at equivalent daily doses of corticosteroids; five studies used oral prednisolone (dose 30 mg, four studies, one tapered dose) and two studies used intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Mean ages of participants ranged from 64 to 73 years. We assessed the risk of allocation and blinding bias as low for these studies.

Primary Outcomes

risk of treatment failure did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but the confidence interval (CI) was too wide to conclude equivalence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.82; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.79) (three studies, n = 146). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) did not differ significantly when measured up to seven days (mean difference (MD) -0.07 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.05) or after seven days (MD -0.02 L;95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) in four studies (n = 187). The likelihood of an adverse event (four studies, n = 192) did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but again the CI was wide (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.40).

Authors' Conclusions

We based assessment of the efficacy of short (seven days or less) compared to longer duration (more than seven days) systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute exacerbations of COPD in this review on four of the seven included studies for which data were available. Two studies were fully published and two were published as conference abstracts but trialists were able to supply data requested for the review. The finding in this review that there is no significant increase in treatment failure with shorter systemic corticosteroid treatment for seven days or less for acute exacerbations of COPD, does not give conclusive evidence to recommend change in clinical practice due to a wide confidence interval around the estimate of effect. The four studies which contributed to the meta-analysis were of relatively low quality and five of the seven studies were not published as full articles. Thus there are insufficient data to allow firm conclusions concerning the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy of acute exacerbations of COPD to be drawn.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of COPD… [^e5909b35]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do oral or parenteral corticosteroids improve clinical outcomes in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence-Based Answer Systemic corticosteroids improve symptoms of acute COPD exacerbations at three days and reduce the likelihood of treatment failure. There is no evidence that they reduce mortality or prevent recurrence at 30 days, but the existing studies may be too small to detect such a benefit. Adverse effects are common but generally are not serious. Practice Pointers This Cochrane review updates an earlier meta-analysis with two new studies. Although systemic steroids are widely used for the treatment of acute COPD exacerbations, the authors stress that it is important to know the magnitude of their benefit and the extent of associated side effects. The question of whether oral or intramuscular steroids are more effective was not addressed.

Four of the studies in this analysis involved oral prednisone with an initial dose of 30 to 60 mg tapering over nine to 14 days; in a fifth study, high-dose oral prednisone was compared with a moderate dose. In studies of intravenous methylprednisolone, a variety of dosing regimens were used, from a single 100-mg dose to 72 hours of methylprednisolone followed by a 57-day prednisone taper. Despite the differences between studies, the review authors were able to combine the results from seven studies of treatment failure and nine studies of mortality. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the likelihood of treatment failure. Respiratory symptom scores at 72 hours were significantly more likely to be improved if patients received steroids.

However, adverse events were common; the number needed to harm was 7 for any adverse event. In addition to steroids, albuterol should be used for bronchodilation because of its short onset of action. Ipratropium bromide may be added. Antibiotics also should be considered for exacerbations that are not clearly triggered by viral infections. 1.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^32827912]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be treated with systemic corticosteroid for seven to 14 days. Intermittent systemic corticosteroid use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could reduce adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven or fewer days) and conventional longer-duration (longer than seven days) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Methods

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to June 2014 and ongoing trials registers up to July 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of systemic corticosteroid defined as short (i.e. seven or fewer days) or longer (i.e. longer than seven days). Other interventions-bronchodilators and antibiotics-were standardised. Studies with participants requiring assisted ventilation were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis. Mean ages of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more). No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more). Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37). In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)). Length of hospital stay (n = 421; mean difference (MD) -0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28) and lung function at the end of treatment (n = 185; MD FEV1 -0.04 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10) did not differ between short-duration and longer-duration treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates. The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.

### Prednisone after emergency treatment of COPD… [^6207ef3e]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Randomized trials have shown that systemic corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that require hospitalization. However, no large, controlled trials have examined outpatient use of oral corticosteroids for milder exacerbations of COPD. Aaron and colleagues conducted a randomized controlled trial of an outpatient course of prednisone in patients who were seen at an emergency department for an exacerbation of symptoms of COPD. The trial initially screened 1, 087 patients who presented to an emergency department with an exacerbation of COPD, which was defined as the presence of at least two of the following three clinical criteria: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, or increased purulence of sputum. Patients included in the study were smokers who had been diagnosed with COPD for at least one year.

The 147 subjects who met the inclusion criteria and signed consent forms were randomized to receive oral prednisone or a matching placebo. Both groups received oral antibiotics and a 30-day course of inhaled albuterol and inhaled ipratropium. The rate of patient relapse, defined as an unscheduled visit to a physician's office or emergency department within 30 days of randomization, was 27 percent in those receiving prednisone and 43 percent in those receiving placebo. Spirometric measures were significantly improved by the use of prednisone. After 10 days, the forced expiratory volume in one second was improved by 34 percent in those receiving prednisone compared with 15 percent of those taking antibiotics and bronchodilators alone.

Quality-of-life surveys showed decreased dyspnea-related scores with steroid use, but no significant change in life-quality status. No serious adverse effects were noted with prednisone use, but more patients in the prednisone group reported increased appetite, weight gain, insomnia, and symptoms of depression or anxiety. The authors conclude that a 10-day course of oral prednisone in patients with exacerbations of COPD who do not require hospitalization is associated with fewer relapses in COPD symptoms after treatment and improved spirometric measures of lung function.

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^9c4b48d2]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^f9b201f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

Search Methods

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and checked references of included studies and trials registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD. Other interventions (e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics) were standardised for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate-quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66).FEV1, measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.

### Role of corticosteroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^b935e30a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has become increasingly commonplace over the past two decades. This practice was controversial because a number of small clinical trials provided inconclusive evidence about efficacy. Experience from recent trials indicates that systemic cortico-steroids are modestly effective in this setting. Systemic corticosteroids administered to hospitalized patients reduces the absolute treatment rate by about 10%, increases the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) by about 100 mL, and shortens the hospital stay by 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not extend longer than 2 weeks. The optimal starting dose is not known. Hyperglycemia and possibly an increased rate of secondary infections are expected complications of treatment.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^27196cb6]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Personalized variable vs Fixed-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of COPD: a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial [^15562121]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD exacerbations decrease treatment failure and shorten the length of hospitalization. However, the optimal dose is unclear.

Research Question

Is personalized-dose corticosteroid administered according to a dosing scale more effective than fixed-dose corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients with COPD with exacerbations?

Study Design and Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial. In-hospital patients with COPD with exacerbations were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to either the fixed-dose group (receiving the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisolone) or the personalized-dose group for 5 days. The primary end point was a composite measure of treatment failure that included in-hospital treatment failure and medium-term (postdischarge) failure. Secondary end points were length of stay and cost.

Results

A total of 248 patients were randomly assigned to the fixed-dose group (n = 124) or personalized-dose group (n = 124). One patient in each group was not included in the intention-to-treat population because of incorrect initial COPD diagnosis. Failure of therapy occurred in 27.6% in the personalized-dose group, compared with 48.8% in the fixed-dose group (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24–0.68; P = 0.001). The in-hospital failure of therapy was significantly lower in the personalized-dose group (10.6% vs 24.4%; P = 0.005), whereas the medium-term failure rate, adverse event rate, hospital length of stay, and costs were similar between the two groups. After treatment failure, a lower additional dose of corticosteroids and a shorter duration of treatment were needed in the personalized-dose group to achieve control of the exacerbation. In the personalized-dose cohort, those receiving 40 mg or less had an average failure rate of 44.4%, compared with 22.9% among those receiving more than 40 mg (P = 0.027).

Interpretation

Personalized dosing of corticosteroids reduces the risk of failure because more patients were provided with a higher initial dose, especially > 60 mg, whereas 40 mg or less was too low in either group.

### Steroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: are nebulized and systemic forms comparable? [^06d660bf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Systemic corticosteroids are strongly recommended in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As COPD patients are usually elderly and are relatively immobile, side effects of systemic corticosteroids frequently outweigh their beneficial effects. On the contrary, nebulized corticosteroid solutions have a negligible systemic side-effect profile. In this review, as an alternative to systemic corticosteroids, the place of nebulized corticosteroids in exacerbation periods of COPD was summarized.

Recent Findings

The number of trials in the literature is increasing. Regarding the available data, high dose nebulized budesonide was found as effective as systemic corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD. The side-effect profile, blood glucose level in particular, is better for nebulized budesonide.

Summary

Findings from recent studies are giving a positive impression on the role of high dose nebulized budesonide in exacerbations of COPD. However, larger and statistically high powered trials testing different types of nebulized corticosteroid solutions with varying dosages are still lacking. Before recommending the routine use of nebulized corticosteroids in exacerbations, present findings need to be confirmed with further studies of high quality.

### Systemic corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^194712e8]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by symptoms of cough, sputum and breathlessness, which become worse during acute exacerbations. The airway inflammation associated with COPD has led to trials of the effect of systemic corticosteroids in COPD assessed in two Cochrane systematic reviews. In stable COPD, compared with placebo, oral corticosteroid treatment increased mean FEV(1) by 53 mL and mean 12-min walking distance by 29 m, but at an increased risk of any drug-related adverse event (OR 7.8). In acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroid treatment decreased the chance of treatment failure (OR 0.48), improved mean FEV(1) at 72 h by 140 mL and improved arterial blood gases, but increased the risk of drug-related adverse events (OR 2.3). Thus, treatment of stable and acute exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroids results in statistically significant average benefits, but at an increased risk of adverse events. In stable COPD, there is little support for the use of systemic corticosteroid treatment, as data on long-term outcomes are lacking. For acute exacerbations, the evidence to support the use of systemic corticosteroids is stronger, but further research is required to define the optimum dose, route and duration.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^327d42ee]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and readmissions: "Systemic oral corticosteroids for the long-term treatment of COPD are not recommended (GOLD guidelines), but their use is recommended for treating acute exacerbations of COPD (GOLD guidelines)". They "have been shown to improve symptoms and lung function, reduce treatment failure, and shorten length of hospital stay". Across trials, pooled data indicate systemic corticosteroids used to treat an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) "can reduce 30-day readmission rates due to recurrent AECOPD (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20–0.91)". Examples include Aggarwal et al using 2 weeks of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone with "no difference… (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.01–3.85)"; Niewoehner et al randomized to 8 weeks vs 2 weeks plus 6 weeks placebo vs 8 weeks placebo with 30-day readmissions "(4% vs 5%), leading to a nonsignificant OR of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.10–2.88)"; Ställberg et al gave "30 mg prednisone daily… for 2 weeks", with hospitalizations "5.6%" vs "1.8%" and OR "1.02 (95% CI, 0.06–16.71)"; and Aaron et al used "prednisone 40 mg daily… for 10 days", reducing a combined end point "27% vs 43%, P = 0.05", with hospitalization odds "0.40; 95% CI, 0.16–0.99".

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^006a2899]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD exacerbations — systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^86860bba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much controversy. Major international guidelines recommend selective use of ICS. Recently published meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings on the effects of inhaled steroid therapy in COPD.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids in stable patients with COPD, in terms of objective and subjective outcomes.

Search Methods

A pre-defined search strategy was used to search the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register for relevant literature. Searches are current as of July 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of inhaled steroid with a placebo control in patients with COPD. Acute bronchodilator reversibility to short-term beta(2)-agonists and bronchial hyper-responsiveness were not exclusion criteria. The a priori primary outcome was change in lung function. We also analysed data on mortality, exacerbations, quality of life and symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, exercise capacity, biomarkers and safety.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.

Main Results

Fifty-five primary studies with 16,154 participants met the inclusion criteria. Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) in COPD patients (generic inverse variance analysis: mean difference (MD) 5.80 mL/year with ICS over placebo, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants; pooled means analysis: 6.88 mL/year, 95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants), although one major trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants). Long-term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants). Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients. There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.46, 5586 participants) and hoarseness. In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years.

Authors' Conclusions

Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV(1)) against the potential side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness, and risk of pneumonia).

### Oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a4290dfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are widely used in the management of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, in combination with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effect of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcome in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

An initial search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo. Other interventions were standardised e.g. bronchodilators, antibiotics. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted by one of the reviewers and sent to authors for verification. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.1) for analysis.

Main Results

We have identified 7 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were varied and few were common to all studies. The most commonly reported outcome, the FEV1 between 6–72 hours after treatment, showed a significant treatment benefit for corticosteroid over placebo treatment, weighted mean difference 120 mL 95% confidence intervals: 5, 190 ml. There were significantly fewer treatment failures in patients given corticosteroid treatment, but the number of studies reporting this outcome was smaller and there was significant heterogeneity between them. There was an increased likelihood of an adverse drug reaction with corticosteroid treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment with oral or parenteral corticosteroids increases the rate of lung function improvement over the first 72 hours of an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but at a significantly increased risk of an adverse drug reaction. There is no evidence that this benefit is maintained after 72 hours, or that other outcomes are improved.

### Association of corticosteroid dose and route of administration with risk of treatment failure in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^83ac2756]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Systemic corticosteroids are beneficial for patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their optimal dose and route of administration are uncertain.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of patients treated with low doses of steroids administered orally to those treated with higher doses administered intravenously.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A pharmacoepidemiological cohort study conducted at 414 US hospitals involving patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD in 2006 and 2007 to a non-intensive care setting and who received systemic corticosteroids during the first 2 hospital days.

Main Outcome Measures

A composite measure of treatment failure, defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 days of discharge. Length of stay and hospital costs.

Results

Of 79,985 patients, 73,765 (92%) were initially treated with intravenous steroids, whereas 6220 (8%) received oral treatment. We found that 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3%-1.5%) of the intravenously and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-1.2%) of the orally treated patients died during hospitalization, whereas 10.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.1%) of the intravenously and 10.3% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.0%) of the orally treated patients experienced the composite outcome. After multivariable adjustment, including the propensity for oral treatment, the risk of treatment failure among patients treated orally was not worse than for those treated intravenously (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84–1.02). In a propensity-matched analysis, the risk of treatment failure was significantly lower among orally treated patients (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.95), as was length of stay and cost. Using an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, increased rate of treatment with oral steroids was not associated with a change in the risk of treatment failure (OR for each 10% increase in hospital use of oral steroids, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.03). A total of 1356 (22%) patients initially treated with oral steroids were switched to intravenous therapy later in the hospitalization.

Conclusion

Among patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD low-dose steroids administered orally are not associated with worse outcomes than high-dose intravenous therapy.

### Effect of corticosteroids on exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^d92a27a9]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Periodic exacerbations of disease severity, which may lead to hospitalization, are a characteristic feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), becoming more prevalent as disease severity increases. Oral corticosteroids increase the rate of resolution of these episodes in both diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective at conventional doses and are not recommended as a primary treatment for exacerbations of either disease. Maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduces the chance that a further exacerbation will occur in asthma. In general, increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than placebo therapy in preventing exacerbations, at least until patients become persistently symptomatic and regular users of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Thereafter, the gains from doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy are modest and generally inferior to those that result from adding other antiinflammatory or bronchodilator agents to the treatment regime. The reduction in the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled corticosteroids, compared with placebo, ranges from 15 to 20% in COPD versus almost 50% in severe asthma. However, given the impact of exacerbations on overall quality of life in COPD, even this modest reduction is likely to be clinically important.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^1ca4c1db]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbation of COPD — systemic corticosteroids beyond 30 days: For patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in the outpatient or inpatient setting, we recommend that systemic corticosteroids not be given orally or intravenously for the sole purpose of preventing hospitalization due to subsequent acute exacerbations of COPD beyond the first 30 days following the initial acute exacerbation of COPD (Grade 1A). A remark clarifies this does not preclude the use of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and the underlying text notes they have not been shown to reduce exacerbations beyond 30 days and that no evidence supports long-term corticosteroids, with risks that far outweigh any benefits.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^de0dd63b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

COPD is a common condition, mainly related to smoking. Acute exacerbations of COPD, usually related to superimposed infection, occur commonly and systemic corticosteroids are widely used in their management in combination with other treatments including antibiotics, oxygen supplementation and bronchodilators.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcomes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. The last search was carried out in August 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo control. Other interventions e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics were standardised. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data measured but not reported were sought from authors of included studies. Trials were combined using Review Manager for analyses.

Main Results

Eleven studies (n = 1081) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 10 studies contributed data for analyses (n = 1051). There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, Odds Ratio (OR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.69 and Hazard Ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97. It would have been necessary to treat 10 patients (95%CI 7 to 16) with corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure in this time period. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment, mean difference -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18. For FEV1 there were significant treatment benefits with mean differences at the early time point (to 72 hours), 140 ml; 95% CI 90 to 190 mL and at end of treatment (up to 15 days) 80 ml; 95% confidence interval 10 to 160. There was a significant improvement in breathlessness and blood gases at both time points. There was no significant effect on mortality but an increased likelihood of an adverse event associated with corticosteroid treatment, OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.60 to 3.40. Overall one extra adverse effect occurred for every 5 people treated (95% CI 4 to 9). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased, OR 4.95; 95% CI 2.47 to 9.91.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of an exacerbation of COPD with oral or parenteral corticosteroids significantly reduces treatment failure and the need for additional medical treatment and shortens hospital stay. It increases the rate of improvement in lung function and dyspnoea and the improvement continues during treatment, but there is a significantly increase in the risk of an adverse drug event occurring. The optimal dose and length of treatment regime needs to be better defined.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^b10fb3de]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) occur frequently in the course of COPD. They can differ in severity and many require hospitalisation, but the majority of mild to moderate AECOPD can be managed in primary care. Antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids are beneficial treatment options that are often used. However, the benefit of antibiotics in mild to moderate AECOPD remains controversial, and their overuse can contribute to the development of bacterial resistance. Systemic corticosteroids bear the risk of adverse side effects, especially in patients with co-morbidities. Inappropriate use of either treatment should be avoided, and targeting patient treatment requires careful patient assessment. Clinical practice guidelines are intended to assist treatment decisions, based on the best available evidence. A critical appraisal of 15 COPD guidelines found variations in the content and between recommendations on several management strategies for COPD, and concluded that these were rather a result of 'selective experience' than based on scientific evidence. Consequently, we designed this study to identify recommended assessment strategies for treating AECOPD patients with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in COPD guidelines. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the quality of guideline development and the applicability of underlying evidence to primary care.

There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, odds ratio 0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.68 and Hazard Ratio 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.97. It would have been necessary to treat 9 patients (95%CI 6 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure in this time period. There was no significant difference in mortality. The early FEV1, up to 72 hours, showed a significant treatment benefit, weighted mean difference 140 mls (95% confidence interval 80–200 mls), although this benefit was not found for later time points. There was a significant improvement in breathlessness and blood gases between 6–72 hours after treatment. There was an increased likelihood of an adverse drug reaction with corticosteroid treatment, odds ratio 2.29; 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 3.38. Overall one extra adverse effect occurred for every 6 people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased, odds ratio 5.48; 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 18.96.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of an exacerbation of COPD with oral or parenteral corticosteroids significantly reduces treatment failure and the need for additional medical treatment. It increases the rate of improvement in lung function and dyspnoea over the first 72 hours, but at a significantly increased risk of an adverse drug reaction.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^28bd512e]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and rationale

Current guidelines recommend that systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (n = 1700) assessed the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo in treating COPD exacerbations. Most of the studies from the meta-analysis were based on hospitalised patients. The meta-analysis showed that corticosteroids shorten hospital stays by approximately 1 day and have a moderately positive effect on pulmonary function tests and 30-day re-exacerbation rate, but do not seem to have any influence on survival. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in treating AECOPD are temporary, lasting only 3–5 days. The risk of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or re-exacerbations after the first month appears to be unaltered. Corticosteroids affect the expression of various genes, especially those regulating the innate and the adaptive immune system, leading to a variety of beneficial and harmful effects such as increasing the risk of acute or chronic infections, the onset or aggravation of diabetes mellitus, and osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, minimising the unnecessary exposure of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations to systemic corticosteroids is crucial. To date, two RCTs have investigated how such unnecessary exposure can be minimised, without attenuating the documented beneficial effects. In the REDUCE trial, patients hospitalised for AECOPD were randomly assigned to either 14 days (standard) or 5 days (intervention) of treatment with 40 mg of daily prednisone. The CORTICO-COP trial randomly assigned patients to 5-day (standard) or eosinophil-guided (intervention) therapy, with the latter regimen resulting in a median of 2 days of treatment with prednisolone.

However, it remains unclear whether 14-day or 2–5-day regimens would result in shorter admission durations and changes in mortality risk. We explored this by analysing the number of days alive and out of hospital based on two trial populations with different dosing regimens.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^53c9ba8b]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

Research needs

The studies available to date used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks (and different responses to pharmacotherapy) for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk, patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk, and patients with two or more exacerbations per year or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking with regard to the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies (e.g. pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions), with larger sample sizes, in the area of triple therapy versus dual therapy should be conducted in real-life situations, such as those involving patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, current smokers, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

Question 3: In Patients with COPD Who Are Receiving Triple Therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), Should the ICS Be Withdrawn?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA, we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done for the exacerbation outcome based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with no exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, all-cause death, ICU admissions, dyspnea, health-related QOL, and physical activity as critical outcomes.

### Should you recommend inhaled corticosteroids for this patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^6507defa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures also may contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. To date, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia. Here, 2 experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for COPD exacerbations… [^426f35a1]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are shorter courses of systemic corticosteroid therapy as safe and effective as conventional, longer courses for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence-Based Answer Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD with a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids is likely to be as effective and safe as treating with longer courses. There is no significant difference in adverse effects between shorter and longer courses.

1. Practice Pointers COPD is a chronic, progressive lung condition resulting in airflow limitations. Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations, which may present as dyspnea, increased cough, and sputum production. Systemic corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment, but the necessary duration of treatment is debated.

The authors of this review assessed whether a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids was as safe and effective as the more conventional 10- to 14-day course. Five studies used oral prednisolone, one study used intravenous methylprednisolone, and two studies used a combination of oral and intravenous corticosteroids. Shorter courses of corticosteroids ranged from three to seven days of treatment; longer courses ranged from 10 to 15 days. This review did not discuss whether three days of treatment is equivalent to other courses of up to seven days of treatment. Treatment failure was assessed in four studies, as was relapse. Adverse effects that were studied included hyperglycemia, hypertension, and "other", which included gastrointestinal bleeding, symptomatic gastrointestinal reflux, symptoms of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease, sleep disturbance, fractures, or depression.

There was no difference in any primary outcomes between patients who were treated with systemic corticosteroids for seven or fewer days and those who were treated for more than seven days. The investigators rated the evidence for primary outcomes as moderate, with imprecision as a reported limiting factor. As noted, the studies did not specifically address outpatient therapy for COPD exacerbations and excluded patients with mild or moderate COPD. Current guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommend treating acute exacerbations of COPD with oral prednisone, 40 mg per day for five days in most patients.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation comparative effectiveness — initial high-dose intravenous corticosteroids versus low-dose oral corticosteroids — is illustrated across efficacy, effectiveness, and observational designs with explicit eligibility, dosing, timing, and outcomes. Efficacy trial eligibility required Age > 50 yr, 20 pack-years or more smoked, and FEV1 < 50% of predicted. The efficacy oral intervention was initiated within 6 h of presentation with 40 mg/d x 10 d, while the intravenous comparator was initiated within 6 h using methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d. The efficacy primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 d of discharge. Effectiveness trial protocols initiated oral corticosteroids within 24 h of hospital admission at 40 mg/d x 10 d and intravenous corticosteroids within 24 h with methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d; patient-centered outcomes included return to baseline level of functional health, hospital length of stay, and readmission or death within 30 d. Observational definitions used ICD-9 discharge codes with Age > 50 yr and no exclusions; oral exposure was prednisone via mouth at least 40 mg/d for 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission, and intravenous exposure was methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h for at least 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^e4c4c7a6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in Web of Science, SCOPUS, SveMed+, PubMed, Embase, Cihnal (EBsco) and Ovid MD to identify COPD guidelines. Throughout the entire search, 'COPD' as Mesh-term was used whenever applicable. If a database did not support Mesh-terms, 'COPD' was searched in keywords, abstract and title. 'COPD' was combined with the search phrases 'guideline' and 'recommendation'. The search string used throughout the search was as follows:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease AND (Guideline OR Recommendation).

Our initial search was performed with a time limit set for publications between 2003 and 2013. It was then extended to 8 May 2014 to ensure the inclusion of any new publications during our work on this project. Eligibility assessment was conducted by the first and the last author, and the approach from the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement was followed(Figure 1). To avoid overlooking documents that were published elsewhere than in the searched databases, a supplemental search was conducted in the guideline databases UpToDate, Best Practice, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Cochrane Library, Guidelines International Network and websites of the Canadian Medical Association, and American College of Physicians. Furthermore, websites of national health authorities (Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, and Netherlands) were searched for eligible guidelines. This search was not repeated after 2013. Only guidelines and published documents with recommendations on adults with AECOPD and/or infectious diseases of the lungs when containing AECOPD were included in this study. They also had to be published in English, German, Dutch, or a Scandinavian language. The most recent guideline from each country was included. The included guidelines were analysed in terms of guideline development by applying criteria from the AGREE II tool (Appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation II). The criteria applied belonged to the domains 2 (stakeholder involvement), 3 (rigor of development), and 6 (editorial independence). We extracted recommendations about patient assessment for treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. If recommendations were given separately for inpatients and outpatients, only those for outpatients were considered. Evidence explicitly linked to the recommendations, as described in domain 3 of the AGREE II tool, was obtained, and randomised controlled trials published in scientific medical journals were assessed in terms of study setting, study design, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, we decided to add the trials included in the latest versions of the Cochrane reviews about treating AECOPD with systemic corticosteroidsand antibiotics, although not directly referred to in the guidelines.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^f310acaf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

Systemic corticosteroids around an acute exacerbation of COPD — timing-specific guidance: For patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in the outpatient or inpatient setting, "we suggest that systemic corticosteroids be given orally or intravenously to prevent hospitalization for subsequent acute exacerbations of COPD in the first 30 days following the initial exacerbation (Grade 2B)". Values and preferences note "reducing recurrent exacerbations in the first 30 days" and state, "The use of systemic corticosteroids to treat an acute exacerbation has not been shown to reduce acute exacerbations beyond the 30-day window", with short-term risks described as including "hyperglycemia, weight gain, and insomnia". For periods beyond this window, "we recommend that systemic corticosteroids not be given orally or intravenously for the sole purpose of preventing hospitalization due to subsequent acute exacerbations of COPD beyond the first 30 days following the initial acute exacerbation of COPD (Grade 1A)", and "Remark: This does not preclude the use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD".

Conclusions

Our study does not suggest that 600 mg b.d. of N-acetylcysteine is effective in the treatment of patients who are admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD and who receive concurrent treatment with corticosteroids. In future studies it may be appropriate to use a higher dose of N-acetylcysteine and to compare N-acetylcysteine with placebo in patients with mild exacerbations who do not require treatment with corticosteroids. Consideration could also be given to comparing the effects of N-acetylcysteine with prednisone or prednisolone in patients who would usually be treated with oral corticosteroids.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^28961778]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

COPD exacerbations characterised by enhanced airway eosinophilic inflammation are generally milder, as they are associated with lower mortalityand shorter length of hospital stay. Bacterial infections are rarely present, while the presence of viral infection in exacerbations characterised by airway eosinophilia remains controversial. Higher blood eosinophil count during exacerbations is predictive of clinical response to oral corticosteroids. An RCT evaluating 166 mostly moderate severity exacerbations demonstrated the safety of withholding systemic corticosteroids in those characterised by a blood eosinophil count of less than 2% of total white cell count at baseline. While studies evaluating stable COPD suggested a degree of variability in blood eosinophils over time, this did not appear to limit the results of this trial. However, use of additional eosinophil measurements to guide the administration of systemic corticosteroids may be preferable, especially for severe exacerbations. Indeed, the Corticosteroid Reduction in COPD (CORTICO-COP) trial demonstrated non-inferiority of a treatment protocol where daily eosinophil measurements were used to guide daily administration of systemic steroids for severe COPD exacerbations, compared with standard care. Based on this treatment protocol, which reduced cumulative prednisolone dose by 60%, corticosteroids were administered for a maximum of up to 5 days — on days when the blood eosinophil count was at least 0.3×10⁹ cells/L. In line with these RCTs, a post-hoc analysis of three clinical trials, using blood eosinophils to direct oral corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of COPD exacerbations, found increased treatment failure rates in patients with a blood eosinophil count ≥ 2% who did not receive prednisolone compared with patients who did (66% vs 11%). On the contrary, increased harm was observed in patients with blood eosinophil count of < 2%, when treated with prednisolone. There remains an ongoing debate as to the appropriate eosinophil count threshold for risk stratification. This has been investigated in more depth in studies evaluating treatment of stable COPD with ICS. Several studies have reported a 2% eosinophil threshold, while others have focused on the absolute eosinophil counts. Based on data from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, a consistent linear relationship between eosinophil counts and exacerbation risk was seen. In the same study, multivariable logistic regression models using different eosinophil count cut-offs found that a threshold of 0.3×10 9 cells/L was associated with the greatest sensitivity (72.6%) and specificity (66.0%) for identifying a risk of self-reported exacerbation of at least one event. The Copenhagen Lung Study showed an increase in exacerbations when blood eosinophilia count was above 0.34×10⁹ cells/l 94. Overall, blood eosinophils represent a continuous biomarker and a threshold with perfect performance characteristics is very unlikely to be found.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^49a4cfe0]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Oral glucocorticoids — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), oral glucocorticoids have numerous side effects, including steroid myopathy which can contribute to muscle weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in people with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or during emergency department visits have been shown to reduce the rate of treatment failure, the rate of relapse and to improve lung function and breathlessness, whereas prospective studies on the long-term effects in stable COPD are limited. Therefore, while they play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.

### A multi-center randomized, controlled, open-label trial evaluating the effects of eosinophil-guided corticosteroid-sparing therapy in hospitalised patients with COPD exacerbations-the CORTICO steroid reduction in COPD (CORTICO-COP) study protocol [^1840b1df]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) often leads to hospitalization and is associated with a high mortality rate. AECOPD episodes lead to accelerated decline in lung function and have negative impact on physical activity and quality of life. Furthermore, AECOPD implies high socioeconomic costs. For decades, systemic corticosteroids have been a cornerstone in management of moderate to severe AECOPD. However, the optimal approach as regards the duration of treatment is unknown. The REDUCE study concluded that a 5-day course of systemic corticosteroids is noninferior to 14-days of treatment. Based on this, the recent GOLD strategy document recommends five to seven days of systemic corticosteroid treatment for patients with AECOPD.

B

Short-acting inhaled β₂-agonists (SABA), with or without short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA), are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of ECOPD, administered using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), with a spacer device if necessary, or nebulization. If a nebulizer is chosen, air-driven is preferable to oxygen-driven nebulization to avoid the potential risk of increasing PaCO₂. The GOLD 2023 report recommends continuing treatments with long-acting bronchodilators during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects.

G

Systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations improve lung function, oxygenation, and risk of early relapse, and reduce treatment failures and length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended. Longer courses increase the risk of pneumonia and mortality. Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration. Nebulized budesonide may be a suitable alternative to systemic corticosteroids in some patients. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat COPD exacerbations in patients with lower blood eosinophil levels.

A

Antibiotics should be given to patients with ECOPD who have increased sputum volume and sputum purulence and most of those requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). The recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days. The choice of antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern. Usually, initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline, or, in selected patients, quinolone. In patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other materials from the lung should be performed, as gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas species) or resistant pathogens that are not sensitive to the above-mentioned antibiotics may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient's ability to ingest medications and the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic.

A

Additional therapies may be indicated to maintain appropriate fluid balance, treat the comorbidities, and monitor nutritional aspects. Hospitalized patients with COPD are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and prophylactic measures for thromboembolism should be instituted. At all times, healthcare providers should strongly enforce the need for smoking cessation.

### Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^e4158ea0]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic and local inflammation is central to the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased levels of inflammation have been linked to a more progressive course in COPD and have been shown to be present during an exacerbation. Decreases in inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, and inflammatory cells have been observed with corticosteroid use, suggesting a possible mechanism for a therapeutic benefit of steroids. No available data support the routine use of systemic corticosteroids in stable COPD; however, short courses during exacerbations are likely to improve length of hospitalization, lung function, and relapse rate. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) decrease the rate of exacerbation and may improve the response to bronchodilators and decrease dyspnea in stable COPD. No study shows that ICS reduce the loss of lung function; however, recent data suggest a possible survival benefit when combined with long-acting beta agonists. There are limited data on the use of ICS in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and its role in this setting must be more clearly defined. The empiric use of systemic corticosteroids perioperatively represents another area of uncertainty. The role of pharmacogenetics in the metabolism of corticosteroids in COPD is evolving but may be partially responsible for the observed variability in patient responsiveness. The potential benefits of systemic or inhaled corticosteroid use must be weighed against the risk of known toxicities.

Combination inhaled therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting β2-agonists (LABA): these are basically longer-acting variations with a 12- or 24-h administration regimen, respectively; and 12- and 24-h inhaled corticosteroids, and each agent, singularly or in combination, has been shown to improve lung function, relieve symptoms, and improve health-related quality of life and exercise endurance. Existing national and international COPD guidelines have recommended that if COPD symptoms are not well controlled with single agents, the combination of two or more agents in a stepwise manner is reasonable. GOLD grades disease severity using the number of exacerbations and recommends combination therapy for patients with two or more exacerbations (categories C and D). The combination includes primarily an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist, although potential use of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist plus a long-acting β2-agonist is also recommended based primarily on consensus. In patients with more severe COPD (GOLD category D), triple therapy is considered appropriate.

Evidence supporting or refuting the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has only recently become available, and evidence is still missing for a number of important clinical issues. Results from four large studies on the long-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids on COPD and other controlled studies on the more short-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids provide evidence that regular treatment with these drugs is only appropriate for a limited group of patients with COPD. These include symptomatic COPD patients with documented spirometric response to inhaled corticosteroids or those with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) less than 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations requiring treatments with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids.

### Systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use in hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^614550db]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective inpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management is critical to appropriately manage health care resources. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines provide recommendations on appropriate systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use, in select patients, for COPD exacerbation.

Objective

To determine the impact of GOLD guideline-recommended systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy in the hospital setting on clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbation.

Methods

This was a noninterventional, retrospective, single-center study. Adults admitted to a non-intensive care unit internal medicine service with documented COPD exacerbation were included. Two analyses were conducted evaluating systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy.

Results

A total of 220 patients were included in the systemic corticosteroid cohort. No difference in 30-day readmission rates was demonstrated for the standard (≤ 200 mg prednisone equivalents [PEs] for exacerbation course) and high-dose groups (> 200 mg PEs; 20.5% vs 13.1%, respectively; P = 0.15). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter for patients prescribed standard-dose therapy (3 days [2–4.5] vs 4 days [2–6]; P < 0.001). A total of 174 patients were included in the antibiotic cohort. For the appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic use groups, no significant differences were observed between 30-day readmission rates (15% vs 18.4%, respectively; P = 0.57) and hospital LOS (4 days [2–5] in both groups; P = 0.97). Conclusion and Relevance: Hospital LOS was shorter for patients prescribed standard-dose systemic corticosteroids; however, no differences in other clinical outcomes were found in either cohort. Use of guideline-recommended systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy is recommended for hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbation.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^ec5c9590]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Not all patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) benefit from treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. The aim of the study was to identify criteria recommended in current COPD guidelines for treating acute exacerbations with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics and to assess the underlying evidence. Current COPD guidelines were identified by a systematic literature search. The most recent guidelines as per country/organisation containing recommendations about treating acute exacerbations of COPD were included. Guideline development and criteria for treating acute exacerbations with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics were appraised. Randomised controlled trials directly referred to in context with the recommendations were evaluated in terms of study design, setting, and study population. A total of 19 COPD guidelines were included. Systemic corticosteroids were often universally recommended to all patients with acute exacerbations. Criteria for treatment with antibiotics were mainly an increase in respiratory symptoms. Objective diagnostic tests or clinical examination were only rarely recommended. Only few criteria were directly linked to underlying evidence, and the trial patients represented a highly specific group of COPD patients. Current COPD guidelines are of little help in primary care to identify patients with acute exacerbations probably benefitting from treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care, and might contribute to overuse or inappropriate use of either treatment.

### Budesonide / formoterol as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol in acute exacerbations of COPD. A double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentre study [^9d21264d]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem and cause of death and disability. Most patients with COPD suffer from exacerbations, which vary in severity and duration. Frequent exacerbations result in further decline in lung function, quality of life and drive mortality. In addition to intensified therapy with bronchodilators, such as β 2 -agonists and anticholinergics, oral corticosteroids represent standard treatment for COPD exacerbations. The value of oral steroids has been widely recognised but extending the course beyond two weeks has not provided additional clinical benefit. High doses of nebulized budesonide has also been successfully used for treatment of acute COPD exacerbations in the emergency department. Inhaled corticosteroids alone and in combination with long-acting β 2 -agonists have been useful in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD, particularly for prevention of severe exacerbations.

In randomized studies in hospitalized patients with acute severe COPD exacerbations, but not requiring ventilation for acute respiratory failure, treatment with budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler has been compared to inhaled salbutamol on top of a standardized regimen of exacerbation treatment and to i.v. aminophylline and prednisolone plus inhaled salbutamol. The results of these studies indicated that budesonide/formoterol is safe and may be of clinical benefit to COPD patients with acute exacerbations. Large, controlled studies were proposed to be performed to evaluate the value of budesonide/formoterol in the treatment of acute COPD exacerbations.

Little is known about COPD exacerbations in an out-patient setting. Based on our experience up to 90% of all COPD patients with exacerbations can be treated at primary health care centres and thereafter return home with intensified therapy. It is self-explanatory that these exacerbations are milder than those treated in hospitals or emergency departments. Published clinical studies in patients with COPD exacerbations have been performed in hospitals or in emergency departments. Therefore, we decided to investigate treatment of COPD exacerbations in an out-patient setting and in patients not requiring immediate hospitalisation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study focused on this type of moderate severe exacerbations. Our hypothesis was that a high dose of the budesonide/formoterol combination could be as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol for this type of acute exacerbations not requiring immediate hospitalisation.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^27a42c82]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations — the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### Oral corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^c897eeda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disorder, usually related to cigarette smoking, representing a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. It is defined "as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases". The use of corticosteroids for their anti-inflammatory effects has been suggested.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids on the health status of patients with stable COPD.

Search Strategy

Searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and MEDLINE were carried out in December 2003 and 2004. Review articles and bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled prospective studies in adults with stable COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1 < 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC < 70%) and a history of smoking, excluding known asthmatics, in which oral steroid use was compared with placebo and use of co-interventions was matched in both groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted independently by two reviewers. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.2.7).

Main Results

From 459 titles 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Treatment lasted three weeks or less in 19 studies, high dose oral steroid was used in 21 studies and subjects had moderate or severe COPD in 15 studies. There was a significant difference in FEV1 after two weeks treatment, WMD 53.30 ml; 95% confidence interval 22.21 to 84.39 favouring oral steroid use compared to placebo when 14 studies with available data (n = 396) were combined, with no significant heterogeneity. There was a significant increase in odds for individual patient FEV1 response greater than 20% from baseline with high dose oral steroid treatment compared to placebo, OR 2.71; 95% CI 1.84 to 4.01 (9 studies). It would be necessary to treat 7 patients (95% CI 5 to 12) with oral corticosteroids to achieve one extra case of increasing FEV1 by more than 20%, with a placebo group risk of 0.13. All differences in health-related quality of life were less than the minimum clinically important difference. There were small statistically significant advantages for functional capacity and respiratory symptom of wheeze with oral steroid treatment but no significant difference in risk of withdrawal from study due to an exacerbation or rate of serious exacerbations over 2 years with low dose oral steroid treatment. There was an increased risk of adverse effects, including increased blood glucose, adrenal suppression and reduced serum osteocalcin.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the long-term use of oral steroids at doses less than 10–15 mg prednisolone though some evidence that higher doses (≥ 30 mg prednisolone) improve lung function over a short period. Potentially harmful adverse effects e.g. diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis would prevent recommending long-term use at these high doses in most patients.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^f6700e5e]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) inhaled corticosteroids versus placebo — long-term effects show that across 55 primary studies enrolling 16,154 participants, long-term use reduced the mean rate of exacerbations with relative effect −0.26 exacerbations/patient/year [95% CI, −0.37 to −0.14; 2,586 participants] and, by pooled means analysis, relative effect −0.19 exacerbations/patient/year [95% CI, −0.30 to −0.08; 2,253 participants], while studies of < 1,000 μg beclomethasone dipropionate equivalents per day did not show a statistically significant difference, with increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.03–3.46; 5,586 participants) and increased pneumonia (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.30–1.86; 6,235 participants) reported, and long-term studies generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over 3 years.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^d4d0182f]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Optimizing treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an assessment of current therapies [^b7cc9fe0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Bronchodilators are the mainstay of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapy. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists generally have a more rapid onset of effect and shorter duration of action than short-acting anticholinergic agents, and are usually prescribed as "rescue" medication to relieve acute bronchospasm. For patients with persistent symptoms, maintenance therapy with inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists is preferable to short-acting beta2-agonists because long-acting beta2-agonists provide more predictable, longer-lasting improvements in lung function. Long-acting anticholinergic agents can provide similar prolonged improvement in lung function with once-daily dosing. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and are recommended for patients with severe COPD and frequent exacerbations. Combining different classes of bronchodilators or combining a bronchodilator with a corticosteroid provides greater improvements in lung function and symptoms than the individual agents given alone. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and surgery, can benefit patients at various stages of disease. A treatment algorithm that combines both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of COPD is presented.

### Five-day steroid treatment effective for acute COPD… [^46c617ec]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is a five-day course of systemic glucocorticoids effective in the treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bottom Line A five-day course of systemic glucocorticoids is at least as effective as a 14-day course in the treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD. Synopsis Glucocorticoid therapy reduces the length of hospital stay in adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, but the optimal dose and duration of treatment are unknown. These investigators identified adults who presented to one of five emergency departments in Switzerland and who met standard clinical criteria for acute exacerbations of COPD.

Eligible patients randomly received five or 14 days of systemic glucocorticoids, beginning with 40 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on day 1, followed by 40 mg of oral prednisone daily for days 2 through 5, and then 40 mg of oral prednisone daily or matched placebo for days 6 through 14. Individuals assessing outcomes remained masked to treatment group assignment. All patients received antibiotic therapy for seven days and an inhaled, nebulized, short-acting bronchodilator as clinically indicated during hospitalization. Additional standard treatments included inhaled glucocorticoids, beta agonists, and tiotropium given throughout the study duration. Approximately 8% of patients in each treatment group were discharged directly from the emergency department; the remaining patients were hospitalized. Complete follow-up occurred for 99% of patients at six months.

Using intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in recurrent COPD exacerbations between the short-term and conventional treatment groups:

35. 9% vs.
36. 8%, respectively, met the primary end point of no exacerbations within 180 days. The median time to exacerbation was 43. 5 days in the short-term treatment group and 29 days in the conventional group. In subgroup analyses, the authors found no differences in results by differing severities of COPD. There were also no treatment group differences in the need for mechanical ventilation, quality-of-life assessments, hypertension or hyperglycemia worsening, infection rates, gastrointestinal bleeding, or all-cause mortality. Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

Research needs

Well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes should be conducted in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia. These studies should stratify patients by eosinophil levels and exacerbation risk. It is unclear whether different threshold values for blood eosinophilia would affect outcomes, and we recommend further research to define the most predictive threshold values. Finally, research is needed to determine the relevance of measuring changes in blood eosinophil counts as a dynamic parameter, and whether this may correlate with treatment response.

Question 5: In Patients with COPD Who Have a History of Severe and Frequent Exacerbations despite Otherwise Optimal Therapy, Is Maintenance Oral Steroid Therapy More Effective than and as Safe as No Maintenance Oral Steroid Therapy?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, we advise against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking mortality, exacerbations, dyspnea, hospital admissions, bone fractures, QOL, and treatment-emergent adverse events as critical outcomes.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 1,500 citations in MEDLINE (n = 777), Embase (n = 664), and the Cochrane Library (n = 59), with deduplication resulting in n = 932 warranting abstract screening. The majority (98.8%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, resulting in the screeners identifying 11 studies for final review inclusion. Four of the 11 studies were RCTs. The total sample size for the four RCTs was 477 patients; 290 (60.8%) of these patients were in the treatment/intervention arms and 187 (39.2%) were in the control (comparator) arms. The four studies were a combination of single- and multicenter designs.

We initially analyzed both RCT and observational (nonrandomized) evidence for this question given the available evidence, while recognizing that nonrandomized evidence can be affected by selection bias and residual confounding (e.g. confounding by indication). After the analysis, we judged the RCT evidence to be the optimal evidence on which to base this recommendation. As such, for the application of GRADE methods, we used the RCT evidence in determining the certainty of evidence, and we present the RCT evidence for the respective patient-important outcomes.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^f5aa9415]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Patients with COPD are also at greater risk of developing pneumonia, mainly due to the impairment of lung defence mechanisms and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In addition, patients hospitalised for COPD and pneumonia exhibit substantially higher rates of intensive care admission, mortality and longer length of hospital stay compared with persons without COPD.

Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendation for treatment duration of systemic corticosteroids (oral corticosteroids, OCS) for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) has changed over the last decades, ranging from treatment durations of 10–14 days,7–10 daysand is currently 5–7 days. The last reduction was based on a robust randomised controlled trial.

OCS are recommended to patients with COPD during acute exacerbations, and most COPD exacerbations can safely be managed in the outpatient setting.OCS have been found to shorten the length of hospital stays, improve lung function, and reduce the risk of early relapse and treatment failure in patients with non-pneumonia exacerbation. No effect has been observed regarding longer-term lung function, length of stay at intensive care unit and 30-day mortality. Most clinical trials investigating OCS for exacerbations were performed on patients who require hospitalisation, and only a few have described the effect of OCS in the outpatient setting.

OCS use is associated with a number of adverse effects including hyperglycaemia, ﬂuid retention, weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, adrenal suppression, deep vein thrombosis, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. Even short courses of OCS (median days = 6) have been associated with adverse effects, and they increase with increased number of OCS courses. In addition, OCS have been shown to cause severe infections due to their immunosuppressive activity, which impairs phagocyte function and suppresses cell-mediated immunity. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 71 pooled controlled trials that showed a relative risk of 1.6 for infectious events in the prednisolone group (n = 2111) compared with the controls (n = 2087). However, the risk of severe infections and death following the use of OCS is in general unknown and mainly short-term follow-up endpoints have been reported in patients with COPD. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, observational cohort study to determine the association between duration of OCS treatment in outpatients with AECOPD and the risk of pneumonia hospitalisation and all-cause mortality during a 1-year study period and to explore how the timing of the exposure affects the risk estimates.

### Building toolkits for COPD exacerbations: lessons from the past and present [^6fa584b4]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Exacerbation treatment

Despite a greater understanding of the biology and complexity of COPD exacerbations, this has not (yet) translated into novel therapies to treat exacerbations. There has been no new intervention to treat COPD exacerbations since the widespread adoption of non-invasive ventilation to treat exacerbations with hypercapnoeic respiratory failure in the early 1990s. From the first introduction of guidelines such as GOLD in 1997, the therapy for an exacerbation is unchanged. As described below, despite being commonly used, there remain significant research knowledge gaps in determining which exacerbations do and do not require treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids were first used in rheumatological disease during the late 1940s. Despite evidence in the late 1980s that many hospitalised patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids, it was only at the turn of the millennium that small randomised clinical trails (RCTs)first documented clinical efficacy, suggesting benefit on lung function and outcomes such as length of hospital stay. Around the same time, the first small outpatient trials of steroids at exacerbation reported, with modest benefits confirmed in a larger 2003 RCT. Later it was defined that short course (5 days) treatment was as effective as longer 14 day courses, and without the need to taper dose. With a greater emphasis on exacerbation phenotyping, more recent studies have documented the ability to safely withhold steroids in exacerbations without an eosinophil signal. However, the practicality of achieving this at point-of-care, and the optimal blood eosinophil cut-off to guide steroid therapy remain to be determined, and there are ongoing trials in the area. Given the toxicity associated with repeated courses of corticosteroids, the need for effective novel anti-inflammatory agents is also great. Disappointingly, there is no evidence of benefit with the anti-TNF agent entanerceptor roflumilast, for example.

### Inhaled corticosteroids versus placebo for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3973f552]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much uncertainty. COPD clinical guidelines currently recommend selective use of ICS. ICS are not recommended as monotherapy for people with COPD, and are only given in combination with long-acting bronchodilators due to greater efficacy of combination therapy. Incorporating and critiquing newly published placebo-controlled trials into the monotherapy evidence base may help to resolve ongoing uncertainties and conflicting findings about their role in this population.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of inhaled corticosteroids, used as monotherapy versus placebo, in people with stable COPD, in terms of objective and subjective outcomes.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was October 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of ICS, given as monotherapy, with a placebo control in people with stable COPD. We excluded studies of less than 12 weeks' duration and studies of populations with known bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) or bronchodilator reversibility.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our a priori primary outcomes were 1. exacerbations of COPD and 2. quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were 3. all-cause mortality, 4. lung function (rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1)), 5. rescue bronchodilator use, 6. exercise capacity, 7. pneumonia and 8. adverse events including pneumonia.]. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Thirty-six primary studies with 23,139 participants met the inclusion criteria. Mean age ranged from 52 to 67 years, and females were 0% to 46% of participants. Studies recruited across the severities of COPD. Seventeen studies were of duration longer than three months and up to six months and 19 studies were of duration longer than six months. We judged the overall risk of bias as low. Long-term (more than six months) use of ICS as monotherapy reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: rate ratio 0.88 exacerbations per participant per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94; I² = 48%, 5 studies, 10,097 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; pooled means analysis: mean difference (MD) -0.05 exacerbations per participant per year, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.02; I² = 78%, 5 studies, 10,316 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 2507 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; minimal clinically importance difference 4 points). There was no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality in people with COPD (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 16,636 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Long-term use of ICS reduced the rate of decline in FEV 1 in people with COPD (generic inverse variance analysis: MD 6.31 mL/year benefit, 95% CI 1.76 to 10.85; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 9829 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; pooled means analysis: 7.28 mL/year, 95% CI 3.21 to 11.35; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 12,502 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Events

in the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group, compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.88; I² = 55%; 9 studies, 14,831 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.68; 5547 participants) and hoarseness (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.74; 3523 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures or bone mineral density over three years. We downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate for imprecision and low for imprecision and inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review updates the evidence base for ICS monotherapy with newly published trials to aid the ongoing assessment of their role for people with COPD. Use of ICS alone for COPD likely results in a reduction of exacerbation rates of clinical relevance, probably results in a reduction in the rate of decline of FEV 1 of uncertain clinical relevance and likely results in a small improvement in health-related quality of life not meeting the threshold for a minimally clinically important difference. These potential benefits should be weighed up against adverse events (likely to increase local oropharyngeal adverse effects and may increase the risk of pneumonia) and probably no reduction in mortality. Though not recommended as monotherapy, the probable benefits of ICS highlighted in this review support their continued consideration in combination with long-acting bronchodilators. Future research and evidence syntheses should be focused in that area.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^6affc873]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included (but was not limited to) hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Summary

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low" and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

Committee discussion

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. In addition, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of medications available for maintenance therapy. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, and therefore the panel believed that a recommendation in favor of maintenance oral steroid use would be problematic given the concerns surrounding patient safety. The panel also believed that well-informed patients would place a greater value on avoiding the potential harms of adverse events and less value on the uncertain benefits of decreased dyspnea and hospital admissions.

After considering these issues and the low certainty of the evidence, the panel concluded that in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations, the balance of benefits of maintenance oral steroid therapy did not outweigh the risks when compared with no steroid use. Given that the panel recommended against the intervention, issues related to feasibility, acceptability, and health equity were not discussed.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^19419130]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

Additional well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes, conducted in real-life situations, could provide the needed robust evidence to determine whether the benefits of maintenance oral steroid therapy might outweigh its harms. In the meantime, the use of maintenance oral steroid therapy in COPD treatment could be considered by clinicians and well-informed patients, underscoring the need for shared decision-making.

Question 6: In Patients with COPD Who Experience Advanced Refractory Dyspnea despite Otherwise Optimal Therapy, Is Opioid-based Therapy More Effective than and as Safe as No Additional Therapy?

Recommendation

In individuals with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy, we suggest that opioid-based therapy be considered for dyspnea management within a personalized shared decision-making approach (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking emergency department visits, dyspnea, exacerbations, health-related QOL, falls/accidents, overdose, and exercise capacity as critical outcomes.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 576 citations in MEDLINE (n = 267), Embase (n = 193), and the Cochrane Library (n = 116), with deduplication resulting in n = 370 warranting abstract screening. The majority (96.2%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, and this resulted in screeners identifying 14 studies for final review inclusion. All of the 14 identified studies were RCTs, and 13 of these studies used a crossover design. Each RCT had a relatively small sample size and the total sample size for the 14 studies was 366 participants. There were 184 participants in the treatment/intervention arms (opioid-based treatment) across the trials (50.2%) and 182 (49.7%) in the control (comparator) arms. The majority of the 14 studies were single-center studies.

Exacerbations

One study (n = 30) assessed exacerbation risk. The study revealed no significant difference in exacerbations between the opioid and nonopioid groups (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.74–2.55; P = 0.31). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 190 more exacerbations per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 130 fewer to 775 more).

### A proposal for the withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in the clinical practice of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2759c8a3]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

According to the current clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to long-acting β 2 agonist therapy is recommended in patients with moderate-to-severe disease and an increased risk of exacerbations. However, ICS are largely overprescribed in clinical practice, and most patients are unlikely to benefit from long-term ICS therapy. Evidence from recent randomized-controlled trials supports the hypothesis that ICS can be safely and effectively discontinued in patients with stable COPD and in whom ICS therapy may not be indicated, without detrimental effects on lung function, health status, or risk of exacerbations. This article summarizes the evidence supporting the discontinuation of ICS therapy, and proposes an algorithm for the implementation of ICS withdrawal in patients with COPD in clinical practice. Given the increased risk of potentially serious adverse effects and complications with ICS therapy (including pneumonia), the use of ICS should be limited to the minority of patients in whom the treatment effects outweigh the risks.

### Effects of corticosteroids on lung function in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^db3c7a16]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Both oral and inhaled corticosteroids have clinically significant effects on symptoms, exacerbations, health status, and lung function in asthma, and to a lesser extent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Change in FEV(1) does not correlate well with functional tests in COPD and may not be the best measure of response to treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial when added to a beta-agonist for treatment of acute asthma, and the efficacy of oral corticosteroids in this setting is well established. Oral corticosteroids inconsistently improve lung function in stable outpatients with COPD. Individual inhaled corticosteroids do not have a marked effect, but the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol and the combination of budesonide plus formoterol seem to improve FEV(1) over treatment with the individual components. In addition, there is convincing evidence for the use of systemic corticosteroids during acute exacerbations of COPD. Some evidence suggests that patients with COPD who respond to corticosteroids have eosinophilic inflammation and other attributes of an asthma phenotype.

Managing the presenting problem. Is it a COPD exacerbation?

A COPD exacerbation is defined as 'an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variation and leads to change in medications'. The worsening symptoms are usually increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence. All these symptoms are present in our patient who experiences an exacerbation triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection — the most common cause of COPD exacerbations. Apart from the management of the acute exacerbation that could include antibiotics, oral steroids and increased use of short-acting bronchodilators, special attention should be given to his on-going treatment to prevent future exacerbations. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids and a course of antibiotics can shorten recovery time, improve lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1)) and arterial hypoxaemia and reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure and length of hospital stay. Short-acting inhaled β 2 -agonists with or without short-acting anti-muscarinics are usually the preferred bronchodilators for the treatment of an acute exacerbation.

Reviewing his routine treatment

One of the concerns about this patient is that his COPD is inadequately treated. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) suggests that COPD management be based on a combined assessment of symptoms, GOLD classification of airflow limitation, and exacerbation rate. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scoreor the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT)could be used to evaluate the symptoms/health status. History suggests that his breathlessness has begun to interfere with his lifestyle, but this has not been formally asssessed since the diagnosis 6 years ago. Therefore, one would like to be certain that these elements are taken into consideration in future management by involving other members of the health care team. The fact that he had two to three exacerbations per year puts the patient into GOLD category C–D (see Figure 1) despite the moderate airflow limitation. Our patient is only being treated with short-acting bronchodilators; however, this is only appropriate for patients who belong to category A. Treatment options for patients in category C or D should include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) or long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs), which will not only improve his symptoms but also help prevent future exacerbations. Used in combination with LABA or LAMA, inhaled corticosteroids also contribute to preventing exacerbations.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^3719d046]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are an important therapy for severe asthma and COPD exacerbations, and their use is recommended for patients who do not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy (Table 2). Interestingly, although corticosteroids are recommended for both diseases, their benefit in COPD exacerbations seems to be driven by a subpopulation with high T2 inflammation and elevated eosinophil counts, drawing interest in using eosinophil levels to guide steroid administration among patients who are not critically ill.–

Strong evidence supports corticosteroids for asthma and COPD exacerbations treated in the acute care setting. – Few studies have evaluated corticosteroids in adult patients who are critically ill with asthma exacerbations, particularly those necessitating mechanical ventilation. For COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation (either noninvasive ventilation [NIV] or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), one study found that corticosteroids were associated with a reduction in duration of IMV and rate of NIV failure, whereas another study found no difference in outcomes.

Among patients managed in acute care settings, the recommended regimen is prednisone 1 mg/kg/d up to 50 mg/d or equivalent for 5 to 7 days for asthma and prednisone 40 mg/d for 5 days for COPD based on studies showing shorter courses (5–7 days vs 10–14 days) resulted in similar rates of treatment failure and relapse with reduced risk of pneumonia and death.– Of the few studies conducted in patients who are critically ill, most used higher doses. However, very high doses (ie, methylprednisolone > 240 mg/d) have been associated with increased treatment failure, duration of IMV, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse events, including hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy and fungal infections. Currently evidence to suggest routine use of higher corticosteroid doses is limited, and we recommend prednisone 40 to 50 mg/d for at least 5 days with consideration of higher doses in patients with life-threatening disease or those not responding to initial therapy.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^15d20ad4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort on the part of a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations: 1) a strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance; 2) a conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year; 3) a conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year; 4) no recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom ICS is conditionally recommended as an additive therapy; 5) a conditional recommendation against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations; and 6) a conditional recommendation for opioid-based therapy in patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy. Conclusions: The task force made recommendations regarding the pharmacologic treatment of COPD based on currently available evidence. Additional research in populations that are underrepresented in clinical trials is needed, including studies in patients with COPD 80 years of age and older, those with multiple chronic health conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma.

### Dapagliflozin for prednisone-induced hyperglycaemia in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^9efcaf82]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is complicated by hyperglycaemia in 53% to 82% of patients without pre‐existing diabetes, and in 96% to 100% of patients with pre‐existing diabetes. 1 Hyperglycaemia during AECOPD is associated with longer hospitalization and higher mortality rates. 2

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently need systemic glucocorticoid therapy for AECOPD. Treatment with 30 to 40 mg prednisone for 5 to 14 days limits the duration and severity of an exacerbation. 3

As a side effect, prednisone increases endogenous glucose production and induces insulin resistance. 4 These phenomena result in a specific pattern of postprandial hyperglycaemia starting ~3 hours after administration and continuing for 24 to 36 hours. 1

Treatment of hyperglycaemia attributable to prednisone can be challenging because of severe insulin resistance. Current practice is insulin therapy, often administered in a sliding‐scale regimen. 5 However, high doses and frequent adjustments are required and, despite intensive treatment, glycaemic control is often inadequate. 6 Furthermore, duration of hospital stay for AECOPD is usually shorter than duration of prednisone therapy, so patients often finish their prednisone course at home. 3 Intensive insulin regimens may be difficult to execute outside the hospital, especially for insulin‐naïve patients.

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral agents that block renal glucose reabsorption, leading to urinary glucose excretion and thereby to a reduction in blood glucose concentration. 7 Their mechanism of action is independent of β‐cell function and different from agents improving insulin sensitivity. SGLT2 inhibitors therefore have a complementary effect to routine diabetes medication in patients with pre‐existing diabetes. 8 The low risk of hypoglycaemia and rapid onset of action (maximum plasma concentration achieved within 1–2 hours after oral administration) make SGLT2 inhibitors an attractive option for treatment of prednisone‐induced hyperglycaemia during AECOPD. 9

The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of add‐on treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily with placebo in patients with prednisone‐induced hyperglycaemia during treatment for AECOPD.

### Randomised, controlled trial of N-acetylcysteine for treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3bd377c2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 3 months or more is associated with a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This raises the question of whether treatment with NAC during an acute exacerbation will hasten recovery from the exacerbation.

Methods

We have examined this in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Subjects, admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD, were randomised within 24 h of admission to treatment with NAC 600 mg b.d. (n = 25) or matching placebo (n = 25). Treatment continued for 7 days or until discharge (whichever occurred first). To be eligible subjects had to be ≥ 50 years, have an FEV1 ≤ 60% predicted, FEV1/VC ≤ 70% and ≥ 10 pack year smoking history. Subjects with asthma, heart failure, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases were excluded. All subjects received concurrent treatment with prednisone 40 mg/day, nebulised salbutamol 5 mg q.i.d and where appropriate antibiotics. FEV1, VC, SaO2 and breathlessness were measured 2 hours after a dose of nebulised salbutamol, at the same time each day. Breathlessness was measured on a seven point Likert scale.

Results

At baseline FEV1 (% predicted) was 22% in the NAC group and 24% in the control group. There was no difference between the groups in the rate of change of FEV1, VC, SaO2 or breathlessness. Nor did the groups differ in the median length of stay in hospital (6 days for both groups).

Conclusions

Addition of NAC to treatment with corticosteroids and bronchodilators does not modify the outcome in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Evidence suggesting that oral corticosteroids increase mortality in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^74e41997]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 1964, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined as a disease condition characterized by not reversible airflow limitation. Since then, oral corticosteroids have often been used to control COPD. In the 1980s, administration of 7.5 − 15 mg/day of long-term oral corticosteroids (LTOC) therapy was proved to improve the prognosis of patients with chronic airflow obstruction, a disease concept that partly overlaps with bronchial asthma and COPD. A meta − analysis in 1991 revealed that oral corticosteroids improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) in stable COPD patients. Various studies have repeatedly confirmed the favorable outcomes of therapy with systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbation of COPD. Guidelines published in 1995 thus indicated that LTOC may have beneficial effects for stable COPD patients.

However, other studies indicated that LTOC is potentially harmful for stable COPD patients because muscle strength and pulmonary function deteriorate after high dose of systemic corticosteroids, and because corticosteroids cause comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Furthermore, two prospective studies with a small number of patients reported that treatment of stable COPD patients with oral corticosteroids was not efficacious: in one study, two weeks of treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily did not improve pulmonary symptoms or function; in the other, a combination of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids for two years was not more effective than inhaled corticosteroids alone. The current guidelines do not recommend LTOC for stable COPD patients. In summary, many studies do not support the use of LTOC for stable COPD patients, but no study has clearly demonstrated a relationship between LTOC and life prognosis.

It is difficult to estimate how many patients worldwide is currently taking oral corticosteroids. But data from recently published randomized trial suggest that a considerable portion of patients with COPD is still taking oral corticosteroids. According to a report of the Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium trial published in 2008, 8.4% of 5992 stable COPD cases took oral corticosteroids.

Given this background, it was not feasible to undertake a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the influence of LTOC on the life prognosis of stable COPD patients. Such a potentially harmful study is not ethically allowed. Even if feasible, evaluation of life prognosis demands the observation of a large number of patients for many years. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the life prognosis of patients treated with LTOC using the propensity score matching method.

### Outpatient oral prednisone after emergency treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^b44949ff]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we studied the effectiveness of prednisone in reducing the risk of relapse after outpatient exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

We enrolled 147 patients who were being discharged from the emergency department after an exacerbation of COPD and randomly assigned them to 10 days of treatment with 40 mg of oral prednisone once daily or identical-appearing placebo. All patients received oral antibiotics for 10 days, plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary end point was relapse, defined as an unscheduled visit to a physician's office or a return to the emergency department because of worsening dyspnea, within 30 days after randomization.

Results

The overall rate of relapse at 30 days was lower in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (27 percent vs. 43 percent, P = 0.05), and the time to relapse was prolonged in those taking prednisone (P = 0.04). After 10 days of therapy, patients in the prednisone group had greater improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second than did patients in the placebo group (mean [± SD] increase from base line, 34 ± 42 percent vs. 15 ± 31 percent; P = 0.007). Patients in the prednisone group also had significant improvements in dyspnea, as measured by the transitional dyspnea index (P = 0.04) and by the dyspnea domain of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Index Questionnaire (P = 0.02), but not in health-related quality of life (P = 0.14).

Conclusions

Outpatient treatment with oral prednisone offers a small advantage over placebo in treating patients who are discharged from the emergency department with an exacerbation of COPD.

### Outcomes associated with corticosteroid dosage in critically ill patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^887c3b6a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Studies evaluating corticosteroid (CS) dosing for patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) have largely excluded patients admitted directly to the intensive care unit (ICU), and none have evaluated the effect of CS dosing regimens on mortality.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and safety of lower- versus high-dose CS in patients admitted to the ICU with an AECOPD.

Methods

This pharmacoepidemiologic cohort study evaluated ICU patients with AECOPD admitted to one of 473 hospitals and treated with CS within the first 2 days between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2008. Patients were grouped into lower-dose (methylprednisolone, ≤ 240 mg/d) or high-dose (methylprednisolone, > 240 mg/d) groups based on CS dosage on hospital Day 1 or 2. The primary outcome was hospital mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 17,239 patients were included; 6,156 (36%) were in the lower-dose and 11,083 (64%) in the high-dose CS group. After propensity score matching and adjustment for unbalanced covariates, lower-dose CS was not associated with a significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–1.01; P = 0.06), but it was associated with reduced hospital (-0.44 d; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.21; P < 0.01) and ICU (-0.31 d; 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.16; P < 0.01) length-of-stay, hospital costs (-$2,559; 95% CI, -$4,508 to -$609; P = 0.01), length of invasive ventilation (-0.29 d; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.06; P = 0.01), need for insulin therapy (22.7% vs. 25.1%; P < 0.01), and fungal infections (3.3% vs. 4.4%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Two-thirds of patients admitted to the ICU with an AECOPD are treated with high doses of CS that are associated with worse outcomes and more frequent adverse effects. Lower dosage strategies should be encouraged for patients admitted to the ICU and the optimum dose should be determined through clinical trials.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^86085062]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways (largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke), punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and especially during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Efficacy and safety of different doses of systemic corticosteroids in COPD exacerbation [^1d875b23]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although systemic corticosteroids (SCS) have long been used to treat patients with COPD exacerbation, the recommended dose remains controversial. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis and an indirect treatment comparison to investigate the efficacy and safety of different doses of SCS in subjects with COPD exacerbation.

Methods

Studies were identified by searching different databases for randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of SCS with placebo in subjects with exacerbation of COPD. The different doses of SCS were assigned to low-dose (ie, initial dose ≤ 40 mg prednisone equivalent/d [PE/d]), medium-dose (initial dose = 40–100 mg PE/d, and high-dose (initial dose > 100 mg PE/d) groups. The indirect treatment comparison was performed between low-, medium-, and high-dose SCS groups.

Results

Twelve trials with 1,375 participates were included. Compared to placebo, the risk of treatment failure was lower in the low-dose SCS groups (risk ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.43–0.88], P = 0.007) and high-dose SCS groups (risk ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.48–0.85], P = 0.002); the FEV 1 was significantly improved in low-dose (mean difference 0.09 [95% CI 0.06–0.12], P < .001), medium-dose (mean difference 0.23 [95% CI 0.02–0.44], P = 0.036), and high-dose SCS groups (mean difference 0.09, [95% CI 0.03–0.15], P < .001, respectively). Regarding safety, the incidence of hyperglycemia was higher in high-dose SCS groups versus placebo (risk ratio 2.52 [95% CI 1.13–5.62], P = 0.02). The indirect comparison between low-, medium-, and high-dose SCS found that the risk of treatment failure and changes in FEV 1 were similar between these doses of SCS.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis indicates that low-dose SCS (initial dose ≤ 40 mg PE/d) was sufficient and safer for treating subjects with COPD exacerbation, and it was noninferior to higher doses of SCS (initial dose > 40 mg PE/d) in improving FEV 1 and reducing the risk of treatment failure. However, our findings need to be verified in head-to-head randomized controlled trials.

### Appropriate use of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD: the candidates for safe withdrawal [^c739bd32]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

International guidance on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management recommends the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in those patients at increased likelihood of exacerbation. In spite of this guidance, ICS are prescribed in a large number of patients who are unlikely to benefit. Given the evidence of the risks associated with ICS and the limited indications for their use, there is interest in understanding the effects of withdrawing ICS when prescribed inappropriately. In this review, we discuss the findings of large ICS withdrawal trials, with primary focus on the more recent trials using active comparators. Data from these trials indicate that ICS may be withdrawn without adverse impact on exacerbation risk and patient-reported outcomes in patients with moderate COPD and no history of frequent exacerbations. Considering the safety concerns associated with ICS use, these medications should be withdrawn in patients for whom they are not recommended, while maintaining adequate bronchodilator therapy.

### Eosinophil-guided corticosteroid therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COPD exacerbation (CORTICO-COP): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^0905abdf]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

Treatment with systemic corticosteroids in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with debilitating adverse effects. Therefore, strategies to reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure are urgently required and might be offered by a personalised biomarker-guided approach to treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether an algorithm based on blood eosinophil counts could safely reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure in patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial at the respiratory departments of three different university-affiliated hospitals in Denmark. Eligible participants were patients included within 24h of admission to the participating sites, aged at least 40 years, with known airflow limitation (defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio ≤ 0.70) and a specialist-verified diagnosis of COPD, who were designated to start on systemic corticosteroids by the respiratory medicine physician on duty. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either eosinophil-guided therapy or standard therapy with systemic corticosteroids. Both investigators and patients were aware of the group assignment. All patients received 80 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on the first day. The eosinophil-guided group were from the second day given 37.5 mg of prednisolone oral tablet daily (for a maximum of up to 4 days) on days when their blood eosinophil count was at least 0.3 × 10⁹ cells per L. On days when the eosinophil count was lower, prednisolone was not administered. If a patient was discharged during the treatment period, a treatment based on the last measured eosinophil count was prescribed for the remaining days within the 5-day period (last observation carried forward). The control group received 37.5 mg of prednisolone tablets daily from the second day for 4 days. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment, assessed by intention to treat (ITT). Secondary outcomes included treatment failure at day 30 (ie, recurrence of acute exacerbation of COPD resulting in emergency room visits, admission to hospital, or need to intensify pharmacological treatment), number of deaths on day 30, and duration of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The non-inferiority margin was 1.2 days (SD 3.8). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02857842, and was completed in January, 2019.

Findings

Between Aug 3, 2016, and Sept 30, 2018, 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 159 patients in the control group were included in the ITT analyses. There was no between-group difference for days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment: mean 8.9 days (95% CI 8.3–9.6) in the eosinophil-guided group versus 9.3 days (8.7–9.9) in the control group (absolute difference -0.4, 95% CI -1.3 to 0.5; p = 0.34). Treatment failure at 30 days occurred in 42 (26%) of 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 41 (26%) of 159 in the control group (difference 0.6%, 95% CI -9.0 to 10.3; p = 0.90). At 30 days nine patients (6%) of 159 in the eosinophil-guided group and six (4%) of 159 in the control group had died (difference 1.9%, 95% CI -2.8 to 6.5; p = 0.43). Median duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy was lower in the eosinophil-guided group: 2 days (IQR 1.0 to 3.0) compared with 5 days (5.0 to 5.0) in the control group, p < 0.0001.

Interpretation

Eosinophil-guided therapy was non-inferior compared with standard care for the number of days alive and out of hospital, and reduced the duration of systemic corticosteroid exposure, although we could not entirely exclude harm on some secondary outcome measures. Larger studies will help to determine the full safety profile of this strategy and its role in the management of COPD exacerbations.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD — general considerations — indicate limited steroid responsiveness and uncertain long-term safety: "In vitro evidence suggests that COPD-associated inflammation has limited responsiveness to corticosteroids. Moreover, some drugs including beta2-agonists, theophylline or macrolides may partially facilitate corticosteroid sensitivity in COPD. The clinical relevance of this effect has not yet been fully established". In vivo data "suggest that the dose-response relationships and long-term (> 3 years) safety of ICS in people with COPD are unclear and require further investigation". Additionally, "both current and ex-smokers with COPD benefit from ICS use in terms of lung function and exacerbation rates, although the magnitude of the effect is lower in heavy or current smokers compared to light or ex-smokers".

Recommendation

In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, we suggest the use of triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA rather than dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, ICU admissions, dyspnea, and health-related QOL as critical outcomes.

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with zero to less than one exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 1,482 citations in MEDLINE (n = 668), Embase (n = 768), and the Cochrane Library (n = 46), with deduplication resulting in n = 1,102 warranting screening. An additional two studies were identified through other means. The majority (99.5%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, and this resulted in screeners identifying four studies for final review inclusion. The four identified studies were multicenter RCTs (,–). The total sample size for the four RCTs was 9,313 participants; 5,700 (61.2%) of these participants were in the treatment/intervention arms and 3,613 (38.8%) were in the control (comparator) arms. Three of the four studies enrolled patients with a history of one or more exacerbations per year. In one study, patients were not required to have had an exacerbation in the past year.

Short-acting muscarinic antagonist vs short-acting β2-agonist monotherapy — lung function and steroid escalation outcomes: Based on available data, comparing treatment with short-acting β2-agonist monotherapy with ipratropium alone for 1 to 3 months resulted in no significant improvement in postbronchodilator FEV1, with a small benefit in prebronchodilator FEV1 of borderline statistical significance; there was a small increase in prebronchodilator FVC and a postbronchodilator increase in FVC area under the curve over 8 h that approached statistical significance. There was no study evaluating exacerbation as a primary end point; four studies including 1,218 patients with a serious risk of bias and overall moderate quality of evidence examined the need to add or increase systemic oral corticosteroids as a surrogate marker for exacerbations.

Future studies should focus on testing our results and investigating the possible causes of the increased all-cause mortality that is associated with long courses of OCS. Additionally, randomised trials should test strategies for safely administering OCS at the lowest possible accumulated dosage to achieve the documented positive short-term effects of OCS in COPD exacerbations without increasing the risk of serious long-term consequences. This could include blood eosinophils at presentation. So far, no data are available with regards to the minimal necessary OCS dose in an outpatient treatment setting. The development of several biological inhibitors of inﬂammatory mediators in COPD for targeting the cytokine/chemokine-mediated inﬂammation in COPD have provided little or no evidence of therapeutic effectiveness with regards to clinical outcomes in COPD.
