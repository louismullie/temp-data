## Question

Respiratory alkalosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about respiratory alkalosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining respiratory alkalosis and confirming diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and expected compensations. Next, I will categorize etiologies and map them to clinical contexts. After that, I need to check systemic effects and special populations. Then, I should review diagnostic pitfalls and bedside tools. Finally, I will outline management principles, including when to treat versus observe, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic criteria. Respiratory alkalosis is a primary decrease in arterial PaCO2 below about 35 mmHg due to increased alveolar ventilation, with a resulting rise in pH; I initially thought "pH > 7.45", but wait, I should verify that this is not too rigid because the pH may be near-normal if renal compensation has already occurred, so the defining feature is the primary hypocapnia rather than pH alone.

> I will now examine the pathophysiology and expected compensation. The primary event is hyperventilation lowering PaCO2, which reduces carbonic acid and raises pH; the kidneys respond by decreasing bicarbonate reabsorption and net acid excretion, with plasma bicarbonate typically falling by about 0.2–0.5 mEq/L for each 1 mmHg decrease in PaCO2 depending on chronicity, so I should double-check that range and remember it widens with chronicity; in panic disorder, I recall an exaggerated bicarbonate drop around 0.41 mEq/L per 1 mmHg PaCO2 decrease, which aligns with increased lactic acid generation during hyperventilation, so I should keep that nuance in mind [^114KJ8K4] [^114fxxzb].

> Next, I should review etiologies systematically. Pulmonary causes include hypoxemia from pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, interstitial lung disease, and early ARDS, where hyperventilation precedes infiltrates; I need to ensure I don't miss early ARDS because the acid-base clue can precede imaging changes, so a low threshold for repeat imaging is prudent [^113BovGh] [^116Xzn1K]. Cardiovascular causes include heart failure and pulmonary edema, where dyspnea drives hyperventilation; central causes include stroke, encephalitis, anxiety/panic, and central neurogenic hyperventilation from pontine lesions; metabolic and endocrine triggers include sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, hyperthyroidism, and pregnancy; toxicologic causes include salicylate poisoning with early respiratory alkalosis; and iatrogenic causes include excessive mechanical ventilation and high respiratory rates on the ventilator, so I should confirm ventilator settings whenever I see unexplained hypocapnia [^113BovGh] [^111h69U9] [^112WZBgF] [^116xFh2U] [^112CcEuE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronicity without checking the clinical context. Acute respiratory alkalosis often reflects anxiety, pain, fever, early sepsis, or acute hypoxemia, whereas chronic respiratory alkalosis is typical of pregnancy, chronic liver disease, and chronic hyperventilation syndromes; I should confirm that compensated chronic respiratory alkalosis can present with low bicarbonate and near-normal pH, which can be mistaken for metabolic acidosis if I rely on bicarbonate alone [^113BovGh] [^112WZBgF] [^1116ZUbJ].

> I need to ensure I consider systemic effects that change management. Hypocapnic alkalosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve leftward, reducing tissue oxygen delivery despite normal saturation; it can precipitate hypophosphatemia with neuromuscular consequences including weakness and even rhabdomyolysis; it may provoke arrhythmias and chest pain; and in the lungs, hypocapnia can impair alveolar fluid reabsorption and worsen V/Q mismatch, so I should actively look for phosphate, potassium, and magnesium disturbances when symptoms are disproportionate [^116TjeRb] [^113si6N1] [^112kYxSe]. But wait, what if the patient has lactic alkalosis from hyperventilation without tissue hypoxia; I should verify that mild hyperlactatemia in this setting correlates with pH and PaCO2 and is not necessarily a red flag for shock, which avoids overtreatment [^116TjeRb].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, progesterone increases ventilatory drive, producing a compensated chronic respiratory alkalosis with lower PaCO2 and reduced SID; I should confirm that CSF acid-base adaptations also occur, so ventilatory control is different and hyperventilation is expected physiologically rather than pathologic [^112WZBgF] [^113NL5z5]. In infants with pyloric stenosis, metabolic alkalosis from vomiting lowers respiratory drive and can precipitate apnea; I need to check that correcting volume, chloride, and potassium before anesthesia reduces perioperative apnea risk, which is why timing of surgery is tied to metabolic stabilization [^116UG57B]. In COPD, post-hypercapnic metabolic alkalosis blunts ventilatory drive and delays weaning; I should double-check whether acetazolamide helps, but hold on, I must verify patient selection because acetazolamide can worsen acidosis in uncompensated hypercapnia, so it should be reserved for selected, stable patients with persistent metabolic alkalosis complicating ventilatory weaning [^1114DUYo] [^117SBCfW].

> Next, I should review diagnostic pitfalls and bedside tools. Chronic respiratory alkalosis can masquerade as metabolic acidosis because bicarbonate is low; I should confirm with an ABG showing low PaCO2 and appropriately low bicarbonate, and if an ABG is not immediately available, a positive urine anion gap with urine pH above 5.5 supports renal compensation for chronic respiratory alkalosis rather than a primary metabolic acidosis, which helps me avoid inappropriate alkali therapy [^1116ZUbJ] [^116E1xMj]. I need to check for mixed disorders by comparing measured compensation to expected rules; for example, if bicarbonate is too low for the degree of hypocapnia, a concurrent metabolic acidosis may be present, whereas an inappropriately normal or high bicarbonate suggests a mixed metabolic alkalosis, so I should verify using standard compensation tables or Stewart-based analysis when needed [^114KJ8K4] [^112uL7vt].

> I will now examine management principles. The cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause: relieve hypoxemia, manage sepsis, correct anxiety with reassurance or anxiolysis, reverse toxic ingestions, adjust ventilator settings to avoid iatrogenic hyperventilation, and address CNS lesions; I should confirm that most mild cases do not require direct correction of alkalosis and that overcorrection risks rebound acidosis or worsening oxygen delivery [^111gRCV3]. For severe symptomatic alkalemia, consider controlled hypoventilation if ventilated, or in select cases rebreathing techniques under supervision; I need to ensure electrolytes, especially phosphate, potassium, and magnesium, are repleted because deficits amplify symptoms and arrhythmias, and I should avoid routine bicarbonate because it can generate CO2 and worsen intracellular acidosis in some contexts [^113si6N1] [^115yXbBJ].

> Wait, let me verify the role of acetazolamide. In mechanically ventilated patients with persistent metabolic alkalosis complicating weaning, acetazolamide can lower bicarbonate and pH and may shorten ventilation duration, but the evidence quality is low and patient selection matters; I should avoid acetazolamide in acute hypercapnic decompensation or uncompensated respiratory acidosis because it can worsen acidosis and precipitate deterioration, so I must confirm the acid-base phenotype before prescribing it [^115A2Wzy] [^117SBCfW]. Hold on, I should also acknowledge that meta-analytic signals of benefit exist but are fragile and may be overestimated; trial sequential analysis suggests uncertainty, so shared decision-making and close monitoring are prudent if I proceed [^115A2Wzy] [^113j47TS].

> Let me reconsider the prognostic implications. In general, respiratory alkalosis is a marker of underlying disease severity rather than a direct killer, but severe alkalemia can reduce oxygen delivery and precipitate arrhythmias; in specific contexts like status epilepticus, metabolic alkalosis — rather than respiratory alkalosis — has been linked to worse outcomes, so I should be careful not to conflate these signals and should focus on correcting the precipitating physiology and electrolytes rather than chasing pH normalization alone [^111gRCV3] [^1136z69F].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the diagnosis with an ABG demonstrating primary hypocapnia, classify acute versus chronic, and search for the cause guided by the etiologic categories; I should screen for systemic effects, especially phosphate and potassium disturbances; I should avoid mislabeling chronic respiratory alkalosis as metabolic acidosis by using urine anion gap and ABG patterns; and I should treat the underlying cause while reserving specific alkalosis-directed interventions for severe symptomatic cases or for persistent metabolic alkalosis complicating ventilatory weaning, with acetazolamide used cautiously and selectively [^113XiPyq] [^116E1xMj] [^1114DUYo].

Respiratory alkalosis is a primary decrease in PaCO2 due to increased alveolar ventilation, leading to **elevated pH and reduced HCO3−** [^116j1xp8]. The most common causes are anxiety, hypoxemia, sepsis, pregnancy, and iatrogenic hyperventilation [^113BovGh] [^112WZBgF]. Acute compensation lowers HCO3− by ~2 mEq/L for each 10 mmHg fall in PaCO2; chronic compensation further reduces HCO3− and stabilizes pH near normal [^114KJ8K4]. Symptoms include dizziness, paresthesia, and tetany; severe cases can cause seizures or arrhythmias [^116BVvhi] [^115XQaNN]. Management focuses on **identifying and treating the underlying cause**, with supportive care and, if needed, controlled CO2 rebreathing or sedation [^115XQaNN].

---

## Pathophysiology

Respiratory alkalosis arises when **hyperventilation increases CO2 excretion**, reducing PaCO2 and shifting the CO2/HCO3− equilibrium toward less H+ and more HCO3−, thereby raising pH [^116j1xp8]. Acute compensation occurs within minutes via intracellular and extracellular buffering, while chronic compensation over 2–3 days increases renal HCO3− excretion and H+ retention, partially normalizing pH [^notfound].

---

## Causes

Respiratory alkalosis has diverse causes; **common etiologies** include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Central nervous system stimulation | - Anxiety <br/> - Panic attacks <br/> - Pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Stroke <br/> - Meningitis <br/> - Encephalitis <br/> - Tumors [^113BovGh] [^1155TS6e] [^117SP11i] [^113si6N1] |
| Hypoxemia | - High altitude <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - Pulmonary embolism <br/> - Interstitial lung disease <br/> - Congestive heart failure [^113BovGh] |
| Metabolic and endocrine | - Pregnancy <br/> - Hyperthyroidism <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy [^112WZBgF] [^114uX2Qa] |
| Iatrogenic | - Mechanical ventilation <br/> - Prostaglandin infusion [^112CcEuE] |
| Medications | - Salicylates <br/> - Catecholamines <br/> - Progesterone [^116xFh2U] [^113si6N1] |

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms reflect increased neural excitability from alkalemia and reduced ionized calcium; **typical features** include:

- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- Paresthesia (perioral and distal extremities)
- Muscle cramps and tetany
- Palpitations and chest discomfort
- Anxiety and confusion
- Seizures and syncope (severe cases) [^116BVvhi]

---

## Laboratory findings

Key laboratory findings include:

- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: pH > 7.45, PaCO2 < 35 mmHg, HCO3− decreased (acute) or near-normal (chronic) [^116j1xp8].
- **Serum electrolytes**: Hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and reduced ionized calcium are common [^notfound].
- **Urine anion gap**: Useful to distinguish chronic respiratory alkalosis from metabolic acidosis when ABG is unavailable [^116E1xMj].

---

## Compensatory mechanisms

Acute compensation occurs within minutes via **intracellular and extracellular buffering**, reducing HCO3− by ~2 mEq/L per 10 mmHg fall in PaCO2 [^114KJ8K4]. Chronic compensation develops over 2–3 days via **renal bicarbonate excretion and hydrogen retention**, further lowering HCO3− and partially normalizing pH [^114KJ8K4].

---

## Complications

Severe or prolonged respiratory alkalosis can cause **significant complications**:

- **Neurological**: Seizures, syncope, and altered mental status [^116BVvhi].
- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias, reduced cardiac output, and ischemia [^115XQaNN].
- **Metabolic**: Hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and reduced tissue oxygen delivery [^113si6N1].

---

## Management

Management centers on **identifying and treating the underlying cause**, with supportive care for symptoms:

- **Identify and treat underlying cause**: Address hypoxemia, anxiety, sepsis, or medication effects [^113BovGh].
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, controlled CO2 rebreathing, and sedation for severe anxiety or hyperventilation [^notfound].
- **Monitor and correct electrolyte imbalances**: Especially potassium and phosphate [^115XQaNN].

---

Respiratory alkalosis is a primary decrease in PaCO2 from hyperventilation, causing alkalemia; **management focuses on the cause** and supportive care to prevent complications [^116j1xp8].

### Evaluation and treatment of respiratory alkalosis [^111gRCV3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is the most frequent acid-base disturbance encountered in clinical practice. This is particularly true in critically ill patients, for whom the degree of hypocapnia directly correlates with adverse outcomes. Although this acid-base disturbance often is considered benign, evidence suggests that the alkalemia of primary hypocapnia can cause clinically significant decreases in tissue oxygen delivery. Mild respiratory alkalosis often serves as a marker of an underlying disease and may not require therapeutic intervention. In contrast, severe respiratory alkalosis should be approached with a sense of urgency and be aggressively corrected.

### Respiratory acidosis and respiratory alkalosis: core curriculum 2023 [^116j1xp8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The respiratory system plays an integral part in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. Normal ventilation participates in the maintenance of an open buffer system, allowing for excretion of CO 2 produced from the interaction of nonvolatile acids and bicarbonate. Quantitatively of much greater importance is the excretion of CO 2 derived from volatile acids produced from the complete oxidation of fat and carbohydrate. A primary increase in CO 2 tension of body fluids is the cause of respiratory acidosis and develops most commonly from one or more of the following: (1) disorders affecting gas exchange across the pulmonary capillary, (2) disorders of the chest wall and the respiratory muscles, and/or (3) inhibition of the medullary respiratory center. Respiratory alkalosis or primary hypocapnia is most commonly caused by disorders that increase alveolar ventilation and is defined by an arterial partial pressure of CO 2 < 35 mm Hg with subsequent alkalization of body fluids. Both disorders can lead to life-threatening complications, making it of paramount importance for the clinician to have a thorough understanding of the cause and treatment of these acid-base disturbances.

### Respiratory alkalosis [^115XQaNN]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is an extremely common and complicated problem affecting virtually every organ system in the body. This article reviews the various facets of this interesting problem. Respiratory alkalosis produces multiple metabolic abnormalities, from changes in potassium, phosphate, and calcium, to the development of a mild lactic acidosis. Renal handling of the above ions is also affected. The etiologies may be related to pulmonary or extrapulmonary disorders. Hyperventilation syndrome is a common etiology of respiratory alkalosis in the emergency department setting and is a diagnosis by exclusion. There are many cardiac effects of respiratory alkalosis, such as tachycardia, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, and ischemic and nonischemic chest pain. In the lungs, vasodilation occurs, and in the gastrointestinal system there are changes in perfusion, motility, and electrolyte handling. Therapeutically, respiratory alkalosis is used for treatment of elevated intracranial pressure. Correction of a respiratory alkalosis is best performed by correcting the underlying etiology.

### Acid base disorders in cirrhosis [^114uX2Qa]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders are common in individuals with liver disease and cirrhosis. The most common disorder is respiratory alkalosis, which may be related to dyspnea or respiratory stimulation. Primary metabolic disorders are less common. Although the liver plays a role in metabolism of amino acids and generation of acid from dietary sources, it does not play a role in the regulation of pH. Instead, metabolic disorders may arise from alterations in normal metabolism or from medications, particularly diuretics and osmotic laxatives, used in the treatment of these complex patients. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of these disorders can aid in the management of individuals with liver disease in the hospital and in outpatient settings.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112ep7UH]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present systematic review demonstrates that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are associated with favorable blood gas parameters in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis, but did not provide conclusive results for clinically important outcomes. Future well-designed and large randomized trials should investigate the effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors on these outcomes, particularly mortality, duration of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

Methods

The detailed methods are included in Additional file 1.

Eligibility criteria

RCTs were included if they recruited patients with respiratory failure and concurrent metabolic alkalosis (as defined by the individual trial), including patients on MV or NIPPV. In addition, the trial should have compared CAI to either placebo or usual care. All co-interventions should have been similar for the two comparison groups.

The primary outcomes of interest were duration of hospital stay, duration of MV or NIPPV, mortality, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the blood gases parameters PaCO 2, PO 2, HCO 3, and PH.

Search strategy

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to August 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Figures 1 to 4 in Additional file 2 detail the electronic search strategy. There were no language or date restrictions. We also screened the reference lists of included trials and identified related systematic reviews. The search strategy did not include attempts at collecting unpublished data.

Selection process

Teams of two review authors (BYT and CN, and HSI and MOO) screened independently and in duplicate the abstract and title of every record captured by the searches. We retrieved the full texts for all citations judged as potentially eligible by at least one reviewer.

The teams of two reviewers then assessed the full texts for eligibility using a standardized screening form.

A PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) flow-chart was used to summarize the results of the selection process (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
PRISMA study flowchart

Data extraction

We extracted information about the study design, the clinical characteristics of the trial (population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes), funding, and conflicts of interest of the authors.

Assessment of risk of bias

Risk of bias was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool. The following criteria were used: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants, providers, data collectors, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts (performance bias and detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias), and other biases (including early stopping for benefit).

Risk of bias criteria was judged as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Extreme alkalaemia with mixed alkalosis due to suspected acute-on-chronic respiratory alkalosis [^113irxvz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Herein we present a case of severe alkalaemia (pH 7.81) due to suspected acute-on-chronic respiratory alkalosis in a patient with chronic anxiety and metabolic alkalosis secondary to emesis. The patient was managed in the intensive care unit with significant improvement and discharged in stable condition. The case report emphasises considering a broad differential of aetiologies that can cause acid-base status derangements and identifying the appropriate therapeutic approach.

### Respiratory physiologic changes in pregnancy [^112WZBgF]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

In summary, the major physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy are the increased minute ventilation, which is caused by increased respiratory center sensitivity and drive; a compensated respiratory alkalosis; and a low expiratory reserve volume. The vital capacity and measures of forced expiration are well preserved. Patients who have many lung diseases tolerate pregnancy well, with the exception of those who have pulmonary hypertension or chronic respiratory insufficiency from parenchymal or neuromuscular disease.

### Postoperative exacerbated cough hypersensitivity syndrome induces dramatic respiratory alkalosis, lactatemia, and electrolyte imbalance [^115L1fYa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the reported case, sudden aggravation of the chronic cough was the primary cause of the severe hypocapnia, resulting in alkalosis and life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. Hyperventilation in the sense of psychiatric stress could not be objectified in the patient; she expressed herself in a differentiated manner throughout. Due to the pre-existing cough hypersensitivity syndrome and complication-free surgery, intubation seems to be the most likely trigger; an opioid-induced cough is also debatable. Hyperventilation is known to have a dramatic effect on the acid-base balance. Hypocapnia, primarily caused by coughing, accompanied by severe electrolyte and acid/base disturbances, has not been described in the literature to date. An interesting secondary finding was the persistence of lactatemia for more than 12 hours. In particular, type A lactic acidosis with underlying tissue hypoxia requires rapid diagnosis but could not be confirmed in this case. According to a meta-analysis, lactatemia is possible after inhalation therapy with the beta-2 agonist salbutamol in rare cases. Of note, psychogenic hyperventilation - which we do not assume in this case - is associated with increased lactate levels and an inverse correlation between pCO2 and lactate concentration in 30% of patients. While in septic or cardiogenic shock, the duration of lactic acidosis is an early predictor of mortality or multi-organ failure, the impact of lactatemia without acidosis is less well known. Lactatemia in the setting of psychogenic hyperventilation appears not to be associated with poor outcomes.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^114EkykH]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study reveals that approximately 50% of SE patients present with an acid–base disorder within the first 24 h of SE according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach.

About 35% of patients experienced respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis, likely directly related to respiratory disfunction and/or lactate production. The antiepileptic effect of acidosis is well established: neuronal excitability and seizure activity are strongly suppressed by a decrease in brain and blood pH, with some anticonvulsants, such as acetazolamide, acting reducing extracellular brain pH. However, the prognostic role of acidosis in critically ill patients remains debated. Some studies associate acidosis to higher mortality, while others find no relationship with outcome, or even a correlation to better prognosis. In our study, we did not find a clear association between acidosis and outcomes, but a larger sample size may be needed to detect small differences.

In the first 24 h of SE, 15% of patients showed alkalosis, split evenly between metabolic and respiratory causes. The pathogenesis of alkalosis in SE is less clear, and likely influenced by the overall pathophysiological context. Alkalosis, especially metabolic alkalosis, has been recognized as a common acid–base disturbance in critically ill patients, increasing with invasive therapies like mechanical ventilation, gastric aspiration, and intravenous infusions. In our cohort, we assessed pH only in the very first stage of SE and only a small percentage of patients experienced alkalosis, with no relationship to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive therapies, suggesting their non-primary role in this context.

An increase in pH is associated with the generation of spontaneous interictal spikes in animal models, potentially contributing to the interictal–ictal transition. In this context, hyperventilation-induced alkalosis has long been used to induce seizure activity/electroencephalogram abnormalities as an activation test.

### Lactic alkalosis in intensive care: a red flag? [^116TjeRb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Red dots show the 90th percentile of lactate measurement in each category. Panel B: Box plot of lactate measurement according to the category of alkalosis: metabolic (orange), or respiratory

An association between alkalosis and mild hyperlactatemia has been described before in numerous case reports of extreme alkalosis, of both respiratory and metabolic origin. Bersin et al. introduced the concept of "primary lactic alkalosis" in a study describing a small case series along with an experimental demonstration of the pH-induced hyperlactatemia in a swine model of metabolic alkalosis. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain its pathophysiology: First, alkalosis stimulates glycolysis by increasing the activity of phosphofructokinase, which is sensitive to both pH itself and to alkalosis-induced sympathetic hyperactivation; second, alkalosis-induced left shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve decreases oxygen tissue extraction, which may explain the decrease in oxygen consumption observed in the seminal study by Bersin. During exercise in man, experimental studies observed the same positive correlation between pH and lactate output, which was interpreted as a protective mechanism to regulate cellular acid production and protect muscle pH. In a cohort of patients with psychogenic respiratory alkalosis, hyperlactatemia was present in 30% of patients and was mainly correlated to pH and PaCo 2 without any relation to adverse events, suggesting that "lactic alkalosis" does not carry the same prognostic value as lactic acidosis. In a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients, alkalosis was not associated with increased mortality but was significantly associated with prolonged ICU stay, although lactate was not available, preventing the exploration of its prognosis value in this particular context.

Overall, very little is known about lactic alkalosis in intensive care, and our findings encourage us to explore further the relationship between alkalosis, lactate and outcome in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, it could be useful for the clinician to know that mild, isolated hyperlactatemia in a patient with alkalosis should be interpreted with caution and is not necessarily a "red flag" that should lead to inappropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Incentive spirometry: 2011 [^115qxUQH]. Respiratory Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Incentive spirometry — hazards and complications — include being ineffective unless performed as instructed, hyperventilation/respiratory alkalosis, hypoxemia secondary to interruption of prescribed oxygen therapy, fatigue, and pain.

### Diagnosis and management of severe respiratory acidosis: a 65-year-old man with a double-lung transplant and shortness of breath [^111vhnmU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in whole-body carbon dioxide stores caused by a positive carbon dioxide balance. This acid-base disorder, if severe, may be life-threatening, therefore requiring prompt recognition and expert management. The case presented highlights the essential features of the diagnosis and management of respiratory acidosis. A brief description of the modifiers of carbon dioxide production, the pathogenesis of respiratory acidosis, and an algorithm for assessment and management of this disorder is included. Key teaching points include the clinical value of both arterial and venous blood gas analyses and the importance of proper recognition of a primary respiratory arrest in contrast to primary circulatory arrest when managing a patient who requires resuscitation from "cardiorespiratory arrest".

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112QQpY2]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Although the results of the pooled analysis concerning mortality and duration of hospital stay are not conclusive, they suggest a possible decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation in the CAI group compared with placebo. This clinically important outcome should be confirmed in future larger randomized clinical trials.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis complicating respiratory failure with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a systematic review [^1114DUYo]. Thorax (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis may lead to respiratory inhibition and increased need for ventilatory support or prolongation of weaning from ventilation for patients with chronic respiratory disease. Acetazolamide can reduce alkalaemia and may reduce respiratory depression.

Methods

We searched Medline, EMBASE and CENTRAL from inception to March 2022 for randomised controlled trials comparing acetazolamide to placebo in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnoea, hospitalised with acute respiratory deterioration complicated by metabolic alkalosis. The primary outcome was mortality and we pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 (Risk of Bias 2) tool, heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 value and χ 2 test for heterogeneity. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodology.

Results

Four studies with 504 patients were included. 99% of included patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No trials recruited patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. 50% of trials recruited patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Risk of bias was overall low to some risk. There was no statistically significant difference with acetazolamide in mortality (relative risk 0.98 (95% CI 0.28 to 3.46); p = 0.95; 490 participants; three studies; GRADE low certainty) or duration of ventilatory support (mean difference -0.8days (95%CI -7.2 to 5.6); p = 0.36; 427 participants; two studies; GRADE: low certainty).

Conclusion

Acetazolamide may have little impact on respiratory failure with metabolic alkalosis in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. However, clinically significant benefits or harms are unable to be excluded, and larger trials are required.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^113V8awq]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several reports highlighted that the presence of metabolic alkalosis is associated with longer ICU stays and increased mortality in patients with various diseases. In our cohort, metabolic alkalosis at admission was a strong indicator of higher mortality, worse GOS, and a lower likelihood of returning to baseline even after correction for potential confounders.

Our findings were further validated using the Stewart approach, which, despite being more complex and less user-friendly for clinical practice, offers a more detailed and precise assessment of acid–base disorders, particularly in critical care settings. According to the Stewart method, predominant metabolic alkalosis was associated with all primary outcomes in univariate analysis and remained significantly linked to a reduced likelihood of good functional outcomes after binomial regression.

Metabolic alkalosis may directly contribute to poor outcomes or be an indicator of other adverse factors. Some studies suggest that metabolic alkalosis directly impacts outcomes by reducing respiratory input, inhibiting hemoglobin dissociation and causing electrolytes imbalance. We analyzed the number of patients with metabolic alkalosis according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach who normalized their pH levels within the subsequent 24 h: of 17 patients with available data, the normalization of pH had no clear impact on prognosis, but the extremely small sample size warrants caution in interpretation.

While alkalosis may contribute directly (e.g. through respiratory depression), other factors likely play a significant role in reducing the likelihood of good outcome for alkalosis patients in our cohort. We found a significant correlation between metabolic alkalosis, hypoalbuminemia, and lower serum potassium. The association between alkalosis and hypoalbuminemia is well established, as well as the bidirectional relationship among metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia.

Hypoalbuminemia is a well-known predictor of poor outcomes across various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and sepsis, and it might be considered as a reliable biomarker of overall patient's resources to survive SE. Similarly, low serum potassium has been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, including an increased risk of respiratory insufficiency, with a reduced capacity to wean from mechanical ventilation.

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115A2Wzy]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is common in patients with respiratory failure and may delay weaning in mechanically ventilated patients. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors block renal bicarbonate reabsorption, and thus reverse metabolic alkalosis. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the benefits and harms of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis.

Methods

We searched the following electronic sources from inception to August 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Randomized clinical trials were included if they assessed at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, duration of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, adverse events, and blood gas parameters. Teams of two review authors worked in an independent and duplicate manner to select eligible trials, extract data, and assess risk of bias of the included trials. We used meta-analysis to synthesize statistical data and then assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology.

Results

Six eligible studies were identified with a total of 564 participants. The synthesized data did not exclude a reduction or an increase in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.56) or in duration of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) 0.42 days, 95% CI −4.82 to 5.66) with the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy resulted in a decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation of 27 h (95% CI −50 to −4). Also, it resulted in an increase in PaO 2 (MD 11.37 mmHg, 95% CI 4.18 to 18.56) and a decrease in PaCO 2 (MD −4.98 mmHg, 95% CI −9.66, −0.3), serum bicarbonate (MD −5.03 meq/L, 95% CI −6.52 to −3.54), and pH (MD −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.01). There was an increased risk of adverse events in the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor group (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.99). Certainty of evidence was judged to be low for most outcomes.

Conclusion

In patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy may have favorable effects on blood gas parameters. In mechanically ventilated patients, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation. A major limitation of this finding was that only two trials assessed this clinically important outcome.

### Alkali therapy for respiratory acidosis: a medical controversy [^113iDKf1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Alkali therapy for certain organic acidoses remains a topic of ongoing controversy, but little attention has been given to a related medical controversy, namely the prescription of alkali for respiratory acidosis. We first describe the determinants of carbon dioxide retention in the 2 types of respiratory failure; hypercapnic respiratory failure and hypoxemic respiratory failure with coexisting hypercapnia. We then highlight the deleterious consequences of severe acidemia for several organ systems, particularly the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. We argue that alkali therapy is not indicated for respiratory acidosis as a simple acid-base disturbance. Notwithstanding, we recommend prescription of alkali for severe acidemia caused by mixed acidosis (ie, combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis) or permissive hypercapnia. We examine the utility of alkali therapy in various clinical scenarios incorporating respiratory acidosis. We conclude that controlled studies will be required to test the impact of alkali therapy on clinical outcomes of these clinical settings. Such studies should also examine the optimal mode of administering alkali (amount, rate, and tonicity) and the blood pH to be targeted. The development of new buffers should be explored, especially systems that do not generate carbon dioxide or even consume it.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^1153skbz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevated P 2

The compensatory alveolar hypoventilation in metabolic alkalosis leads to hypercapnia (elevated arterial carbon dioxide; Pa 2), which blunts the rise in arterial pH due to elevated HCO 3 − concentration. Although hypercapnia occurs gradually as a respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis, it enhances the HCO 3 − reabsorptive capacity of the kidney tubules and thus prevents HCO 3 − excretion. Hypercapnia together with vascular volume depletion, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and mineralocorticoid excess contribute to the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis.

Maintenance Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis in Volume-Expanded States

In conditions associated with the primary increase in circulating mineralocorticoids or glucocorticoids, the vascular volume is increased due to augmented salt absorption in the collecting duct (Fig 4B). The initiation of metabolic alkalosis in the aforementioned states is gradual and is primarily due to enhanced H + excretion in A-intercalated cells. This process is driven by increased luminal negative electrogenicity consequent to aldosterone-dependent Na + absorption via the apical sodium channel, ENaC (Fig 4B). A similar driving force enhances K + secretion into the lumen of the collecting duct, creating a state of K + wasting. The aldosterone-induced hypokalemia plays a critical role in the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis by increasing acid secretion and HCO 3 − absorption in several nephron segments as discussed previously (Fig 2B). Diseases such as primary aldosteronism and Cushing syndrome present with this abnormality, as does excess licorice ingestion. In conditions associated with primary stimulation of the RAAS (renal artery stenosis, renin-producing tumors, etc), increased angiotensin II levels intensify net acid excretion in the distal nephron, hence contributing to the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis.

Recovery Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis

The recovery phase occurs when the existing deficits (volume, Cl −, or K +) are corrected, and the continued losses (via kidney or GI tract) are halted. Agents that are responsible for the loss of acid (ie, loop diuretics, licorice, etc) or gain of alkali (oral bicarbonate or citrate) need to be discontinued.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^115h2Xfw]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is one of the four cardinal acid-base disorders and perhaps the least well understood by students. Taking a mechanistic approach to etiologies and management can be very helpful in such cases. Particularly, one should focus on the factors that generate the alkalosis (source of fluid loss and composition, less commonly alkali administration) and the factors (extracellular fluid volume status, hormonal systems) that maintain the abnormality.

### Hypocapnic but not metabolic alkalosis impairs alveolar fluid reabsorption [^112kYxSe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances, such as metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, are relatively common in critically ill patients. We examined the effects of alkalosis (hypocapnic or metabolic alkalosis) on alveolar fluid reabsorption in the isolated and continuously perfused rat lung model. We found that alveolar fluid reabsorption after 1 hour was impaired by low levels of CO2 partial pressure (PCO2; 10 and 20 mm Hg) independent of pH levels (7.7 or 7.4). In addition, PCO2 higher than 30 mm Hg or metabolic alkalosis did not have an effect on this process. The hypocapnia-mediated decrease of alveolar fluid reabsorption was associated with decreased Na, K-ATPase activity and protein abundance at the basolateral membranes of distal airspaces. The effect of low PCO2 on alveolar fluid reabsorption was reversible because clearance normalized after correcting the PCO2 back to normal levels. These data suggest that hypocapnic but not metabolic alkalosis impairs alveolar fluid reabsorption. Conceivably, correction of hypocapnic alkalosis in critically ill patients may contribute to the normalization of lung ability to clear edema.

### Acetazolamide: a second wind for a respiratory stimulant in the intensive care unit? [^117BVmiY]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are affected by episodes of respiratory exacerbations, some of which can be severe and may necessitate respiratory support. Prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality rates. Persistent failure to discontinue invasive mechanical ventilation is a major issue in patients with COPD. Pure or mixed metabolic alkalosis is a common finding in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with a worse outcome. In patients with COPD, the condition is called post-hypercapnic alkalosis and is a complication of mechanical ventilation. Reversal of metabolic alkalosis may facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation of patients with COPD. Acetazolamide, a non-specific carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is one of the drugs employed in the ICU to reverse metabolic alkalosis. The drug is relatively safe, undesirable effects being rare. The compartmentalization of the different isoforms of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme may, in part, explain the lack of evidence of the efficacy of acetazolamide as a respiratory stimulant. Recent findings suggest that the usually employed doses of acetazolamide in the ICU may be insufficient to significantly improve respiratory parameters in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD. Randomized controlled trials using adequate doses of acetazolamide are required to address this issue.

### Postoperative exacerbated cough hypersensitivity syndrome induces dramatic respiratory alkalosis, lactatemia, and electrolyte imbalance [^115pcLTt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The perioperative management of patients with chronic cough or cough hypersensitivity syndrome and its sometimes severe effects is currently under-researched and under-reported.

Case Presentation

A 46-year-old female patient with a history of chronic cough and Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome. After laparoscopic hiatoplasty and anterior fundoplication under general anesthesia, experienced a pronounced exacerbation of coughing symptoms. Despite prompt and extensive treatment involving antitussives, inhalants, anxiolytics, and sedatives, the symptoms remained uncontrollable. Within a few hours, the patient developed a respiratory alkalosis with severe and life-threatening electrolyte shift (pH 7.705, pCO2 1.72 kPa, K+ 2.1 mmol/l). Lactatemia lasted for more than 12 hours with values up to 6.6 mmol/l. Acute bleeding, pneumothorax, and an acute cardiac event were ruled out. Deep analgosedation and inhalation of high-percentage local anesthetics were necessary to manage the clinical symptoms.

Conclusions

This case highlights the challenging nature of chronic cough and hypersensitivity syndrome perioperatively. A tailored anesthesiologic approach, exclusion of other provoking medical problems, and knowledge of possible management and treatment options are key.

### Acid-base patterns in acute severe asthma [^117G4Bhy]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acid-base status in acute severe asthma (ASA) remains undefined; some studies report complete absence of metabolic acidosis, whereas others describe it as present in one fourth of patients or more. Conclusion discrepancies would therefore appear to derive from differences in assessment methodology. Only a systematic approach centering on patient clinical findings can correctly establish true acid-base disorder prevalence levels.

Methods

This study examines acid-base patterns in ASA (314 patients), taking into account both natural history of disease and treatment, in patients free of other diseases altering acid-base status. Data were collected from patients admitted for ASA without prior history of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, kidney or liver disease, heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or gastrointestinal illness. Informed consent was obtained for all patients, after study protocol approval by the Institutional Review Board.

Results

Arterial blood gases, plasma electrolytes, lactate levels, and FEV(1) were measured on arrival. Severe airway obstruction was found with FEV(1) values of 25.6 ± 10.0%, substantial hypoxemia (PaO(2) 66.1 ± 11.9mmHg) and increased A-a O(2) gradient (39.3 ± 12.3mmHg) breathing room air. While respiratory alkalosis occurred in patients with better preservation of FEV1, respiratory acidosis was observed with more severe airway obstruction, as was increased lactate in the majority of patients, independent of PaO(2) and PaCO(2) levels.

Conclusions

Predominant acid-base patterns observed in ASA in this patient population included primary hypocapnia, or less frequently, primary hypercapnia. Lactic acidosis occurred in 11% of patients and presented consistently as a mixed acid-base disorder. These findings suggest lactic acidosis results from the combined effects of both ASA and medication-related sympathetic effects.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^1143EY3w]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Of the 55 (15%) SE patients with a pH > 7.45, respiratory alkalosis was found in 26 (7%) patients (in-hospital mortality: 10%; GOS 1–3 at discharge: 50%; no-return to baseline neurologic function at discharge: 61%), metabolic alkalosis in 23 (6%) patients (in-hospital mortality: 22%; GOS 1–3 at discharge: 52%; no-return to baseline neurologic function at discharge: 69%), and mixt alkalosis in 6 (2%) (in-hospital mortality: 0%; GOS 1–3 at discharge: 33%; no return to baseline neurologic function at discharge: 67%).

At univariate analysis, a normal pH value was associated to reduced in-hospital mortality (P = 0.020), while respiratory alkalosis was associated with GOS 1–3 at discharge (P = 0.030). Notably, the presence of metabolic alkalosis was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (P = 0.034), GOS 1–3 at discharge (P = 0.023), and reduced chance to return to baseline premorbid neurologic function at discharge (P = 0.010). Table 2 shows univariate analysis assessing the relationship between acid–base categories and primary outcomes.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116Xzn1K]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the clinical manifestation of severe, acute lung injury. It is characterized by the acute onset of diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates secondary to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, refractory hypoxia, and decreased lung compliance. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs most frequently in the setting of sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, trauma, or multiple transfusions. Its complex pathophysiology involves an inciting local or systemic event that initiates pulmonary endothelial and epithelial damage and subsequent increased permeability. Tachypnea, hypoxia, and respiratory alkalosis are typical early clinical manifestations, and they are usually followed by the appearance of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure within 48 hours. Early identification and treatment of the underlying disorder, along with aggressive supportive care, are essential. Experimental therapies, including those using nitric oxide and surfactant, have not been shown to improve mortality in patients with ARDS, but new therapeutic approaches such as low-volume ventilation have been shown to decrease mortality. Many patients who survive ARDS have permanent, mild to moderate impairment of lung function. Quality of life after hospitalization with ARDS may be poorer than that in similar patients without ARDS.

### Distinctive acid-base pattern in Wernicke's encephalopathy [^11441Y4q]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Wernicke's encephalopathy may result in severe morbidity and possible mortality when unrecognized. We report a distinctive acid-base pattern that has not been associated with this syndrome. This is a case series of patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy who had an arterial blood gas measurement performed on initial presentation. Exclusion criteria were patients with an unclear diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy and those for whom no arterial blood gas measurement was performed. Four patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy were included in the analysis. All 4 patients exhibited an anion-gap (primary) metabolic acidosis, accompanied by a primary respiratory alkalosis. Three of 4 patients exhibited a significant lactic acidosis. None of the patients had any competing diagnoses or dysfunction to account for this acid-base pattern. Patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy may exhibit a distinctive acid-base pattern consisting of a primary metabolic acidosis in conjunction with a primary respiratory alkalosis. Observation of this acid-base disturbance should prompt clinicians to consider thiamine deficiency disorders as a possible cause.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1133nt6p]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

### Cerebrospinal fluid and arterial acid-base equilibria in spontaneously breathing third-trimester pregnant women [^115QCppE]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- It is unclear whether hypocapnic alkalosis in full-term pregnant women is primary or secondary to changes in CSF electrolytes.
- Simultaneously collected CSF and arterial blood samples from third-trimester pregnant women and healthy non-pregnant women of childbearing age undergoing spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery or elective surgery were analysed.
- Hypocapnic alkalosis was more common in the pregnant (65%) than the control (8%) group.
- The primary hypocapnic alkalosis that characterises pregnancy, likely because of progesterone, leads to a compensatory reduction in strong ion difference (metabolic acidosis) more pronounced in plasma than in CSF.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear fluid produced by the choroid plexus, the acid–base regulation of which is of paramount importance in the control of spontaneous breathing. According to Stewart's physico-chemical approach, only two variables regulate the acid–base equilibrium in this extracellular compartment: the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P 2) and the difference between strong cation and anion concentrations (strong ion difference [SID]). A third independent variable that must also be considered in evaluating the acid–base status of blood is the weak non-volatile acids (A TOT).

By the first 7 weeks of gestation, resting spontaneously breathing pregnant women increase their minute ventilation, progressively developing hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis. Several studies have addressed the possible roles of progesterone and arginine–vasopressin (AVP) in ventilatory regulation in pregnancy. For instance, progesterone acts on central chemoreceptors, increasing minute ventilation independently from CSF pH, and acts on peripheral chemoreceptors, inducing a hypoxic respiratory response at higher partial pressure of oxygen (P 2). Additionally, AVP induces water reabsorption, decreasing osmolality and SID of extracellular fluids. The reduction in SID and plasma osmolality is associated with increased minute ventilation in humans, particularly during pregnancy. Although multiple mechanisms have been hypothesised and tested, the relative contributions of different mechanisms underlying this physiological respiratory response have not been addressed. Moreover, previous studies rarely relied on human blood and CSF sampled simultaneously.

The aims of the present study were to (i) describe, applying the physico-chemical approach to acid–base status, the characteristics of CSF and arterial plasma in resting spontaneously breathing third-trimester pregnant women; (ii) compare these results with healthy non-pregnant women of childbearing age; and (iii) discuss the physiological adaptations to hypocapnic alkalosis (HA) in pregnancy.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for acute respiratory acidosis [^115yXbBJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Respiratory acidosis is commonly present in patients with respiratory failure. The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial.

Recent Findings

There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained.

Summary

There is a lack of clinical evidence that administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114aNowL]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In summary, we did not find definitive results for the effects of CAI therapy on clinically important outcomes such as mortality and duration of hospital stay in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis. The results suggest that CAI therapy may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation. There was a trend towards increased incidence of adverse events in the CAI group; however, most of these adverse events were mild.

On the other hand, the results suggest that CAI therapy has favorable effects on arterial blood gas parameters (PaCO 2, PaO 2, bicarbonate and pH), with decreased PaCO 2, increased PaO 2, and, as expected, decreased bicarbonate and pH levels.

The main strength of the current review is the use of rigorous systematic review methods. Also, inclusion criteria were restricted to well-designed RCTs with an overall low risk of bias.

The limitations of the current systematic review relate to those of the included studies, mainly their limited number. In addition, some of the included studies did not report all the data required to include them in the meta-analyses. For example, Nelson and Wallace did not provide SDs, and Faisy et al. reported medians and IQRs but not means and SDs. Furthermore, most trials used acetazolamide, and most patients had COPD, and thus our results may not be applicable to CAIs other than acetazolamide and in respiratory conditions other than COPD.

A previously published systematic review focusing on patients with COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure included four trials with 84 participants. That study reported that acetazolamide therapy significantly decreased pH and serum bicarbonate and significantly increased PaO 2, and led to a small decrease in PaCO 2. The study reported those results as not statistically significant. We have excluded two of the trials included in that review (Skatrud and Dempsey and Wagenaar et al.) because they did not meet our eligibility criteria. Skatrud and Dempsey reported outcomes exclusively in patients deemed as "correctors" to acetazolamide, and in Wagenaar et al. the arms comparing acetazolamide with placebo were not randomized. Furthermore, none of the trials included in that previous review assessed clinically important outcomes. The present review included six trials with a total of 564 participants, and it provides higher certainty evidence for the favorable effects of CAI therapy on blood gases parameters. In addition, two trials included in our review assessed clinically important outcomes.

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114yWJqc]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is common in patients with respiratory failure. There is evidence that increased pH level in the cerebrospinal fluid may depress respiratory drive and may delay weaning in patients with respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) (such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, and dichlorphenamide) block renal bicarbonate reabsorption, and thus reverse metabolic alkalosis. However, uncertainty remains about their effects in the setting of respiratory failure with concurrent metabolic alkalosis on duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (MV), or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and mortality.

A Cochrane systematic review on the use of CAI for hypercapnic ventilatory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) identified four eligible trials. The review found that acetazolamide therapy resulted in a significant improvement in PO 2 and a nonsignificant decrease in PaCO 2. However, the included studies had a limited number of participants (84 patients), had short-term follow-ups, did not assess clinically important outcomes such as duration of hospitalization and mortality, and none included patients on NIPPV or MV.

Since the publication of the Cochrane review in 2001, several trials have been published. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), acetazolamide therapy in 382 patients with COPD and metabolic alkalosis on mechanical ventilation resulted in a 16-h decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation compared with placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) −36.5 to 4.0 h; p = 0.17). A smaller trial with 22 patients with COPD with respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, and on NIPPV, found that acetazolamide therapy significantly reduced the duration of NIPPV compared with a matched control group (6 ± 8 versus 19 ± 19 days; p = 0.03).

Given the current uncertainty about the benefits and harms of using CAI in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis, it would be informative for clinical practice to synthesize and critically appraise the current body of evidence.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of carbonic CAI therapy in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis.

### Injurious mechanical ventilation in the normal lung causes a progressive pathologic change in dynamic alveolar mechanics [^112urY1a]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Critique of the model

Respiratory rate, inspratory:expiratory ratio, and carbon dioxide

Numerous factors have been implicated in the development of VILI. For example, it has been shown that alterations in the respiratory rate and the inspiratory:expiratory ratio can impact VILI. For this reason, we employed a protocol that standardized the respiratory rate and inspiratory:expiratory ratio between the groups (respiratory rate, 20/min; inspiratory:expiratory ratio, 1:2). Additionally, it has been shown that hypercapnic acidosis protects against VILI and that, conversely, hypocapnic alkalosis can injure isolated rabbit lungs. There was no significant difference in the pH or partial pressure of carbon dioxide values between the groups at the end of the protocol (Table 1). The development of alveolar instability, as well as gross and histologic changes, is therefore reflective of the differences in ventilatory pressures and volumes, not of the acid–base status.

Question: What is the impact of RRT on lung function?

Consensus statements

RRT applied for diuretic-resistant fluid overload may improve pulmonary function.
There is little evidence that RRT, using current methods, directly leads to lung injury.
The pathophysiological mechanisms of the potential association between RRT and lung function comprise haemodynamic, inflammatory, electrolyte-mediated, and acid–base effects.

Rationale

RRT is usually initiated to compensate for complications of AKI. This includes fluid overload in patients with diuretic resistance, repeatedly described as a major risk factor for adverse outcome. Early correction of fluid accumulation may be important to reduce further damage to the injured lung. However, earlier initiation of RRT in patients with severe AKI and ARDS has not been shown to improve outcome.

Data on the direct effects of RRT on the lung are sparse and mostly from patients with ESRD receiving IHD. Alternating episodes of volume depletion and overload, and leukocyte activation resulting from IHD, have been identified as triggers for deterioration of lung function. Few studies have compared the impact of different RRT modalities on respiratory function in AKI patients, having found no significant difference between modalities (peritoneal dialysis vs. IHD and IHD and SLED).

Rapid correction of acid–base balance during intermittent haemodialysis may also impact the lungs and should be avoided when commencing RRT. When RRT is delivered to COPD patients with metabolic compensation, it may cause eventual "iatrogenic" acidosis, which increases the respiratory drive and may overstretch the lungs through air trapping. This effect has been poorly studied and the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate is a possible solution. Alternatively, CO 2 removal through the haemofilter could be an option, but has shown to be successful only in in vitro models.

Recommendation for practice

We suggest, that during RRT in patients with COPD with metabolic compensation, the correction of compensatory metabolic alkalosis should be as slow as tolerated, to avoid development of acidosis (Grade 2D).

Recommendations for research

Future work should aim to determine if there is any impact of current RRT practices [continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), slow extended dialysis (SLED) and intermittent haemodialysis (IHD)] on lung function and determine which approach to acute RRT is most beneficial for the lung.
The application of different reinfusion/dialysate solutions should be evaluated in patients with hypercapnia (COPD or permissive hypercapnia).
Further research on CO 2 removal techniques should be undertaken as an ancillary measure in hypercapnic patients receiving RRT.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^114KJ8K4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^117NaEuu]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective cohort study covering nearly a decade, it may have been affected by changes in the management of SE patients over time. In addition, we did not account for pre-hospital management, which could have influenced pH levels in the early stages of SE or at hospital admission. Furthermore, we were unable to evaluate long-term outcomes due to a lack of data. Another limitation is the variability in the timing of pH assessments relative to SE onset and hospital admission, which our data do not capture. However, BGA are routinely performed during the initial assessment after hospital admission, and for patients with multiple ABG assessments, only the first one was considered.

Finally, while it is known that respiratory-induced alkalosis might facilitate seizure occurrence and respiratory-induced acidosis might elevate the seizure threshold promoting seizure cessation, our study did not directly focus on SE duration in relation to pH. However, no pH categories were related to SE duration in our study, and the association between metabolic alkalosis and outcomes remained significant after adjusting for several confounders, including SE duration. This makes it very unlikely that the observed association between metabolic alkalosis and outcomes is based on SE duration.

### Cerebrospinal fluid and arterial acid-base equilibria in spontaneously breathing third-trimester pregnant women [^113NL5z5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acid-base status in full-term pregnant women is characterised by hypocapnic alkalosis. Whether this respiratory alkalosis is primary or consequent to changes in CSF electrolytes is not clear.

Methods

We enrolled third-trimester pregnant women (pregnant group) and healthy, non-pregnant women of childbearing age (controls) undergoing spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery and elective surgery, respectively. Electrolytes, strong ion difference (SID), partial pressure of carbon dioxide ([Formula: see text]), and pH were measured in simultaneously collected CSF and arterial blood samples.

Results

All pregnant women (20) were hypocapnic, whilst only four (30%) of the controls (13) had an arterial [Formula: see text] < 4.7 kPa (P < 0.001). The incidence of hypocapnic alkalosis was higher in the pregnant group (65% vs 8%; P = 0.001). The CSF-to-plasma Pco 2 difference was significantly higher in pregnant women (1.5 [0.3] vs 1.0 [0.4] kPa; P < 0.001), mainly because of a decrease in arterial Pco 2 (3.9 [0.3] vs 4.9 [0.5] kPa; P < 0.001). Similarly, the CSF-to-plasma difference in SID was less negative in pregnant women (-7.8 [1.4] vs -11.4 [2.3] mM; P < 0.001), mainly because of a decreased arterial SID (31.5 [1.2] vs 36.1 [1.9] mM; P < 0.001). The major determinant of the reduced plasma SID of pregnant women was a relative increase in plasma chloride compared with sodium.

Conclusions

Primary hypocapnic alkalosis characterises third-trimester pregnant women leading to chronic acid-base adaptations of CSF and plasma. The compensatory SID reduction, mainly sustained by an increase in chloride concentration, is more pronounced in plasma than in CSF, as the decrease in Pco 2 is more marked in this compartment.

### Trial sequential analysis suggested the potential overestimated effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor for respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis [^113j47TS]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) used to be considered as the optimum evidence to guide clinical practices. Generally, a high-quality meta-analysis with conclusive information should meet the minimum requirements of a well-conducted RCT, which includes prospective protocol development, limitation of bias, and adequate sample size. Conversely, meta-analyses based on limited RCTs may trigger the potential overestimation of the authentic intervention effect owing to weak statistical power. More interestingly, increasing studies indicated that pooled results with false positive were frequently existed in published meta-analyses including many Cochrane ones.

Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was introduced to monitor potential random error, false positive, and false negative in meta-analyses of RCTs. Moreover, it was recommended that TSA should be performed to assess the "imprecision" of outcomes of interest in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A recent meta-analysis indicated that carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) may have a positive effect on respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis. Considering that limited trials with small information size included in the study, we assumed that the effect of CAI for respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis may be overestimated. Subsequently, we performed TSA for one of outcomes (i.e. PaCO 2) with the most included RCTs to estimate whether the evidence is enough reliable and credible. TSA in Fig. 1 showed that the cumulative Z -curve did not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit and the required information size boundary, which suggested that the current evidence (the positive effect of CAI on PaCO 2) was inconclusive. In addition, TSA on PaCO 2 showed that the required information size (347 patients) is not reached due to weak statistical power. So, the effects of CAI therapy for patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis may very likely be overrated.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^1136z69F]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus (SE) is a heterogeneous neurological emergency with significant variability in prognosis, influenced by underlying disease and pathophysiological context. Acid-base disturbances are common in critically ill patients, yet their distribution and impact in SE patients remain poorly understood.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study including non-hypoxic SE patients with available blood gas analysis within the first 24 h of SE, treated at the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland between 2015 and 2023. Acid-base disturbances were classified using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, with prevalent metabolic alkalosis confirmed through the Stewart approach. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and return to premorbid neurologic function.

Findings

Among 540 SE patients, 365 were included. Half of patients exhibited acid-base disturbances within the initial 24 h of SE, with metabolic and respiratory acidosis being the most prevalent, though not prognostically significant. After correction for possible confounders, metabolic alkalosis (6%) was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (P = 0.011; OR = 4.87, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), worse GOS (P = 0.012; OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), and reduced likelihood of returning to premorbid function (P = 0.017; OR = 3.30, CI95% = 1.24–8.80). Following the Stewart approach, 9% of patients had predominant metabolic alkalosis, associated with worse GOS (P = 0.005; OR:3.37, 95%CI = 1.45–7.82), and reduced chance of returning to baseline (P = 0.012; OR = 3.29, CI95% = 1.30–8.32). Metabolic alkalosis was related to hypoalbuminemia and lower serum potassium.

Conclusion

Metabolic alkalosis strongly predicts mortality and adverse functional outcome in SE patients. Prospective studies should assess whether early detection and correction of metabolic alkalosis and related electrolyte imbalances can improve SE prognosis.

### Acetaminophen for analgesia following pyloromyotomy: does the route of administration make a difference? [^112uFn4Q]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The practice of anesthesiology involves choosing appropriate analgesic medications for a specific surgical patient population. The physiologic variability that exists among patients, including differences in gestational and chronological age, end-organ function, cardiopulmonary status, volume of distribution, and metabolic maturation, can affect drug pharmaco-dynamics and pharmacokinetics. Therefore, analgesic agents must be chosen judiciously, taking into account the patient's unique physiology. Opioids remain the primary analgesic regimen for perioperative pain. However, this class of analgesics is associated with dose-dependent adverse effects which may impact postoperative outcomes especially in neonates and infants. Alternative non-opioid analgesic agents exist, which may offer advantages to opioid monotherapy. The main theoretical advantage is the prevention of opioid side effects including constipation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia.

Opioid-related hypoventilation and apnea are of particular concern following anesthesia in neonates and infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for hypertrophic PS. Hypertrophic PS leads to projectile vomiting and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Cerebrospinal fluid alkalosis may persist even after the correction of systemic metabolic alkalosis and pH normalization. Cerebrospinal fluid pH is one of the determinants of respiratory stimulus.–This metabolic milieu along with hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis), dehydration, use of neuromuscular blocking agents, the administration of inhalational anesthetic agents, and opioids during the anesthetic procedure can increase the risk of central apnea. The risk of central apnea is increased furthermore in premature infants who constitute approximately 12% of this population. Neonates are especially sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids related to the immaturity of the central respiratory control centers. Thus, an opioid-sparing technique is often advocated for these patients during pyloromyotomy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an important class of non-opioid analgesics which have been used for the treatment of pain for more than a century. Aspirin was introduced into the market by Bayer in 1899. The primary mechanism by which NSAIDs exert their effects is via inhibition of the arachidonic acid–cyclooxygenase pathways. This leads to a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis both peripherally at the site of injury and centrally in the spinal cord, decreasing inflammatory mediators and pain. IV ketorolac and IV ibuprofen are the two parenteral NSAIDs that are approved for use in the United States. However, given their adverse effect profile, it may be prudent to limit their use in the neonatal and infant population.

### Acetazolamide causes worsening acidosis in uncompensated COPD exacerbations: increased awareness needed for patient safety [^117SBCfW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetazolamide has been studied extensively in post-hypercapnic alkalosis as a tool to facilitate ventilator weaning in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has also been utilized to facilitate respiratory drive in nonmechanically ventilated patients with COPD. Although this is generally a forgiving intervention, providers must carefully select patients for this medication, as it can cause severe acidosis and deterioration of clinical status in severe COPD cases. The present report describes two cases of patients who developed worsening acidosis and hypercapnia after receiving acetazolamide in acute respiratory failure.

Case Report

Case 1 was a 72-year-old obese male with COPD who was dependent on supplemental oxygen and presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. He was given a one-time dose of acetazolamide in the ED for "respiratory failure made worse by severe metabolic alkalosis". His arterial blood gas (ABG) worsened overnight, accompanied by decreased mental status: pH 7.32, paCO 2 82 mm Hg, paO 2 50 mm Hg, HCO 3 41.7 mmol/L, FiO 2 32% to pH 7.21, paCO 2 91.7 mm Hg, paO 2 59 mm Hg, HCO 3 36.6 mmol/L, and FiO 2 32%. Case 2 was a 62-year-old male with COPD who was dependent on supplemental oxygen and presented to the ED with acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. He was given acetazolamide in the ED with similar results: ABG on presentation pH 7.37, paCO 2 79.3 mm Hg, paO 2 77.6 mm Hg, HCO 3 45.5 mmol/L, and FiO 2 32%. The next morning, ABG was pH 7.29, paCO 2 79 mm Hg, paO 2 77 mm Hg, HCO 3 45.5 mmol/L, and FiO 2 32%. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Acetazolamide given early in the uncompensated setting can worsen acidosis and potentiate clinical deterioration.

The CSF-to-plasma P 2 difference was significantly higher in pregnant women (1.5 [0.3] vs 1.0 [0.4] kPa; P < 0.001), mainly because of a decrease in arterial P 2 (3.9 [0.3] vs 4.9 [0.5] kPa; P < 0.001). Similarly, the CSF-to-plasma difference in SID was less negative in pregnant women (–7.8 [1.4] vs –11.4 [2.3] mM; P < 0.001), mainly because of a decreased arterial SID (31.5 [1.2] vs 36.1 [1.9] mM; P < 0.001).

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Inflammation emerges as a sensitizer of a heat-responsive cation channel [^113VY2bY]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

The Impact of Inflammation on Thermal Hyperpnea: Relevance for Heat Stress and Febrile Seizures.

Barrett KT, Roy A, Ebdalla A, Pittman QJ, Wilson RJA, Scantlebury MH. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2024 Aug;71(2):195–206. doi: PMID: 38597725; PMCID: PMC11299082.

Extreme heat caused by climate change is increasing the transmission of infectious diseases, resulting in a sharp rise in heat-related illness and mortality. Understanding the mechanistic link between heat, inflammation, and disease is thus important for public health. Thermal hyperpnea, and consequent respiratory alkalosis, is crucial in febrile seizures and convulsions induced by heat stress in humans. Here, we address what causes thermal hyperpnea in neonates and how it is affected by inflammation. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), a heat-activated channel, is sensitized by inflammation and modulates breathing and thus may play a key role. To investigate whether inflammatory sensitization of TRPV1 modifies neonatal ventilatory responses to heat stress, leading to respiratory alkalosis and an increased susceptibility to hyperthermic seizures, we treated neonatal rats with bacterial LPS, and breathing, arterial pH, in vitro vagus nerve activity, and seizure susceptibility were assessed during heat stress in the presence or absence of a TRPV1 antagonist (AMG-9810) or shRNA-mediated TRPV1 suppression. LPS-induced inflammatory preconditioning lowered the threshold temperature and latency of hyperthermic seizures. This was accompanied by increased tidal volume, minute ventilation, expired CO 2, and arterial pH (alkalosis). LPS exposure also elevated vagal spiking and intracellular calcium concentrations in response to hyperthermia. TRPV1 inhibition with AMG-9810 or shRNA reduced the LPS-induced susceptibility to hyperthermic seizures and altered the breathing pattern too fast shallow breaths (tachypnea), making each breathless efficient and restoring arterial pH. These results indicate that inflammation exacerbates thermal hyperpnea-induced respiratory alkalosis associated with increased susceptibility to hyperthermic seizures, primarily mediated by TRPV1 localized to vagus neurons.

### Acetazolamide-mediated decrease in strong ion difference accounts for the correction of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^112uL7vt]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic alkalosis is a common acid–base disturbance in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is associated with increased ICU mortality and morbidity, with adverse effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic function. Additionally, such patients are characterized by compensatory alveolar hypoventilation, which can result in delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Options for treatment aimed at correcting metabolic alkalosis are fluid and potassium replacement, and administration of ammonium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or acetazolamide. These therapeutic interventions potentially increase minute ventilation, allowing patients to be weaned more rapidly.

An advanced understanding of acid–base physiology is central to the practice of critical care medicine. Although it is not difficult to quantify the degree of metabolic alkalosis, it is more challenging to identify the cause of a metabolic alkalosis and determine the actions that must be taken to correct it. The method of quantifying and qualifying an acid–base disturbance, as described by Stewart, relies on the accepted physicochemical principles of conservation of mass and electroneutrality. According to Stewart, three variables independently determine the serum hydrogen concentration. These variables are the partial carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2), the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acids (primarily serum proteins and phosphate), and the strong ion difference (SID). The Stewart approach, in contrast to other approaches, allows us to quantify an acid–base derangement as well as determine its cause.

### Approach to metabolic alkalosis [^115uKjaC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a common disorder, accounting for half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients. It is the result of an increase in bicarbonate production, a decrease in bicarbonate excretion, or a loss of hydrogen ions. Most causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into 4 categories: chloride depletion alkalosis, mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, and excess alkali administration. Treatment is usually supportive and based on cause of the alkalosis.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111s7rzo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 3:

A 28-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis has been followed up in the adult outpatient clinic for the past 12 years. Last year she was admitted to the hospital with severe weakness and lethargy after an episode of upset stomach associated with nausea and loss of appetite. There was no vomiting or diarrhea. Her vital signs on admission showed a blood pressure of 90/55 mm Hg and pulse rate of 90 beats/min. Blood chemical analysis showed Na +, 134 mEq/L; K +, 2.4 mEq/L; HCO 3 −, 35 mEq/L; Cl −, 88 mEq/L; SUN, 38 mg/dL; and Scr, 1.4 mg/dL. She is not on any diuretics. VBG indicated a pH of 7.48 and P 2 of 48 mm Hg. Urine electrolyte profile showed Na +, 35 mEq/L; Cl −, 30 mEq/L; and K +, 28 mEq/L.

Question 6:

The generation of metabolic alkalosis, volume depletion, and renal Cl − loss in this patient could be best explained by:

Severe volume depletion due to the excessive loss of Na + and Cl − in sweat
Kidney salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte replacement solutions
Posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis after the treatment for respiratory acidosis
The inability to conserve Cl − in the kidney during volume depletion

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

Chloride-Responsive Alkalosis

The treatment of metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction (urine Cl − < 20 mmol/L) targets the factors that maintain the alkalotic state: decreased GFR due to volume depletion, Cl − deficiency, and hypokalemia. Administration of Cl − -based intravenous fluids expands intravascular volume, restores GFR, and disrupts the avid reabsorption of Na +, K +, HCO 3 −, Cl −, and water, as well as facilitating HCO 3 − excretion. Rising urinary Cl − indicates adequate volume expansion. Repletion of K + to address hypokalemia decreases ammoniagenesis and the generation of new HCO 3 − as well as reducing the absorption of HCO 3 −. Restoring K + reestablishes pendrin expression and activity, thereby enhancing the secretion of HCO 3 −. Altogether, this treatment with Cl − -based intravenous fluid and K + repletion corrects multiple pathogenic factors that maintain volume-depleted metabolic alkalosis.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^113EMCNL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we should be cautiously enthusiastic. Modifying pH by removing chloride and manipulating the strong ion difference will not treat the underlying cause of the acid–base disorder any more than lowering P 2 or administering sodium bicarbonate does, unless of course the primary derangement is hyperchloremia, elevated P 2, or hyponatremia. Although acidosis with hyperchloremia is quite common in critical illness, preventing hyperchloremia by using the physicochemical approach to guide the choice and composition of fluids is perhaps a simpler and wiser alternative. Furthermore, hyperventilation, sodium bicarbonate administration, and chloride electrodialysis do not directly treat elevated lactate levels, the most common cause of acidosis in critical illness. However, Zanella and colleagues make no such claims. They simply use the physicochemical approach to elegantly show that increasing the strong ion difference restores pH to normal levels. It's conceivable that the same result could be more easily obtained by conventional dialysis, where the dialysate solutions are engineered to target a given strong ion difference. Either way, the manipulation of strong ion difference to achieve specific therapeutic effects is slowly gaining traction, and similar approaches have recently been shown to enhance respiratory support. Whatever the future holds for these therapies, it behooves us to start teaching the physicochemical approach to our medical students and junior colleagues sooner rather than later.

### The injurious effects of elevated or nonelevated respiratory rate during mechanical ventilation [^112CcEuE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Respiratory rate is one of the key variables that is set and monitored during mechanical ventilation. As part of increasing efforts to optimize mechanical ventilation, it is prudent to expand understanding of the potential harmful effects of not only volume and pressures but also respiratory rate. The mechanisms by which respiratory rate may become injurious during mechanical ventilation can be distinguished in two broad categories. In the first, well-recognized category, concerning both controlled and assisted ventilation, the respiratory rate per se may promote ventilator-induced lung injury, dynamic hyperinflation, ineffective efforts, and respiratory alkalosis. It may also be misinterpreted as distress delaying the weaning process. In the second category, which concerns only assisted ventilation, the respiratory rate may induce injury in a less apparent way by remaining relatively quiescent while being challenged by chemical feedback. By responding minimally to chemical feedback, respiratory rate leaves the control of almost exclusively to inspiratory effort. In such cases, when assist is high, weak inspiratory efforts promote ineffective triggering, periodic breathing, and diaphragmatic atrophy. Conversely, when assist is low, diaphragmatic efforts are intense and increase the risk for respiratory distress, asynchronies, ventilator-induced lung injury, diaphragmatic injury, and cardiovascular complications. This review thoroughly presents the multiple mechanisms by which respiratory rate may induce injury during mechanical ventilation, drawing the attention of critical care physicians to the potential injurious effects of respiratory rate insensitivity to chemical feedback during assisted ventilation.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1152N3eJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

### Postoperative exacerbated cough hypersensitivity syndrome induces dramatic respiratory alkalosis, lactatemia, and electrolyte imbalance [^114z4WLy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

While a wide range of well-established drug therapy options exist for acute cough management, particularly for post-extubation cough, limited research has been conducted on perioperative management in patients with chronic cough.

Intravenous lidocaine administration is effective for reducing "post-extubation cough". In the present case, the existing lidocaine inhalation was continued only postoperative. Theoretically, it might have been possible to apply Lidocaine in a nebulized form via tubus right before extubation or in alkalized form in the block cuff of a tracheal tube, which could help to reduce coughing after extubation, but, at least in theory, can increase the risk of aspiration. Other data suggest that the combination of a low-dose propofol (0.25 mg/kg/KG) and ketamine (0.15 mg/KG) shortly before extubation may reduce the incidence of "post-extubation cough". Further, continuous administration of remifentanil or a bolus of dexmedetomidine (0.5 mcg/Kg/KG) 10 minutes before extubation could be valuable therapy options. In retrospect, intravenous lidocaine and an earlier extension of the described drug therapy options might have been effective. Aggressive treatment of "post-extubation cough" seems reasonable in view of the described effects on the acid/base-associated increase in intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, hemodynamic effects, and consecutive risk of bleeding. Finally, severe cardiac arrhythmia, which can lead to cardiac arrest, is also mentioned in the literature. Video laryngoscopy appears to be ideal for reducing excessive laryngeal pressure during intubation, as laryngeal trauma is likely associated with postoperative cough.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^1169N7mt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Urine anion gap can differentiate respiratory alkalosis from metabolic acidosis in the absence of blood gas results [^116E1xMj]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low plasma bicarbonate concentration due to chronic respiratory alkalosis may be misdiagnosed as metabolic acidosis and mistreated with administration of alkali therapy, particularly when arterial blood gas is not available.

Methods

We measured urine anion gap [urine (Na + +K +)-(Cl -)], as a surrogate of renal ammonium excretion in 15 patients presenting with hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentration to distinguish chronic respiratory alkalosis (CRA) from metabolic acidosis (MA) when blood gas was unavailable.

Results

Hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentrations were associated with urine pH above 5.5 and positive urine anion gap in all, suggesting CRA. The diagnosis was later confirmed by obtaining capillary blood gas, which showed a decrease in PCO 2 and high normal pH values.

Conclusion

The use of urine anion gap can help to differentiate between chronic respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, especially when arterial blood gas is not obtained.

### How I manage differential gas exchange in peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^115f66wv]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the subsequent days, her upper body metabolic alkalosis worsened (right radial ABG: pH 7.53, PaCO 2 47 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 39 mmol/L), though the pH was improved owing to appropriate respiratory compensation. At the same time, she had a primary respiratory acidosis in the lower body with appropriate renal compensation (post-membrane blood gas: pH 7.32, PaCO 2 97 mm Hg and bicarbonate 51 mmol/L). The changes in the right radial and post-membrane blood gases suggest that the decrease in sweep gas flow rate led to worsening respiratory acidosis in the blood delivered to the kidneys, whose response was to increase hydrogen ion excretion (increase generation of bicarbonate) ultimately leading to a worsening systemic metabolic alkalosis (including in the upper body). During this time, the brain, sensing a metabolic alkalosis, demonstrated appropriate respiratory compensation by reducing native lung ventilation, but such a change in CO 2 was isolated to the blood proximal to the mixing point (i.e. the upper body).

In this patient with preserved native gas exchange, the assumption was that minimal sweep gas would be needed to manage CO 2. However, in the presence of dual circulation with a mixing point superior to the renal arteries, the carbon dioxide tension of blood within the lower body was dependent on the sweep gas flow rate of the ECMO circuit, rather than native lung ventilation. The pH of the blood perfusing the kidneys determines the renal response to an acid–base disturbance. At the same time, the pH of the blood perfusing the brain determines the ventilatory response to an acid–base disturbance. Given that there were differential pH values in the blood perfusing the brain and kidneys, the compensatory responses were independent of each other. A low sweep gas flow resulted in the delivery of acidemic blood with high CO 2 to the kidneys which responded appropriately by increasing hydrogen ion excretion (thus raising the serum bicarbonate). The increase in serum bicarbonate was commensurate with the pH perfusing the kidneys as driven by the ECMO circuit. Since the upper body was alkalemic to start with, an increase in serum bicarbonate produced by the kidneys exacerbated upper body metabolic alkalosis (even though pH improved since respiratory compensation was appropriate). In a counterintuitive way, to improve the upper body alkalemia, we then increased the sweep to remove more CO 2 in the lower body which prompted bicarbonate excretion by the kidneys. The eventual pH normalization in the upper body confirmed that this was both the correct mechanism and the appropriate corrective action.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^117DDyR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Severe hypophosphataemia: a rare cause of postoperative muscle weakness [^117SP11i]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report a case of severe generalised muscle weakness in a 66-year-old man who underwent revision of left knee arthroplasty. On postoperative day 1, he developed non-focal muscle weakness and shortness of breath which progressed over a 6-hour period. Serum phosphorus level was severely low at 0.5mg/dL, along with mild degree of hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia. His symptoms completely resolved after emergent phosphorus replacement. The authors believe this case is of educational interest to physicians as generalised muscle weakness is an uncommon presentation of severe hypophosphataemia. In a postoperative setting, hypophosphataemia is often multifactorial, thought to result from combination of perioperative catecholamine surge, administration of saline, diuretics, glucose and antacids, poor oral intake and respiratory alkalosis secondary to pain. We report this case to raise awareness among physicians on severe phosphate imbalance as the primary aetiology for acute generalised muscle weakness and respiratory failure, especially after a surgery.

### Respiratory dyskinesia with refractory tachypnea and alkalosis treated by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor [^111UrZ6p]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first case report to longitudinally document both clinical symptoms and arterial blood gas changes in a patient with RD, as well as the use of a VMAT2 inhibitor for its treatment. Historically, TD has been considered difficult to treat and often irreversible. Although no specific medications have been established for RD, recent high-quality evidence supports VMAT2 inhibitors as the preferred treatment for TD. In this case, deutetrabenazine yielded marked symptomatic and laboratory improvement, with clear correlation between drug administration and clinical outcomes, and this remission appears largely independent of antipsychotic cessation, which is recommended, because the patient exhibited significant symptom relapse during post-discontinuation between days 33 and 85. Although this observation suggests a potential therapeutic role for VMAT2 inhibitors in RD, definitive causal inference is limited by the case study design, which highlights the need for further case studies and rigorously controlled clinical trials.

In conclusion, this case underscores the diagnostic challenges of RD because of its rarity, severe respiratory manifestation, and the limited clinical awareness. It also illustrates the novel therapeutic opportunity once RD is correctly identified. We therefore recommend an increasing awareness, conducting thorough differential diagnoses, discontinuing TD-inducing medications when possible, avoiding oversedation, and considering targeted therapies to improve outcomes for patients with refractory RD.

### Oxycodone and aspirin (Endodan) [^114t9U3E]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Salicylism (chronic salicylate toxicity) may be noted by symptoms such as
dizziness, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental
confusion. More severe salicylism may result in respiratory alkalosis.

Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of
adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the
institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures
(including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors) should be employed in
the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as
indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or
defibrillation. Treatment of acid-base disturbances and electrolyte disorders is
also important. Because of the concern over salicylate toxicity, acid-base
status should be followed closely with serial blood gas and serum pH
determinations.

The opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against
respiratory depression which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity
to opioids including oxycodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone
hydrochloride should be administered (usual initial adult dose 0.4 mg-2 mg)
preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory
resuscitation. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the
antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated
doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate
respiration. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of
clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to
oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid
agonist including oxycodone, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects
may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal
syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose
of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the
specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.

### Metabolic alkalosis contributes to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adult cystic fibrosis [^114sbrXJ]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Background

and study objectives: Patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) develop respiratory failure and hypercapnia. In contrast to COPD patients, altered electrolyte transport and malnutrition in CF patients may predispose them to metabolic alkalosis and, therefore, may contribute to hypercapnia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic alkalosis in adults with hypercapnic respiratory failure in the setting of acute exacerbations of CF compared with COPD.

Design

Levels of arterial blood gases, plasma electrolytes, and serum albumin from 14 consecutive hypercapnic CF patients who had been admitted to the hospital with a respiratory exacerbation were compared with 49 consecutive hypercapnic patients with exacerbations of COPD. Hypercapnia was defined as a PaCO(2) of ≥ 45 mm Hg.

Results

Despite similar PaCO(2) values, patients in the CF group were significantly more alkalotic than were those in the COPD group (mean [± SD] pH, 7.43 ± 0.03 vs 7.37 ± 0.05, respectively; p < 0.01). A mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis was evident in 71% of CF patients and 22% of COPD patients (p < 0.01). The mean concentrations of plasma chloride (95.1 ± 4.9 vs 99.8 ± 5.2 mmol/L, respectively; p < 0.01) and sodium (136.5 ± 2.8 vs 140.4 ± 4.5 mmol/L, respectively; p < 0.01) were significantly lower in the CF group, and the levels of serum albumin were significantly reduced (27.4 ± 5.8 vs 33.7 ± 4.8 mmol/L, respectively; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Metabolic alkalosis contributes to hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults with acute exacerbations of CF. This acid-base disturbance occurs in conjunction with reduced total body salt levels and hypoalbuminemia.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^114bcob6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient in case 3 exhibits signs of volume depletion, along with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In addition, she displays inability to conserve chloride. Common causes of volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia include vomiting, excessive use of loop or thiazide diuretics, or an inordinate consumption of laxatives. It can also be caused by genetic disorders such as congenital chloride-losing diarrhea, Gitelman syndrome, or Bartter syndrome. This patient does not fit into any of these categories. Loss of electrolytes in sweat, specifically in hot weather, can lead to significant volume depletion and RAAS activation, leading to hypokalemia and alkalosis. The urine chloride in nonrenal causes of volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis should be very low. However, the urine chloride in this patient is elevated, meaning option (a) is not correct for Question 6.

Salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte-containing solutions should not lead to volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis, so option (b) is not correct. This patient's history did not support the presence of respiratory acidosis before or on admission, and she was not treated for it before the admission to the hospital, ruling out option (c).

Recent studies have identified kidney-specific mechanisms that contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of volume contraction. These reports demonstrated that pendrin, which is critical to Cl − absorption (and HCO 3 − secretion) by B-intercalated cells in volume-depleted states, is profoundly downregulated in cystic fibrosis. a Pendrin downregulation impairs the ability of the kidney collecting duct to absorb salt and enhance HCO 3 − secretion (Fig 1). This further exacerbates the magnitude of volume contraction and metabolic alkalosis due to renal Cl − loss and impaired HCO 3 − secretion into the collecting duct, respectively. The loss of Cl − in the urine consequent to the inactivation of pendrin in the setting of volume depletion mimics a pseudo-Bartter picture, which has been described in cystic fibrosis patients, thus option (d) is the best answer to Question 6. The patient was admitted for the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction, and received 6 liters of saline along with 120 mEq of KCl over 48 hours. She was discharged with a serum HCO 3 − of 27 and K + of 3.8 mEq/L, and a venous blood gas of 7.41.

### Respiratory dyskinesia with refractory tachypnea and alkalosis treated by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor [^115p5SdP]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The literature on RD is sparse, consisting mainly of case reports, small series, or outdated reviews that focus on symptomatology.TD typically develops after prolonged exposure (over 3 months) of dopamine-receptor blocking agents, manifesting as involuntary and irregular movements of tongue, lips, jaw, and face. Occasionally, these movements involve laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles and result in dyspnea, which is termed RD. Second-generation antipsychotics are associated with lower incidence of TD than the first-generation antipsychotics, and their widespread use in recent decades may potentially reduce the incidence and severity of RD. This case demonstrated that RD associated with second-generation antipsychotics use can lead to significant respiratory complications, which may be misdiagnosed or undertreated, resulting in severe distress and potentially life-threatening outcomes, such as alkalosis, oversedation, and hypotension.

Differential diagnosis in this case was challenging because of refractory tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis, which mimic both organic conditions (eg, pneumonia, cardiopulmonary disorders) and psychogenic hyperventilation (commonly seen in anxiety and dissociative disorders). This difficulty was compounded by limited clinical awareness of RD, reflecting the scarcity of recent literature. The diagnosis of RD in this case is supported by several key factors: (1) the clinical presentation — refractory tachypnea and alkalosis with involuntary laryngeal and pharyngeal muscle movements that markedly mitigated during sleep; (2) an identifiable precipitating‌ factor — chronic antipsychotic use, a well-documented cause of TD including RD; (3) a 2-year prodromal history of involuntary movements — predominately affecting the orofacial region and resulting in tooth loss, with an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale score of 22 at admission, indicating a severe condition; (4) systematic exclusion of alternative causes — absence of salicylate or other respiratory stimulants exposure (excluding substance toxication); normal thyroid function and biochemical profiles (excluding hyperthyroidism, or metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis); normal procalcitonin levels (ruling out sepsis/systemic inflammation); normal pulmonary CT/CT angiography (excluding pneumothorax, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism); unremarkable cranial MRI, including absence of pontine lesions (excluding central hyperventilation); no allergen observed (ruling out asthma); no psychological triggers observed, coupled with benzodiazepine nonresponsiveness (excluding psychogenic hyperventilation attributable to hysteria or anxiety); and (5) the pharmacologic responsiveness — significant symptomatic improvement with deutetrabenazine, with relapse on discontinuation and relief after reinitiation.

### Acids in the brain: a factor in panic? [^1161xXfF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Several methods to experimentally induce panic cause profound acid-base disturbances. Evidence suggests that CO(2) inhalations, lactate infusions and, to a certain extent, voluntary hyperventilation can conceivably lead to a common scenario of brain acidosis in the face of disparate intravascular pH alterations. The importance of this event is reflected in data that support a model in which experimental panic attacks, as proxy to those occurring spontaneously, constitute a response to acute brain acidosis. Given that central CO(2)/H(+) chemoreception is an important drive for ventilation, and many chemosensitive neurons are related to respiration and arousal, this model can explain much of the connection between panic and respiration. We propose that the shared characteristics of CO(2)/H(+) sensing neurons overlap to a point where threatening disturbances in brain pH homeostasis, such as those produced by CO(2) inhalations, elicit a primal emotion that can range from breathlessness to panic.

### Ventilatory responses to inhaled carbon dioxide, hypoxia, and exercise in idiopathic hyperventilation [^113NVUdU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Idiopathic hyperventilation (IH) is a poorly understood condition of sustained hypocapnia and controversial etiology. Although behavioral/emotional factors may contribute, it is uncertain whether chemosensitivity is altered, hyperventilation is maintained during exercise, and the associated breathlessness reflects the hyperventilation. In 39 patients with IH and 23 control subjects, we described ventilatory responses to isocapnic-hypoxia, hyperoxic-hypercapnia, and exercise; breath-hold tolerance; breathlessness; and psychologic status. Patients demonstrated hyperventilation at rest, with hypocapnia (28 ± 3.8 mm Hg), a normal (slightly alkaline) arterial pH and [H(+)]a, and a significant base excess (-4.5 ± 2.7 mEq/L), consistent with compensated respiratory alkalosis. Hyperventilation was sustained during exercise, despite hyperoxic-hypercapnic ventilatory responsiveness being normal and isocapnic-hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness being low relative to control (but exceeding control [2.4 ± 1.0 vs. 1.6 ± 0.5 L/min/%, p < 0.05] with acute restoration to normocapnia). Hyperventilation was maintained during exercise, at the resting CO(2) "setpoint". Relative to control, the breath-hold tolerance was attenuated, and dyspnea during exercise was significantly greater and not simply ascribable to the high ventilation. These observations suggest that patients with IH have a sustained hyperventilatory and dyspneic drive that, although not attributable to central chemosensitivity, may possibly have peripheral chemoreflex contributions. The nature and etiology of this chronic hyperventilatory drive remain unclear.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^113ixzRZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Base excess (BE) was introduced by Siggaard-Andersen in 1960 as an answer to the forty-year-long quest for a reliable, stand-alone marker of metabolic acidosis/alkalosis, independent from co-existing respiratory derangements, and able to quantify the severity of the disorder. Previously, several parameters had been examined. The first was actual bicarbonate (HCO 3 −), which was quickly discarded due to its known dependency on the partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2). To eliminate the respiratory component, standard bicarbonate (HCO 3 − (st)) was introduced, representing the plasma bicarbonate concentration after equilibration at a PCO 2 of 40 mmHg. Although this was certainly a step forward, HCO 3 − (st) does not take into account the buffer effect of weak non-carbonic acids, i.e. proteins, which normally contribute to buffering with 14–16 negative charges (A −) per liter. Indeed, when a strong acid is added to blood, both HCO 3 − and A − concentrations will be reduced. In an open system, which is the case of a subject properly regulating PCO 2 through breathing, carbonic buffers have a predominant role (about 75–80%), however, non-carbonic buffers cannot be disregarded completely. Therefore, the difference between HCO 3 − (st) and the ideal, "normal" bicarbonate value, slightly underestimates the acid/base added to the system (e.g. the addition of 10 mmol/L of a strong acid to blood with HCO 3 − of 24 mmol/L could result in an HCO 3 − (st) of 16 mmol/L, instead of 24–10 = 14 mmol/L). To overcome this problem, Singer and Hastings introduced the buffer base (BB), the sum of all buffer anions.

### Exaggerated compensatory response to acute respiratory alkalosis in panic disorder is induced by increased lactic acid production [^114fxxzb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In acute respiratory alkalosis, the severity of alkalaemia is ameliorated by a decrease in plasma [HCO(3)(-)] of 0.2 mEq/L for each 1 mmHg decrease in PaCO(2). Although hyperventilation in panic disorder patients is frequently encountered in outpatients, the drop in plasma [HCO(3)(-)] sometimes surpasses the expectation calculated from the above formula. The quantitative relationship between reduced PaCO(2) and plasma [HCO(3)(-)] in acute respiratory alkalosis has not been studied in panic disorder patients. Our objective was to provide reference data for the compensatory metabolic changes in acute respiratory alkalosis in panic disorder patients.

Methods

In 34 panic disorder patients with hyperventilation attacks, we measured arterial pH, PaCO(2), plasma [HCO(3)(-)] and lactate on arrival at the emergency room.

Results

For each decrease of 1 mmHg in PaCO(2), plasma [HCO(3)(-)] decreased by 0.41 mEq/L. During hypocapnia, panic disorder patients exhibited larger increases in serum lactate levels (mean ± SD; 2.59 ± 1.50 mmol/L, range; 0.78–7.78 mmol/L) than previously reported in non-panic disorder subjects. Plasma lactate accumulation was correlated with PaCO(2) (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

These results suggest that the compensatory metabolic response to acute respiratory alkalosis is exaggerated by increased lactic acid production in panic disorder patients. Here, we call attention to the diagnosis of acid-base derangements by means of plasma [HCO(3)(-)] and lactate concentration in panic disorder patients.

### Physiologic homeostasis in a living human after pig kidney xenotransplantation [^116hFzFF]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Acid-Base Balance

The recipient developed moderate metabolic alkalosis, evidenced by high venous pH (7.46–7.48) and elevated serum bicarbonate levels (33–39 mmol/L) in the absence of respiratory alkalosis (pCO2 52−59 mmHg) (Supplemental Fig. 4A). Persistent diuretic use for volume management, high-dose oral calcium carbonate, and pulse-dose intravenous corticosteroids — administered at transplant and during rejection treatment — likely contributed to this imbalance.

Urinary chloride concentration remained elevated (> 20 mmol/L), while urine pH was low (5.5–6.0) (Supplemental Fig. 4B). In the setting of ongoing diuretics use, serum potassium levels were mostly within the normal range but remained in the low-normal range after POD 36, requiring daily potassium supplementation (Supplemental Fig. 4C). Urinary potassium excretion was elevated, with a urine potassium/creatinine ratio consistently > 18 mmol/g during this period.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^113wBcuP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a widespread acid-base disturbance, especially in hospitalized patients. It is characterized by the primary elevation of serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, along with a compensatory increase in Pco 2 consequent to adaptive hypoventilation. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis involves either a loss of fixed acid or a net accumulation of bicarbonate within the extracellular fluid. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney, whereas the sources of excess alkali may be via oral or parenteral alkali intake. Severe metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients-arterial blood pH of 7.55 or higher-is associated with significantly increased mortality rate. The kidney is equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to avert the generation or the persistence (maintenance) of metabolic alkalosis by enhancing bicarbonate excretion. These mechanisms include increased filtration as well as decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bicarbonate by specialized transporters in specific nephron segments. Factors that interfere with these mechanisms will impair the ability of the kidney to eliminate excess bicarbonate, therefore promoting the generation or impairing the correction of metabolic alkalosis. These factors include volume contraction, low glomerular filtration rate, potassium deficiency, hypochloremia, aldosterone excess, and elevated arterial carbon dioxide. Major clinical states are associated with metabolic alkalosis, including vomiting, aldosterone or cortisol excess, licorice ingestion, chloruretic diuretics, excess calcium alkali ingestion, and genetic diseases such as Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In this installment in the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis; appraise the precipitating events; and discuss clinical presentations, diagnoses, and treatments of metabolic alkalosis.

### Inflammation emerges as a sensitizer of a heat-responsive cation channel [^116Rd1ow]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Febrile seizure (FS) is a prevalent neurologic condition in children. It is characterized by seizures occurring with fever, typically in children between six months and five years of age. FS represents the most common type of seizure in patients without an underlying chronic neurologic disorder. The causes of FS are multifactorial and heterogeneous, but the underlying pathophysiology of how elevated body temperature induces seizures is unresolved.

In addition to convulsions, fever-associated hyperventilation can occur in children who experience FS. Hyperventilation and thermal hyperpnea can sometimes lead to respiratory alkalosis, but the underlying relationships between fever, hyperventilation, alkalosis, and the resultant seizures remain ill-defined. In experimental rodent models, FS can be induced in the absence of inflammation. However, most clinical cases of FS occur in an elevated systemic inflammatory context brought on by a viral infection. Thus, inflammation is an invariant feature of the clinical FS presentation.

Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective cation channel highly permeable to calcium cations. TRPV1 channels are activated by capsaicin or heat. They are expressed in immune cells and central and peripheral nervous tissues that regulate the respiratory response to elevated temperatures, including the carotid sinus and vagus nerves. Previous work by Barrett et alidentified vagal TRPV1 engagement in increased FS susceptibility in postnatal day (P) 10 rats, providing an anatomical and pharmacological target for drug development. Studies performed in tissue cultures indicate the ambient temperature activation threshold for TRPV1 is ∼45°C, which is higher than patient temperatures typical for FS. Thus, if TRPV1 activation plays a prominent role in FS, the channel would need to be sensitized to lower the activation threshold. One potent TRPV1 sensitizer is inflammation. These considerations led Barrett et alto hypothesize that chronic inflammation, acting through TRPV1 activation, enhances hyperthermia-induced respiratory alkalosis and propensity to seize.

### Carbon dioxide attenuates pulmonary impairment resulting from hyperventilation [^113C3fYA]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Deliberate elevation of PaCO2 (therapeutic hypercapnia) protects against lung injury induced by lung reperfusion and severe lung stretch. Conversely, hypocapnic alkalosis causes lung injury and worsens lung reperfusion injury. Alterations in lung surfactant may contribute to ventilator-associated lung injury. The potential for CO2 to contribute to the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated lung injury at clinically relevant tidal volumes is unknown. We hypothesized that: 1) hypocapnia would worsen ventilator-associated lung injury, 2) therapeutic hypercapnia would attenuate ventilator-associated lung injury; and 3) the mechanisms of impaired compliance would be via alteration of surfactant biochemistry.

Design

Randomized, prospective animal study.

Setting

Research laboratory of university-affiliated hospital.

Subjects

Anesthetized, male New Zealand Rabbits.

Interventions

All animals received the same ventilation strategy (tidal volume, 12 mL/kg; positive end-expiratory pressure, 0 cm H2O; rate, 42 breaths/min) and were randomized to receive FiCO2 of 0.00, 0.05, or 0.12 to produce hypocapnia, normocapnia, and hypercapnia, respectively.

Measurements and Main Results

Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was significantly lower with therapeutic hypercapnia, and peak airway pressure was significantly higher with hypocapnic alkalosis. However, neither static lung compliance nor surfactant chemistry (total surfactant, aggregates, or composition) differed among the groups.

Conclusions

At clinically relevant tidal volume, CO2 modulates key physiologic indices of lung injury, including alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and airway pressure, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated lung injury. These effects are surfactant independent.

### Central neurogenic hyperventilation secondary to suspected metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^111h69U9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Central neurogenic hyperventilation (CNH) is a neurogenic disorder rarely described within Emergency Medicine literature. CNH is a primary cause of hyperventilation, most commonly due to primary central nervous system neoplasms. Patient presentation varies based on the underlying cause, and may present with a sole chief complaint of dyspnea. We present a case of an adult male with a history of deep vein thrombosis, anticoagulated on apixaban, and extensively metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with a two-week history of dyspnea. Evaluation in the emergency department showed a primary respiratory alkalosis with a compensatory metabolic acidosis. Diagnostic work-up failed to reveal a cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, or toxic cause. During the emergency department course, the patient became dysarthric and altered, at which point, computed tomography scan of the head revealed a pontine hemorrhage. The hemorrhage was stabilized with prothrombin complex concentrate, but the patient's dyspnea and mental status deteriorated throughout the course of his hospitalization. While the cause of the patient's hemorrhage was not elucidated, given the patient's widely metastatic disease, it was presumed to be secondary to metastasis. Our case highlights both a unique cause of a rare disorder of hyperventilation, and a diagnostic challenge to the emergency medicine provider. It is important to consider central causes of hyperventilation in patients with dyspnea and neurologic symptoms.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^1144XRk8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a widespread acid-base disturbance, especially in hospitalized patients. It is characterized by the primary elevation of serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, along with a compensatory increase in P 2 consequent to adaptive hypoventilation. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis involves either a loss of fixed acid or a net accumulation of bicarbonate within the extracellular fluid. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney, whereas the sources of excess alkali may be via oral or parenteral alkali intake. Severe metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients — arterial blood pH of 7.55 or higher — is associated with significantly increased mortality rate. The kidney is equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to avert the generation or the persistence (maintenance) of metabolic alkalosis by enhancing bicarbonate excretion. These mechanisms include increased filtration as well as decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bicarbonate by specialized transporters in specific nephron segments. Factors that interfere with these mechanisms will impair the ability of the kidney to eliminate excess bicarbonate, therefore promoting the generation or impairing the correction of metabolic alkalosis. These factors include volume contraction, low glomerular filtration rate, potassium deficiency, hypochloremia, aldosterone excess, and elevated arterial carbon dioxide. Major clinical states are associated with metabolic alkalosis, including vomiting, aldosterone or cortisol excess, licorice ingestion, chloruretic diuretics, excess calcium alkali ingestion, and genetic diseases such as Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In this installment in the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis; appraise the precipitating events; and discuss clinical presentations, diagnoses, and treatments of metabolic alkalosis.

### Osmolality and respiratory regulation in humans: respiratory compensation for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is absent after infusion of hypertonic saline in healthy volunteers [^114K9Xnz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Several animal studies show that changes in plasma osmolality may influence ventilation. Respiratory depression caused by increased plasma osmolality is interpreted as inhibition of water-dependent thermoregulation because conservation of body fluid predominates at the cost of increased core temperature. Respiratory alkalosis, on the other hand, is associated with a decrease in plasma osmolality and strong ion difference (SID) during human pregnancy. We investigated the hypothesis that osmolality would influence ventilation, so that increased osmolality will decrease ventilation and decreased osmolality will stimulate ventilation in both men and women.

Methods

Our study participants were healthy volunteers of both sexes (ASA physical status I). Ten men (mean 28 years; range 20–40) and 9 women (mean 33 years; range 22–43) were included. All women participated in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Hyperosmolality was induced by IV infusion of hypertonic saline 3%, and hypoosmolality by drinking tap water. Arterial blood samples were collected for analysis of electrolytes, osmolality, and blood gases. Sensitivity to CO2 was determined by rebreathing tests performed before and after the fluid-loading procedures.

Results

Infusion of hypertonic saline caused hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with decreased SID in all subjects. Analysis of pooled data showed absence of respiratory compensation. Baseline arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) mean (SD) 37.8 (2.9) mm Hg remained unaltered, with lowest PaCO2 37.8 (2.9) mm Hg after 100 minutes, P = 0.70, causing a decrease in pH from mean (SD) 7.42 (0.02) to 7.38 (0.02), P < 0.001. Metabolic acidosis was also observed during water loading. Pooled results show that PaCO2 decreased from 38.2 (3.3) mm Hg at baseline to 35.7 (2.8) mm Hg after 80 minutes of drinking water, P = 0.002, and pH remained unaltered: pH 7.43 (0.02) at baseline to pH 7.42 (0.02), P = 0.14, mean difference (confidence interval) = pH -0.007 (-0.017 to 0.003).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that osmolality has an influence on ventilation. Respiratory compensation for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was suppressed during hyperosmolality. Water loading caused a decrease in plasma osmolality and metabolic acidosis, and although the decrease in SID was smaller compared with salt loading, the expected respiratory compensation was observed. Ventilation was also stimulated in men, therefore independently of progesterone levels. We propose that the influence of osmolality on ventilation consists mainly as depression in conditions of hyperosmolality and that this depression is absent during hypoosmolality.

### Acid-base dysregulation and chemosensory mechanisms in panic disorder: a translational update [^112G3sk3]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Acidosis, an interoceptive trigger in panic: evidence for relationship between pH disturbances in PD

Many clinical and preclinical studies have focused on dysregulation of central fear circuitry that includes components of the limbic network, which involves connections between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (Broadman's area 25, 24/32) as well as midbrain regions including the periaqueductal gray matter in panic. These studies have provided useful information relevant to cued panic attacks and phobias in PD subjects; however, the genesis of unexpected panic attacks still remains elusive to panic researchers. Jamesfirst proposed that feelings and emotion can derive from interoceptive sensing of our body states. These internal triggers and interoceptive chemosensory pathways are of particular relevance to PD as initial attacks come 'out of no-where'. Moreover, accumulating evidence supports a principal role of pH homeostasis in panic physiology and suggests that acidosis may be an interoceptive trigger for panic attacks. Consistent with this, a recent study with ambulatory monitoring, a valid approach for studying spontaneous panic, reported pH disturbances and altered respiratory rhythms in subjects during the final minutes before the onset of a panic attack. Well-characterized and clinically relevant methods of inducing panic, such as CO 2 inhalation or sodium lactate infusion, cause acid–base disturbances. Importantly, CO 2 inhalation and sodium lactate infusion stimulate respiration, which is itself tightly regulated by pH. Thus, it is intriguing that despite their disparate effects, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, both CO 2 inhalation and sodium lactate administration lead to extracellular and intracellular acidosis in the brain. In addition, neuroimaging studies also raise the possibility of dysregulated acid–base buffering and increased plasma and brain lactate responses to metabolic challenges in PD. There is also a high prevalence of hyperventilation and other respiratory abnormalities among patients with PD. The link between panic attacks and pH disturbances also forms the basis of the false suffocation alarm theory of spontaneous panic, where CO 2 hypersensitivity may exist due to a malfunctioning suffocation alarm monitor. Below we discuss specific areas of investigation that support the panic-pH link.

### Acid-base dysregulation and chemosensory mechanisms in panic disorder: a translational update [^113FvdvF]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

It is clear from the clinical and preclinical findings discussed in preceding sections that interoceptive acid/base imbalance and pH chemosensory mechanisms may contribute to certain aspects of PD, particularly uncued panic attacks. Converging evidence from neuroimaging, genetics and rodent preclinical models strongly supports that underlying abnormalities in pH homeostasis and chemosensation may be an important causative factor in panicogenesis.

However, it should be noted that, while there is significant evidence and consensus on the role of pH homeostasis and impaired acid–base buffering in patients with PD, not all data support the link between pH, specifically acidosis, and panic attacks. As described herein, clinical, genetic and preclinical studies on CO 2 inhalation strongly support this link. Although not all panicogens (for example, sodium lactate and doxapram, which may cause respiratory distress, pH shifts or compensatory acidosis as a response to alkalosis) support the notion that acidosis provokes panic. In this regard, future studies are required to further clarify these inconsistencies.

Although pH sensing may contribute to panic, systems regulating stress, arousal, fear and anxiety are also relevant, particularly in the maintenance of the disorder. It is possible that panic vulnerability occurs due to a combined deficit in the processing of internal and external threats. The late onset of PD also suggests that more than one phenomenon is required for the manifestation of the disorder. An interesting future research direction would be to study the connectivity and crosstalk between pH chemosensory mechanisms and exteroceptive threat response systems (see Figure 2). There is also a need for the development of preclinical animal models where stress and pH chemosensory threat processing and translation should be simulated as this scenario is more likely to occur in humans. These models will also be relevant for therapeutic testing of novel agents. Another important area would be to study the interaction and communication between different pH chemosensory molecules in the brain. The presence of multiple sensory mechanisms at distinct sites is reflective of a highly sensitive pH threat detection system functioning at different thresholds and sensitivities, which may be relevant to PD. In conclusion, pH homeostasis and chemosensation remains an important area of investigation that furthers our understanding of panic pathophysiology and treatment.

### Perioperative apnea in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a systematic review [^116UG57B]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Infantile hypertrophic pylorus stenosis (IHPS), the most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants, is caused by hypertrophy of the distal muscular aperture of the stomach. 1, 2 The incidence of IHPS is 2‐5 per 1000 live births. 1, 3, 4, 5 The condition typically develops between the third and twelfth week after birth and is characterized by nonbilious, projectile vomiting. 4

Vomiting causes loss of fluid as well as hydrogen, chloride, and potassium ions, resulting in hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. 3, 6 Due to fluid loss, most infants are dehydrated and may develop volume depletion and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Thus, the usual ability of the kidney to maintain a normal pH by bicarbonate excretion is impeded by chloride depletion and bicarbonate overload. Furthermore, in the distal tubule potassium is conserved at the expense of excreted hydrogen leading to increased metabolic alkalosis. 7, 8 Besides renal compensation, the body is also able to compensate metabolic alkalosis by retaining carbon dioxide through hypoventilation. 7, 8, 9 Normally, respiratory compensation is limited by decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the blood which activates the peripheral chemoreceptors and stimulates the ventilation rate. 6, 10, 11 However, conflicting evidence exists demonstrating the occurrence of hypoventilation in reaction to metabolic alkalosis. 12, 13 Furthermore, in young infants PaCO 2 is the primary stimulus for ventilation via its influence on the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, affecting the central chemoreceptors. 6 Therefore, infants with IHPS may develop central apneas due to severe metabolic alkalosis.

Little is known about the incidence of perioperative apnea in infants with IHPS. Only a few case reports have been described. 7, 9, 14, 15 Yet, timing of surgery is classically based on the correction of hypovolemia and metabolic derangements to prevent hypotension and respiratory complications, respectively. However, it is unknown to which extent this is necessary. Furthermore, the clinical consequences of the association between metabolic alkalosis and apnea remain unclear. If infants with IHPS have an increased risk of developing perioperative apnea, it may be necessary to monitor them to be able to identify apnea timely and to prevent further deterioration. In order to assess the incidence of apnea in infants with IHPS and to verify the possible association between apnea and metabolic alkalosis, we performed a systematic review.

### Acid-base dysregulation and chemosensory mechanisms in panic disorder: a translational update [^114F59Jn]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

CO 2 inhalation

Inhalation of CO 2 — a commonly studied interoceptive stimulus — produces intense fear, autonomic and respiratory responses that can evoke panic attacks in individuals with PD. For this reason, CO 2 is frequently used as a biological challenge and pathological marker of PD. First described in 1951 by Cohen and White, CO 2 inhalation is established as a reliable panicogen in patients with PD.,

The partial pressure of CO 2 in the blood increases following CO 2 inhalation challenge. In addition, and of direct relevance to central nervous system (CNS) physiology, CO 2 readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and is sensed by H + and CO 2 chemoreceptors in the CNS and periphery. In the extracellular fluid, CO 2 is hydrolyzed to carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3) by carbonic anhydrase which readily dissociates into bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) and H +. The resulting acidosis is thought to be the trigger for the panic symptoms caused by this challenge including hyperventilation and increased blood pressure. Klein puts forth in his false suffocation theory that hyperventilation may have a protective role to combat attacks caused by increases in CO 2 (acidosis). However, this is a faulty response because the respiratory alkalosis caused by hyperventilation is always associated with a compensatory metabolic acidosis produced by tissue buffering systems that release H + ions. Panic challenge studies with acetazolamide shed light on the role of protons as effector molecules for generating panic responses; acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, blocks the facilitated conversion of CO 2 to bicarbonate and H +, leading to increases in CO 2 concentrations. Interestingly, administration of intravenous acetazolamide fails to induce panic attacks in patients with PD, suggesting that H + ions, rather than CO 2 per se may facilitate panicogenesis.

### Metabolic alkalosis treatment standard [^114J8fm2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

### Oxycodone and aspirin [^116xFh2U]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with oxycodone and aspirin tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.

Early signs of acute aspirin (salicylate) overdose including tinnitus occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.

In acute salicylate overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration, and coma. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Serious symptoms such as depression, coma, and respiratory failure progress rapidly.

Salicylism (chronic salicylate toxicity) may be noted by symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental confusion. More severe salicylism may result in respiratory alkalosis.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^114XRafs]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Different to previous studies in which hypoalbuminemia was the confounding factor in the interpretation of acid–base data, the alkalinizing factor in the present study was hypochloremia. Albuminemia and the [A tot -] value were lower in patients with low [BE] – which might be due to the presence of shock, a condition that increases extravascular albumin losses. McAuliffe and colleagues described 'primary hypoproteinemic alkalosis' in hypoalbuminemic ICU patients with positive [BE] and elevated [HCO 3 -] levels. Nevertheless, the actual role of hypoalbuminemia to produce metabolic alkalosis has been recently challenged. We previously could only detect one patient fulfilling the criteria of primary hypoproteinemic alkalosis among 700 hypoalbuminemic patients. Wilkes showed that the loss of weak acid secondary to hypoproteinemia is compensated by a renal-mediated increase in [Cl -], so the [SID] decreases without changes in pH.

The presence of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis in patients with normal [BE] can be related to the high number of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these patients, hypochloremia is the consequence of an appropriate kidney response to chronic respiratory acidosis. Despite the prior administration of diuretics being similar both groups, in some patients the diuretics might have contributed to the development of hypochloremia.

Although most of the patients in the normal [BE] group had absolute hypochloremia and most of the patients in the low [BE] group had normal [Cl -] levels, a mechanism other than hypochloremic alkalosis might have contributed to the differences in [Cl -] between both groups. Since shock was more frequently present in patients with low [BE], these patients received more aggressive fluid resuscitation before ICU admission. Consequently, a subtle component of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis might be present in this group.

### Clinical strategies for implementing lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation: avoiding insufficient and excessive effort [^115SWNZ2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another dyssynchrony occurring in patients with absent or low respiratory drive is auto-triggering, i.e. the delivery of a ventilator-assisted breath in the absence of patient effort. Auto-triggering due to strong cardiac oscillations transmitted to the Paw or airflow signal is more likely to occur when the respiratory system time constant is low, such as in ARDS. Air leaks and moisture in the ventilator circuit are also common causes of auto-triggering.

Ineffective triggering (or ineffective efforts) develops when a patient's effort fails to trigger a ventilator-delivered breath. Ineffective triggering is generally the consequence of weak inspiratory efforts, either from low respiratory drive due to sedation, metabolic alkalosis or excessive ventilatory assist, or because of diaphragm weakness. When the respiratory system time constant is high, (i.e. obstructive lung disease), ventilator over-assistance results in delayed cycling, dynamic hyperinflation, and increased intrinsic PEEP, predisposing to ineffective triggering. Decreasing the level of assist can therefore alleviate ineffective efforts. Over-assistance in assisted ventilation can also induce apneas during sleep.

Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that NAVA improves patient-ventilator interaction, especially reducing the risks of ineffective efforts and over-assist. Whether the reduced duration of mechanical ventilation reported in some NAVA trials results from improved patient-ventilator interaction remains to be investigated.

### Acute metabolic alkalosis perpetuating hypercarbia… [^114ZQdyr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC alkalosis leads to hypercarbia. The increase in the blood Pco2 owing to alveolar hypoventilation is the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis as the ventilatory drive is blunted by the elevated Hco3- levels. 1 Hypercarbia induced by a metabolic alkalosis is of no clinical consequence in most normal persons, since the rise in Pco2 rarely exceeds 10 mm Hg, but it can lead to severe carbon dioxide narcosis in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who already are severely hypoxic and hypercarbic. Metabolic alkalosis owing to diureticinduced intravascular volume, chloride, or potassium depletion2 usually requires more than 24 hours to be generated. 2, 3 Because of this, metabolic alkalosis as the cause for persistent hypercarbia in subjects with COPD is generally not considered in the first few hours after hospitalization.

To the Editor: — The review of hyperventilation syndrome by Missri and Alexander was excellent, but they neglected to emphasize one important effect of respiratory alkalosis — severe hypophosphatemia. Their observation that "substantial reduction in organic phosphate levels has been recorded" is a profound understatement. In what I think is a much unappreciated review of the pathophysiology of hypophosphatemia, Knochel1 cites many documented examples of respiratory-alkalosis-induced hypophosphatemia and details its many serious, even potentially fatal, sequelae, including rhabdomyolysis, hemolytic anemia, and metabolic encephalopathy. Clinicians should be aware of the consequences of profound hypophosphatemia in those groups of patients who are susceptible: alcoholics, diabeticketoacidotics, and those with marked respiratory alkalosis, be it caused by anxiety, cardiopulmonary disease, hepatic coma, stroke, meningitis, or drugs such as aspirin or progesterone.

### Round table discussion: ACIDOSIS AND ALKALOSIS… [^113zG384]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Acidosis and alkalosis are terms used to describe opposite types of disturbance of acid-base balance of the body fluids. From the chemical point of view acidosis may be defined as the condition in the blood characterized by a reduction of the BHCO. 3/HHCO 3 ratio, and alkalosis as an increase. When BHCO 3 is primarily affected, the disturbance is referred to as metabolic in origin; when HHCO 3 concentration is the first to be altered, the resulting change is considered to be of respiratory origin. Primary changes of either BHCO 3 or HHCO 3 usually stimulate compensatory changes in the other which tend to restore the original normal ratio. When compensation for acidosis is incomplete, an increased H + ion concentration of the blood results, and such a change is referred to as acidemia. The opposite condition is called alkalemia.

From the clinical point of view a much broader concept of acidosis and alkalosis exists and includes in addition all related changes in metabolism which may give rise to definite symptoms and signs of illness. Such metabolic changes may be either primary or secondary, and, as either, may be very important in determining prognosis as to life or death. The most important signs and symptoms of acidosis are: hyperpnea, which is considered not primary, stupor, dehydration, ketosis and strongly acid urine. Any or all may be absent. The most important signs and symptoms of alkalosis are: depressed respiration, considered compensatory, or hyperventilation, considered primary, tetany, and forceful vomiting, thought to be the result of pyloric or high intestinal obstruction, and strongly alkaline urine. For absolute diagnosis of acidosis or alkalosis two of the three variables, BHCO 3, HHCO 3 and pH have to be determined.

Since pH and BHCO 3 usually move in the same direction, it has been widespread clinical practice to determine only BHCO 3 by determining serum CO 2 content by the Van Slyke manometric method. In this connection it should be remembered that when so determined about 20/21 of the CO 2 comes from BHCO 3, the remainder coming from HHCO 3 In the past it was customary not to separate BHCO 3 and HHCO 3, but to record them together as the total CO 2 content.

### Alkalosis due to hyperventilation… [^1155TS6e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recently one of us reviewed the factors involved in the regulation of acid-base balance and pointed out the necessity of actual determination of the blood pH for correct differentiation of respiratory and metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

1. Breathing in excess of the physiological requirements removes excessive quantities of carbon dioxide from the blood and tends to produce alkalosis. Hyperventilation may be severe enough to overcome the compensatory mechanisms, and the pH of the blood then rises above the accepted upper limit of normal. Symptoms that result include tingling of the fingers and toes, numbness of the face followed by carpopedal spasm and ultimately by generalized spasms, convulsions, delirium and disorientation.

Alkalosis due to hyperventilation may be induced in a number of ways as outlined by Peters, 2 and Cantarow and Trumper3: acute hyperventilation, which occurs in unstable persons under sudden emotional stress; fever hyperventilation, which Sattler TH, Marquardt GH, Cummins GM.

### Respiratory alkalosis during anesthesia… [^116BVvhi]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Increased pulmonary ventilation in the human individual, whether voluntary or involuntary, is accompanied by a series of biochemical and physiologic changes which are proportional to the intensity and duration of hyperventilation. The resulting symptoms and signs are numerous, 1 but certain of these are reasonably characteristic. Dizziness, blurring of vision, and numbness and tingling of the extremities are frequent early symptoms. Excessive pulmonary ventilation, long continued, results usually in spasms of the muscles of the face, hands and feet. In some persons these signs are accompanied or followed by laryngeal stridor, opisthotonos, generalized convulsions and unconsciousness. Physical and nervous fatigue are common sequels to the episode and may persist for several days. The exact biochemical basis for these changes in the irritability of nerve cells has not been clearly established.

It is probable that some of the symptoms and signs are initiated by the train of events which follow local SEEVERS MH, STORMONT RT, HATHAWAY HR, WATERS RM. RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS DURING ANESTHESIA: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN MAN. JAMA. 1939; 113: 2131–2137.
