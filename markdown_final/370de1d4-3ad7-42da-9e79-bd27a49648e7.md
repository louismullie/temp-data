## Question

What imaging test is used to evaluate a hernia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what imaging test is used to evaluate a hernia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the optimal modality varies by hernia type and clinical context. Then, I should verify first-line versus second-line choices based on guidelines and evidence. Next, I will review performance characteristics across ultrasound, CT, MRI, and special tests for occult disease. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, guideline-based algorithm and highlight exceptions like pregnancy, trauma, obesity, and athletic pubalgia, cross-checking with major society guidelines to ensure accuracy [^113iejFW] [^116mgPb9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: imaging is not one-size-fits-all, and the choice depends on hernia type (inguinal, ventral/incisional, hiatal/diaphragmatic/thoracic), presentation (palpable vs occult, simple vs complicated), and patient factors (BMI, prior repairs, pregnancy) because physical examination often suffices but imaging clarifies uncertain diagnoses, defines anatomy for surgery, or detects complications; I should double-check this general approach against appropriateness criteria and surgical algorithms to avoid over-imaging or missing complex disease [^116mgPb9] [^1135xHQE].

> For suspected inguinal hernia, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although my initial impulse is to say "just get a CT", that would be imprecise, because when the exam is equivocal the first-line test is a targeted groin ultrasound performed dynamically with Valsalva in standing and supine positions, given its accessibility, safety, and high diagnostic accuracy when properly performed and interpreted, as recommended by HerniaSurge and supported by ACR and primary care guidance [^116EASse] [^117FMeqv] [^111VmaKa]. Wait, let me verify the next step for occult or equivocal cases; if ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic but clinical suspicion remains high, MRI is superior for occult hernias and should be considered before CT when available, given MRI's higher sensitivity and specificity in this setting, with CT as an alternative when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^116UAZMN] [^113j2uSs]. I should confirm caveats: ultrasound can yield false positives, especially with higher BMI and suboptimal technique, so standardized requests and reports and correlation with clinical findings reduce unnecessary surgery, and this nuance should guide escalation to MRI or CT when doubt persists [^112xcnCo] [^112SWyBd] [^117VREyE].

> For ventral and incisional hernias, I need to ensure I'm aligning with evidence; the most accurate modality for diagnosis and characterization is CT, which is robust across body habitus, quantifies defect size and number, evaluates muscle quality, identifies prior mesh, and is indispensable for surgical planning, with European Hernia Society analyses ranking CT highest in diagnostic performance while ultrasound is second and physical examination the least accurate in this context [^113iejFW]. Let me verify alternatives; surgeon-performed dynamic abdominal sonography for hernia (DASH) is promising and can match CT accuracy in experienced hands without radiation, but it is operator- and body habitus–limited, so CT remains the workhorse for most patients and for standardized preoperative assessment [^1135XdnX] [^113iejFW]. I should double-check interpretive variability; interobserver disagreement on CT for recurrence exists, underscoring the value of standardized reporting and multidisciplinary review when findings drive management decisions [^116cwXxz] [^11367yrJ].

> When the ventral hernia is complex (loss of domain, multiple defects, recurrent, morbid obesity), I will now examine whether MRI offers advantages; but wait, given bore and field-of-view limitations and the need for volumetrics, CT remains the practical and preferred modality to define loss of domain, rectus defect ratio, mesh position, and associated issues that influence operative strategy and perioperative risk, which is why radiology reporting templates emphasize these CT-derived metrics for surgical planning [^111EDbWb] [^114dZUd3].

> For hiatal hernia, I should confirm that I'm not conflating endoscopic evaluation with imaging; my first thought was "endoscopy is primary", but endoscopy evaluates mucosa and reflux complications rather than providing full dynamic anatomic and functional imaging, so let me correct that: imaging options include dynamic real-time MRI for functional assessment of the gastroesophageal junction, upper GI fluoroscopy for anatomic classification, and CT for large or complicated hernias, while SAGES provides the classification framework and endoscopy remains integral to GERD evaluation and procedural planning in guideline pathways [^115MqgpS] [^112sJe1T] [^113sqV2w] [^116Yp1iv].

> For thoracic and diaphragmatic hernias, I need to check the acute versus chronic distinction; CT is the cross-sectional modality of choice for thoracic hernias and for acute or traumatic diaphragmatic defects because it defines the defect, hernia contents, and complications and enables surgical triage, whereas MRI can be useful in selected non-acute or recurrent diaphragmatic cases when radiation avoidance or soft tissue characterization is desired [^116hSEv5] [^116NYcdR] [^113aw5rD] [^112HgvEU].

> For athletic pubalgia ("sports hernia"), let me consider the best test for subtle multisite pathology; MRI is preferred because it sensitively depicts the spectrum of musculoskeletal and inguinal canal abnormalities responsible for activity-related groin pain, and although the literature has variability and limited high-level evidence, expert reviews and systematic assessments consistently position MRI as the primary modality in this scenario [^116rNe3P] [^114vQ2QQ] [^114E9M2w].

> Next, I should review comparative performance to avoid overstating any single test; ultrasound for inguinal hernia shows wide sensitivity and specificity ranges that are operator dependent, yet systematic reviews suggest it generally outperforms CT for typical inguinal hernias, while MRI excels for occult disease; for incisional hernias, EHS summary ROC confirms CT as most accurate overall, with ultrasound second, reinforcing modality selection by clinical question rather than habit [^113sx8bZ] [^113j2uSs] [^116UAZMN] [^113iejFW]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied MRI was validated for incisional hernia accuracy like inguinal; I should correct that: the EHS analysis noted a lack of robust accuracy studies for MRI in incisional hernia, so CT remains the reference cross-sectional modality there while MRI is reserved for specific circumstances [^113iejFW].

> Now, I need to apply scenario-based modifiers; in obesity, ultrasound and MRI can be technically limited, making CT preferable for both diagnosis and preoperative planning, whereas in pregnancy, ultrasound is preferred and MRI without contrast is a reasonable second-line if needed to avoid ionizing radiation; after prior repairs or when anatomy and mesh position must be defined, CT is favored; in trauma or suspected complicated hernia with potential bowel or mesenteric injury, CT is mandatory for comprehensive assessment and triage; and for women with groin swelling, I should remember the higher prevalence of femoral hernias and maintain that in the differential to guide imaging and surgical planning [^111EDbWb] [^116mgPb9] [^114dZUd3] [^116Lj3LG] [^116T2Lrr].

> Synthesis into a practical algorithm: let me first confirm the inguinal pathway; begin with a careful physical exam, and if inconclusive, obtain a dynamic groin ultrasound; if ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic but suspicion persists, proceed to MRI for occult hernia evaluation, using CT when MRI is not available or contraindicated; in athletes with exertional groin pain without a palpable hernia, go directly to pelvic MRI for athletic pubalgia patterns and inguinal canal assessment [^116EASse] [^117FMeqv] [^116UAZMN] [^116rNe3P]. For ventral or incisional hernia, confirm on examination and then use contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis to define defects, contents, and muscle quality for operative planning; consider surgeon-performed dynamic abdominal sonography in non-obese patients if expertise exists and pretest probability is high, but do not substitute it for CT in complex cases or when comprehensive mapping is required [^113iejFW] [^1135XdnX] [^111EDbWb]. For hiatal hernia, integrate endoscopy per GERD guidelines and use dynamic MRI or an upper GI series when imaging is needed for anatomic and functional characterization, reserving CT for large or complicated hernias or when alternative thoracoabdominal pathology is suspected [^116Yp1iv] [^115MqgpS] [^112sJe1T].

> Final answer summary: there is no single "best" imaging test for all hernias; use ultrasound first for suspected inguinal hernia when the exam is equivocal, escalate to MRI for occult disease, rely on CT for ventral/incisional, thoracic, complex, or traumatic hernias and for preoperative planning, consider dynamic MRI or upper GI fluoroscopy for hiatal hernias within GERD-focused pathways, and tailor choices to patient factors such as obesity and pregnancy; if imaging is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, do not stop — reconsider MRI for occult pathology or alternative diagnoses and integrate multidisciplinary review as needed [^116mgPb9] [^116EASse] [^113iejFW] [^115MqgpS].

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: The European Hernia Society [^113iejFW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

A total of two cross-sectional studies directly compared ultrasound and CT imaging for incisional hernia diagnosis; 40 and 181 patients were included, respectively. In the larger study by Beck et al, ultrasound was found to have a sensitivity of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.0) and a specificity of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94) when compared with CT. Den Hartog et al. showed ultrasound having a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.87) and a specificity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.0).

Using all the data analyzed for Recommendation A, an SROC (summary receiver operating characteristic) plot was produced to show the relative diagnostic accuracy for different imaging modalities. The only reference standard available with 100% sensitivity and specificity is intraoperative diagnosis. Based on the existing evidence, tests, and comparisons available, the SROC plot shows that the most accurate investigation is CT. The second most accurate is ultrasound, which has good accuracy. The least accurate method for diagnosing an incisional hernia is physical examination. Interestingly, none of the published studies looked at the accuracy of MRI, which could be used as an alternative to CT.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^111EDbWb]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Preoperative imaging aims to define CVH morphology, content, abdominal muscular quality, and identify any complications that would compromise repair (since a large proportion will be recurrences). Imaging these patients is challenging because morbid obesity is the rule rather than the exception. For this reason, CT assumes prominence; the authors frequently find patients exceed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) bores and/or their defects are too extensive for effective sonography. Intravenous contrast is probably unnecessary in most cases.

Preoperative CT will indicate the precise location of the hernia and provides prognostic information regarding the scale of subsequent surgery; for example, smaller hernias may be closed using mesh alone, whereas larger defects will need additional component separation. Clinical examination by the surgeon will usually provide extensive information regarding the precise anatomical site, but imaging may provide unexpected information. Hernia extent on CT will also help indicate the scale of subsequent abdominal and cardiovascular insult (fluid loss is considerable during extensive CVH repair), so that appropriate preoperative conditioning, intraoperative support, and postoperative care can be scheduled. Ultimately, by imaging the true extent of the hernia, CT is able to indicate which cases can be handled by "general" surgeons and which may require specialized care.

### The athletic hernia: A systematic review [^114vQ2QQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

The athletic hernia is an obscure condition of uncertain etiology commonly seen in soccer and rugby players. The pain is often debilitating and may place an athletic career at risk. Treatment failures are frustrating to both the athlete and the physician. The anatomy involved, diagnostic criteria, and treatment modalities are inconsistently described in the medical, surgical, and orthopaedic literature. There is no evidence-based consensus available to guide decision-making. We performed an overview of the anatomy and pathoanatomy and a systematic review of the literature to gain insight into the disease and its treatment. Most studies are Level IV. The most common operative finding is a deficient posterior wall of the inguinal canal, although other abdominal wall abnormalities are frequently found. Open and laparoscopic repairs produce excellent results, but the latter allows an earlier return to play. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to have excellent diagnostic potential for athletic hernia. A multidisciplinary approach to groin pain in the athlete is recommended.

### Comparative effectiveness of dynamic abdominal sonography for hernia vs computed tomography in the diagnosis of incisional hernia [^1135XdnX]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and characterization of incisional hernia are often established by CT, which incurs radiation exposure and substantial cost in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the comparative effectiveness of surgeon-performed Dynamic Abdominal Sonography for Hernia (DASH) vs CT for incisional hernia evaluation.

- **Study design**: Patients with previous abdominal operations and recent CT imaging were enrolled prospectively; patients with stomas, fistula, or soft tissue infection were excluded. In the clinic setting, DASH was performed with prerequisite training of the American College of Surgeons Ultrasound for Surgeons Basic Course. Clinical evidence of hernia, results of DASH examination, and radiologist documentation of incisional hernia were compared with the gold standard of surgeon-interpreted CT. Testing characteristics of sensitivity and specificity were compared and predictive values were calculated. Inter-rater reliability was performed by comparing DASH results in a subgroup of patients with three different evaluators.

- **Results**: There were 181 patients enrolled, with a mean age of 54 years, and 68% were women. In patients in whom hernias were identified, the mean hernia size was 44.6 cm² (range 0.2 to 468.3 cm²). The DASH examination showed high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (88%). Hernia prevalence was 55% in this population, resulting in positive and negative predictive values of 91% and 97%, respectively. Four patients had clinically detectable hernias that were not seen on CT but were discovered with DASH. Inter-rater reliability was confirmed by comparing DASH results among different evaluators.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^116EASse]. Hernia (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inguinal hernia, specifically in the context of initial evaluation, HSG 2018 guidelines recommend performing a clinical examination and obtaining an ultrasound for diagnosis in patients with vague groin swelling or possible occult groin hernias. If the ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic, consider obtaining a dynamic MRI or CT for further evaluation.

### CT of complex ventral hernias: A guide to reporting [^114dZUd3]. Clinical Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Complex ventral hernias (CVHs) represent a subset of incisional hernias so large that they cannot be reduced by standard operative techniques without an unacceptable risk of recurrence or potentially dangerous complications. They are debilitating to patients, causing pain, sores, and immobility, and their incidence is increasing worldwide due to rising operation numbers, an aging population, and increased obesity levels. The field of CVH repair has become its own surgical subspeciality, with the development of CVH multidisciplinary team meetings and tertiary hernia repair centers being established across the world.

Preoperative computed tomography (CT) has become one of the most important aspects of CVH repair planning, providing information that cannot be clinically assessed. This includes defect measurements, muscle quality evaluation, evidence of previous hernia repair, and metrics such as domain loss calculations and the rectus defect ratio. Together, this information can be combined with the clinical examination to determine the best surgical course. Unfortunately, there is evidence that when confronted with a CVH on CT, radiologists provide reports missing important metrics and reporting information of limited value.

This imaging review provides a comprehensive summary of all of the features which should be included in a CT report for CVH assessment, together with the methods used to generate metrics where appropriate. An illustrative overview of the surgical techniques used to approach CVH repair is provided, as well as an up-to-date summary of mesh plane position nomenclature.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: A single-centered retrospective pilot study [^112SWyBd]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**: Our finding that some preoperative ultrasounds are false positives (FP) for inguinal hernia in need of surgery indicates the importance of detailed requests by general practitioners (GPs) and surgeons for ultrasound examinations. The request should at least include the indication of the ultrasound examination, body mass index (BMI) of the patient, symptoms, and findings of the physical examination. This way, the radiologist has more insight into the patient's history and factors that could potentially affect the accuracy of the ultrasound.

	- Ideally, radiology reports should use a standard template and contain the following items: position of the patient during the ultrasound examination, use of Valsalva maneuver (positive or negative), mass and size of the inguinal hernia, epigastric veins (identified or not identified), the contents of the hernia sac, reducibility, and possible limitations of the examination due to scanning conditions. A more detailed radiology report is especially important in the case of an inconclusive ultrasound examination.

	- When anamnesis and physical examination are inconclusive and the ultrasound is positive, but factors associated with FP ultrasound results such as BMI are present, the surgeon may consider using additional diagnostic imaging like an MRI or CT scan as recommended by guidelines. For an accurate physical and/or ultrasound examination, it is important to examine the patient both in a standing and supine position, considering that the hernia, in some cases, can only be seen in a certain position or only with the Valsalva maneuver.

### Abdominal hernias: Imaging review and historical perspectives [^116kAqZS]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Many eminent anatomists originally described abdominal hernias, some of which are still named after the original authors. This article reviews the radiologic features of abdominal hernias as imaged on x-ray, ultrasound, multidetector computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Recognition of the typical appearance of various types of abdominal hernias, along with associated adverse features such as bowel obstruction, perforation, strangulation, or volvulus formation, can assist in formulating an accurate diagnosis. The article also provides a short biography of the scientists associated with eponymous hernias and their other significant scientific contributions.

### Imaging of thoracic hernias: types and complications [^116NYcdR]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Thoracic hernias are characterized by either the protrusion of thoracic contents outside their normal anatomical confines or the extension of abdominal contents within the thorax. These hernias can be congenital or acquired in etiology and may occur at the level of the thoracic inlet, chest wall, or diaphragm. Thoracic hernias can be symptomatic or discovered incidentally on imaging performed for other reasons. Complications include incarceration, trauma, and strangulation with necrosis.

Multiple imaging modalities are available for the evaluation of thoracic hernias. Radiographs often provide the first clue for diagnosis. Upper gastrointestinal radiography can pinpoint bowel herniation and associated complications. CT, and occasionally MRI, are valuable for further evaluation, accurately identifying the type of hernia, its contents, and associated complications. These modalities also facilitate surgical planning. This article reviews the different types of thoracic hernias and the role of imaging in their evaluation.

- **Teaching points**:

	- Protrusion of lung contents beyond their anatomic confines constitutes a hernia.
	- Complications of thoracic hernias include incarceration, trauma, and strangulation with necrosis.
	- Multiple imaging modalities are available to evaluate thoracic hernias.
	- CT is the imaging modality of choice for identifying thoracic hernias and their complications.
	- Imaging can provide a roadmap for surgical planning.

### Characterization of ventral incisional hernia and repair using shear wave elastography [^1148J2yk]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the integrity of hernia repair, imaging modalities such as computed tomography or ultrasound (US) are commonly used. Neither modality currently has the capacity to simultaneously image the mesh and quantify the stiffness of a prosthetic and surrounding tissue. In this pilot study, we hypothesize that US shear wave elastography (SWE) can be used to identify a polyester mesh and a biologic graft and to assess their stiffness noninvasively in a rat model of bridging hernia repair.

- **Methods**: Lewis rats underwent hernia creation and repair with Parietex or Strattice at 30 days. After 3 months, the animals were euthanized, and the Young's Modulus was measured using SWE. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the hernia pre- and post-repair were performed using in-house image processing algorithms.

- **Results**: SWE was capable of accurate and real-time assessment and diagnosis of the hernia defects in vivo. The Young's Modulus of Parietex meshes and Strattice grafts, as estimated from the shear wave elastograms, were found to be statistically different from each other (P < 0.05). Accurate three-dimensional reconstructions of the hernia defects pre- and post-repair were generated.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using US SWE to detect ventral hernias and evaluate mesh repair in vivo. Our results indicate that the presence of a hernia and repair can be reliably visualized by SWE and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Thus, this technique may provide both structural and functional information regarding the hernia and the repair.

### Prevalence and impact on quality of life of occult hernias among patients undergoing computed tomography [^113BZxZx]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Low credibility.

With the widespread use of advanced imaging, there is a need to quantify the prevalence and impact of hernias. We aimed to determine the prevalence of abdominal wall hernias among patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) scans and their impact on abdominal wall quality of life (AW-QOL).

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing elective CT abdomen/pelvis scans were enrolled. Standardized physical examinations were performed by surgeons blinded to the CT scan results. AW-QOL was measured through the modified Activities Assessment Scale. On this scale, 1 is poor AW-QOL, 100 is perfect, and a change of 7 is the minimum clinically important difference. Three surgeons reviewed the CT scans for the presence of ventral or groin hernias. The number of patients and the median AW-QOL scores were determined for three groups: no hernia, hernias only seen on imaging (occult hernias), and clinically apparent hernias.

- **Results**: A total of 246 patients were enrolled. Physical examination detected 62 (25.2%) patients with a hernia, while CT scan revealed 107 (43.5%) with occult hernias. The median (interquartile range) AW-QOL of patients per group was: no hernia = 84 (46), occult hernia = 77 (57), and clinically apparent hernia = 62 (55).

- **Conclusions**: One-fourth of individuals undergoing CT abdomen/pelvis scans have a clinical hernia, whereas nearly half have an occult hernia. Compared with individuals with no hernias, patients with clinically apparent or occult hernias have a lower AW-QOL (by 22 and seven points, respectively). Further studies are needed to determine the natural history of abdominal wall hernias.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^117XCuFq]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Study population**: In 2019, 607 patients underwent inguinal hernia surgery at our hernia repair expertise center. A preoperative ultrasound of the groin area was available for 201 of these patients, all of which were reported as positive for inguinal hernia. Patients with a negative ultrasound did not undergo surgery. In 406 operated patients who did not have a preoperative ultrasound, the diagnosis of inguinal hernia was confirmed during surgery. Among the 201 patients with a positive ultrasound, 26 were excluded because 17 were performed over 6 months prior to surgery and 9 were not conducted at our hospital. No patients presented with an incarcerated, strangulated inguinal hernia, or sports hernia. Thus, 175 patients were included, with only one patient diagnosed with a lipoma. Missing data were noted for hernia size, work experience of the ultrasound technician, and work experience of the radiologist.

The study population comprised 162 men (92.6%) and 13 women (7.4%), with a mean age of 57.1 ± 14.7 years. In 129 cases (73.7%), the groin ultrasound was requested by a general practitioner; in 27 cases (15.4%) by a surgeon; in 4 cases (2.3%) by other specialists, with data missing for 15 cases (8.6%). The linear array probe L12–5 (5–12 MHz) was most commonly used, appearing in 82 instances (46.9%), followed by the 9L4 probe used 53 times (30.5%), and the 14L5 probe used 16 times (9.1%). Convex probes C5–1 and C9–2 were utilized 10 times each.

### Current advances in prenatal imaging of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^115gm1gg]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia, despite advances in therapy, remains a complex condition with significant morbidity and mortality. The etiology of the disorder is still incompletely understood, though the pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension that develop secondarily must be overcome to improve survival. Prenatal US and fetal MRI have helped in the development of a greater understanding of this disease.

- **Imaging techniques**: With these modalities, measurement techniques have been developed in an attempt to provide prognosticators for the development of pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. There is a broad range of approaches for performing these measurements, and variability among imaging centers is noted.

Despite inconsistent approaches, these techniques have become the foundation for counseling and prenatal and postnatal therapy. It is hoped that with further research with prenatal US and fetal MRI and the development of innovative medical and surgical therapies, the morbidity and mortality of children with congenital diaphragmatic hernias can be significantly reduced.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^113sx8bZ]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernia surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. According to the national guidelines published in 2020, approximately 27,000 inguinal hernia surgeries are performed annually in the Netherlands, of which 500 to 800 surgeries are performed in our hospital. In 95% of patients with suspected inguinal hernia, the general practitioner (GP) or surgeon can diagnose the inguinal hernia based on the clinical presentation and physical examination. When the physical examination is inconclusive, ultrasonography is indicated according to both the international and Dutch inguinal hernia guidelines. Typical findings of a hernia on ultrasound consist of a hernial sac containing adipose or intestinal tissue or protrusion of a herniating sac when the Valsalva maneuver is performed.

Several studies have compared the role of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias. In a recent systematic review, Piga et al. (2020) aimed to determine which diagnostic modality is the most accurate in diagnosing inguinal hernia. They concluded that ultrasound has the highest sensitivity and specificity compared to CT and/or MRI. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for diagnosing inguinal hernias were 56–100% and 0–100%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans ranged from 48 to 98% and 25 to 100%, respectively, and of MRI from 85 to 95% and 90 to 100%, respectively.

### Hiatal hernias in patients with GERD-like symptoms: Evaluation of dynamic real-time MRI vs endoscopy [^115MqgpS]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic potential of real-time MRI for the evaluation of hiatal hernias in patients exhibiting GERD-like symptoms, a study was conducted comparing MRI to endoscopy.

One hundred eight patients with GERD-like symptoms were included in this observational cohort study from 2015 to 2017. Real-time MRI was performed at 3.0 Tesla with a temporal resolution of 40 ms, allowing dynamic visualization of esophageal transport of a pineapple juice bolus, its passage through the gastroesophageal junction, and functional responses during the Valsalva maneuver. Hernia detection via MRI and endoscopy was calculated using contingency tables, with the presence of hernia on either modality as a reference.

Among the 108 patients, 107 underwent successful MRI without adverse events. The examination was aborted in one case due to an inability to swallow pineapple juice while supine. No perforations or acute bleeding occurred during endoscopies. The median examination time was 15 minutes. Eighty-five patients (79.4%) were diagnosed with a hiatal hernia via either real-time MRI or endoscopy. Both modalities detected forty-six hernias. MRI exclusively identified seventeen hernias, while endoscopy exclusively identified twenty-two hernias. Of the sixty-three MRI-detected hernias, sixteen (25.4%) were evident only during the Valsalva maneuver and were smaller compared to hernias at rest (median: -13.5 mm vs -33.0 mm, p < 0.99).

In conclusion, real-time MRI is a fast and safe modality for assessing the gastroesophageal region.

The inguinal canal can exhibit a diverse range of pathologies due to its complex anatomy and the varying contents in males and females. Imaging plays a crucial role in the accurate diagnosis and management of these pathologies, as they frequently present with similar clinical symptoms such as pain and swelling. Various pathologies in the inguinal region include congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic, and iatrogenic conditions. This paper provides an overview of the role of various modalities, such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI, in the evaluation of inguinal pathologies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^116mgPb9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in herniation of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may include a specific, palpable body wall mass or bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction.

This document focuses on the initial imaging of the adult population with signs or symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often, CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI may be useful as a first-line imaging study, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluoroscopic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for the initial diagnosis of a hernia.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodological principles, such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures.

### Watchful waiting versus totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair for occult inguinal hernia and pain (EFFECT trial) - a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^117VREyE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

The role of additional imaging in the workup of occult inguinal hernias is questionable given that our study observed a PPV of 85% for detecting occult inguinal hernias by ultrasound. Preoperative ultrasound findings may have demonstrated true abdominal wall defects or weaknesses, sliding lipomas, or false-positive findings representing normal anatomic variation of the inguinal canal. As a result, unnecessary surgeries were still performed, with six patients (15%) undergoing negative explorations. A possible explanation for the reduced accuracy of ultrasound is that it is susceptible to subjectivity and heavily relies on operator skills. For example, during the Valsalva maneuver, some fatty tissue may slide into the inguinal ring or minor bulging of the abdominal wall could potentially be interpreted as an inguinal hernia. Insights from a recent study suggest that addressing ultrasound variability could benefit from a standardized protocol, as the optimal approach for diagnosing occult inguinal hernias is unknown. A recent Delphi-based consensus highlighted key recommendations for diagnosing occult inguinal hernias, such as the use of dynamic ultrasound and that reports should include hernia contents and defect size. Providing the radiologist with clinical details, especially symptoms and surgical history, can also improve diagnostic accuracy. When ultrasound was analyzed in conjunction with clinical judgment, Light et al. reported a PPV of 73%, which was comparable to the 85% observed in our study.

### Review of MRI technique and imaging findings in athletic pubalgia and the "sports hernia" [^116rNe3P]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical syndrome of athletic pubalgia has prematurely ended many promising athletic careers and has made many active, fitness-conscious adults more sedentary. It has also posed a diagnostic and therapeutic conundrum for innumerable trainers and physicians worldwide for decades. This diagnosis arises from one or more lesions within a spectrum of musculoskeletal and visceral injuries. In recent years, MRI has helped define many of these syndromes and has proven to be both sensitive and specific for numerous potential causes of athletic pubalgia.

This text provides a comprehensive review of expected and sometimes unexpected MRI findings in the setting of athletic pubalgia and delineates an imaging algorithm and MRI protocol to help guide radiologists and other clinicians dealing with refractory, activity-related groin pain in an otherwise young, healthy patient. There is still more to be learned about prevention and treatment plans for athletic pubalgia lesions, but accurate diagnosis should be much less nebulous and difficult with the use of MRI as a primary imaging modality.

### Groin pain syndrome known as sports hernia: A review [^114E9M2w]. JAMA Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Groin pain in active individuals and athletes without clinical evidence of hernia or hip pathologic findings is challenging for health care clinicians and aggravating for those experiencing pain. Frequently called sports hernia or athletic pubalgia, many surgeons continue to refute the diagnosis because there is a lack of consensus and clear comprehension of the basic pathophysiologic features of this groin pain syndrome.

- **Observations**: Understanding the anatomic and pathophysiologic findings of groin pain syndrome is necessary to appropriately treat this problem. In general, the level of evidence in the literature is of relatively low quality. Exercise-based therapy can be an effective first-line therapy in individuals who develop groin pain syndrome. Surgical therapies are typically reserved for those who experience nonoperative management failure. The common features of the varied surgical procedures include the resultant changes in the vectors of pull on the pubic bone or joint, the defects in the inguinal canal, and the inguinal sensory nerve compression or bowstringing.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: The diagnosis of nonhip, nonhernia, chronic groin pain is common. Understanding the diagnosis and treatment options may facilitate recovery and allow a return to an active lifestyle and sport.

### Imaging of thoracic hernias: types and complications [^112sJe1T]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Different imaging modalities can be useful in identifying thoracic hernias, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These include radiographs, upper gastrointestinal series, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The roles of imaging in the evaluation of hernias include establishing the diagnosis, characterizing the type, delineating the extent, identifying the contents, detecting complications, and providing a roadmap for intervention/surgery.

- **Radiographs**: Chest radiographs (CXR) are usually the first imaging modality used in adults with any suspected thoracic pathology and may offer the first clue to a thoracic hernia.

- **Gastrointestinal tract radiography**: Gastrointestinal contrast radiography under fluoroscopy is a useful modality in identifying bowel herniation into the thorax. Upper gastrointestinal imaging with oral contrast (UGI) is useful in the identification and classification of hiatal hernias. Lower gastrointestinal radiography (contrast enema) helps in identifying herniation of the large bowel into the thorax and complications of large bowel conduits. In patients with suspected bowel perforation, water-soluble contrast is initially used for both UGI and enema examinations.

### Inguinal hernias: Diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g. groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients.

Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. However, watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and early postoperative complications after current techniques for ventral hernia repair [^1146Pme6]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Broadly defined as "a protrusion of tissues through a defect of the anterior abdominal wall", ventral hernias represent a highly prevalent but heterogeneous problem in general surgery. The European Hernia Society (EHS) categorizes abdominal wall hernias as either primary or incisional. The former group includes midline (epigastric and umbilical) and lateral (spigelian and lumbar) hernias, which are classified according to their size (4 cm, or intermediate). Congenital or acquired umbilical hernias represent the most common primary hernias.

An incisional hernia is defined as "any abdominal wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging from incisional hernias". Incisional hernias develop after any abdominal surgery, with an incidence approaching 20%, and are increasingly encountered because of increased life expectancy and the high prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Recurrences after repair of primary hernias fall in the incisional group.

### Imaging of thoracic hernias: types and complications [^116hSEv5]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Computed tomography: CT is the cross-sectional imaging modality of choice in the identification and characterization of thoracic hernias in adults. It accurately identifies and classifies thoracic hernias as well as the contents of the hernia sac. On CT, the dimensions of the hernia sac and size of the defect can be measured. CT is also useful for the assessment of any associated complications. The modern multidetector CT (≥ 16 detector rows) yields isotropic voxels that can be displayed in multiple different planes. Image analysis of these axial CT images can generate three-dimensional, volume- or surface-rendered images, as well as minimum- and maximum-intensity projections, for a more comprehensive review of the hernias. Most thoracic hernias can be identified and classified on a single venous phase contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax. In our practice, we use oral contrast in those patients who have suspected bowel herniation or who are also undergoing an abdomen CT.

Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI can identify non-acute pericardial and diaphragmatic hernias. MRI without intravenous contrast can characterize the hernia in patients who cannot receive contrast for CT due to renal failure, history of anaphylaxis after previous contrast medium administration, etc. Multiple acquisitions can be obtained, which can help characterize herniation of the abdominal contents such as the liver or spleen since these can be suboptimally characterized on a single-phase contrast-enhanced CT examination. Steady-state free-precession sequences are used to identify in utero fetal congenital.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: An algorithm of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^1135xHQE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin.

For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate. The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on…

### Traumatic abdominal wall injuries-a primer for radiologists [^11651kbX]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Traumatic abdominal wall injuries encompass a broad clinical and radiological spectrum and are identified in approximately 9% of blunt trauma patients. The most severe form of abdominal wall injury — a traumatic abdominal wall hernia — is seen in less than 1.5% of blunt abdominal trauma patients. However, the incidence of intra-abdominal injuries in these patients is high and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.

Although the diagnosis of abdominal wall injuries is typically straightforward on CT, associated injuries may distract the interpreting radiologist in more subtle cases. Thus, it is important for the radiologist to identify abdominal wall injuries and their associated injuries on admission CT, as these injuries typically require surgical correction early in the course of their management. Untreated abdominal wall injuries subject the patient to increased risk of delayed bowel incarceration and strangulation. Therefore, it is important for the radiologist to be knowledgeable about injuries to the abdominal wall and commonly associated injuries to provide optimal patient triage and expedite management.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of radiology in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia [^113j2uSs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias are a common cause of groin pain. Most hernias are detectable by clinical examination, and many patients proceed to hernia repair based on history and examination findings alone. However, a significant proportion of patients with symptoms suggestive of groin hernia are found to have a normal clinical examination. Several radiological techniques have been developed to solve the dilemma posed by occult inguinal hernias. No systematic review or meta-analysis has addressed this common clinical problem.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken of relevant articles in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane database. Studies were assessed using the QUADAS tool, and statistical analysis was conducted.

- **Results**: We have shown in this meta-analysis that ultrasound has a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 77% in occult inguinal hernias. Computed tomography has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 65%. Herniography has a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%.

- **Conclusions**: Based on this systematic review, herniography should be considered as the initial investigation for occult inguinal hernia where available. In centers where this is not available, ultrasound of the groin should be used with good clinical judgment. When there is still diagnostic uncertainty, further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging should be considered to exclude alternative pathology.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: A single-centered retrospective pilot study [^112xcnCo]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

In our study, we found a positive predictive value (PPV) of preoperative ultrasound in predicting an inguinal hernia in need of surgery to be 90.9%; this means that 9.1% of patients underwent surgery without having an inguinal hernia. This finding aligns with previously reported PPVs. We also identified factors associated with a false positive (FP) ultrasound when an inguinal hernia is suspected, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before in this setting.

Awareness of these factors may influence the diagnostic approach by considering alternative imaging modalities, such as CT or MRI.

Although the PPV of preoperative ultrasound to diagnose inguinal hernia has been investigated before, only some of these studies used surgery as the gold standard. By using surgery as the gold standard, a reliable PPV could be established in this retrospective study.

A higher body mass index (BMI) was identified as a potential predictor for FP results (p = 0.043). Ultrasound is difficult to perform in obese patients due to the increased distance to the target tissue. It is more difficult to distinguish fatty tissue from material of a hernia. Moreover, the increased depth of the inguinal canal complicates identification. Compared to MRI and CT, ultrasound is the modality most constrained by obesity.

- **Related literature**: The accuracy of ultrasonography is generally known to be dependent on the experience of the technician. However, this has not yet been determined for inguinal hernias. We could not find a significant difference between the experience of the examiners in the FP and true positive (TP) ultrasound groups.

### Diaphragmatic hernia: Diagnostic approaches with review of the literature [^113aw5rD]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Because surgical repair is indicated for the treatment of diaphragmatic hernia (DH), preoperative imaging of the diaphragmatic defect, hernia content, and any associated complications with other organ pathologies is important. While various techniques can be used for imaging DHs, selecting the most effective yet least invasive technique will yield the most accurate findings and facilitate the management of DH.

We reviewed the types of diaphragmatic hernia associated with our cases and discussed preferred imaging modalities for different DHs, with a review of the literature. We evaluated the imaging findings of 21 DH cases including Morgagni's hernia (n = 4), Bochdalek hernia (n = 2), iatrogenic DH (n = 4), traumatic DH (n = 6), and hiatal hernia (n = 5).

Plain radiography, despite its limited findings on DH and indirect findings about diaphragmatic rupture, is the first preferred technique for DH. We found that ultrasound (US) is especially useful in cases of traumatic DH. It not only shows diaphragmatic continuity and herniated organs but also reveals associated abdominal organ pathologies.

Computed tomography (CT) scan is most effective in many DH cases. It can show herniated abdominal organs along with complications such as intestinal strangulation, hemothorax, and rib fractures. We emphasized that Multislice CT scans with coronal and sagittal reformatted images are the most effective and useful imaging techniques for DH. With high sensitivity for soft tissue, MR imaging may be performed in selected patients, particularly those presenting late.

### Radiologic reporting and interpretation of occult inguinal hernia [^1157dt5w]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias are common entities, but occult inguinal hernias are difficult to diagnose on examination and can cause groin and pelvic pain. Imaging is heavily relied on to help diagnose these hernias; as such, correct interpretation of imaging studies can prevent delay in treatment for a patient experiencing pain. We evaluated the accuracy and reliability of radiologic reports for detection of occult inguinal hernias in patients with groin and pelvic pain.

- **Study design**: All CT and MRI studies ordered for groin or pelvic pain during a 5-year period were analyzed. Studies were included if the original radiologic reports were available for review and if the patient underwent operative exploration. A blinded radiologist was asked to "over-read" the images. Operative findings were considered the gold standard with which radiologic reports were compared.

- **Results**: Of 322 CT and MRI studies, 125 groins met criteria. Original radiologic reports were 35% accurate, with 97% positive predictive value (PPV) and 13% negative predictive value (NPV). Over-read radiologist reports were significantly different (p < 0.0001), with 79% accuracy, 97% PPV, and 30% NPV.

- **Conclusions**: Most radiologic reports issued for CT and MRI studies were incorrect for evaluation of occult inguinal hernia. Over-read radiologist reports were more than twice as accurate when evaluating the same images. The physician who is relying on radiologic reports to determine the plan of care for a patient with groin or pelvic pain should inquire further into any negative study, especially if there is strong clinical suspicion.

### Clinical assessment, radiographic imaging, and patient self-report for abdominal wall hernias [^1163GHM2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Increasingly, abdominal wall hernias are being diagnosed incidentally through radiographic imaging. Such hernias are referred to as occult. However, the clinical significance of occult hernias is unknown. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of occult hernias and to assess the abdominal wall quality of life (AW-QOL) among patients with occult hernias.

- **Materials and methods**: A blinded, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2016 at a single academic institution's general surgery clinics. Inclusion criteria included all patients who had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen or pelvis within the last year without intervening abdominal or pelvic surgery. Patients were administered a validated AW-QOL survey and underwent a standardized clinical examination. Computed tomography scans were reviewed. The primary outcomes were prevalence and AW-QOL measured by the modified Activities Assessment Scale. AW-QOL of patients with no hernias was compared to that of those with occult hernias and clinically apparent hernias using the Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Results**: A total of 250 patients were enrolled, of whom 97 (38.8%) had a hernia noted on clinical examination, and 132 (52.8%) had a hernia noted on radiographic imaging. The prevalence of occult hernias was 38 (15.2%). Patients with no hernia had a median (interquartile range) AW-QOL of 82.5 (55.0–95.3). Patients with clinically apparent hernias had an AW-QOL of 47.7 (31.2–81.6; P < 0.001), and patients with occult hernias had an AW-QOL of 72.4 (38.5–97.2; P = 0.36).

### Fetal body MRI and its application to fetal and neonatal treatment: an illustrative review [^115VrvJQ]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2021). Low credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has an estimated prevalence of one per 2000–4000 pregnancies and results in a herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest. Consequently, the developing lungs are abnormal in terms of airspace volume and vasculature on both the affected and the contralateral side. Postnatal morbidity and mortality result from ventilation difficulties, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac failure.

In expert centers, antenatal measures of disease severity have been shown to be as accurate as measures taken after birth, affirming the importance of the standardization of fetal assessment. Ultrasound can predict outcomes in congenital diaphragmatic hernia with reasonable accuracy using the ultrasound measurement of the observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio. This ratio takes the size of the contralateral lung in a single plane as a surrogate measurement for total lung volume and remains the most commonly used antenatal prognostic indicator. Several previous studies have failed to show the superiority of MRI in predicting outcomes compared with the observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio; however, MRI is able to give a more objective and reproducible estimate of the total lung volume, which has been shown to be a defining measure of long-term postnatal oxygen requirement. Although fetal interventions such as fetoscopic endotracheal occlusion are done based on ultrasound measurement of the observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio, MRI might soon become a more accurate way to stratify patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

### Ultrasound of the inguinal floor for evaluation of hernias [^111Z8z5k]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in diagnosing inguinal hernias and obscure groin pain.

- **Methods**: A series of 65 consecutive groin explorations performed subsequent to percutaneous ultrasound examination were prospectively evaluated. Patients were examined in an office setting. The examination included a history and a physical. Then an ultrasound of the inguinal region was performed by the staff surgeon and fellows. Patients were then taken to surgery for either a laparoscopic or open hernia repair. The preoperative and operative findings were compared to determine the utility of groin ultrasound.

- **Results**: A series of 41 patients presenting with symptoms of groin pain or a palpable groin bulge were evaluated with ultrasound of the groin. Of these patients, 24 went on to have bilateral repairs, bringing the study total to 65 groins. Surgery involved 50 laparoscopic and 15 open hernia repairs. This included 20 groins without hernia, as determined by physical examination, and 45 groins with a palpable hernia. Overall, ultrasound was used to identify the type of hernia correctly (direct vs. indirect) with 85% success. In the 20 patients who had no palpable bulge, ultrasound identified a protrusion (hernia or lipoma) in 17. Two of these were false positives, and the three negative ultrasound examinations were false negatives. Thus, ultrasound identified the pathology in a groin without a palpable bulge with an accuracy of 75%. The overall accuracy in finding a hernia of any kind by ultrasound was 92%.

Multidetector CT allows comprehensive assessment of the operated anterior abdominal wall and is, therefore, recommended to elucidate suspected postoperative complications after VHR. CT findings consistently allow diagnosis of abdominal wall abscesses and fistulas, hematomas with or without active bleeding, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and recurrent hernias. Familiarity with early post-surgical CT studies is warranted to avoid misinterpretation of the expected postoperative appearance.

### Guidelines for the management of hiatal hernia [^113sqV2w]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hiatal hernia, more specifically with respect to classification, SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend classifying hiatal hernias into the following types:

- **Type I**: Sliding hernias occur when the GEJ migrates above the diaphragm. The stomach remains in its usual longitudinal alignment, and the fundus stays below the GEJ.

- **Type II**: Pure paraesophageal hernias happen when the GEJ remains in its normal anatomic position, but a portion of the fundus herniates through the diaphragmatic hiatus adjacent to the esophagus.

- **Type III**: This is a combination of types I and II, where both the GEJ and the fundus herniate through the hiatus, and the fundus lies above the GEJ.

- **Type IV**: Hiatal hernias with the presence of a structure other than the stomach, such as the omentum, colon, or small bowel, within the hernial sac.

### Audit of ultrasound and decision to operate in groin pain of unknown aetiology with ultrasound technique explained [^111fgxZR]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the ability of a groin ultrasound service to identify inguinal/femoral hernias in patients with groin pain and equivocal clinical signs, and to evaluate the number of positive cases undergoing surgery, a retrospective review was conducted. This review covered 243 examinations performed from January 2000 to June 2004. Referral information, as well as details from the examination and subsequent follow-ups, were acquired through our hospital and radiological information system.

Of the 243 patients, 92 (38%) were referrals from general practitioners, while 151 (62%) were hospital referrals. The examinations were performed by radiology consultants or specialist registrars, with consultants accounting for 228 examinations (94%). The patients' ages ranged from 3 months to 88 years, with a mean age of 48.7 years, and a male to female ratio of 3.2:1.

A total of 143 examinations were negative for hernias. Two of these patients underwent groin explorations and were found to be normal. The remainder were discharged, and none returned with related complaints. Ninety-four examinations (39%) were positive for hernias, leading to 62 patients undergoing surgery. Of these, only four were found to be false positives, yielding a positive predictive value of 94% in operated patients. Three scans were equivocal, and three were positive for other conditions.

In conclusion, in patients with equivocal clinical signs, groin ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying hernias and thus aids in surgical management.

### Are preoperative CT variables associated with the success or failure of subsequent ventral hernia repair: Nested case-control study [^112k35i5]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

We reviewed data from 428 patients. Of these, 115 had no available CT scanning, and 93 were excluded due to inappropriate imaging (postoperative CT, incomplete abdominopelvic coverage, imaging outside the preoperative temporal window). The outcome at 1 year could not be determined in 32 patients. Ultimately, 188 patients had complete data for CT and outcome: 34 (18%, mean age 58, range 22 to 86; 73 male) whose hernia recurred within 1 year and 154 (82%, mean age 56, range 27 to 90; 22 male) who did not.

- **Hernia types**:
	- 14 presented with a primary ventral hernia (2 recurred following our surgery)
	- 117 had an incisional hernia following surgery (13 recurred following our surgery)
	- 52 had a reherniation after previous repair (14 recurred following our surgery)
	- Data were missing for 5 patients

Surgery was performed by various surgeons in a tertiary referral abdominal wall reconstruction unit. Of the 154 patients without recurrence, 139 (90%) had a mesh implanted and 12 (8%) did not (data missing for 3 patients), compared to 23 (68%) and 5 (15%) respectively, for the 34 who recurred (data missing for 6 patients). Fascial closure was achieved in 128 (83%) of patients without recurrence, while 20 (60%) of those who recurred also achieved it (data missing for 6 patients).

Regarding surgical interventions for hiatal hernia, and more specifically in respect to indications for surgery, ASGE 2025 guidelines recommend considering evaluating patients with confirmed GERD and a small hiatal hernia (≤ 2 cm) with Hill grade I or II for transoral incisionless fundoplication. This approach can be an alternative to chronic medical management if they meet any of the following criteria:

- **Chronic GERD for at least 6 months**: Patients experiencing persistent GERD symptoms for this duration.
- **Chronic PPI use (≥ 6 months) for GERD symptoms**: Long-term utilization of proton pump inhibitors.
- **Refractory GERD**: GERD that does not respond to standard treatments.
- **Regurgitation-predominant GERD**: GERD where regurgitation is the main symptom.
- **Preference to avoid long-term PPI use**: Patients who wish to avoid sustained proton pump inhibitor therapy.

### Preoperative computed tomography morphological features indicative of incisional hernia formation after abdominal surgery [^1164mz4L]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate key morphometric features identifiable on routine preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging indicative of incisional hernia (IH) formation following abdominal surgery.

- **Background**: IH is a pervasive surgical disease that impacts all surgical disciplines operating in the abdominopelvic region, affecting 13% of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Despite the significant costs and disability associated with IH, there is an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology.

- **Methods**: A cohort of patients (n = 21,501) who underwent colorectal surgery was identified. Clinical data and demographics were extracted, with a primary outcome of IH. Two datasets of case-control matched pairs were created for feature measurement, classification, and testing. Morphometric linear and volumetric measurements were extracted as features from anonymized preoperative abdominopelvic CT scans. Multivariate Pearson testing was performed to assess correlations among features. Each feature's ability to discriminate between classes was evaluated using 2-sided paired t-testing. A support vector machine was implemented to determine the predictive accuracy of the features individually and in combination.

- **Results**: Two hundred and twelve patients were analyzed (106 matched pairs). Of the 117 features measured, 21 were capable of discriminating between IH and non-IH patients. These features are categorized into three key pathophysiologic domains: 1) structural widening of the rectus complex, 2) increased visceral volume, and 3) atrophy of the abdominopelvic skeletal.

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis of occult hernias [^116UAZMN]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Occult hernias are symptomatic but not palpable on physical examination, a condition more commonly seen with inguinal hernias. Early diagnosis and treatment of occult hernias are essential for relieving symptoms and improving patients' quality of life. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of imaging techniques — ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — in diagnosing occult inguinal hernia.

A retrospective medical records review was conducted involving surgical patients with groin and pelvic pain from 2008 to 2013, within a single-surgeon hernia specialty practice. Thirty-six patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) examination findings suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic for, an inguinal hernia; (2) imaging of the groin and/or pelvis using US, CT, and MRI; and (3) an operation performed to address the groin or pelvic pain. In total, fifty-nine groins were included in the study.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of US, CT, and MRI for detecting occult inguinal hernia.

- **Results**:
	- The number, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for each imaging modality were as follows:
	- US: 9, 0.33, 0, 1.00, and 0
	- CT: 39, 0.54, 0.25, 0.86, and 0.06
	- MRI: 34, 0.91, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.85
	- Among the groins that underwent multiple imaging methods where CT failed to diagnose hernias, MRI correctly detected an occult hernia in 10 of 11 cases (91%).

In conclusion, ultrasonography and CT cannot reliably exclude occult groin abnormalities.

### Unnecessary use of radiology studies in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias: a retrospective cohort study [^114kD85i]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of inguinal hernias is predominantly based on physical examination, although imaging may be used in select cases. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of unnecessary imaging used in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias.

- **Methods**: Patients who underwent elective inguinal hernia repair at a large academic health system in the U.S. from 2010 to 2017 were included. Within this cohort, we identified patients who received imaging six months prior to surgery. Through chart review of physical exam findings and imaging indications, we categorized patients into four imaging categories: unrelated, necessary, unnecessary, and borderline. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with receipt of unnecessary imaging.

- **Results**: Of 2162 patients who underwent inguinal hernia surgery, 249 had related imaging studies six months prior to surgery. 47.0% of patients received unnecessary imaging. 66.9% and 33.1% of unnecessary studies were ultrasounds and CT scans, respectively. 24.5% of patients had necessary studies, while 28.5% had studies with borderline indications. On multivariable analysis, having a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m² was associated with the receipt of unnecessary studies. Primary care providers and ED physicians were more likely to order unnecessary imaging.

- **Conclusions**: Nearly 50% of all patients who received any related imaging prior to surgery had potentially unnecessary diagnostic radiology studies. This not only exposes patients to avoidable risks but also places a significant economic burden.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^114BiNoB]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

While most ventral hernias are repaired easily, complex ventral hernias (CVH) pose specific problems. The anatomical defect is large and complex, and surgeons frequently encounter morbid obesity, infection, enterocutaneous fistula, and stomas. Accordingly, recurrence is common, reaching 27% at just 1 year for patients whose BMI exceeds 35, versus 8.3% for those under 25. A wide variety of surgical techniques are available, along with a sizeable range of mesh used to close the defect. Lack of consensus regarding the optimal surgical approach and material complicates the issue further.

Why should we repair CVH if surgery is so risky? CVH causes chronic back pain, abdominal discomfort, and poor respiratory function. Patients with large, heavy hernias are unstable and often wheelchair-bound. CVH inevitably means poor quality of life. Furthermore, hernia research is neglected. Professor Michael Rosen, Director of the Cleveland Clinic Hernia Centre, has said, "When hernia surgery goes wrong, it results in some of the most despondent, challenged patients with the worst quality of life who are desperate for improvements. This is hard to imagine, because hernia surgery is probably the most common surgery performed by general surgeons". He continues, "Hernia disease has been one of the most neglected procedures in the field of general surgery. There has been very little innovation during the past 50 years".

### Mind the gap: Imaging spectrum of abdominal ventral hernia repair complications [^112LZLrP]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple factors, including the type of hernia, surgical technique, and patient comorbidities, influence the complication rate and type in post-ventral hernia repair. Multimodality imaging, especially CT, is essential for the adequate diagnosis of various complications that can occur post-hernia repair. Combined surgeon–radiologist participation is imperative in diagnosis and prompt management.

### Use of computed tomography in diagnosing ventral hernia recurrence: A blinded, prospective, multispecialty evaluation [^116cwXxz]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Physical examination misses up to one-third of ventral hernia recurrences visible on radiologic imaging. However, computed tomographic (CT) imaging tests are subject to interpretation and require validation of interobserver reliability.

- **Objective**: To determine the interobserver reliability of CT scans for detecting a ventral hernia recurrence among surgeons and radiologists. The hypothesis was that there would be significant disagreement in the diagnosis of a ventral hernia recurrence among different observers. A secondary aim was to identify reasons for disagreement in the interpretation of CT scans.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The study involved 100 patients who underwent ventral hernia repair from 2010 to 2011 at an academic health care center, with a postoperative CT scan selected randomly from a larger cohort. Conducted from July 2014 to March 2015, the prospective assessment compared the presence or absence of a recurrent ventral hernia on CT scans among 9 blinded reviewers and the radiology report. Five reviewers (consensus group) met to discuss all CT scans with disagreement, and their discussions were assessed for keywords and key concepts. The remaining four reviewers (validation group) read the consensus group recommendations and reassessed the CT scans. Pre- and post-review Kappa (κ) statistics were calculated; post-review assessments were compared with clinical examination findings.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Interobserver reliability in determining hernia recurrence radiographically was the focus.

Of 100 CT scans, there was disagreement among all 9 reviewers regarding the presence of hernia recurrence.

### Postnatal MRI for CDH: A pictorial review of late-presenting and recurrent diaphragmatic defects [^112HgvEU]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Late-presenting or recurrent diaphragmatic defects can pose a diagnostic challenge due to varying clinical presentations. Diagnostic approaches include plain film radiographs for initial assessment, with other imaging modalities such as fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT, and MRI mainly utilized for troubleshooting. As a radiation-free modality, MRI can provide a more definitive diagnosis in particular cases due to its ability to visualize discontinuity of the diaphragm, distinguishing it from eventration. MRI can also accurately characterize hernia contents, defect location, and size.

We present our MRI technique and review cases of different hernia types with relevant discussion of the imaging findings and correlation with intraoperative findings. MRI can be a useful diagnostic tool in the assessment of late-presenting or recurrent diaphragmatic hernias.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1) [^116Lj3LG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**: Clinical investigation ranks first for the diagnosis of ventral hernia. However, CT or MRI can be recommended in some cases for a more precise preoperative diagnosis. The available literature is most concerned with investigations involving specific entities. Data on the use of CT and MRI are lacking for all ventral hernia types. In cases with abdominal trauma, a CT scan is recommended, among other things, to identify potential traumatic ventral hernias.

- **Research findings**: Killeen et al. investigated the CT scan results for patients with blunt abdominal trauma and traumatic lumbar hernias, which showed that 9 of 14 patients had concomitant injuries and only 1 of the 14 patients had clinical signs of a hernia. Likewise, in a retrospective series of 15 traumatic abdominal wall hernias, all correctly diagnosed by a CT scan and subsequently confirmed intraoperatively, Hickey et al. reported on the high frequency of associated mesenteric and intestinal injuries. The CT scan can therefore provide valuable information concerning concomitant injuries, hernia condition, or potential hematoma.

- **Case reports and retrospective series**: The importance of the CT scan for diagnosing uncommon abdominal wall hernias has been demonstrated by some case reports and retrospective series. Gough and Vella described the discovery of an incarcerated Spieghelian hernia as the cause of acute abdominal pain by a CT scan. Skrekas et al. highlighted the case of a patient who had swelling in the left lumbar region without trauma or previous surgery. The CT scan showed a superior lumbar hernia.

### Sonographic evaluation of inguinal lesions [^116X9qwM]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in the inguinal region are varied. The most common abnormality in the inguinal region is the hernia, which can be classified as direct or indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia. There are many hernia-mimicking lesions, such as spermatic cord hydrocele, undescended testis, hematoma, inflammation, abscess, benign or malignant tumors, metastatic or benign lymph node enlargement, round ligament varicosities, mesothelial cysts, and herniated ovary. Ultrasonography is currently the primary imaging modality used in assessing inguinal lesions and is helpful for the differential diagnosis of a broad spectrum of these diseases. Familiarity with the clinical setting and specific ultrasonography details will facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Utility of magnetic resonance imaging to monitor surgical meshes: Correlating imaging and clinical outcome of patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair [^1124Y5vM]. Investigative Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

From a surgeon's point of view, meshes implanted for inguinal hernia repair should overlap the defect by 3 cm or more during implantation to avoid hernia recurrence secondary to mesh shrinkage. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible meshes now offers the opportunity to noninvasively monitor whether a hernia is still covered sufficiently in the living patient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of hernia repair after mesh implantation based on MRI findings, including mesh coverage and visibility of hernia structures, as well as the patient's postoperative symptoms.

In this prospective study approved by the ethics committee, 13 MRI-visible meshes were implanted in 10 patients (3 bilaterally) for inguinal hernia repair between March 2012 and January 2013. Senior visceral surgeons, with more than 7 years of experience, implanted the meshes via laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 1 week and at 3 months after surgery using a 1.5-T system. The mesh position, deformation, and coverage of the hernia were visually assessed in consensus and rated on a 4-point semiquantitative scoring system. Distances from the hernia center point to the mesh borders (overlap) were measured. Mesh position and hernia coverage postoperatively and at 3 months after implantation were correlated with the respective patients' clinical symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Two of the 13 meshes presented with an atypical mesh configuration along the course of the study.

### Computed tomography in ventral hernia diagnosis: Have we improved? A quality improvement initiative [^11367yrJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Previous studies suggest that agreement between readers of computed tomography (CT) scans for the diagnosis of a ventral hernia (VH) is poor, showing 32% agreement (κ = 0.21). Recommendations were developed by surgeons and radiologists after determining common reasons for disagreement among CT reviewers; however, the long-term effect of adopting these recommendations has not been assessed. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to determine whether the incorporation of recommendations developed by surgeons and radiologists improves agreement among reviewers of CT scans in diagnosing a VH.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort of patients with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in the past year attended a surgery clinic at a single institution and was enrolled. Enrolled subjects underwent a standardized physical examination by a trained hernia surgeon to determine the likelihood of a clinical VH (no, indeterminate, or yes). The QI intervention was the distribution and implementation of previously described recommendations. After a year of intervention, independent radiologists assessed patients' CT scans for the presence or absence of a VH. Percent agreement and kappa were calculated to determine interobserver reliability. In-person discussion on scans with disagreement was held, and the results were used as a "gold standard" to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for CT scan diagnosis of a VH.

- **Results**: A total of 79 patients were included in the study. After QI intervention, seven radiologists agreed on 43% of the scans.

### Differences of alternative methods of measuring abdominal wall hernia defect size: A prospective observational study [^116fEpiL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the importance of defect size, there are no standardized recommendations on how to measure ventral hernias. Our aims were to determine if any significant differences existed between various methods of measuring ventral hernias and the effect of these methods of measurement on the selection of mesh size.

- **Method**: A prospective study of all patients enrolled in a randomized trial assessing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair at a single institution from March 2015 to July 2016 was eligible for inclusion. Abdominal wall hernia defect size was determined by multiplying defect length and width obtained separately using each of five methods: radiographic (CT), intraoperative with abdomen desufflated, intraoperative with abdomen insufflated to 15 mmHg (intra-abdominal aspect), intraoperative with abdomen insufflated to 15 mmHg (extra-abdominal aspect), and clinical. The primary outcome was intraclass correlation between the five different methods of measurement for each patient. The secondary outcome was changes in mesh selection, assuming a 5 cm overlap in each direction.

- **Results**: Fifty patients met inclusion criteria for assessment. The five different measurement methods had an intraclass correlation for each patient of 0.533 (95% CI 0.373–0.697) (weak correlation) for length; 0.737 (95% CI 0.613–0.844) (moderate correlation) for width; and 0.684 (95% CI 0.544–0.810) (moderate correlation) for area. Different types of measurements affected mesh selection in up to 56% of cases.

- **Conclusion**: Among five common methods of measuring abdominal wall hernia defect sizes, there is.

### Approach to abdominal imaging in 2022 [^111Gw6LE]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain represents 5% to 7% of all emergency department presentations. Many patients require imaging for diagnosis, and choosing the appropriate imaging modality is a crucial decision point. Modern medicine offers a fantastic array of options including abdominal radiograph, computed tomography, MRI, and ultrasonography. However, the plethora of alternatives can be paralyzing. This article introduces the commonly available modalities, discusses the advantages and disadvantages, and presents recommendations for commonly diagnosed conditions.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^113G3Uo3]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The authors provide details on which muscle groups are partially or wholly absent and offer a subjective impression of the "quality" of residual muscle, such as whether it is thinned and/or atrophic. Anterior abdominal wall thickness is a metric that has been investigated, though it is measured in various ways. The most cited research by Blair and colleagues found that increased abdominal wall thickness was associated with postoperative success. This measurement involves the shortest distance on a CT scan between the anterior rectus abdominis fascia and the skin (typically measured roughly halfway between the linea alba and the semi-lunar ligament) at the umbilical level.

The CT dimension most used by surgeons is the maximum transverse diameter of the fascial defect, known as the "width". Additionally, we report the cranio-caudal dimension to provide the surgeon with advance information regarding the size of mesh required, accounting for overlap if the mesh is not an inlay. Some researchers report the cross-sectional area of the defect; however, our surgeons do not find this adds significant value. Specialists in complex ventral hernias (CVH) will want to understand the relationship between the hernia sac volume and the residual abdominopelvic cavity volume, a metric termed "loss of domain". Loss of domain describes the extent to which the abdominal cavity has lost volume to the hernia and is important for predicting the degree of systemic compromise when the hernia contents are returned to the abdominal cavity.
