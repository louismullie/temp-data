## Question

How to diagnose large vessel vasculitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose large vessel vasculitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clinical suspicion and risk stratification by phenotype. Then, I should verify initial laboratory screening and its limitations. Next, I will review first-line imaging choices and when to extend beyond the temporal arteries. After that, I need to consider when to add histopathology and how timing and length affect yield. Then, I will examine large-vessel imaging to define extent and complications. Next, I should review classification and diagnostic criteria and explicitly distinguish them from bedside diagnosis. Finally, I will consider key mimics, define diagnostic confidence categories, and integrate special scenarios and monitoring considerations into a pragmatic algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical suspicion framework by age and phenotype because that anchors the diagnostic pathway: patients over 50 with new headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, scalp tenderness, or PMR features raise concern for GCA, whereas patients under 50, often female, with limb claudication, absent pulses, or refractory hypertension suggest TAK. Both can present with constitutional symptoms, so I need to ensure I don't anchor on a single feature and miss large-vessel GCA, which can lack cranial signs entirely [^112hS23Q] [^116cnf3S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check that large-vessel GCA is more prevalent than often appreciated and that modern imaging has expanded its detection, so unexplained constitutional symptoms, claudication, or persistent inflammatory markers despite therapy should trigger a search for large-vessel involvement rather than prematurely labeling the case as atypical or seronegative [^111A4iz1] [^1138Lqq8].

> Next, I should review baseline labs with a cautious eye: ESR and CRP are sensitive but nonspecific. In GCA, an ESR ≥ 50 mm/hr or CRP ≥ 10 mg/L supports the diagnosis, yet normal values do not exclude disease, and I need to remember that in patients over 65 an ESR up to 40 mm/hr may still be physiologic, so I must interpret these in context and not overweigh a single normal value [^115TC6yp] [^117DhFG3].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging first move in suspected cranial GCA: duplex ultrasound of the temporal arteries is now a preferred first-line test in many centers because it is noninvasive, can be done rapidly, and performs well. The halo sign and the compression sign carry strong pooled accuracy against clinical diagnosis, with sensitivity around 77% and specificity around 96% for the halo sign, and extended scanning to axillary arteries modestly increases sensitivity, which is crucial when temporal arteries are spared in large-vessel–predominant disease [^1179FZPw] [^1158EaDp].

> I need to ensure timing and expertise are addressed: ultrasound is operator dependent and can be falsely negative early or with suboptimal equipment, so I should coordinate with experienced sonographers and, if imaging is negative but suspicion remains high, escalate to MRI or PET rather than prematurely abandoning the diagnosis, keeping in mind that combining ultrasound signs or using compression can enhance diagnostic yield [^113P2NHF] [^1158EaDp].

> Now, about histology, I should confirm when and how to pursue temporal artery biopsy: biopsy remains valuable when imaging is unavailable, equivocal, or discordant with high clinical suspicion, but I must act quickly because sensitivity falls with glucocorticoid exposure, from roughly 48% within 3 days to about 33% after a week, though some positivity persists even after 2 weeks. Adequate length, at least 0.5–0.7 cm after fixation, is essential to mitigate skip lesions, and bilateral biopsy can be considered if the first is negative but suspicion remains very high [^112eTF1K].

> But wait, what if imaging is positive and clinical probability is high? Do I still need biopsy? EULAR-aligned pathways support that a positive ultrasound can obviate the need for biopsy in many cases, whereas U.S. practice often still includes biopsy; I should communicate this nuance with patients and document shared decision-making while ensuring we do not delay sight-saving therapy in high-risk presentations [^1135hhiC] [^113yh3vY].

> Next, I should review large-vessel imaging to define extent and screen for complications: MRI or CT angiography of the entire aorta and branch vessels is recommended to assess stenoses, occlusions, wall thickening, and aneurysms, and FDG-PET/CT adds metabolic information, especially valuable for detecting active inflammation in extracranial arteries and the aorta. However, I need to check that PET performance is better before treatment and can be confounded by glucocorticoids, and that MRA or CTA are superior for structural assessment and aneurysm surveillance over time [^114SjrVg] [^116DUyFm] [^117PuVxA] [^112hS23Q].

> Hold on, I should verify comparative strengths and limitations across modalities: ultrasound is excellent for temporal and proximal arm arteries but limited for deep thoracic and abdominal vessels. MRA avoids radiation and provides wall edema sequences but may be less available acutely. CTA is fast and high-resolution but requires iodinated contrast. PET offers whole-body metabolic assessment but has moderate accuracy for treatment monitoring and limited availability, so modality choice should be individualized by clinical question, renal function, and local expertise [^113P2NHF] [^113C5LhN].

> I will now examine classification and diagnostic criteria because I need to ensure I am not conflating classification with bedside diagnosis: the 2022 ACR/EULAR GCA classification uses a point-based system incorporating age, clinical features, inflammatory markers, imaging, and biopsy, with imaging of medium/large-vessel vasculitis carrying substantial weight. However, classification criteria are designed for research homogeneity and may not capture all real-world phenotypes, so clinical judgment remains paramount, particularly in large-vessel–predominant disease where cranial features are absent [^115TC6yp] [^114XsPcL].

> Let me consider mimics carefully before finalizing the diagnosis: infections such as syphilis or mycotic aneurysm, heritable and nonheritable vasculopathies, cholesterol emboli, thrombotic disorders, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome can mimic LVV. I should confirm the absence of infection, review medication exposures, and, when appropriate, pursue targeted serologies or cultures to avoid misclassification and harmful immunosuppression [^114fRpDb].

> Next, I should review how to categorize diagnostic confidence in a way that guides immediate management: a definite diagnosis combines high clinical suspicion with supportive imaging or biopsy. A probable diagnosis reflects high suspicion with nonspecific imaging or discordant data. Possible disease reflects moderate suspicion with nonspecific findings. In definite or high-probability cases, I should initiate glucocorticoids without delay to prevent ischemic complications, documenting the rationale and revisiting the diagnosis as additional data return [^116c1Das].

> I need to ensure special scenarios are addressed: in isolated aortitis, diagnosis is often radiologic given the inaccessibility of tissue, so careful exclusion of infectious and secondary causes and longitudinal imaging for aneurysm formation are essential. In biopsy-negative but high-suspicion GCA, I should reconsider large-vessel imaging and repeat ultrasound if early, recognizing that up to 40% of large-vessel GCA may have spared temporal arteries. In TAK, histology is rarely available outside surgery, so diagnosis rests on imaging patterns and clinical context, and I should maintain vigilance for stenotic complications requiring intervention during quiescence [^114dyFzg] [^112wESBQ] [^116M1Hfj] [^114622tk].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and follow-up plans: EULAR recommends regular assessment of symptoms, examination, and ESR/CRP, with imaging reserved for new symptoms, suspected relapse, or surveillance of known large-vessel damage such as aortic dilatation. Given that inflammatory markers can be suppressed by biologics like tocilizumab and that imaging abnormalities may persist despite clinical remission, I must integrate clinical, laboratory, and imaging data longitudinally and individualize surveillance intervals based on risk and prior complications [^114cef9b] [^111dAhNJ] [^113Z4b8A].

Diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis (LVV) relies on a **clinical–imaging–laboratory** approach, integrating symptoms, inflammatory markers, and vascular imaging [^112a1ctQ] [^1174JqSA]. Ultrasound (halo/compression signs) and MRI/MRA are **first-line** for suspected GCA, with PET/CT reserved for extracranial or uncertain cases [^113P2NHF] [^112cxSZe]. For TAK, MRA/CTA of the aorta and branches are **essential**, and PET/CT can detect early inflammation [^114SjrVg] [^112CZdDt]. Temporal artery biopsy confirms GCA when imaging is inconclusive or unavailable [^112eTF1K]. Prompt imaging and early treatment are critical to prevent ischemic complications [^116c1Das] [^112LqEQg].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial assessment

LVV presents with **nonspecific constitutional symptoms** (fever, malaise, weight loss) and vascular-specific features such as new headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, limb claudication, and absent pulses [^116ezFtC]. Initial assessment should include a detailed history, physical examination (temporal arteries, pulses, blood pressure), and laboratory tests (ESR, CRP) [^117DhFG3].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are **nonspecific** but support the diagnosis:

- **ESR/CRP**: Elevated in most cases; normal values do not exclude LVV [^114dyFzg].
- **ANCA**: Typically negative; helps exclude ANCA-associated vasculitides [^notfound].
- **Other tests**: CBC, renal and liver function tests to assess systemic involvement and comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Imaging modalities and diagnostic criteria

Imaging is central to LVV diagnosis, with **modality selection guided by clinical context** [^1174JqSA]:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Diagnostic features** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | First-line for GCA; temporal and axillary arteries | Halo sign (hypoechoic wall thickening), compression sign | Operator-dependent; limited by obesity, calcification [^112coLZY] |
| MRI/MRA | Cranial and extracranial GCA; TAK; aorta and branches | Wall thickening, enhancement, edema, stenosis, occlusion | Limited availability; contraindications (pacemaker, severe renal impairment) [^notfound] |
| CT angiography (CTA) | TAK; aorta and branches; aneurysms | Wall thickening, enhancement, stenosis, occlusion, aneurysms | Radiation exposure; contrast-related risks [^notfound] |
| PET/CT | Extracranial GCA; TAK; uncertain cases | Increased FDG uptake in vessel walls | Costly; limited availability; false positives (atherosclerosis) [^113C5LhN] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and classification

The **2022 ACR/EULAR classification criteria** for GCA include clinical, laboratory, imaging, and biopsy findings, providing a standardized diagnostic approach [^115TC6yp]. For TAK, diagnosis relies on imaging evidence of large-vessel inflammation, typically involving the aorta and its branches [^112NzUPD].

---

## Role of biopsy

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) remains the **gold standard** for confirming GCA, particularly when imaging is inconclusive or unavailable [^1179FZPw]. However, its sensitivity decreases with glucocorticoid therapy, and false negatives can occur due to skip lesions [^112eTF1K] [^1179FZPw].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key mimics include **atherosclerosis, infections, other vasculitides, and connective tissue diseases** [^notfound]. Careful clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and imaging are essential to exclude these conditions [^111oKrJC].

---

## Emerging biomarkers and novel imaging techniques

Research is ongoing to identify **specific biomarkers** and improve imaging techniques. PET/MRI, novel PET tracers, and advanced MRI sequences show promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and monitoring disease activity [^114wxVYc] [^113avxhd].

---

## Impact of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis of LVV can lead to **severe complications**, including vision loss, stroke, aortic aneurysm, and ischemic complications [^117JgnnZ]. Early recognition and prompt initiation of glucocorticoid therapy are critical to prevent irreversible damage [^116c1Das].

---

Diagnosis of LVV requires a **multimodal approach**, integrating clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging. Ultrasound and MRI/MRA are first-line imaging modalities, while PET/CT is useful for extracranial disease or uncertain cases. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent severe complications [^112wESBQ].

### The role of PET / CT in disease activity assessment in patients with large vessel vasculitis [^111kvvpg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article was to review the recent contributions on the role of PET in assessing disease activity in patients with large-vessel vasculitis (giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis).

Recent Findings

18 FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) vascular uptake in large-vessel vasculitis at PET shows moderate correlation with clinical indices, laboratory markers and signs of arterial involvement at morphological imaging. Limited data may suggest that 18 FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) vascular uptake could predict relapses and (in Takayasu arteritis) the development of new angiographic vascular lesions. PET appears to be in general sensitive to change after treatment.

Summary

While the role of PET in diagnosis large-vessel vasculitis is established, its role in evaluating disease activity is less clear-cut. PET may be used as an ancillary technique, but a comprehensive assessment, including clinical, laboratory and morphological imaging is still required to monitor patients with large-vessel vasculitis over time.

### Medium-and large-vessel vasculitis [^115YYmNB]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic vasculitides are multisystem blood vessel disorders, which are defined by the size of the vessel predominantly affected, namely small, medium, or large vessels. The term "large vessel" relates to the aorta and its major branches; "medium vessel" refers to the main visceral arteries and veins and their initial branches. The most common causes of large-vessel vasculitis are giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, and those of medium-vessel arteritis are polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease. However, there is some overlap, and arteries of any size can potentially be involved in any of the 3 main categories of dominant vessel involvement. In addition to multisystem vasculitides, other forms of vasculitis have been defined, including single-organ vasculitis (eg, isolated aortitis). Prompt identification of vasculitides is important because they are associated with an increased risk of mortality. Left undiagnosed or mismanaged, these conditions may result in serious adverse outcomes that might otherwise have been avoided or minimized. The ethnic and regional differences in the incidence, prevalence, and clinical characteristics of patients with vasculitis should be recognized. Because the clinical presentation of vasculitis is highly variable, the cardiovascular clinician must have a high index of suspicion to establish a reliable and prompt diagnosis. This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnostic strategies, and management of vasculitis.

Study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias (RoB)

The SLR was conducted by two reviewers (ChristinD and ChristiaD) under the guidance of the methodologist (SR) and with the help of the statistician (AS), who performed the meta-analyses. The search strategy was developed by an experienced librarian (LF) (online supplementary text S1). MEDLINE (1946), Embase (1974) and the Cochrane Library (1993) databases were searched without language restrictions from their inception dates (noted in parentheses) until 10 March 2017.

The reviewers screened independently all titles and abstracts to identify potentially eligible studies that were then reviewed in full text. Papers fulfilling the inclusion criteria were proceeded to data extraction. Both reviewers independently retrieved data using a predefined data extraction sheet. The following data were extracted for diagnostic studies: studies' main characteristics (year of publication, setting, number of included patients, inclusion criteria, use of glucocorticoids (GC) before performance of imaging), patient characteristics (number (%) of females, patients' age), disease characteristics (number (%) of patients fulfilling clinical criteria for GCA or TAK, number (%) of patients with positive TAB, number (%) of patients with the LV-GCA subset), technical aspects (imaging devices used, elementary lesions and structures investigated, blinding of the index test to reference standard), index test (lesions identified in the index test that are analysed), reference standard, diagnostic performance (raw data to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR−)) and parameters required for the assessment of the RoB. For prognostic and monitoring studies, the following items were retrieved: study's aim, inclusion criteria, number of patients included, number (%) of patients with follow-up, period of follow-up, investigated structures, signs and time of change, prognostic factors and outcome — as explained above any outcome reflecting disease activity or damage. For technical aspects, we extracted the study aim, number of included patients, inclusion criteria, number of patients finally diagnosed with GCA or TAK, investigated structures, different technical aspects being compared (intervention and comparator) and outcome (diagnostic performance or disease activity/damage, as appropriate) were detailed.

Discussion

The management of GCA has recently been improved as a result of more standardised and widespread introduction of diagnostic imaging tools, newer therapies (particularly bDMARDs) and optimised therapeutic and monitoring strategies. Two SLRs were required to inform an update of the recommendations on the management of LVV supported by the EULAR Task Force. The SLRs provided more evidence than the previous recommendationsbecause they were conducted from inception of all available literature to ensure a more systematic assessment of the evidence in LVV. The Task Force agreed to include all study designs (except for case reports of single patients) in the SLRs, in order to offer a comprehensive overview of all available evidence to support clinical decisions in a field of rare diseases with very limited numbers of RCTs/high LoE studies. The inclusion of observational studies reflecting routine care improves the generalisability of our results but introduces a higher RoB and confounding elements that need to be taken into account when interpreting these findings. Information from the online supplementary material should be considered together with the present paper. Moreover, it needs to be considered that research on LVV is an evolving field, but the SLR included evidence published until the 31 December 2017 in order to provide evidence for the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendations on the management of LVV.

The increasingly recognised role of imaging, especially ultrasound and fast-track clinics, in the diagnosis of GCA has been incorporated into the recently published EULAR recommendations on imaging of LVVand should allow earlier diagnosis and better characterisation of the frequency and types of disease patterns in the future.

The SLR on the general management and monitoring mainly retrieved studies with a low LoE, underlying the need for future high-quality research aiming at clarifying the precise prognostic role of disease phenotypes (cranial vs LV-GCA), the assessment of reliable predictors and preventive strategies for future complications (including ischaemic events and development of aneurysms), the optimal follow-up timing and tools to detect disease relapses. Moreover, the identification of biomarkers of disease severity and activity which could prove useful during treatment with TCZ (in view of its direct effect in suppressing CRP) is gaining increasing interest.

18 F-FDG positron emission tomography

Only two studies(n = 93, one study with low RoB) focused on the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG-PET for the diagnosis of extracranial LV-GCA yielding sensitivities of 67%–77% and specificities of 66%–100%, using TAB or a clinical diagnosis after 6 months as reference standards, respectively. The study by Lariviere et al (n = 24, low RoB), reporting a specificity of 100%, applied a semiquantitative approach (aortic-to-blood pool uptake ratio) for the evaluation of 18 F-FDG vessel wall uptake (table 5 and online supplementary table S4 for further study details, online supplementary table S6 for RoB assessment).

Main characteristics of diagnostic studies on 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) and CT angiography (CTA) in extracranial large vessel giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK)

CT angiography

The study by Lariviere et al mentioned above(n = 25, with low RoB) evaluated the roles of PET and CTA within the same population. CTA revealed a sensitivity of 73% (95% CI 45 to 92) and a specificity of 78% (95% CI 40 to 97) using the clinical diagnosis of GCA after 6 months as reference standard.

For the diagnosis of TAK, one study(n = 25, with low RoB) examined the role of CTA reporting a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 76 to 100) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 40 to 100) compared with conventional angiography (table 5 and online supplementary tables S5 for further study details, online supplementary table S6 for RoB assessment).

Methods

Given the rarity of LVV, the search strategy needed to be comprehensive, allowing varied study designs (RCTs, and observational prospective and retrospective studies). By including high-quality evidence from RCTs, and potentially lower quality evidence from small observational studies such as cohorts or case series, we aimed to ensure that the results better reflect clinical practice.

To maximise results, a wide and indepth search was conducted by two fellows (SM and AFÁ), who performed two independent systematic literature reviews (SLRs), one concerning mainly diagnosis and monitoring and the other concerning efficacy and safety of drug therapies and surgical procedures. The SLRs were conducted encompassing the Medline, Embase and Cochrane libraries, from inception until 31 December 2017, without language restrictions, and allowed all study designs except individual case reports.

The SLRs were conducted according to the EULAR operating procedures for the development of recommendations. The research design followed the PICO (population, intervention, comparator and outcome) strategy, although the use of a comparator was not possible given the specifications of the search. Two experienced librarians and the methodologist (RAL) aided the process.

The resulting articles were assessed for eligibility by evaluation of title and abstract and the relevant ones were kept for full-text review. The references of the included articles were screened as well.

Study selection considered agreement to the defined PICO strategy, where the relevant population included patients with a diagnosis of GCA, TAK, or other LVV such as isolated aortitis or IgG4-related disease with vasculitis.

Of note, papers on imaging were included initially. However, given the recently published imaging recommendations for LVV, these were later excluded, and imaging considerations were referred to the EULAR imaging recommendations.

The results, in the form of summary of findings tables, were used to summarise the information obtained. According to the EULAR operating procedures, level of evidence (LoE) was attributed according to the 2009 Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) toolfor RCTs, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies, the revised tool for the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)and the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool (QUIPS) for prognostic studies.

The results of this process were used to inform the new EULAR recommendations on LVV management and are presented in two supporting SLRs papers according to disease of interest: the current publication focusing mainly on TAK and a separate paper on GCA.

### Systemic vasculitis [^111oKrJC]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The systemic vasculitides are characterized by inflammation of blood vessel walls. Vessels of any type, in any organ can be affected, resulting in a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms. The heterogenous nature of vasculitides presents a diagnostic challenge. The American College of Rheumatology classification criteria and the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature are the most widely used to distinguish different forms of vasculitis. The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature defines 10 primary vasculitides based on vessel size (large, medium, and small). The diagnosis relies on the recognition of a compatible clinical presentation supported by specific laboratory or imaging tests and confirmatory histology. Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody testing has been of particular benefit in defining a subgroup of small vessel vasculitides. Treatment is based on clinical presentation and the pattern of organ involvement. Glucocorticoids are the primary treatment for many forms of vasculitis. Additional immunosuppressive agents, including methotrexate and cyclophosphamide, are sometimes required. Newer approaches, such as the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor or B cell therapies, are being tried in resistant cases. Patients can experience considerable treatment-related toxicity, especially infection from immunosuppressive therapy and adverse effects from steroids (e.g., osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, cataract). Vitamin D and calcium prophylaxis are recommended in patients on long-term steroid therapy.

### Imaging in diagnosis, monitoring and outcome prediction of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the 2023 update of the EULAR recommendations [^114XsPcL]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

We only included prospective and cross-sectional studies in our SLR to increase precision, but also to reduce the RoB, which is often high in retrospective studies. Selection bias may occur when imaging is only performed in certain patient groups (eg, dubious cases), rather than in all patients with suspected disease. Expectation bias may lead to an overestimation of diagnostic properties when the imaging assessor is also aware of the clinical symptoms of a patient (which is common in retrospective studies). Lastly, the selection bias inherent in case–control studies can lead to an overestimation of the value of the imaging technique, as controls are usually not patients with suspected GCA, but rather healthy controls or patients with other diseases, leading to an unrealistically large contrast between cases and controls. We have, therefore, opted for the stricter approach by excluding both retrospective and case–control studies. We believe that further meta-analyses in the field should have a similar approach, which is now possible, due to the large number of high-quality studies.

For ultrasound studies we pooled the results of different imaging abnormalities (ie, halo sign, compression sign, occlusion and stenosis) as they not only describe the same underlying inflammatory process, that is, inflammatory thickening of the arterial wall, but also have similar diagnostic properties. This reflects new insights in the field and clarity that was obtained throughout the last years of GCA research.

SLRs including meta-analysis on FDG-PET have also been published before, reporting similar results to ours. These reviews, however, used the 1990 ACR criteria and TAB rather than the clinical diagnosis as reference standard.TAB has a considerable risk of FN results, especially in GCA patients with large vessel involvement, while the 1990 ACR criteria, also relying on TAB, largely focus on cranial symptoms that are not necessarily present in LV-GCA. Moreover, when assessing the diagnostic performance of an imaging test, we are interested in its performance compared with the clinical diagnosis and not to classification criteria that are intended to select a homogeneous population for clinical trials. Classification criteria should not be used for clinical diagnosis.

### Definitions and reliability assessment of elementary ultrasound lesions in giant cell arteritis: a study from the OMERACT large vessel vasculitis ultrasound working group [^112LqEQg]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary systemic vasculitis, occurring predominantly in Caucasian populations.GCA mainly involves large and medium-sized arteries, predominantly branches of the external carotid arteries such as the temporal arteries, and the aorta and its large branches such as the subclavian and axillary arteries. Temporal artery biopsy has been regarded as the gold standard for decades; however, biopsy is invasive, and it lacks sensitivity, particularly in extracranial large vessel (LV)-GCA. Imaging techniques including ultrasound (US), MRI and positron emission tomography-CT are increasingly being used in diagnosis of GCA and may in future replace biopsy in many cases. Notably, US is less invasive, reveals a higher sensitivity, particularly in extracranial disease, and results become available faster. Early diagnosis and treatment of patients with GCA are important since patients may develop irreversible ischaemic complications, including vision loss and stroke. The implementation of fast track clinics that involve US as a point-of-care test for patients with suspected GCA has led to a decrease of permanent vision loss. A recently published multicentre study showed that a diagnostic algorithm including US is cost-effective compared with a conventional strategy focusing on biopsy only.

GCA is characterised by inflammatory infiltration of the artery wall resulting in the so-called 'halo' sign, first described in 1995, which is a hypoechoic (dark) thickening of the vessel wall as visualised by US. In contrast to the healthy artery, the inflammatory wall thickening is not compressible upon application of pressure with the US probe. This feature has recently been termed the 'compression' sign.

Several studies have been conducted thus far to investigate the accuracy, construct and criterion validity of US in the diagnosis of GCA, and four meta-analyses of these studies have been published until now. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the utility of US in GCA, standardised definitions of the elementary normal and abnormal appearance and their reliability are lacking. Therefore, an Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Large Vessel Vasculitis (LVV)-US Working Group was formed in order to agree on the US lesions suggestive of GCA as well as to test the reliability of these definitions.

### Management of Takayasu arteritis: a systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis [^114622tk]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To collect available evidence on management of large vessel vasculitis to inform the 2018 update of the EULAR management recommendations.

Methods

Two independent systematic literature reviews were performed, one on diagnosis and monitoring and the other on drugs and surgical treatments. Using a predefined PICO (population, intervention, comparator and outcome) strategy, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were accessed. Eligible papers were reviewed and results condensed into a summary of findings table. This paper reports the main results for Takayasu arteritis (TAK).

Results

A total of 287 articles were selected. Relevant heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Males appear to have more complications than females. The presence of major complications, older age, a progressive disease course and a weaker inflammatory response are associated with a more unfavourable prognosis. Evidence for details on the best disease monitoring scheme was not found. High-quality evidence to guide the treatment of TAK was not found. Glucocorticoids are widely accepted as first-line treatment. Conventional immunosuppressive drugs and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were beneficial in case series and uncontrolled studies. Tocilizumab failed the primary endpoint (time to relapse) in a randomised controlled clinical trial; however, results still favoured tocilizumab over placebo. Vascular procedures may be required, and outcome is better when performed during inactive disease.

Conclusions

Evidence to guide monitoring and treatment of patients with TAK is predominantly derived from observational studies with low level of evidence. Therefore, higher-quality studies are needed in the future.

The main novel therapeutic option for GCA in recent years has been TCZ.TCZ proved to be efficacious in newly diagnosed and relapsing patients in terms of reducing the risk of relapse and allowing a GC-free or low-GC dose remission. Continuous surveillance and future studies are needed to assess the optimal dose, duration of treatment and tapering speed of GC when prescribed concomitantly to TCZ. We do not have any reliable monitoring tests in patients receiving TCZ, which very effectively suppresses acute phase reactants; this might be clarified by longer term registry data.

The studies on the two main add-on therapies supported by high-quality evidence (MTX and TCZ) are characterised by differences in study outcomes, definitions of relapse and remission, treatment duration, doses of concomitant GC and study effect sizes (lower for MTX) which do not allow direct comparisons between the two drugs. Only one of the three RCTs conducted on MTX reached its primary endpoint and the quality of the RCTs supporting the use of TCZ was higher. Nevertheless, no head-to-head comparative studies have been conducted to date. Moreover, there are no validated biomarkers of disease severity or extent to identify patients who should be treated more intensively from the onset of disease. All these questions will need to be addressed by the future studies.

In summary, the literature review confirms the need for prompt GC initiation in suspected GCA, the emerging role for imaging diagnostic tools, and the efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapy with MTX or TCZ. The review highlights some unresolved issues in terms of the optimal monitoring test(s), ability to detect complications and prophylactic treatment to prevent ischaemic, cardiovascular or infectious events.

### Imaging for large-vessel vasculitis [^117PuVxA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ultrasonography, MRI, and PET are increasingly studied in large-vessel vasculitis. They have broadened our knowledge on these disorders and have a place in the diagnostic approach of these patients.

Recent Findings

Temporal artery ultrasonography can be used to guide the surgeon to that artery segment with the clearest 'halo' sign to perform a biopsy, or in experienced hands can even replace biopsy. The distal subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries can also be examined. High-resolution MRI depicts superficial cranial and extracranial involvement patterns in giant cell arteritis (GCA). Contrast enhancement is prominent in active inflammation and decreases under successful steroid therapy. Presence of aortic complications such as aneurysm or dissection can be ruled out within the same investigation. Large thoracic vessel FDG-uptake is seen in the majority of patients with GCA, especially at the subclavian arteries and the aorta. FDG-PET cannot predict which patients are bound to relapse, and once steroids are started, interpretation is hazardous, which makes its role in follow-up uncertain. Increased thoracic aortic FDG-uptake at diagnosis of GCA may be a bad prognostic factor for later aortic dilatation. In patients with isolated polymyalgia rheumatica - who have less intense vascular FDG uptake - symptoms are caused by inflammation around the shoulders, hips, and spine.

Summary

Ultrasonography, MRI, and PET remain promising techniques in the scientific and clinical approach of large-vessel vasculitis.

### Imaging in diagnosis, monitoring and outcome prediction of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the 2023 update of the EULAR recommendations [^112v9kwz]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary large vessel vasculitis (LVV) includes giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and idiopathic aortitis. Previously, our group published a systematic literature review (SLR) and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) endorsed recommendations for the use of imaging techniques in LVV, including ultrasound, MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CT.

That SLR, containing studies until 2017, concluded that ultrasound and MRI had a good diagnostic accuracy for cranial GCA. FDG-PET studies were scarce and only assessed extracranial arteries, preventing conclusions on its diagnostic accuracy on cranial vessels. Furthermore, there was little data on the role of imaging for monitoring disease activity and outcome prediction.

Since the publication of the original EULAR recommendations, the use of large vessel imaging has become more widespread, leading to a noticeable increase in the number of publications reporting the use of imaging in diagnosis, monitoring disease activity and outcome prediction in LVV. Furthermore, new data on FDG-PET has been published, as well as novel studies evaluating the potential of ocular imaging techniques for diagnosing GCA, altogether adding to the existing literature. Lastly, more research has been done on the diagnostic value of extended ultrasound examinations in GCA, also including large vessels such as the axillary artery. Whether these studies yield better higher sensitivities and specificities than studies only assessing cranial arteries warrants further exploration.

Our aim was to update the previous SLR and inform the EULAR task force on new evidence on the use of imaging for diagnosis, monitoring and outcome prediction in LVV.

Technological advances and increased recognition of the prevalence and implications of large vessel vasculitis have led to robust research into various imaging techniques. Although there is still debate about which modality to choose in specific clinical scenarios, Ultrasound, PET/CT, MRI/A, and CT/A offer complementary information regarding diagnosis, disease activity, and vascular complication monitoring. Recognition of the strengths and limitations of each technique is important for appropriate application in clinical practice.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology / vasculitis foundation guideline for the management of giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis [^113yh3vY]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Guideline discussion — diagnostic and treatment preferences and evidence context in giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK): overarching themes include the preference, in the US, for temporal artery biopsy over cranial imaging studies for the diagnosis of GCA, the use of large vessel imaging for GCA and TAK for diagnosis and disease monitoring, and limiting glucocorticoid exposure in order to minimize toxicity. Almost all recommendations are conditional due to low-quality evidence. EULAR indicates that the diagnosis of GCA may be made with a positive imaging test without additional testing such as temporal artery biopsy, but in the US there is limited experience with these modalities and the guideline continues to recommend temporal artery biopsy as the diagnostic test of choice at this time. In contrast to EULAR, the guideline favors initial treatment of GCA with glucocorticoids and a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Key knowledge gaps include that the optimal duration of therapy and how best to monitor disease status is unknown, accurate and validated indicators of disease activity have not been established or widely used for GCA or TAK, and the clinical significance of persistent vascular wall inflammation during clinically quiescent disease is unclear; therefore, additional research into the management of GCA and TAK is encouraged.

### Imaging in diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the EULAR recommendations [^112cxSZe]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To perform a systematic literature review on imaging techniques for diagnosis, outcome prediction and disease monitoring in large vessel vasculitis (LVV) informing the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations for imaging in LVV.

Methods

Systematic literature review (until 10 March 2017) of diagnostic and prognostic studies enrolling > 20 patients and investigating ultrasound, MRI, CT or positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with suspected and/or established primary LVV. Meta-analyses were conducted, whenever possible, obtaining pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity by fitting random effects models.

Results

Forty-three studies were included (39 on giant cell arteritis (GCA), 4 on Takayasu arteritis (TAK)). Ultrasound ('halo' sign) at temporal arteries (8 studies, 605 patients) and MRI of cranial arteries (6 studies, 509 patients) yielded pooled sensitivities of 77% (95% CI 62% to 87%) and 73% (95% CI 57% to 85%), respectively, compared with a clinical diagnosis of GCA. Corresponding specificities were 96% (95% CI 85% to 99%) and 88% (95% CI 81% to 92%). Two studies (93 patients) investigating PET for GCA diagnosis reported sensitivities of 67%–77% and specificities of 66%–100% as compared with clinical diagnosis or temporal artery biopsy. In TAK, one study each evaluated the role of magnetic resonance angiography and CT angiography for diagnostic purposes revealing both a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Studies on outcome prediction and monitoring disease activity/damage were limited and mainly descriptive.

Conclusions

Ultrasound and MRI provide a high diagnostic value for cranial GCA. More data on the role of imaging for diagnosis of extracranial large vessel GCA and TAK, as well as for outcome prediction and monitoring in LVV are warranted.

MULTIMODALITY IMAGING IN LARGE VESSEL VASCULITIS

Imaging plays an increasing role in the diagnosis and management of LVV. Although temporal artery biopsy is an established diagnostic test for cGCA, it has limited specificity and is of little use in patients with limited lvGCA, TAK or cGCA with isolated involvement of cranial arteries, such as vertebral arteries (see Figure 1). In cases of TAK or lvGCA, histology evidence is typically not possible. Such analysis is only possible in cases requiring an aortic replacement surgery, often many years after the diagnosis has been established by imaging. While traditional imaging methods encompass morphological evaluations through US combined with Color Doppler ultrasonography (US/CDUS), CTA, and MRA, FDG-PET/CT(A) is already a well-established imaging tool, and FDG-PET/MR(A) is gaining traction as an imaging tool for LVV. Catheter-based techniques are no longer central to LVV diagnosis due to their inability to inform on the vessel wall and invasiveness. Instead, they are now primarily used for therapeutic interventions. It is important to realize that the various imaging methods provide complementary information. US/CDUS, CTA, and MRA primarily reveal thickening of the arterial wall. The latter two may also reveal contrast enhancement of the arterial wall, whereas US/CDUS provides insight into the blood flow. In contrast, FDG-PET measures metabolic activity in the arterial wall. Although these are all established tools for the diagnosis of lvGCA, their role in therapy monitoring is less clear since imaging abnormalities may persist despite prolonged clinical remission. In selected cases, a combination of imaging tools is needed to gain insight into the inflammatory state of the vessel wall.

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the common feature of inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can be a systemic or localized process and depending on the disorder can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians including interventional radiologists often may be involved early in these cases before the establishment of a diagnosis as these patients may present with manifestations attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes. In this article, we discuss the presenting signs and symptoms of patients with vasculitis as well as laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders and treatment options, which include interventional as well as noninterventional options.

### Vessel inflammation and morphological changes in patients with large vessel vasculitis: a retrospective study [^116adsHt]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) is a group of vasculitides affecting predominantly the aorta and its major branches. The most common LVV are large vessel-giant cell arteritis (LV-GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK), two granulomatous vasculitides that share many clinical, pathological and radiographic features. Vascular inflammation leads to arterial remodelling, resulting in irreversible structural vessel changes, including stenosis and dilation.

Assessing the extent of arterial involvement and measuring current inflammatory status are essential for the optimal management of LVV. Despite many attempts to adopt standardised approaches to disease activity assessment in LVV, no single measure or set of measures have been accepted as valid and useful in clinical practice. Imaging procedures remain the mainstay in the follow-up of patients with LVV, including 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography associated with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT), and CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA), allowing to detect early inflammatory signs and late complications of LVV (stenosis and dilations). However, their potential role in monitoring disease activity and in predicting the disease course and the development of vascular damage is still unclear. In particular, it is currently unclear whether the low-grade vascular FDG uptake that persists during treatment in up to 70% of patients with LVV in clinical remission represents persistent disease activity or non-inflammatory remodelling.

Most of the available literature on imaging of LVV focuses on the association between either PET-CT or morphological imaging and clinical disease activity. Some studies evaluating the association between PET-CT and morphological imaging findings have reported the association between vessel wall oedema and thickening with increased vascular FDG uptake. However, only a few small studies have reported on the relationship between baseline arterial wall inflammation evaluated mostly by means of PET-CT and the occurrence of irreversible morphological changes during follow-up, with contrasting results.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the presence of inflammatory signs of the vessel wall, including vascular uptake at PET-CT and vessel wall thickening at CTA or MRA, and the synchronous presence or the subsequent development of vascular damage, including stenosis and dilations.

Large-vessel vasculitis remission and surveillance imaging — Optimal treatment duration in Takayasu arteritis is less well understood, and outcomes measures may include remission based on clinical criteria, normalization of inflammatory biomarkers, stabilization on serial CT or MRI, improvement on PET-CT imaging, quality of life, and presence of clinical disease relapse. The EULAR 2018 updated guidelines placed the greatest emphasis on both the improvement of clinical symptoms and the stability of inflammatory biomarkers in defining the remission phase of LVV. Contemporary imaging is complementary to clinical symptoms and laboratory surveillance, and its use should be individualized, focused mostly on the evaluation of new symptoms or signs of aortic, major branch artery stenoses or aneurysms, or both. One prospective cohort study using FDG-PET in disease surveillance of GCA showed reduced inflammatory activity at 3 months after treatment initiation but no further change at 6 months.

The SLR focusing on treatment confirmed the need to promptly initiate GC therapy as soon as the diagnosis of GCA is suspected, however, there are conflicting data on the optimal starting dose and route of administration of GC. There is a need to optimise future studies to define the minimum effective initial dose and a safe reduction approach for managing GCA with GC. The treatment challenge of GC dependent or refractory/relapsing disease remains, particularly when reaching low-to-medium doses of GC (10–15 mg/day). The three RCTs conducted to assess the role of MTX in newly diagnosed patients with GCA have been criticised for the application of variable endpoints (time to first relapse, reduction of relapses or influence on cumulative GC dose), the use of different drug doses (maximum 15 mg/week) for a variable period of time, and for their heterogeneous adjunctive GC doses and tapering schemes. Only one of them had reached its primary endpoint. However, a meta-analysis of individual patient data assessed the role of MTX in preventing the first and subsequent relapse, confirming the efficacy and safety of MTX in both disease states and highlighting the relatively slow action of the drug within 2–3 months. MTX was confirmed to reduce the cumulative GC dose. Available evidence on the subsequent long-term use of MTX (although at a maximum dose of only 15 mg/week) in routine clinical care confirmed its efficacy and safety.

### Advances in the diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis [^112NzUPD]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of large-vessel vasculitis has experienced substantial improvement in recent years. While Takayasu arteritis diagnosis relies on imaging, the involvement of epicranial arteries by giant-cell arteritis facilitates histopathological confirmation. When appropriately performed temporal artery biopsy has high sensitivity and specificity. However, an optimal biopsy is not always achievable and, occasionally, the superficial temporal artery may not be involved. Imaging in its various modalities including colour-duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and positron emission tomography, are emerging as important procedures for the diagnosis and assessment of disease extent in large-vessel vasculitis. Recent contributions to the better performance and interpretation of temporal artery biopsies as well as advances in imaging are the focus of the present review.

Background

Large vessel vasculitis (LVV), of which giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) are the major subtypes, represents a group of diseases whose importance has been increasingly recognised over the years. Clinical manifestations for these diseases may vary from non-specific constitutional symptoms, such as fever, malaise and weight loss, to more characteristic features, resulting from stenosis/occlusion of the vascular territories involved.

Adequate management requires a correct diagnosis, appropriate monitoring and a tailored treatment strategy. To aid diagnosis and monitoring, new imaging methods have become available, as acknowledged in the new EULAR recommendations for the use of imaging in LVV, and new biomarkers are currently being evaluated.

The treatment of LVV remains a challenge, with most of the evidence coming from observational studies with limited number of patients and multiple biases, but efforts are being made to improve study quality. Since the 2009 recommendations, new evidence, including some randomised controlled trials (RCTs), has become available. Thus, an update was needed to explore the new evidence for diagnosis, monitoring, treatment efficacy and safety.

This report will focus on the combined evidence retrieved for TAK and other LVV, excluding GCA.

### Systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis: focus on giant cell arteritis [^114Sk1q5]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of large vessel vasculitis (LVV) has rapidly changed in the recent years. Imaging is becoming increasingly recognised as a reliable tool to diagnose LVV. However, we still lack prognostic markers (either derived from baseline characteristics or useful biomarkers) to tailor the intensity of treatment to individual patients. Moreover, less common types of LVV (eg, isolated aortitis, vascular involvement in IgG4-related disease) are emerging, thereby expanding the spectrum of disease and adding complexity to their diagnosis and management. New therapeutic options are available for giant cell arteritis (GCA), offering opportunities, but also challenges in the best treatment approach and timing, appropriate concomitant glucocorticoids (GC) dose and tapering scheme, as well as potential safety concerns.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to collect evidence on the therapeutic management of LVV to inform the Task Force responsible for the 2018 update of the EULAR LVV recommendations. This, together with a second SLR focused on diagnostic and monitoring aspects in LVV, provided the Task Force with the current state of evidence. This paper will provide the evidence that emerged from both SLRs, focusing on the evidence in GCA. A second publication will deal with results of the two SLRs regarding Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and other types of LVV.

### European League Against Rheumatism / European vasculitis study group recommendations for the management of vasculitis [^1114A24b]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations in the management of primary systemic vasculitis.

Recent Findings

Important developments in the classification and treatment of systemic vasculitis have led the European League Against Rheumatism to publish recommendations in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of the small, medium and large-vessel vasculitides. These recommendations resulted from a combination of evidence from systematic analysis of selected studies and the experience of experts in vasculitis when data were not available.

Summary

The purpose of formulating clinical recommendations is to improve quality of care and guide the clinician inexperienced with vasculitis. Nevertheless, patients with vasculitis should be managed by a vasculitis expert whenever possible. As our understanding of this rare and complex group of diseases advances, novel therapeutic options are being developed.

### Influence of the EULAR recommendations for the use of imaging in large vessel vasculitis in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis: results of the ARTESER register [^1135hhiC]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The procedures to confirm the diagnosis of GCA have changed over the last decade. In a recent study based on data from a Danish register for 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2018, Therkildsen et al reported that the percentage of GCA patients diagnosed by TAB remained constant until 2016, after which it sharply declined from 70%–80% to 29%–39%; in contrast, the percentage of patients undergoing diagnostic imaging increased from 2% to 66% between 2000 and 2018. Similar patterns are observed in our nationwide register (ARTESER), TAB being the leading test for diagnosis in 2013, but its popularity declining such that, by 2019, it was only used in a third of cases. Diagnostic imaging, on the other hand, has become more popular, with ultrasound at the top of the list, it is used in 53% of patients in 2019, followed by PET-TC used in 20%. The diagnostic approach has changed progressively over time, probably associated with stronger evidence emerging and an increasing interest in extracranial vessel disease. After the emergence of the EULAR recommendations for the use of imaging in large vessel vasculitis in clinical practiceand the publication of the definitions and reliability of elementary ultrasound lesions in GCA, the use of ultrasound rose sharply, by as much as 20.3% in a year.

### Vasculitis… [^11247YEE]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Giant cell arteritis — common in older women, this vasculitis causes headache, jaw pain, and visual loss. Henoch-Schönlein purpura — more common in children, this type of vasculitis may cause kidney failure or may resolve on its own. Kawasaki disease — uncommon type of vasculitis that usually affects children. It may cause a swollen, red tongue. Inflammation of the heart and aorta makes this a particularly dangerous type of vasculitis if not treated rapidly. Microscopic polyarteritis — affects the smaller blood vessels of the body, causing kidney failure and lung hemorrhage. A type of antibody called ANCA is commonly found. Polyarteritis nodosa — affects skin, joints, peripheral nerves, and blood vessels of the kidney. Polymyalgia rheumatica — a disease of adults, this vasculitis often causes joint pain and stiffness.

Rheumatoid vasculitis — associated with rheumatoid arthritis, this type of vasculitis affects small blood vessels, especially in the skin. Wegener granulomatosis — usually affects the lungs, the kidneys, and the skin. Granulomas may occur. Diagnosis A detailed medical history and physical examination may lead to diagnosis of a specific type of vasculitis. Vague symptoms may occur at the beginning of a vasculitis-related illness; these may include fever, malaise, nausea, weakness, weight loss, poor appetite, and fatigue. Each type of vasculitis has specific signs and symptoms associated with it. Based on a person's symptoms, testing for vasculitis may include blood tests, x-rays, angiograms, biopsies of involved tissue, or urine testing. Each of the vasculitis syndromes has its own best method of treatment.

Intravenous immune globulin can be helpful in certain types of vasculitis, particularly Kawasaki disease. Surgical treatment may be offered for aortic and other types of aneurysms.

### Outcome assessment in Takayasu arteritis [^116agEZV]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a systemic granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis with a phenotype that overlaps with GCA and defined by the 1993 and 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference statements. However, the diagnosis of TAK is often delayed since TAK patients may be asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms. Once a diagnosis is made, it is difficult to judge remission or recurrence since there are no reliable assessment tools. With the availability of newer agents, such as cytokine blockade, which are being evaluated in GCA, there is the potential for real advances in TAK patient management. Without reliable assessment tools it will be difficult to introduce newer agents in an organized way or to optimally benefit patients in the future. In this article we review the use and performance of disease indicators in TAK clinical trials as a basis for the further development of assessment tools for this disease.

ARTERIOGRAPHY OR BIOPSY. Confirmation of a clinical suspicion of vasculitis usually requires arteriography, biopsy, or both. Evaluation should be directed toward establishing a tissue diagnosis, if possible. In general, because "blind" biopsy of asymptomatic sites or organs generally has a low yield. 2 it is best to "go where the money is. " For example, if a patient is over age 50 and presents with a new, unexplained headache and elevated ESR, with or without a tender or abnormal temporal artery, a temporal artery biopsy would be indicated. Similarly, in a patient who presents with a multisystem illness and testicular pain and swelling, a testicular biopsy should be considered. Sural nerve biopsy may be indicated in a patient with numbness and tingling in a lower extremity. If the urine sediment is abnormal, a renal biopsy might be obtained. If a biopsy is impractical, an angiogram may be diagnostic.

An angiogram should be obtained in cases of suspected large-vessel vasculitis, such as of the branches of the aorta, which may be manifested as extremity ischemia or claudication. A patient with abdominal pain may have mesenteric or renal vasculitis. If visceral involvement is suspected, a visceral angiogram to include the celiac, mesenteric, renal and, perhaps, hepatic arteries should be performed. Finally, a renal biopsy only rarely reveals vasculitis in the renal vessels themselves but may show focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis, a finding that is suggestive of systemic necrotizing vasculitis in the appropriate clinical setting. In addition, renal biopsy findings usually cannot differentiate the type of vasculitis. 16 Patients with giant cell arteritis are almost always over age 50 and have an ESR over 50 mm per hour.

The diagnosis is confirmed by temporal artery biopsy; in centers where this technique is available, the diagnostic yield may be enhanced if biopsy is performed under sonographic guidance that highlights potential areas of involvement. Irreversible blindness is the most common serious sequela of giant cell arteritis and is preventable with corticosteroid therapy.

### Large-vessel vasculitis [^114Fyu3t]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Primary large-vessel vasculitis encompasses conditions that, despite sharing many common features, constitute distinct entities that have their own prognostic implications. These conditions include giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, with isolated aortitis being increasingly recognised in the literature and studied within this disease spectrum. Epidemiological studies have evidenced a worldwide distribution of Takayasu arteritis. In giant cell arteritis, distinct clinical phenotypes with specific outcomes (ie, cranial and large vessel forms) have been recognised. The advancements that have been made in vascular imaging have enabled improvement in diagnosis and classification of these diseases, although their value in follow-up continues to be assessed. Targeted therapies that can induce clinical remission with reduced glucocorticoid exposure are emerging. However, many patients develop vascular damage over time, highlighting the need for further understanding of the pathophysiological link between inflammation, vascular injury, and remodelling.

### Takayasu arteritis – advances in diagnosis and management [^113C5RZa]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Takayasu arteritis, a rare granulomatous vasculitis affecting young people, is associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality. In most patients the diagnosis is delayed until after the development of substantial arterial injury. Studies of noninvasive imaging techniques suggest that these approaches might facilitate earlier diagnosis and have a role in monitoring disease progress; however, they remain limited in their ability to accurately quantify inflammatory disease activity in the arterial wall. A lack of controlled clinical trial data complicates the choice of therapy for Takayasu arteritis, and clinical indices for monitoring disease activity are currently suboptimal. Increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of the large vessel vasculitides might eventually lead to novel targeted therapies. Preliminary data from open-label trials of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy are encouraging, but there is an urgent need for controlled clinical trials to establish optimum therapeutic approaches for this disease. These trials should include a prospective assessment of the use of noninvasive imaging modalities in the diagnosis and subsequent management of Takayasu arteritis.

### Imaging in vasculitis [^113avxhd]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Systemic vasculitides are characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. Their classification is based on the size of the blood vessels involved - large, medium, or small. Vasculitis early diagnosis and reliable monitoring are crucial to establish a treatment plan and prevent serious complications. Based on these considerations and depending on the location of the affected vessels, the importance of imaging modalities including ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography (CT), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy- d -glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) has progressively increased. In addition to physical exam and laboratory data, these imaging tools offer complementary information about vascular changes occurring in vasculitis. This review summarizes the different imaging modalities being utilized to diagnose and monitor vasculitis.

Recent Findings

The most recent update for the use of imaging in vasculitis is referenced in the 2023 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines in 2021. Recent advances in PET imaging in large vessel vasculitis include improved technological imaging acquisition and the use of novel radiotracers for cellular and immune targets. FDG-PET has now been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity to detect temporal arteritis.

Summary

Imaging plays a significant role in the evaluation of vasculitis and continues to gain importance in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity. Differences exist between the ACR guidelines, which advocates for temporal artery biopsy, and the EULAR guidelines, which favors imaging modalities for the initial evaluation and diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis (LVV). Prerequisites for appropriate clinical management utilizing imaging in patients with vasculitis are the availability and access to skilled clinicians to interpret the images and the cost of these techniques not being prohibitive.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® noncerebral vasculitis [^112GGPAZ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Noncerebral vasculitis is a wide-range noninfectious inflammatory disorder affecting the vessels. Vasculitides have been categorized based on the vessel size, such as large-vessel vasculitis, medium-vessel vasculitis, and small-vessel vasculitis. In this document, we cover large-vessel vasculitis and medium-vessel vasculitis. Due to the challenges of vessel biopsy, imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing this entity. While CTA and MRA can both provide anatomical details of the vessel wall, including wall thickness and enhancement in large-vessel vasculitis, FDG-PET/CT can show functional assessment based on the glycolytic activity of inflammatory cells in the inflamed vessels. Given the size of the vessel in medium-vessel vasculitis, invasive arteriography is still a choice for imaging. However, high-resolution CTA images can depict small-caliber aneurysms, and thus can be utilized in the diagnosis of medium-vessel vasculitis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Imaging of childhood vasculitis [^112rT6vn]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric vasculitides are rare conditions that can represent a diagnostic challenge because symptoms are usually aspecific and variable. Symptoms are related to the size of the involved vessel, extension of disease, and organs affected. The outcome is closely linked to an early diagnosis and proper treatment. Diagnostic imaging allows visualization of the involvement of large-size and medium-size vessels and assesses end-organ changes and response to therapy, thus playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment. This article explores the general features of pediatric vasculitis and discusses the imaging approach and the most common diagnostic findings.

### Large-vessel vasculitis [^112a1ctQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Large-vessel vasculitis (LVV) manifests as inflammation of the aorta and its major branches and is the most common primary vasculitis in adults. LVV comprises two distinct conditions, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, although the phenotypic spectrum of primary LVV is complex. Non-specific symptoms often predominate and so patients with LVV present to a range of health-care providers and settings. Rapid diagnosis, specialist referral and early treatment are key to good patient outcomes. Unfortunately, disease relapse remains common and chronic vascular complications are a source of considerable morbidity. Although accurate monitoring of disease activity is challenging, progress in vascular imaging techniques and the measurement of laboratory biomarkers may facilitate better matching of treatment intensity with disease activity. Further, advances in our understanding of disease pathophysiology have paved the way for novel biologic treatments that target important mediators of disease in both giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. This work has highlighted the substantial heterogeneity present within LVV and the importance of an individualized therapeutic approach. Future work will focus on understanding the mechanisms of persisting vascular inflammation, which will inform the development of increasingly sophisticated imaging technologies. Together, these will enable better disease prognostication, limit treatment-associated adverse effects, and facilitate targeted development and use of novel therapies.

### Imaging in diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the EULAR recommendations [^114bSVKa]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Out of 8691 articles screened, 43 studies were finally included with some of these addressing more than one index test or key objectives (see flow chart in online supplementary figure S1). For GCA, 27 articles focused on the diagnostic accuracy,5 studies on outcome prediction,13 on monitoring disease activityand five on technical aspects. For TAK, four studies were included with two studies addressing diagnostic accuracyand two studies evaluating the value of imaging for monitoring. No study on isolated aortitis was identified.

Diagnostic accuracy studies

For GCA, most diagnostic accuracy studies focused on the role of US (n = 17)or MRI (n = 8). One study addressed the role of PET, and another study examined the role of PET and CTA for GCA diagnosis. In TAK, one study evaluated the role of MRA and another the role of CTA.

Ultrasound

The main study — and patient — characteristics are summarised in table 1 with additional data and details on the RoB assessment described in online supplementary tables S2 and S6, respectively. Most US studies in GCA tested the 'halo' sign (n = 16) as a key elementary lesion defining vasculitis. Other US signs addressed (mostly in combination with the 'halo' sign) were stenosis (n = 13), occlusion (n = 9) and the 'compression' sign (n = 2).

### Imaging in diagnosis, monitoring and outcome prediction of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the 2023 update of the EULAR recommendations [^114xYHMo]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Meta-analyses were performed for diagnostic accuracy studies using the imaging findings as index test, and either clinical diagnosis or TAB as two separate reference standards. Ultrasound findings of different aspects of arterial inflammation, including halo sign, compression sign, stenosis and occlusion were pooled, and reported here as 'halo sign', because they represent different aspects of the same pathological process and because the field has converged on halo sign as the central imaging feature of GCA. If studies reported halo sign and other ultrasound features of GCA separately, the data relating specifically to the halo sign were used in the meta-analysis.

Studies were only included in the meta-analysis if they reported all findings that would allow the calculation of sensitivity and specificity. For all other diagnostic accuracy studies, as well as studies on monitoring, prediction and technical aspects, individual results are reported separately.

To conduct meta-analyses, data from the 2017 SLRand the current update were pooled. Random-effects bivariate generalised binomial mixed models were applied in case three or more studies were available for a certain index test and reference standard combination. These models are the adequate analytical method because they consider correlations between sensitivities and specificities and therefore estimate them together. If only three studies were available for a specific meta-analysis, univariate random-effects models were used instead. Meta-analysis was not performed if less than three studies were available. LR+/LR− was obtained using the delta method.

We report the results of the meta-analysis both for all studies and separately for studies with low RoB. Further subanalyses were performed comparing diagnostic properties between studies assessing cranial arteries (ie, temporal, facial, occipital and maxillary arteries) only and studies assessing both cranial and extracranial arteries using imaging.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted considering studies, in which: (1) all patients were glucocorticoid naïve before imaging; (2) for ultrasound, ≥ 15 MHz probes were used; (3) for MRI, a 3 Tesla machine was used; (4) the clinical diagnosis was confirmed at a follow-up visit; (5) the index test and the reference standard were performed independently from one another (ie, without the assessors of one test being aware of the results of the other test). Sensitivity analyses were performed for all studies fulfilling the mentioned criteria, as well as restricted to the subset of these studies with low RoB whenever possible.

All analyses were performed using R V.4.2.1 using the 'lme4', 'msm' and 'forestploter' packages.

Role of TAB in GCA

The SLR retrieved 13 retrospective observational cohort papersand only three prospective studies, focusing on the diagnostic role of TAB and on the associated clinical features. The data showed the importance of performing TAB as soon as possible, since in one large study including 381 patients sensitivity decreased rapidly with high dose of GC treatment (48% within 3 days vs 33% ≥ 7 days). Nevertheless, another study on a large cohort of 535 consecutive patients had shown similar rates of TAB positivity regardless of previous GC treatment (31% in untreated patients vs 35% in patients exposed to GC before TAB; p = 0.4). The frequency of positive TABs reduced with ongoing GC therapy > 7 days but persisted in 28% of cases treated with GC for over 2 weeks. Interestingly, TABs were re-evaluated by a pathologist blinded to clinical and treatment information. Moreover, one small longitudinal pathological study (40 patients with initial positive TABs) has shown that vasculitis may still be demonstrated on repeated biopsies obtained after 3 (n = 10), 6 (n = 12), 9 (n = 9) or 12 months (n = 9) of GC therapy but with decreasing probability: 70% at 3 months, 75% at 6 months, 44% at 9 and 12 months, respectively.

The recently published study on the Role of Ultrasound compared with Biopsy of Temporal Arteries in the Diagnosis and Treatment of GCA (TABUL) has reported a TAB sensitivity against clinical diagnosis of 39%, with 100% specificity. Assessing the diagnostic performance of TAB has some limitations in GCA since an absolute reference standard for diagnosis is still lacking. The reference clinical diagnosis used in TABUL incorporated TAB results as part of ACR criteria, but also clinician's final diagnosis, emergence of complications consistent with GCA during follow-up or the emergence of alternative diagnosis and the validation by an expert review panel.

The length of TAB is crucial for optimising diagnostic performance. The cut-off with the highest positive predictive value for a positive TAB has been reported to be ≥ 0.7 cm after specimen fixation. A single retrospective multicentre study has suggested that in the presence of inflammatory infiltrate involving the media and media–intima junction (excluding lymphocyte infiltration isolated to the adventitial or periadventitial tissue) the cut-off to optimise sensitivity for an histological confirmation of GCA should be ≥ 0.5 cm.

### Treatment guidelines in vasculitis [^116edbox]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The vasculitides encompass a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the blood vessels with severe consequences including tissue ischemia, structural abnormalities, such as aneurysms/dissections, and end organ damage. The different forms are commonly classified based on the size of the blood vessel involved as large-vessel, medium-vessel, and small-vessel vasculitis. The American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation recently published guidelines on the management of several forms of primary systemic vasculitides. In this review, the recommendations for giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are discussed. We highlight the key recommendations, aspects where they diverge from other published guidelines, controversies, and areas of uncertainty.

### Pediatric vasculitis: recognizing multisystemic manifestations at body imaging [^117VeuEy]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric vasculitides are multisystem diseases that can be diagnostic challenges because of variable clinical manifestations. The clinical manifestation is determined by the size of the affected vessels, organs involved, extent of vascular injury, and underlying pathologic characteristics. Henoch-Schönlein purpura and Kawasaki disease are the two most common subtypes of pediatric vasculitis. Diagnosis of pediatric vasculitis can be difficult, and the outcome can be serious or fatal in the absence of timely intervention. Imaging plays a central role in establishing the diagnosis of vasculitis involving large- and medium-sized vessels, visualizing its vascular and extravascular manifestations, and monitoring the disease course and response to treatment. Although imaging cannot depict the vessel changes of small-vessel vasculitis directly, it can be used to detect tissue damage resulting from vessel inflammation. This article discusses the classification and clinical features of the major pediatric vasculitides. The imaging approach to and nonneurologic findings of major pediatric vasculitis subtypes are reviewed for the pediatric body imager.

### Multimodality imaging to assess diagnosis and evaluate complications of large vesselarteritis [^11744MSp]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Different types of vasculitis can be distinguished according to the blood vessel's size that is preferentially affected: large-vessel, medium-vessel, and small-vessel vasculitides. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) are the main forms of large-vessel vasculitis, and may lead to lumen narrowing. Clinical manifestations of arterial narrowing on the short- and long term include vision loss, stroke, limb ischemia, and heart failure. Imaging tools are well established diagnostic tests for large-vessel vasculitis and may aid therapy monitoring in selected cases while providing important information regarding the occurrence of vascular damage, tissue and organ complications. This review aims to provide the current status of multimodality imaging for the diagnosis and identification of vascular complications in the field of large vessel vasculitis.

### Diagnosing giant cell arteritis: a comprehensive practical guide for the practicing rheumatologist [^112coLZY]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

GCA is the most common large vessel vasculitis in the elderly population. In recent years, advanced imaging has changed the way GCA can be diagnosed in many locations. The GCA fast-track clinic approach combined with US examination allows prompt treatment and diagnosis with high certainty. Fast-track clinics have been shown to improve prognosis while being cost effective. However, all diagnostic modalities are highly operator dependent, and in many locations expertise in advanced imaging may not be available. In this paper, we review the current evidence on GCA diagnostics and propose a simple algorithm for diagnosing GCA for use by rheumatologists not working in specialist centres.

Introduction

Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) is the most common form of primary vasculitis comprising (cranial and large vessel (LV)) giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and idiopathic aortitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of LVV are important to prevent serious ischaemic complications such as visual loss in GCA, vascular stenosis/occlusion in TAK and aneurysm formation in idiopathic aortitis. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) has been the standard test to confirm the diagnosis of GCA; although highly specific, biopsy is invasive and lacks sensitivity, with false-negative results in up to 61% of patients compared with a clinical diagnosis of GCA. In addition, extracranial arteries are usually not accessible for histological assessment, and in extracranial LV-GCA, temporal arteries are spared in up to 40% of patients. Consequently, GCA diagnosis often relies on the combination of clinical symptoms, elevated serum inflammatory markers and imaging findings.

The classification criteria for TAK focus on the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusions as detected by conventional angiography. Conventional angiography, however, does not allow the delineation of vessel wall changes and bears the potential risk of complications, such as allergic reactions, haematoma, iatrogenic embolisation and arterial dissection. Therefore, angiography is being increasingly replaced by newer imaging modalities.

Aortitis is common in GCA and TAK but rarely occurs as an isolated (idiopathic) disease. The diagnosis of idiopathic aortitis is frequently based on radiological findings with inflammatory wall changes of the aorta because histological assessment is only possible if aortic aneurysms are operated.

The role of imaging modalities including ultrasound (US), MRI, CT and 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) in LVV has been addressed in several studies over the last years. Imaging modalities, however, are not yet uniformly used for the diagnosis and monitoring of LVV in clinical practice. A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) project has therefore been undertaken to develop recommendations for the use of imaging in LVV in clinical practice.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to summarise the available evidence on the performance of imaging techniques on diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of disease activity and damage in LVV, as well as technical aspects of imaging modalities in order to inform the EULAR task force developing these new recommendations.

### Imaging in diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the EULAR recommendations [^114abqr6]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

In TAK, both studies on MRA and CTA revealed excellent sensitivities and specificities using conventional angiography as the reference standard. These studies, however, were small, included (partially) the same patients and there was a long interval between MRA/CTA and angiography. Future studies on the diagnostic performance of imaging techniques in TAK are thus warranted, and there is a need for a novel reference standard, given that conventional angiography is highly invasive.

Current evidence on the role for imaging modalities for outcome prediction, as well as for monitoring disease activity and damage in LVV is limited. Although a response of vessel wall alterations to GC treatment was detected in both, cranial and extracranial LV-GCA and TAK, neither imaging findings at baseline nor during follow-up were clearly associated with a disease relapse or any other outcome. Besides, monitoring studies were mainly descriptive and without clear inferences, thus precluding drawing a clear conclusion from them that could be of further information for an SLR like ours. The decision to include these studies in the current SLR was solely based on content knowledge, while from a methodological point of view, this decision is obviously arguable. Now, 15 studies on monitoring are included in this SLR, as we were inclusive, and facing a scarcity of studies, tried to retrieve from the literature any information on the value of imaging for monitoring LVV. However, we could have also been somewhat more restrictive by only including studies that analysed any association between the imaging for monitoring and other outcomes (eg, relapse); if this was the case, no eligible study would have been found in the literature. The development of standard tools for monitoring disease activity and damage in LVV is urgently needed and might facilitate further research on the evaluation of the role of imaging for disease monitoring and outcome prediction.

Table 2
Results of the meta-analysis (pooled estimates) for ultrasound and MRI signs of vasculitis in comparison with clinical diagnosis or temporal artery biopsy as reference standard for giant cell arteritis (GCA)

Eight studies (n = 605, three studies with low RoB)investigated the value of the 'halo' sign in comparison with the clinical diagnosis of cranial GCA yielding a pooled sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 62% to 87%) and a specificity of 96% (95% CI 85% to 99%). A similarly good diagnostic performance was obtained when the 'halo' sign was compared with TAB as reference standard (seven studies, n = 289, no study with low RoB). Also, the evaluation of the combination of US signs defining vasculitis ('halo', stenosis or occlusion) in comparison with clinical diagnosis (three studies, n = 560, no study with low RoB)or TAB (five studies, n = 611, one study with low RoB)resulted in a similar diagnostic performance as the 'halo' sign alone. Sensitivity analyses for the diagnostic performance of the 'halo' sign (compared with clinical diagnosis of cranial GCA) as detailed above, revealed higher pooled sensitivities (86%–89%) than the main analysis and comparable or slightly lower specificities. The only exception was the analysis including only studies without GC treatment before the index test, which had a slightly lower sensitivity of 73% (table 3).

### The last classification of vasculitis [^117MCV66]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic vasculitides are a group of diverse conditions characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. To obtain homogeneity in clinical characteristics, prognosis, and response to treatment, patients with vasculitis should be classified into defined disease categories. Many classification schemes have been proposed, but the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and the Chapel Hill definitions for the systemic vasculitides are most widely used. The ACR criteria for classifying a patient with vasculitis within a specific disease entity are useful in clinical practice; but, in many cases, their application results in overlapping diagnoses, particularly in patients with small vessel vasculitis and classical polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The Chapel Hill definitions cannot be used as classification criteria in clinical practice. A recently developed algorithm for the antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies-associated vasculitides and PAN, based both on the Chapel Hill definitions and the ACR criteria and in which clinical data and serological findings are included, proved useful for correctly classifying patients. The use of this algorithm together with the definitions for the large vessel vasculitides may result in a more unifying approach to the classification of the primary systemic vasculitides.

Sensitivity analyses for diagnostic studies on ultrasound ('halo' sign) and MRI in comparison with clinical diagnosis for cranial giant cell arteritis (GCA) as reference standard

Two studies (n = 140, both with low RoB), conducted by the same research group, investigated the 'compression' sign. The authors reported sensitivities of 77%–79% and a specificity of 100% of this sign compared with the clinical diagnosis of cranial GCA.

In three US studies(n = 541, one study with low RoB), extracranial arteries were examined. Only one of these addressed the effect of the examination of temporal plus axillary arteries on the diagnostic performance as compared with the assessment of temporal arteries alone. This study revealed an incremental change of sensitivity of 2% by the former compared with the latter approach. Although 22 arteries were evaluated in the study by Aschwanden et al a low sensitivity of 55% was observed for US ('halo' and stenosis) to detect vasculitis. No separate results for the diagnostic performance of US in patients with cranial and extracranial LV involvement were provided in that study.

No study on US in TAK was identified.

### Influence of the EULAR recommendations for the use of imaging in large vessel vasculitis in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis: results of the ARTESER register [^1179FZPw]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults. It is associated with considerable morbidity; vision loss is common if initiation of treatment is delayed and stroke and constitutional symptoms may occur. For decades, temporal artery biopsy (TAB) has been the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of GCA, but it has only a moderate sensitivity (of 40–60%), with false-negative results due to skip lesions and difficulties detecting involvement of extracranial arteries.

In recent years, several studies have found various imaging modalities, including vascular ultrasound, MRI, CT and positron emission tomography (PET) to have high sensitivity and specificity for GCA. Evidence from imaging in the diagnosis of the disease has allowed widening of the concept from cranial disease diagnosed by TAB to isolated or associated involvement of large extracranial vessels. Ultrasound is now recommended as a first-line diagnostic tool in GCA in current European guidelines, and TAB or additional imaging tests are considered redundant in patients with positive imaging and a high clinical probability of GCA. In patients with a low clinical probability and a negative imaging result, the diagnosis of GCA can be considered unlikely. In all other situations, additional efforts towards a diagnosis are necessary.

To standardise research studies, various classification systems have been used. Currently, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of GCAare probably the most widely used, but the positive predictive value of these criteria is based on the high specificity of TAB, though it has been reported to have insufficient sensitivity. Therefore, in the latest EULAR recommendations on the use of imaging in GCA, imaging techniques were accepted as new useful tools in GCA with high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis and assessment of large vessel vasculitis. This means that the GCA classification criteria are currently under discussion and evolution. Meanwhile, the diagnosis is based on the experience and judgement of the clinician. Our main objective was to determine how TAB and the new imaging techniques are being used in the diagnosis of GCA in recent years and whether the publication of the EULAR recommendations has changed diagnostic practice in our hospitals.

### Takayasu's arteritis – recent advances in imaging offer promise [^112CZdDt]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Takayasu's arteritis (TA), a rare large vessel vasculitis of unknown aetiology, remains a difficult disease to manage with diagnosis often delayed until the late occlusive stage when irreversible vascular damage has occurred. Recent studies suggest that non-invasive imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) allow diagnosis of TA earlier in the disease course than standard angiography and provide a means for monitoring disease activity. Choice of appropriate therapy for TA is limited by a lack of evidence and a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs is most commonly used. Novel therapeutic approaches such as the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors and drug-eluting arterial stents show promise for improving the prognosis in severe disease. In addition, strict management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension and lifestyle factors is mandatory to minimize secondary cardiovascular complications, which are the major cause of death in this disease.

The last two years have been marked by significant achievement in the identification of the basic mechanisms of systemic vasculitis and in the translation of these mechanisms into targeted therapies. More specifically, new insights into the environmental, cellular, and genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis have been provided. Consequently, several studies focused on the development of novel strategies to achieve and maintain clinical remission in small- and large-vessel vascultis, including relevant large multicentre trials, have been promoted. The highlights of these studies, their potential clinical implications and the unmet needs, which are still to be addressed, are summarised in this review.

### Endovascular treatment of large vessel arteritis [^11128xAk]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Large vessel vasculitis is very uncommon, particularly in Western countries, but can cause serious sequelae. Large vessel vasculitis is usually due to either Takayasu arteritis or giant cell arteritis. The available laboratory tests are nonspecific, so the diagnosis is often dependent on imaging findings. The location and pattern of vessel narrowing will usually define the type of vasculitis. Symptomatic vascular stenoses and occlusions can frequently be managed using balloon angioplasty. Familiarity with the indications for treatment and techniques and outcomes associated with angioplasty and surgical alternatives is essential when treating these rare disorders.

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis of large and medium-sized vessel vasculitis [^111DX9QG]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

In large-vessel vasculitis, imaging studies are useful to document temporal artery involvement and crucial to show large-vessel involvement. Color Doppler sonography, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography show early vasculitic lesions. Angiography delineates later vascular complications well. Color Doppler sonography, magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomography angiography can also be used to show vascular luminal changes. Positron emission tomography is very sensitive in detecting large-vessel inflammation. Imaging procedures can also be used to monitor the course of large-vessel vasculitis. In medium-vessel vasculitis, imaging studies can be used to show both vascular changes and internal organ changes.

### Giant cell arteritis: is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing? [^113RibXz]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis of large and middle-sized arteries that affects patients aged over 50 years. It can show a typical clinical picture consisting of cranial manifestations but sometimes nonspecific symptoms and large-vessel involvement prevail. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to avoid irreversible damage.

Discussion

There has been an increasing knowledge on the occurrence of the disease without the typical cranial symptoms and its close relationship and overlap with polymyalgia rheumatica, and this may contribute to reduce the number of underdiagnosed patients. Although temporal artery biopsy is still the gold-standard and temporal artery ultrasonography is being widely used, newer imaging techniques (FDG-PET/TAC, MRI, CT) can be of valuable help to identify giant cell arteritis, in particular in those cases with a predominance of extracranial large-vessel manifestations.

Conclusions

Giant cell arteritis is a more heterogeneous condition than previously thought. Awareness of all the potential clinical manifestations and judicious use of diagnostic tests may be an aid to avoid delayed detection and consequently ominous complications.

### Imaging in diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the EULAR recommendations [^113Qf6ig]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

RoB of the studies was appraised independently by the same two reviewers who conducted the SLR. For studies on diagnostic accuracy, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used comprising four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, as well as flow and timing. Each of these domains was evaluated as having a 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' RoB, whereas concerns about applicability were evaluated in the first three domains also as 'low', 'high' or 'unclear'. The Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was applied for the assessment of prognostic studies evaluating the following aspects: study participation and attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding as well as statistical analysis/reporting. Each QUIPS domain was rated as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'unclear' RoB. For studies on monitoring and technical aspects, no RoB assessment was performed, because identified studies were mainly only descriptive (see below), hence no adequate RoB assessment could be performed. Discrepancies between reviewers regarding study selection, data extraction and RoB assessment were solved by discussion. A third reviewer (WAS) was involved in case no consensus could be achieved (n = 2 studies).

### Large vessel giant cell arteritis [^112hS23Q]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is the principal form of systemic vasculitis affecting people over 50. Large-vessel involvement, termed large vessel giant cell arteritis, mainly affects the aorta and its branches, often occurring alongside cranial giant cell arteritis, but large vessel giant cell arteritis without cranial giant cell arteritis can also occur. Patients mostly present with constitutional symptoms, with localising large vessel giant cell arteritis symptoms present in a minority of patients only. Large vessel giant cell arteritis is usually overlooked until clinicians seek to exclude it with imaging by ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-CT. Although the role of imaging in treatment monitoring remains uncertain, imaging by MRA or CTA is crucial for identifying aortic aneurysm formation during patient follow up. In this Series paper, we define the large vessel subset of giant cell arteritis and summarise its clinical challenges. Furthermore, we identify areas for future research regarding the management of large vessel giant cell arteritis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporal arteritis… [^117DhFG3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Elderly patients are more likely to be affected by temporal arteritis, an inflammatory vasculitis. Patients with TA tend to present in a variety of ways, with ocular and systemic symptoms. Lee and Brazis developed a guide for the evaluation of patients with TA based on a search of the literature from 1966 to 1998. The authors developed the following criteria for evaluation of patients: clinical suspicion, laboratory testing and temporal artery biopsy. Clinical suspicion can be based, in part, on the American College of Rheumatology study that determined highly sensitive parameters for diagnosis of TA. These parameters include age more than 50 years, a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 50 mm per hour and an abnormal temporal artery biopsy. The highest specific clinical features include jaw or tongue claudication, visual abnormalities and temporal artery abnormalities.

High clinical suspicion includes any one of these three criteria in a patient more than 50 years of age with an elevated ESR, or if three or more of the following four criteria are met: new localized headache, temporal artery abnormality, elevated ESR and abnormal temporal artery biopsy. TA should be suspected in patients more than 50 years of age who have a diagnosis of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Steroid therapy should be initiated. A unilateral temporal artery biopsy should be performed, and treatment should be initiated if the biopsy is positive for TA. If the biopsy is negative but suspicion remains high, a con-tralateral biopsy should be considered. Patients with medium clinical suspicion for TA should undergo an ESR and a temporal artery biopsy.

Medium clinical suspicion is classified as meeting any one of the highest specificity criteria or having anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In addition, any two of the following represents medium clinical suspicion: elevated ESR, new headache in an older patient or a clinical temporal artery abnormality. It should also be remembered that an ESR of 40 mm per hour should not be considered abnormal in patients more than 65 years of age. C-reactive protein, an acute-phase reactant, is also considered a marker for TA.

### Multimodality imaging of large-vessel vasculitis, from theSpecial series on inflammation [^1174JqSA]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Large-vessel vasculitis (LVV) is a noninfectious inflammation of the large vessels, including the aorta and its main branches. Imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing LVV given the challenges of tissue biopsy. This article reviews the types of LVV and the multimodality imaging tools available to establish its diagnosis. The cornerstone of imaging diagnosis is morphologic assessment using gray-scale ultrasound (US), gray-scale US combined with color Doppler US, CTA, or MRA. In the last decade, substantial progress has been made in functional and molecular imaging with FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis of LVV. Investigation is ongoing to develop novel MRA techniques and new PET tracers to assess disease activity and to differentiate the various vasculitides. An algorithm is provided to guide imaging technique selection based on the patient's specific clinical presentation.

### Aortitis: recent advances, current concepts and future possibilities [^114dyFzg]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Broadly defined, aortitis refers to inflammation of the aorta and incorporates both infectious and non-infectious aetiologies. As advanced imaging modalities are increasingly incorporated into clinical practice, the phenotypic spectrum associated with aortitis has widened. The primary large vessel vasculitides, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, are the most common causes of non-infectious aortitis. Aortitis without systemic disease or involvement of other vascular territories is classified as clinically isolated aortitis. Periaortitis, where inflammation spreads beyond the aortic wall, is an important disease subset with a distinct group of aetiologies. Infectious aortitis can involve bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens and, while uncommon, can be devastating. Importantly, optimal management strategies and patient outcomes differ between aortitis subgroups highlighting the need for a thorough diagnostic workup. Monitoring disease activity over time is also challenging as normal inflammatory markers do not exclude significant vascular inflammation, particularly after starting treatment. Additional areas of unmet clinical need include clear disease classifications and improved short-term and long-term management strategies. Some of these calls are now being answered, particularly with regard to large vessel vasculitis where our understanding has advanced significantly in recent years. Work extrapolated from temporal artery histology has paved the way for targeted biological agents and, although glucocorticoids remain central to the management of non-infectious aortitis, these may allow reduced glucocorticoid reliance. Future work should seek to clarify disease definitions, improve diagnostic pathways and ultimately allow a more stratified approach to patient management.

### Imaging in systemic vasculitis [^111JWFjm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Imaging is becoming a relevant tool for the assessment of patients with systemic vasculitis. This review focuses on recently generated data with potential clinical impact in the diagnosis, evaluation of disease extent and management of systemic vasculitis.

Recent Findings

Temporal artery examination by color duplex ultrasonography (CDUS) is a valuable approach to the diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis. Evaluation of additional arteries may increase its diagnostic performance. However, CDUS-specific findings may not be detected in arteries with early inflammation and CDUS-guidance of temporal artery biopsy does not seem to significantly increase its diagnostic yield. Large-vessel involvement detected by computed tomography angiography occurs in two out of three of patients with giant-cell arteritis at diagnosis. Furthermore, significant ascending aortic dilatation can be observed in one out of three of patients after long-term follow-up. Objective cut-offs for detecting large-vessel inflammation by positron emission tomography (PET) are trying to be established through prospective studies. PET may also contribute to the assessment of disease extent in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis or Behçet's disease.

Summary

Data generated by existing and emerging imaging techniques are expected to have a major impact in the diagnosis, appraisal of disease extent, evaluation of disease activity and response to treatment in patients with systemic vasculitis.

### Diagnostic approach in giant cell arteritis [^116x2oaD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is the most common form of vasculitis in the elderly. While initially described as involving the temporal arteries, GCA can also affect the aorta and its major branches. Despite the increased use of imaging modalities and the availability of temporal artery biopsy, diagnosing GCA remains challenging. GCA should be considered a spectrum, with diagnostic methodologies tailored to the prevalent symptoms. The sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic approaches can vary depending on the clinical setting. Timing in diagnosing GCA is crucial to prevent serious complications, such as blindness and cerebrovascular ischemic events. While the prompt initiation of glucocorticoids (GCs) has reduced the incidence of major ischemic events, an uncertain diagnosis may expose the patient to unnecessary harm, such as complications from overtreatment or organ damage due to inadequate control of vasculitis. This narrative review will summarize the most widely available diagnostic techniques for GCA and outline our approach for cases where the diagnosis may be uncertain.

### Systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis: focus on giant cell arteritis [^116c1Das]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To analyse the current evidence for the management of large vessel vasculitis (LVV) to inform the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendations.

Methods

Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) dealing with diagnosis/monitoring and treatment strategies for LVV, respectively, were performed. Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to 31 December 2017. Evidence on imaging was excluded as recently published in dedicated EULAR recommendations. This paper focuses on the data relevant to giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Results

We identified 287 eligible articles (122 studies focused on diagnosis/monitoring, 165 on treatment). The implementation of a fast-track approach to diagnosis significantly lowers the risk of permanent visual loss compared with historical cohorts (level of evidence, LoE 2b). Reliable diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for GCA are still not available (LoE 3b). The SLR confirms the efficacy of prompt initiation of glucocorticoids (GC). There is no high-quality evidence on the most appropriate starting dose, route of administration, tapering and duration of GC (LoE 4). Patients with GCA are at increased risk of dose-dependent GC-related adverse events (LoE 3b). The addition of methotrexate or tocilizumab reduces relapse rates and GC requirements (LoE 1b). There is no consistent evidence that initiating antiplatelet agents at diagnosis would prevent future ischaemic events (LoE 2a). There is little evidence to guide monitoring of patients with GCA.

Conclusions

Results from two SLRs identified novel evidence on the management of GCA to guide the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendations on the management of LVV.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology / vasculitis foundation guideline for the management of giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis [^1129RMxq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations and expert guidance for the management of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) as exemplars of large vessel vasculitis.

Methods

Clinical questions regarding diagnostic testing, treatment, and management were developed in the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) format for GCA and TAK (27 for GCA, 27 for TAK). Systematic literature reviews were conducted for each PICO question. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. Recommendations were developed by the Voting Panel, comprising adult and pediatric rheumatologists and patients. Each recommendation required ≥ 70% consensus among the Voting Panel.

Results

We present 22 recommendations and 2 ungraded position statements for GCA, and 20 recommendations and 1 ungraded position statement for TAK. These recommendations and statements address clinical questions relating to the use of diagnostic testing, including imaging, treatments, and surgical interventions in GCA and TAK. Recommendations for GCA include support for the use of glucocorticoid-sparing immunosuppressive agents and the use of imaging to identify large vessel involvement. Recommendations for TAK include the use of nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive agents with glucocorticoids as initial therapy. There were only 2 strong recommendations; the remaining recommendations were conditional due to the low quality of evidence available for most PICO questions.

Conclusion

These recommendations provide guidance regarding the evaluation and management of patients with GCA and TAK, including diagnostic strategies, use of pharmacologic agents, and surgical interventions.

### The role of 18F-FDG positron emission tomography for the diagnosis of vasculitides [^117JgnnZ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Large-vessel vasculitis is the most common form of primary vasculitis comprising cranial and large-vessel giant cell arteritis, Takayasu's arteritis and idiopathic aortitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of large-vessel vasculitis are important to prevent potentially serious emergencies such as visual loss, vascular stenosis and aneurysm formation. Temporal artery biopsy has long been the standard for diagnosing GCA - an invasive technique that lacks sensitivity compared to a clinical diagnosis that relies on a combination of clinical symptoms, elevated serum inflammatory markers and imaging findings. Conventional angiography focussing on the detection of arterial stenoses and occlusion does not assess vessel wall changes. Therefore, angiography is being increasingly replaced by newer imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and 18F-FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography. However, imaging modalities also including ultrasound are not uniformly used for diagnosis and monitoring of large-vessel vasculitis in clinical practice. Very recently recommendations for imaging have been developed by the European League Against Rheumatism and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging in cooperation with the European Association of Nuclear Medicine and an interest group endorsed by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology. These and a small literature search using PubMed are the basis for this review.

### Role of imaging studies in the diagnosis and follow-up of large-vessel vasculitis: an update [^116qSrG1]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Imaging studies play a central role in diagnosing and monitoring giant-cell and Takayasu arteritis. Deep, large vessels can be examined by CT or MRI, while colour Doppler ultrasound and MRI have been used with promising results to investigate the temporal arteries. Positron emission tomography is very sensitive in detecting large-vessel inflammation, although it does not delineate the vessel wall. Imaging procedures can also be used to monitor the disease course. However, imaging signs of inflammation may sometimes persist despite clinical remission and, conversely, seemingly unaffected vessels may develop alterations later on.

### Usefulness of PET in recognizing and managing vasculitides [^117HFL26]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article was to review the recent contributions to the scoring methods of PET in vasculitis as well as to its role in the diagnostic work-up.

Recent Findings

Both visual and semiquantitative scoring methods can be used to interpret PET scans. PET has been shown to be both sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of large-vessel vasculitis. In addition, it also has a role in predicting vascular complications.

Summary

There is a need to better standardize the scoring methods used to interpret PET scans. In clinical practice, PET is useful to diagnose untreated individuals with suspected large-vessel vasculitis and contributes to identify patients at risk for vascular complications.

### 2022 American College of Rheumatology / EULAR classification criteria for giant cell arteritis [^115TC6yp]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACR/EULAR classification criteria for giant cell arteritis" for giant cell arteritis.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for giant cell arteritis is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this condition. The criteria incorporate a combination of clinical, laboratory, imaging, and biopsy findings to provide a comprehensive assessment of the likelihood of giant cell arteritis.

The primary components of the ACR/EULAR criteria include evidence of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis on imaging, exclusion of alternative diagnoses mimicking vasculitis, and age of 50 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Clinical criteria encompass morning stiffness in the shoulders or neck, sudden visual loss, jaw or tongue claudication, new temporal headache, scalp tenderness, and abnormal examination of the temporal artery. Laboratory, imaging, and biopsy criteria include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels, positive temporal artery biopsy or halo sign on temporal artery ultrasound, bilateral axillary involvement, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography activity throughout the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are designed to provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, facilitating early recognition and treatment of this potentially sight-threatening condition.

The calculator is designed to evaluate the likelihood of giant cell arteritis (GCA) by analyzing various clinical inputs and assigning a score to each. This score helps determine whether the diagnostic criteria for GCA are met, aiding in the diagnosis process.

Based on a set of 13 criteria commonly associated with GCA, each input is a Yes/No response indicating the presence or absence of specific clinical signs, symptoms, or test results. Each positive (Yes) response adds a designated number of points to the total score. Here's a brief overview of how the criteria are scored:

- **Evidence of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis on imaging**: 30 points
- **Alternative diagnoses mimicking vasculitis are excluded**: 30 points
- **Age 50 years or older at the time of diagnosis**: 30 points
- **Morning stiffness in shoulders or neck**: 2 points
- **Sudden visual loss**: 3 points
- **Jaw or tongue claudication**: 2 points
- **New temporal headache**: 2 points
- **Scalp tenderness**: 2 points
- Abnormal examination of the temporal artery (e.g., absent/diminished pulse, tenderness, hard cord-like appearance): 2 points
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm/hour or higher, or C-reactive protein 10 mg/L or higher before treatment: 3 points
- **Positive temporal artery biopsy or halo sign on temporal artery ultrasound**: 5 points
- Bilateral axillary involvement with changes like stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm: 2 points
- FDG-PET activity throughout descending thoracic and abdominal aorta with uptake greater than liver: 2 points

The total possible score ranges from 0 to 115, with higher scores indicating a stronger likelihood of GCA.

Interpretation is straightforward:

- If the total score is 96 or more, the diagnosis criteria for giant cell arteritis are considered met.
- If the score is below 96, the criteria are not met.

This tool standardizes the evaluation by quantifying clinical features pertinent to GCA, allowing for a systematic approach to diagnosis.

### Nomenclature and classification of vasculitis-update on the ACR / EULAR diagnosis and classification of vasculitis study (DCVAS) [^112WtPrV]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Classification of vasculitis remains unsatisfactory. This is largely because the pathogenetic mechanisms of this family of related disorders have not been fully understood. Existing classification criteria are useful but limited. This has become more apparent with the advent of more effective and more specific therapies. A rational basis for classification could significantly improve our approach to treatment. The development of diagnostic criteria in vasculitis is an even greater challenge but may ultimately provide more useful for the non-specialist clinician. International efforts are underway to provide more effective classification and diagnostic criteria.

Vasculitis, a systemic disease characterised by inflammation of the blood vessels, remains challenging to diagnose and manage. Vessel size has been the basis for classifying systemic vasculitides. Imaging plays a vital role in diagnosing this challenging disease. This review article aims (a) to summarise up-to-date literature in this field, as well as include classification updates and (b) to review available imaging techniques, recent advances, and emphasis on imaging findings to diagnose large vessel vasculitides.

### Mimics of vasculitis [^114fRpDb]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

While prompt diagnosis of vasculitis is important, recognition of vasculitis mimics is equally essential. As in the case of vasculitis, an approach to mimics based on the anatomic size of vessels can be useful. Infections can mimic vasculitis of any vessel size, including the formation of aneurysms and induction of ANCAs. Genetic disorders and vasculopathies are important considerations in large and medium vessel vasculitis. Cholesterol emboli, thrombotic conditions and calciphylaxis typically affect the medium and small vessels and, like vasculitis, can cause cutaneous, renal and CNS manifestations. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is important to distinguish from primary angiitis of the CNS. As an incorrect diagnosis of vasculitis can result in harmful consequences, it is imperative that the evaluation of suspected vasculitis includes consideration of mimics. We discuss the above mimics and outline a systematic and practical approach for differentiating vasculitis from its mimics.

### Influence of the EULAR recommendations for the use of imaging in large vessel vasculitis in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis: results of the ARTESER register [^111A4iz1]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Another important finding associated with the introduction of imaging techniques for the assessment in GCA is the increase in the diagnosis of the large vessel vasculitis subtype, this increasing by 65%, with no decrease in the rate of diagnosis of cranial forms, which suggests that the inclusion of imaging leads to an expansion in the diagnosis of all GCA subtypes. This higher rate of diagnosis of large vessel involvement is consistent with recent publications that show a higher frequency of the large vessel subtype in this disease, and the value of imaging for improving the accuracy of GCA diagnosis

Limitations of the study include its retrospective nature, which implies a risk of information bias caused by inaccurate recording of the data. To address this, all researchers had a previous meeting with the principal investigator to clarify the procedure for accurate retrieval of the data of interest. Another limitation of the study was the potential variability in the use of imaging tests and biopsies between the hospitals. The different hospitals have used the best standard methods and evidence in the use of PET, but the cited standards were changed along the time, PET studies. The US machine/probes and expertise of the ultrasonographers differ in the different hospitals. Nonetheless, with the participation of 26 hospitals across different regions and data collected on 1675 cases, we believe that the results are a good reflection of real clinical practice in Spain. An additional limitation is that we did not exclusively use the ACR classification criteria, since imaging tests are not yet included in these criteria. Our gold standard for diagnosis was the clinical judgement of the physician, and the results show that the adoption of image techniques in daily clinical practice could account for updating criteria for classifying the disease.

In summary, TAB was the most widely used diagnostic method for confirming GCA, but today, following the publication of the EULAR recommendations in 2018, ultrasound has displaced biopsy as the leading diagnostic test. The use of PET-TC for diagnosis is also growing, this type of imaging having been performed in around 20% of patients in the last 3 years of the study. There is a wide margin for improvement in the diagnosis of GCA; however, a quarter of diagnoses still being made clinically, without TAB or additional imaging tests. Concerning the subtypes of GCA, cranial involvement is the most common, but the diagnosis of the extracranial large vessel subtype has increased in recent years in line with the use of imaging, and the rate of this subtype detected is likely to increase further in the coming years.

### Diagnostic value of [18F] FDG-PET / CT for treatment monitoring in large vessel vasculitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113C5LhN]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

The current systematic review and meta-analysis provide a comprehensive overview on the value of [18F]FDG-PET/CT for treatment monitoring in patients with LVV. The majority of studies indicates that arterial [18F]FDG uptake improves upon clinical remission in patients treated for LVV. It remains to be elucidated, however, to what extent [18F]FDG-PET/CT completely normalizes during clinical remission. Overall, [18F]FDG-PET/CT has moderate diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between patients with active disease and those in clinical remission. Differences in technical aspects and interpretation of [18F]FDG-PET/CT, as well as clinical differences among the included patients, may have contributed to marked between-study heterogeneity.

Current data indicate that [18F]FDG-PET/CT may aid in monitoring treatment response in patients with LVV, but its findings need to be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings. Careful evaluation of symptoms and laboratory markers remains a critical step in the assessment of disease activity. Due to its moderate diagnostic accuracy in patients on treatment (sensitivity 77%, specificity 71%), a [18F]FDG-PET/CT scan by itself cannot rule in or rule out disease activity. Prior recommendations on imaging in LVV have recognized the potential role of FDG-PET/CT for monitoring treatment response. Despite the paucity of evidence, other imaging methods such as ultrasonography, MRA and CTA are also often applied to monitor treatment in LVV. Although [18F]FDG-PET/CT has various drawbacks including high cost and radiation exposure, it has several advantages. [18F]FDG-PET/CT is inherently a whole-body imaging method and allows for a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant large arteries in a single scan. Even temporal arteries might be evaluated due to improved resolution on newer camera systems. [18F]FDG-PET/CT also allows evaluation of concomitant PMR in patients with GCA. Contrast-induced nephropathy is not an issue for [18F]FDG-PET/CT as no contrast is needed. Since [18F]FDG-PET/CT detects metabolic activity in the arterial wall, it could also provide complementary information to other imaging methods. For instance, persistence or gradually worsening of arterial wall thickening in the absence of [18F]FDG uptake might suggests 'burnt out fibrotic disease'. Further studies are needed to firmly establish a role for [18F]FDG-PET/CT and other imaging methods in the management of LVV.

Fast-track approach

The consequences of disease progression in TAK may be severe, and a rapid diagnosis and treatment would likely reduce the likelihood of vascular damage, as shown for GCA, where implementation of fast-track clinics leads to an improved prognosis. However, this approach to diagnosis is probably not as relevant in TAK as it is for GCA, and may be difficult to implement, given the usual subacute clinical presentation and pattern of disease progression. No studies regarding such an approach in TAK were found.

Role of histology

Histological evaluation is not routinely performed in TAK since this is only possible if surgery is needed or in the event of death. This SLR did not find relevant papers in this regard.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to illustrate multitechnique imaging findings in patients with primary and secondary vasculitides involving large and medium-sized vessels and their mimics.

Conclusion

Large and medium-sized vessels are affected by many primary and secondary inflammatory disorders or mimicking conditions, often presenting similar imaging characteristics. Knowledge of distinctive imaging features such as location, length, and degree of vessel wall enhancement as well as the particular clinical settings will help the clinician in appropriately narrowing down the differential diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION

The primary vasculitides are autoimmune diseases affecting blood vessels. Different types of vasculitis can be distinguished according to the blood vessel's size that is preferentially affected: large-vessel, medium-vessel, and small-vessel vasculitides. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) are the main forms of large vessel vasculitis (LVV).

GCA is prevalent among older individuals (> 50), with the highest incidence noted in individuals of Northern-European descent. GCA may cause inflammation of both large systemic arteries (large vessel GCA; lvGCA) and medium-sized cranial arteries (cranial GCA; cGCA). The complications of cGCA include blindness and stroke, whereas aortic dissection is a feared complication of lvGCA. A meta-analysis of studies with systematic imaging reported a pooled prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysms of 15%. On the other hand, TAK primarily occurs in young females, with a predilection for those of Asian descent. TAK more commonly causes focal stenotic lesions than GCA. Hence, loss of peripheral pulsations is more frequently observed in TAK than in GCA. In addition, TAK more frequently causes symptomatic stenotic lesions in the visceral arteries than GCA.

Comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluation is critical in patients with vasculitis. For long, temporal artery biopsy was the standard test for GCA, while conventional angiography was the main test for TAK. However, other imaging methods have now largely replaced these tests. This includes ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and [18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy — glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). These imaging tools are well established diagnostic tests for LVV. In addition, these imaging techniques may aid therapy monitoring in selected cases while providing important information regarding the occurrence of damage. Overall, these imaging modalities provide complementary information to each other and can therefore be used in parallel.

This review aims to provide the current status of multimodality imaging for the diagnosis and identification of vascular complications in the field of LVV.

Systemic vasculitides are autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. They are categorized based on the size of the preferentially affected blood vessels: large-, medium-, and small-vessel vasculitides. The main forms of large-vessel vasculitis include giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK). Depending on the location of the affected vessels, various imaging modalities can be employed for diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis: ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and [18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). These imaging tools offer complementary information about vascular changes occurring in vasculitis. Recent advances in PET imaging in large vessel vasculitis include the introduction of digital long axial field-of-view PET/CT, dedicated acquisition, quantitative methodologies, and the availability of novel radiopharmaceuticals. This review aims to provide an update on the current status of PET imaging in large vessel vasculitis and to share the latest developments on imaging vasculitides.
