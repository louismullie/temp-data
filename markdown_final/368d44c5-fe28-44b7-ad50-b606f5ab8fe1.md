## Question

How is removal of a melanoma on the ear performed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how removal of a melanoma on the ear is performed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic biopsy approach and initial staging. Then, I should define wide local excision margins by tumor thickness and anatomic constraints. Next, I will determine the appropriate deep plane of excision and whether to resect perichondrium or cartilage. After that, I need to plan for intraoperative margin control strategies and reconstruction. I will then consider sentinel lymph node biopsy indications and timing with lymphatic mapping. Finally, I should review postoperative management, special auricular subsite considerations such as the external auditory canal, and summarize key principles with attention to areas of controversy and self-correction.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic step. For any pigmented lesion suspicious for melanoma on the ear, the preferred diagnostic method is a narrow excisional biopsy that removes the entire breadth of the lesion with 1–3 mm clinical margins and sufficient depth to avoid transecting the base, which optimizes accurate Breslow thickness and staging and preserves lymphatic channels for subsequent SLNB mapping if indicated [^114R5Xio] [^112JfRB6] [^1155GuEZ]. Wait, let me verify the role of partial biopsies in constrained areas like the helix or concha; although partial techniques risk understaging, deep saucerization or punch excision that captures full thickness down to subcutis can be acceptable when anatomic constraints preclude complete excision at the first pass, provided they are performed to adequate depth and followed by definitive excision once histology is available [^114R5Xio] [^117UXE9v]. I need to ensure the pathology report includes Breslow thickness, ulceration, and mitotic rate to guide definitive margins and SLNB planning [^112JfRB6].

> Next, I should review lymphatic mapping because ear drainage is notoriously variable. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is essential to identify sentinel nodal basins, which often include ipsilateral cervical level II as well as preauricular and postauricular fields, but can involve multiple ipsilateral neck levels in the same patient, so mapping individualizes the SLNB plan and reduces the risk of a false-negative node [^113VxTem]. Hold on, I should verify laterality concerns; in the largest mapping series, contralateral neck drainage was not observed for external ear primaries, but multiple ipsilateral basins were common, underscoring the need to plan for more than one sentinel node during the SLNB procedure [^113VxTem].

> Now, I will define margins for melanoma in situ on the ear. The baseline recommendation is a 0.5–1.0 cm clinical margin for MIS, but I need to check for lentigo maligna behavior on the ear, where subclinical spread is frequent and 5 mm margins are often inadequate, making tissue-sparing techniques with exhaustive margin control attractive. Data from large MMS and staged excision series show that 6 mm clears about 86% and 9 mm about 98–99% of head and neck MIS, supporting a starting margin of at least 6 mm and commonly more for LM, with consideration of MMS or staged excision on the ear to ensure histologic clearance before reconstruction [^113dhDDc] [^113JJRyX] [^117CNQ8F] [^114kq6mn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a 5 mm margin would suffice universally, but the head and neck data contradict that, so I should favor larger or micrographically controlled margins for LM-type MIS on the ear to reduce local recurrence and re-excisions [^113JJRyX] [^112xQ8wW].

> For invasive melanoma, I should confirm standard margins. Guidelines support 1–2 cm clinical margins based on Breslow thickness, applied with judgment on the ear to preserve form and function when anatomy is constrained, acknowledging that margins narrower than 1 cm for invasive melanoma are discouraged even at specialty sites unless dictated by function with a plan for rigorous margin assessment [^112JfRB6] [^115gPVxo] [^114nGvsN]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; randomized data suggest that a 1 cm margin may be inadequate for melanomas thicker than 2 mm, with some trials showing signals favoring wider margins for melanoma-specific survival, so if the primary is > 2 mm on the ear, I should aim for 2 cm where feasible or, if constrained, document rationale and consider intensified margin-control strategies and surveillance [^112GKKem] [^111QtgFQ] [^112JfRB6]. I should double-check that functional preservation can justify a 1 cm margin on the ear for select invasive cases, but I need to ensure meticulous pathologic clearance if I compromise on width for anatomy [^115gPVxo] [^114nGvsN].

> I will now examine the deep plane and whether to resect perichondrium or cartilage. Standard practice for cutaneous melanoma is to excise through skin and subcutaneous tissue to, but not including, the underlying fascia or perichondrium, which defines an oncologically sound deep plane in most cases on the ear as well, minimizing morbidity without compromising clearance [^115gPVxo] [^117UXE9v]. Wait, I used to think routine perichondrial or cartilage resection would improve oncologic outcomes on the auricle, but large cohort data from the Melanoma Institute Australia and other series show perichondrial invasion is rare and true cartilage invasion is exceedingly uncommon, with no recurrence-free or melanoma-specific survival advantage to cartilage resection compared with cartilage-sparing techniques, arguing against routine cartilage removal unless there is clinical or histologic involvement of the perichondrium or deeper structures [^111nakzm] [^116wuX1r] [^112WGa5V] [^11299Vgz]. But wait, what if thicker primaries abut perichondrium; select T4 lesions may occasionally necessitate perichondrial or segmental cartilage resection, yet even in high-risk subsets most cases achieve negative margins without cartilage removal, and prior reports suggesting frequent cartilage invasion are not corroborated by larger contemporary series, which also identify the perichondrium as a practical biologic barrier on the auricle [^116UNzAp] [^114ghsbj] [^111nakzm].

> Next, I should review operative execution and margin control. A standard elliptical wide local excision with the predetermined peripheral margin measured from the visible or histologic edge is appropriate, but for challenging superior conchal access, a simple crusotomy to divide the crus of the helix can improve exposure and facilitate both resection and reconstruction without compromising cosmetics or control, which I should keep in mind for posterior conchal or deep bowl lesions [^114rFjEQ]. Hold on, I should verify whether intraoperative or staged margin assessment reduces recurrence; for head and neck melanomas including the ear, Mohs micrographic surgery or staged excision with permanent sections can reduce local recurrence compared with conventional WLE and allows confirmation of negative margins before definitive reconstruction, particularly valuable for lentigo maligna and MIS with subclinical extension on the ear [^113JJRyX] [^112xQ8wW].

> Let me consider reconstruction strategy with an aesthetic-functional hierarchy. I need to ensure symmetrical auricular projection and a smooth helix contour first, planning reconstruction from the inside out by restoring or preserving the cartilaginous framework and then resurfacing skin with primary closure, grafts, or flaps depending on defect size and depth, mindful of support for glasses or hearing aids and the thin cutaneous envelope of the auricle [^113NLd16] [^113Nku7h]. I should confirm timing; immediate reconstruction after negative margin verification is acceptable and, in limited comparative data, may even be associated with fewer positive margins than delayed reconstruction, though I need to individualize based on frozen or staged margin strategy and patient factors that affect wound healing and cosmesis [^111TbJco] [^11682JnJ]. Wait, let me verify donor-site choices; full-thickness skin grafts are frequently successful on the ear, and local chondrocutaneous advancement or regional flaps are reserved for larger composite defects, balancing complication risks with functional and aesthetic goals [^11682JnJ] [^113Nku7h].

> I should now address sentinel lymph node biopsy indications and timing. SLNB is recommended for intermediate-thickness primaries of 1.0–4.0 mm and considered for high-risk thin melanomas with adverse features such as ulceration or high mitotic rate, with mapping performed via preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB executed at the time of definitive wide excision of the primary site, which is particularly important for the ear given its unpredictable drainage pattern [^112JfRB6] [^114rhen4] [^113VxTem]. Hold on, I should verify the downstream management of a positive SLN; historically this led to completion lymph node dissection, but contemporary practice increasingly favors risk-adapted nodal observation and adjuvant systemic therapy discussions in a multidisciplinary setting, so I need to ensure counseling reflects current standards and trial data, even as institutional pathways may vary [^1147yeUq] [^112JfRB6]. I need to ensure the SLNB plan anticipates multiple sentinel nodes in different ipsilateral basins for auricular primaries to minimize false negatives and maximize staging accuracy [^113VxTem].

> Next, I should review postoperative management. I need to confirm histologically negative margins before finalizing complex reconstruction if margins were not verified intraoperatively, with prompt re-excision for any positives to achieve clear peripheral and deep margins, maintaining the deep plane at or above perichondrium unless invasion is documented [^112JfRB6] [^117UXE9v]. I should consider adjuvant therapy based on AJCC stage, nodal status, and histopathologic risk features, including immunotherapy for stage III and select stage II disease and adjuvant radiation for select scenarios such as desmoplastic melanoma with high-risk features or persistently close margins in anatomically constrained sites, within multidisciplinary tumor board discussion [^1147yeUq]. Let me double-check follow-up and recurrence expectations; large ear melanoma series report roughly 10–11% local recurrence, 12% regional metastasis, and about 22% distant disease over several years, emphasizing the need for structured surveillance with skin and nodal exams and imaging based on stage and symptoms [^112fa5FB].

> But wait, I should also consider special anatomic scenarios of the external auditory canal. When melanoma involves or abuts the bony external auditory canal, management often requires lateral temporal bone resection to obtain clear deep margins, with SLNB used for staging when appropriate and consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy based on pathologic risk, given higher Breslow depths and aggressive presentation in this subsite compared with other auricular melanomas [^112KCXao]. I need to ensure that preoperative imaging, otologic evaluation, and multidisciplinary planning with head and neck surgical oncology are integrated early for suspected EAC involvement to avoid under-treatment or non-oncologic planes of resection [^112KCXao].

> Let me reconsider areas of controversy and self-correction to keep the plan honest. First, I initially favored routine perichondrial or cartilage resection for invasive primaries on the ear to enhance deep control, but large contemporary data do not show oncologic benefit to cartilage resection and document rare perichondrial and exceedingly rare cartilage invasion, so cartilage-sparing surgery should be the default unless invasion is suspected or demonstrated, which better preserves auricular form and function without compromising outcomes [^111nakzm] [^112WGa5V] [^114ghsbj]. Second, I had assumed a universal adequacy of 5 mm margins for MIS, but head and neck data demonstrate frequent subclinical spread in LM, making 6–10 mm or micrographically controlled excision more appropriate on the ear to secure negative margins before definitive reconstruction [^117CNQ8F] [^114kq6mn] [^113JJRyX]. Third, while a 1 cm margin is often used at constrained sites, high-risk invasive tumors thicker than 2 mm may benefit from wider margins, and if anatomy forces narrower excision, I need to document the rationale and ensure rigorous margin control and follow-up, recognizing conflicting data and guideline allowances for thoughtful compromise in the head and neck [^112GKKem] [^112JfRB6] [^115gPVxo].

> In summary, I need to ensure the pathway remains systematic: perform an adequate excisional biopsy for accurate staging, use preoperative lymphoscintigraphy to map unpredictable auricular drainage, select margins based on stage with LM-specific strategies for MIS, maintain the deep plane at or just superficial to perichondrium while avoiding routine cartilage resection, consider MMS or staged excision to confirm margins on specialty sites, reconstruct by prioritizing projection and helix form with inside-out planning, offer SLNB per standard indications with mapping across multiple ipsilateral basins, and coordinate adjuvant therapies and surveillance within a multidisciplinary framework to balance oncologic safety with functional and aesthetic preservation on the ear [^114R5Xio] [^113VxTem] [^113dhDDc] [^112xQ8wW] [^113NLd16] [^112JfRB6] [^1147yeUq] [^112fa5FB].

Melanoma removal of the ear is performed by **wide local excision with 1–2 cm margins** [^115gPVxo] based on Breslow thickness [^112JfRB6], with **cartilage-sparing preferred unless invasion is suspected** [^114ghsbj] [^111nakzm]. For melanoma in situ [^113dhDDc], **Mohs micrographic surgery or staged excision** is recommended to ensure clear margins while preserving tissue [^113JJRyX] [^114kq6mn]. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed for **tumors ≥ 1 mm** [^112JfRB6] or with **high-risk features** [^114rhen4], and reconstruction is tailored to defect size and location, using primary closure, skin grafts, or local flaps [^113NLd16] [^113Nku7h]. Postoperative care includes regular follow-up for recurrence and metastasis, with adjuvant therapy considered for advanced disease [^1147yeUq].

---

## Preoperative evaluation and planning

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed evaluation of lesion size, location, and depth (Breslow thickness) guides surgical planning [^114R5Xio] [^112JfRB6].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI may be used for deeper lesions or suspected regional metastasis [^117Wjoif].

- **Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)**: Recommended for tumors ≥ 1 mm [^112JfRB6] or with high-risk features (ulceration, high mitotic rate) [^114rhen4] [^113VxTem].

## Surgical techniques

### Wide local excision (WLE)

Margins are **1–2 cm** [^112JfRB6], determined by Breslow thickness and adjusted for anatomic constraints. Depth extends to, but not including, **fascia or perichondrium** [^117UXE9v]; cartilage-sparing is preferred unless invasion is suspected [^111nakzm].

---

### Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS)

Indication is **melanoma in situ (MIS), lentigo maligna type** [^113dhDDc], to achieve tissue-sparing excision with exhaustive histologic assessment [^113JJRyX]. Advantages include **lower local recurrence rates** compared with WLE [^112xQ8wW].

---

### Cartilage resection

Indication is **suspected or confirmed cartilage invasion**; otherwise, cartilage-sparing is preferred [^111nakzm] [^114ghsbj]. Outcomes show **no significant differences in recurrence-free or melanoma-specific survival** between cartilage resection and cartilage-sparing approaches [^112WGa5V] [^116wuX1r] [^111nakzm].

---

## Reconstruction techniques

- **Primary closure**: Small defects [^113Nku7h].

- **Skin grafts**: Full-thickness or split-thickness for moderate defects [^11682JnJ].

- **Local flaps**: Chondrocutaneous or fasciocutaneous flaps for larger defects [^114W6ufo].

- **Complex reconstruction**: Two-stage procedures or engineered cartilage for extensive defects [^113NLd16].

---

## Postoperative care and follow-up

- **Wound care**: Regular dressing changes and monitoring for infection.

- **Surveillance**: Regular follow-up for recurrence or metastasis [^117Wjoif].

- **Adjuvant therapy**: Immunotherapy or targeted therapy for advanced disease [^1147yeUq].

Melanoma removal of the ear involves **wide local excision with 1–2 cm margins**, cartilage-sparing when possible, and reconstruction based on defect size and location. Postoperative care includes regular follow-up and adjuvant therapy for advanced disease [^112JfRB6].

### Advanced reconstruction of the ear: A framework for successful wound closure [^113NLd16]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The ear is a complex and intricate feature of the human face, where reconstruction following oncologic excision requires complete removal of skin cancer. Reconstructive strategies are based on understanding the hierarchy of aesthetic concerns for the ear.

- **Methods**: Review of the reconstructive strategies for reconstruction of the ear.

- **Results**: The two most important characteristics of the ear are its symmetrical projection from the head and the smooth curvature of the helix. With this in mind, the reconstructive plan must begin from the "inside out", with assessment of the cartilaginous frameworks followed by the cutaneous defect.

- **Conclusion**: A reconstructive strategy that takes into account the hierarchy of aesthetic concerns for defects of the ear will optimize cosmesis, function, and patient satisfaction.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^111nakzm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Melanoma of the ear accounts for approximately 1% of cutaneous melanomas. Management recommendations are based on small retrospective series and case reports. Resection of melanoma of the ear requires a delicate balance between disease clearance, preservation of function, and aesthetics. The role of cartilage resection in the wide excision of melanoma of the ear remains unclear. We aimed to compare outcomes in patients having wide excision of ear melanoma who had cartilage resected with those who had a cartilage-sparing approach.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) prospectively maintained database. All patients diagnosed with invasive melanoma involving the ear between 1990 and 2022 were included. Data analysis was performed to assess the association between cartilage resection and recurrence-free survival (RFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).

- **Results**: Overall, 411 patients were included in the study, of whom 330 (80%) had cartilage resected and 81 (20%) had a cartilage-sparing resection. The cartilage resection group had a higher mean Breslow thickness (1.9 vs. 1.4 mm; p = 0.0002), whereas the cartilage-sparing group had a higher proportion of stage IA disease (60.5 vs. 39.7%; p = 0.041). Five (1.2%) patients had melanoma invading into perichondrium but not deeper. Cartilage resection had no impact on RFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82 (0.52–1.29); p = 0.39] or MSS (HR 0.89 (0.30–2.62); p = 0.83).

- **Conclusion**: The decision to resect cartilage as part of the wide excision of invasive ear melanoma should be guided by individual patient factors.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, specifically the management of melanoma in situ, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend considering Mohs micrographic surgery or staged excision with paraffin-embedded permanent sections in patients with melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type, on the face, ears, or scalp. This approach is suggested for tissue-sparing excision and exhaustive histologic assessment of peripheral margins.

### The unpredictability of lymphatic drainage from the ear in melanoma patients, and its implications for management [^113VxTem]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The ear is known to have variable lymphatic drainage. This study aimed to better define the lymphatic drainage patterns of the ear by correlating the location of primary tumors, classified according to the embryologically derived anatomical subunits of the ear, with their mapped sentinel nodes (SNs) identified by lymphoscintigraphy (LS).

- **Methods**: Lymphatic drainage data for patients with a primary melanoma of the ear were reviewed and correlated with the precise primary melanoma site.

- **Results**: Between 1993 and 2010, LS was performed in 111 patients with a primary melanoma on the ear, identifying 281 SNs in 195 lymph node (LN) fields. The mean numbers of SNs and LN fields identified by LS per patient were 2.65 and 1.76, respectively. SN biopsy was performed in 71 patients (64%), and the mean number of SNs removed was 2.36. The 111 ear melanomas were mostly located on the helical rim (55%), followed by the lobule (24.3%). The five different primary ear sites drained mainly to SNs in level CII, level CV, and the preauricular region. Drainage was most often to level CII (36.4%). Notably, drainage to the contralateral neck was not observed.

- **Conclusions**: Lymphatic drainage of the ear has no predictable pattern and can be to SNs anywhere in the ipsilateral neck. Most commonly, drainage is to cervical level II and the preauricular and postauricular LN fields. LS defines the lymphatic drainage pattern in individual melanoma patients and is essential for accurate SN identification and reliable SN biopsy.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^116UNzAp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025).

At the time of writing, there have been 11 studies describing a cartilage-sparing approach to the surgical management of external ear melanoma, as summarized in Table 6. While these are only small retrospective series and case studies, they all demonstrate acceptable RFS and MSS outcomes. Of the six studies that compared cartilage resection with cartilage-sparing surgery, none reported invasion of melanoma into the cartilage. This mirrors the findings in the present study, in which none of the 330 patients who had cartilage resected showed evidence of melanoma invasion on histopathology, and only six demonstrated tumor abutting the perichondrium. In these six patients, all but one had T4a primary lesions, which could suggest that thicker primaries may still benefit from cartilage resection. However, in this cohort, 39 patients with T4a or T4b lesions had cartilage resected, with 34 (87%) not abutting the perichondrium. Therefore, despite a small number probably needing cartilage resection, the majority will achieve clear margins even for thicker primary tumors.

To our knowledge, there has only been one published report of invasion into cartilage. In that study, Benmeir et al. report a cohort of thick melanomas in which 8 out of 13 patients demonstrated invasion into the cartilage. Our findings, together with the majority of similar published literature, refute this finding and suggest that the overwhelming pattern of local invasion of melanoma of the ear is a peripheral pattern along fascial planes, superficial to the cartilage, rather than penetrating deep to the perichondrium.

### Wide versus narrow excision margins for high-risk, primary cutaneous melanomas: Long-term follow-up of survival in a randomised trial [^117AnM4Z]. The Lancet Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

This study cannot establish whether locoregional relapse predisposes patients to the subsequent development of distant metastatic disease, or whether the development of locoregional disease is merely correlated with and predates the development of metastatic disease. However, a 1 cm clinical margin should be adequate to completely excise a primary melanoma with negative microscopic margins. Because a 3 cm margin resulted in a decreased number of melanoma deaths, this would suggest that surgically intervening in a micrometastatic process in the 3 cm around the primary tumour can somehow affect the later metastatic process at more distant sites. Previous studies have shown a significant increase in local recurrence rates after 1 cm excisions, suggesting that 1 cm margins might not be adequate to deal with local microsatellitosis.

Previous randomised studies of elective or selective lymph node dissection have not shown a significant difference in melanoma-specific survival. The absence of a proven survival benefit in these nodal studies is at odds with the probable biological hypothesis for an effect on survival shown in this study — that removal of microsatellites around the primary tumour affects the development of metastatic disease. However, because subgroup analyses in these studies raised the possibility of survival benefit for prophylactic lymph node clearance that was not detected at the point of randomisation, there might be a consistent biological process underlying the effect noted in this study and in previous studies of prophylactic lymph node clearance.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^115gPVxo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous melanoma, specifically in the management of locoregional disease, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend:

- **Surgical margins**: Ensure surgical margins for invasive CM are between 1 cm and 2 cm, measured clinically around the primary tumor. It is recognized that the margin may be narrower to accommodate function and/or anatomic location.
- **Depth of excision**: Ensure the depth of excision reaches but does not include the fascia.

### Crusotomy: A safe, simple surgical technique to facilitate resection and reconstruction of poorly accessible auricular tumors [^114rFjEQ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Carcinomas of the ear are commonly referred to Mohs surgeons due to their tendency for subclinical spread and location in poorly accessible anatomic areas. A simple technique, the crusotomy, is described that improves access to superior conchal lesions, facilitating the resection of these tumors and repair of their resultant defects.

- **Objective**: To describe a surgical technique, the crusotomy, that facilitates the resection and repair of poorly accessible auricular tumors.

- **Methods**: Five patients with superior conchal tumors underwent crusotomy before the resection of their tumors. All patients had immediate reconstruction of the resultant defect with either local flaps or grafts and were seen for follow-up at 1-week and 1-month intervals.

- **Results**: Excellent cosmetic results were obtained in all five patients, with no postoperative complications.

- **Conclusion**: Crusotomy is a safe, rapid, and simple technique that facilitates the resection and repair of poorly accessible auricular tumors.

### Excision guidelines and follow-up strategies in cutaneous melanoma: Facts and controversies [^111TBhSb]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The ongoing increase in melanoma incidence throughout Caucasian populations worldwide raises the question of an economic and efficient management of primary melanoma and follow-up. The primary treatment of a cutaneous melanoma is surgical excision. An excision biopsy is recommended, with safety margins of 1 cm for tumor thickness up to 2 mm and 2 cm for a higher tumor thickness applied at the primary excision or in a two-step procedure. When dealing with facial, acral, or anogenital melanomas, micrographic control of the surgical margins may be preferable to allow reduced safety margins and conservation of tissue. Whereas the treatment for primary melanoma is accepted worldwide, follow-up strategies for melanoma patients are discussed controversially, and so far, no international consensus has been reached.

### Melanoma of the external auditory canal: A review of seven cases at a tertiary care referral center [^112KCXao]. The Laryngoscope (2021). High credibility.

Examine the presentation and management characteristics of seven patients with melanoma of the external auditory canal (EAC). A retrospective case series and review of the relevant literature was conducted. Records of seven patients from 2003 to 2017 with melanoma of the EAC were reviewed for characteristics of presentation, subsequent management, and outcomes. A thorough review of relevant literature is presented.

The median age is 52 years, with four females. The average Breslow depth was 3.6 mm, with five patients having a Clark level IV or greater on presentation. Six patients underwent lateral temporal bone resection, and one patient underwent wide local excision of the cartilaginous canal. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in three patients. Three patients experienced distant recurrence an average of 20 months following primary therapy. Median follow-up was 21 months. At last follow-up, four were free of disease, one had active disease, and two were deceased from melanoma.

This is the largest series and the first to report the use of SLNB for patients with EAC melanoma in the peer-reviewed literature. Patients with external auditory canal melanoma present with higher Breslow thickness and stage relative to all external ear melanomas. Management should include wide local excision, which entails lateral temporal bone resection when the bony ear canal is involved. SLNB has a critical role in identifying patients with early metastatic disease. Postoperative radiation therapy should be considered for the patient.

### Updates in the evidence-based management of cutaneous melanoma [^1147yeUq]. Head & Neck (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of cutaneous melanoma is evolving with significant developments over the past several years, promising to reshape the field of melanoma surgical oncology. Modifications to the staging system, based on the analysis of a large international dataset, as well as the timing and extent of regional lymphadenectomy, are among the changes. Additionally, the emergence of effective systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, along with the role of adjuvant radiation, are all undergoing a data-driven evolution. Surgeon engagement in multidisciplinary decision-making remains an essential component of contemporary management for patients across all stages of melanoma, demanding the specific involvement of head and neck surgical oncologists.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^11299Vgz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Cartilage resection in the surgical management of invasive melanoma of the ear does not appear to alter recurrence-free survival (RFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), or overall survival (OS) compared with patients who have a cartilage-sparing procedure. Particularly in early-stage disease, the decision to perform a cartilage-sparing procedure should be made on an individual basis. This consideration should take into account patient factors, cosmesis, and functional outcomes rather than concern for adequate oncological clearance, as melanoma does not appear to invade beyond the perichondrium.

### Surgical approaches to pre-auricular cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas extending to the temporal bone [^114PJQgR]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Through further analysis of our previous case series, we developed a level-based system of treatment, with each level increase correlating with further medial spread of the disease and a more radical surgical resection. Level 1 represented the least advanced tumors, which either extended close (≤ 5 mm) to or involved the external auditory canal (EAC). While treatment of tumors involving the EAC is generally straightforward and in line with that of primary EAC carcinomas, it remains more unclear for those abutting the temporal bone or EAC.

The approach for these tumors has traditionally been soft tissue resection alone, possibly in efforts to preserve function and cosmesis. However, achieving an en-bloc clear margin resection in this setting is very challenging. As such, we also perform temporal bone resection (TBR) when tumors are abutting to improve access and ensure clearance of the posterior and medial margin, even in the absence of direct EAC or temporal bone invasion. In these situations, a partial lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR), such as excision of the anterior EAC wall, as opposed to a formal en-bloc LTBR, would likely suffice as an appropriate bony margin. We have found that this type of resection is more time-efficient than a full LTBR and carries less risk of inadvertent facial nerve (VII) injury.

This more aggressive approach appears justified when comparing our long-term outcomes (2- and 5-year disease-specific survival [DSS] of 70.2% and 48.1%, respectively) to studies that utilized a soft tissue approach only (2-year DSS 33%) and considering the significant impact margin status has on survival outcomes (hazard ratio [HR] > 3 for recurrence, p < 0.01). Furthermore, most patients who underwent

### Bilateral malignant melanoma metastases to the internal auditory canal/cerebellopontine angle: Surgical management and preservation of function [^115xWrBo]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Although intracranial metastases of malignant melanomas are common, localization at the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) or in the internal auditory canal (IAC) is rare, with bilateral presentation being especially uncommon. We present the case of a 46-year-old Caucasian woman with bilateral IAC/CPA lesions and a prior history of malignant melanoma on the right leg. During preoperative investigations, the presence of bilateral IAC/CPA lesions, along with several radiologically identified lesions along the neural axis, led to the suspicion that she had neurofibromatosis Type 2. This was despite her history of malignant melanoma and the lack of characteristic skin lesions and family history. Histopathological analysis of the resected lesion confirmed the intraoperative diagnosis of bilateral CPA malignant melanoma metastases. Surgical removal of the tumors via the retrosigmoid approach, with preservation of normal bilateral facial nerve function and unilateral serviceable hearing, combined with control of the systemic disease, provided this patient with a near-normal quality of life for at least 42 months after the initial diagnosis of melanoma.

### Melanoma of the ear: Treatment and survival probabilities based on 199 patients [^112fa5FB]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

In 2005, it was estimated that one in 62 Americans had a lifetime risk of developing invasive melanoma. Melanoma of the ear accounts for 1% of all cases of melanoma and 14.5% of all head and neck melanomas. With this increase in incidence, plastic surgeons will likely have to treat and manage more of these patients in the future.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on 199 patients diagnosed with primary melanoma of the ear. Specimens were reviewed by dermatopathologists at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC for standardization of histologic criteria in all but 10 patients. Surgical treatment and outcomes were reviewed, and survival rates based on thickness and stage were calculated. Metastases information, anatomic location on the ear, and histologic subtype were recorded and analyzed.

- **Results**: The median length of follow-up was 3.3 years with a range of 0.4 to 24.9 years. Eighty-six patients were known to be dead at the last known follow-up date. The median survival time among these patients was 7.9 years. The most common histologic classification of the lesions was superficial spreading type (45.2%) and these were most likely to be localized to the anterior helix (49.3%). One hundred sixty-one of 199 (80.9%) patients underwent wide local excision with a local recurrence rate of 10.6%. Overall, 43.2% of patients developed a local recurrence or metastatic spread. Ulceration, thickness, and stage all negatively affected survival.

- **Conclusions**: This is the largest review of primary ear melanoma cases reported at the time of writing. Survival probabilities and detailed demographic data provide important insights for future treatments.

### Cartilage-sparing surgery for melanoma of the external ear [^1137EsuA]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The excision of melanoma of the external ear poses a challenge to surgeons, who must achieve adequate oncological control while minimizing impact on form and function. Cartilage-preserving surgery is an attractive option, as it leaves behind a scaffold for immediate reconstruction with a variety of techniques, including full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) and local flaps. This manuscript reviews the literature comparing cartilage-sparing surgery with composite excision of the skin and cartilage for the treatment of auricular melanoma. We report the results of a 17-year experience of using both techniques, together with sentinel node biopsy, at our center.

- **Methods**: A structured review of MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted to evaluate all studies reporting local recurrence or survival rates for melanoma of the external ear treated with cartilage-preserving surgery. A retrospective review of all patients undergoing wide local excision (WLE) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for auricular melanoma at our center between 2000 and 2017 was performed.

- **Results**: Of 40 patients identified, 29 underwent cartilage-preserving surgery with no local recurrences or evidence of perichondral involvement. There was one local recurrence out of 11 patients who had their cartilage excised. There were no significant differences in recurrence rates or melanoma-specific survival rates when comparing cartilage-preserving and cartilage-sparing surgery. Our results are supported by the literature review, which suggests that cartilage-sparing surgery is gaining acceptance as a safe option.

### Association of quality of life with surgical excision of early-stage melanoma of the head and neck [^1151XR8p]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Surgical excision is the standard-of-care treatment for Tis and T1a melanomas of the head and neck. Currently, however, the association of diagnosis and surgical treatment of these typically slowly progressive and nonfatal melanomas with a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unknown.

- **Objective**: To characterize and assess HRQoL in patients with Tis and T1a head and neck melanoma, evaluate changes in HRQoL over the surgical treatment course, and identify patient characteristics associated with lower HRQoL.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This longitudinal, prospective cohort study involved patients with Tis or T1a melanoma of the head and neck who underwent staged excision at a single tertiary care center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York) and were recruited from June 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017. Patients were followed up for 1 year after their surgical procedure. Participants were asked to complete 2 patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires, Skindex-16 and Skin Cancer Index (SCI), at 4 time points: baseline, perioperative (1 to 2 weeks after surgery), and 6-month and 1-year follow-up.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Scores on the Skindex-16 and SCI questionnaires.

- **Results**: A total of 56 patients were included in the study, among whom 24 (43%) were female and 32 (57%) were male, with a mean (range) age of 67.2 (32–88) years; all patients self-identified as white. Forty-one (73%) questionnaires at perioperative, 49 (88%) at 6-month postoperative, and 41 (73%) at 1-year postoperative time points were completed.

### Excision margins for melanoma in situ on the head and neck [^114kq6mn]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Complete surgical excision of melanoma in situ (MIS) is curative. A 5-mm margin is often taken as the standard primary excision margin despite increasing evidence that this is frequently inadequate for tumor clearance. The objective of this study was to calculate the proportion of patients requiring more than a 5-mm margin for clearance and to investigate any patient or lesion characteristics necessitating larger margins.

Three hundred forty-three primary MIS cases on the head and neck, treated in the authors' department by Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) over a 65-month period, were retrospectively analyzed. Records were made of patient and lesion characteristics, and the total surgical margin for clearance was calculated.

Sixty-five percent of cases were cleared by a 5-mm margin; for a 97% clearance rate, a margin of 15 mm was necessary. The increased clearance with an additional margin was significant (p < .0001). Patient age, lesion site, and preoperative size did not predict the necessary margin.

These results verify that MIS on the head and neck can spread significantly beyond the clinical margin and demonstrate the importance of confirming clearance histologically before closure procedures. Mohs micrographic surgery has the advantage of total margin evaluation, and where available, it may be reasonable to start with a 5-mm margin. Where MMS is not a treatment option, the authors advocate larger excision margins of ≥ 10 mm.

### Gaba regulates electrical activity and tumor initiation in melanoma [^1129yYDg]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Low credibility.

To test this in a mammalian system, we overexpressed Gad1 in the mouse melanoma cell line YUMM 1.1 and transplanted these cells into the mouse ear, which is rich in microenvironmental keratinocytes, thus providing an ideal model to test melanoma/microenvironment interactions. Although we did not observe any difference in the proliferation and invasion potential of the Gad1-overexpressing cells in monoculture in vitro, we found a marked increase in tumor growth using this system, suggesting that Gad1 expression is protumorigenic in a mouse melanoma model.

We next wanted to test this in a human context. We created 3D skin melanoma reconstructs, widely used to understand tumor/stromal interactions in melanoma, using human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanoma cells together in a collagen matrix. We found that treatment with the GABA-A agonist muscimol strongly increases the growth of initiated melanoma cells in a keratinocyte-rich microenvironment in this model, thus suggesting that activation of the GABA-A receptor in keratinocytes is protumorigenic in zebrafish, mouse, as well as human melanoma models.

### Changing surgical therapy for melanoma of the external ear [^115qPcLt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic variables and clinical ramifications of melanoma of the ear.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of patients treated since 1985 at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, AZ, and Rochester, MN, identified 78 patients with complete follow-up.

- **Results**: Of these 78 patients, 68 (87%) were men; the mean age was 64 years (range, 23–87 years). Melanoma thickness averaged 1.7 mm (range, 0.2–7.0 mm). Treatment of the primary melanoma included wedge resection (59%), Mohs resection (14%), partial amputation (11%), skin and subcutaneous resection with perichondrium preservation (9%), and total amputation (7%). Nineteen patients underwent an elective lymph node dissection, and lymph node metastases were found in seven (37%). Two patients presented with clinically positive lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 10 patients. After a mean follow-up of 55.7 months, 10 patients (13%) had local recurrence, 9 patients (12%) had regional recurrence, and systemic metastases had developed in 17 patients (22%). Tumor thickness, lymph node metastases, and local recurrence significantly affected systemic recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: The treatment of malignant melanoma of the external ear should follow standard guidelines, which require wide local excision with negative margins. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be used to identify patients with lymph node metastases who are at high risk of recurrence.

### Reconstruction after wide excision of primary cutaneous melanomas: Part I-the head and neck [^113Nku7h]. The Lancet Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of management for primary cutaneous melanoma is wide surgical excision. However, sometimes it is necessary to strike a balance between adequately resecting a potentially curable lesion and minimizing the functional deficit or cosmetic deformity in the affected area, particularly in the head and neck region. The reconstructive surgeon must possess extensive knowledge of reconstructive techniques, including their advantages and limitations, and a comprehensive understanding of the local and regional anatomy to achieve the surgical goals. In part I of this series, we review literature and available evidence on reconstruction after the wide excision of primary cutaneous melanoma in the head and neck region.

### Precision oncology in melanoma: Changing practices [^117Wjoif]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Malignant melanoma, hereafter referred to as melanoma, is an aggressive malignancy of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. These cells are found throughout the body, including the skin, eyes, ears, gastrointestinal tract, and multiple mucous membranes, leading to the recognition of nine distinct subtypes of melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma, originating from the melanocytes of the skin, accounts for the vast majority of melanoma diagnoses globally across all populations and ethnicities. Approximately 5% of all melanoma cases are noncutaneous in origin; of these cases, 50% affect regions within the head and neck, with the nasal cavities and sinuses being the main sites of disease. Uveal melanoma, the most common primary malignancy of the eye in adults, results from malignant transformation of melanocytes within the uveal tract. It is, however, pathophysiologically distinct from cutaneous melanoma. For the purposes of this review article, we refer to cutaneous melanoma when discussing melanoma from this point onward.

The role of radiology in many areas of medicine, particularly oncology, continues to grow at a rapid pace. CT, ultrasound, and MRI play critical roles in the initial staging, treatment response assessment, and surveillance of many malignancies. The combination of 18 F-FDG PET with low-dose CT, termed PET/CT, became commercially available in 2000. PET/CT has resulted in significant improvements in treatment response assessment, correlation of areas of 18 F-FDG uptake with underlying anatomic structures, and changes in surgical management in patients with resectable melanoma.

### Surgical approaches to pre-auricular cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas extending to the temporal bone [^112JyQmf]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Advanced pre-auricular cSCCs, originating either primarily on the skin or as a metastatic nodal deposit, are challenging to treat. There are relatively high rates of involved surgical margins and poor survival outcomes, as demonstrated in our previous report of cSCCs requiring temporal bone resection (TBR). Similarly, in their study of primary and peri-temporal bone malignancies, Gidley et al. found that tumors of the peri-auricular skin had some of the worst outcomes compared to other subsites, with a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival of 33.6% and 42.7%, respectively, compared to 77.3% and 82.3% for external auditory canal (EAC) primaries.

Contributing to this disparity in survival outcomes and the difficulties in managing pre-auricular cSCCs is the lack of evidence guiding treatment of these tumors and the absence of standardized surgical approaches. While attempts have been made to create stage-based treatment protocols, the utility of such systems is questionable, given that most, if not all, tumors are classified as T4 or N3b according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer system. As such, different approaches may be warranted for tumors with the same staging, as treatment tends to be individualized based on the direction of spread and involved structures.

We aimed to provide examples of surgical resections and approaches that can be used to manage pre-auricular cSCCs extending to the temporal bone, based on common patterns of spread observed, rather than their prognostic staging group. We also aimed to draw attention to the utility and role of the anterior commissural system (ACS) as a fascial plane of dissection.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy and complete lymph node dissection for melanoma [^117UXE9v]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of melanoma is wide and radical excision, including deep tissue. If the resected margins are not clear from malignant melanoma at histological examination, any remaining melanoma cells in the surrounding tissue should be included in a re-excision. Surgical margins are based on the maximal melanoma Breslow thickness, measured in millimeters. All pigmented lesions with a clinical suspicion of melanoma should be removed with at least a 2-mm clinical clear margin but not exceeding 5 mm to preserve the lymphatic drainage assessed by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) at a later stage. Excision of lesions located on the extremities should follow the length axis to facilitate primary closure and avoid skin grafts. For invasive melanoma (as defined by histology), the excision should continue through the skin and subcutaneous tissue down to, but not including, the fascia/periosteum/perichondrium. For melanoma in situ, surgical excision should include the superficial subcutaneous tissue.

Partial biopsies of suspected melanomas should be avoided due to the risk of understaging, but, if necessary, they can be guided by dermatoscopy to identify the most malignant part of the suspected melanoma lesion. Importantly, the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis or overall survival has not been associated with the choice of biopsy method, whether excisional, incisional, or shave biopsy.

In a study from the National Cancer Database (N = 153,218), data suggested that surgery performed later than 90 days was associated with a decrease in survival outcomes for patients with melanoma.

### Nonmelanoma skin cancer of the head and neck II: Surgical treatment and reconstruction [^1161Gg9P]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) is most often straightforward and can be performed as an office-based procedure by non-surgically trained professionals. However, cases that present to an otolaryngology practice typically involve difficult-to-treat lesions around the face and necessitate an in-depth knowledge of how to balance the need for adequate surgical margins with the reconstructive constraints imposed by the aesthetic subunits of the face.

This article discusses modern concepts of surgical margins for NMSC, including the Moh's micrographic surgical technique, and reviews the most common reconstructive strategies for difficult-to-treat areas on the face. The goal of this paper is to help general otolaryngologists understand the basic principles of surgical resection and reconstruction of NMSC lesions on the face.

### Local recurrence of melanoma is higher after wide local excision versus Mohs micrographic surgery or staged excision: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112xQ8wW]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Complete removal of melanoma is a primary goal of excision, and local recurrence is one measure to evaluate the efficacy of surgical technique. The objective of this study is to compare published local recurrence rates for melanoma treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) or staged excision versus wide local excision (WLE).

- **Methods and materials**: A search of six databases identified comparative and noncomparative studies that reported local recurrence rates after MMS, staged excision, or WLE for melanoma. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from comparative studies and event rates from noncomparative studies.

- **Results**: Of the 71 studies included (16,575 patients), 12 were comparative studies (2,683 patients) and 56 were noncomparative studies (13,698 patients). Comparative studies showed increased recurrence after WLE compared with MMS or staged excision (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–4.6) and compared with MMS alone (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8–5.9). Pooled data from comparative and noncomparative studies showed a local recurrence rate of 7% after WLE (95% CI, 5%-11%), 3% after staged excision (95% CI, 2%-4%), and less than 1% after MMS (95% CI, 0%-1%). Statistical heterogeneity was moderate to high.

Local recurrence of melanoma is significantly lower after MMS (< 1%) and staged excision (3%) compared with WLE (7%).

### Melanoma: Diagnosis and treatment [^1155GuEZ]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to excisional biopsy, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend performing an excisional biopsy of all suspicious pigmented lesions. The biopsy should be deep enough to prevent transection of the base of the lesion, with 1–3 mm circumferential margins to excise the entire lesion.

### Head and neck mucosal melanoma: Where are we now [^116yFAEE]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

To highlight recent and relevant treatment considerations while managing mucosal melanoma, evidence is building to support the use of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Surgical resection with postoperative radiotherapy plays a major role in managing resectable disease. Recent studies evaluate the addition of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in an attempt to determine the most efficacious sequence of treatment.

### Spontaneous regression of a middle ear melanoma [^1119gzC3]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Low credibility.

To describe a case of complete spontaneous regression of a middle ear melanoma, we present a 68-year-old man with complaints of unilateral hearing loss and an ipsilateral facial nerve paresis. Radiological and histopathological examination revealed a cT4bN0M0 mucosal melanoma of the middle ear.

- **Interventions**: The patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy and postoperative radiotherapy.

- **Main outcome measure**: Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET-CT), and histopathological examination.

- **Results**: After subtotal petrosectomy, histopathological examination of the resection specimen showed only fibrosis and a histiocytic and clonal T-cell infiltration, but no residual melanoma at the primary tumor site, consistent with spontaneous tumor regression. Follow-up MRI scanning 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy showed no signs of tumor recurrence.

This case describes the concept of spontaneous regression of a mucosal melanoma of the middle ear. Spontaneous tumor regression at this location has not been described before.

### Ear reconstruction after Mohs cancer excision: Lessons learned from 327 consecutive cases [^11682JnJ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The ear serves many functional and aesthetic purposes, and its complex structure presents a notable challenge for reconstruction. However, there is a paucity of objective data and analysis on the reconstruction of acquired ear defects. The goal of this study was to evaluate all ear reconstructions and lessons learned over past decades in a large clinical Mohs reconstruction practice.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent ear reconstruction after Mohs cancer excision from 2004 to 2018, performed by the senior author (J.F.T). Data regarding patient demographics, oncologic type, treatment, defect characteristics, reconstructive modalities, number of stages, and complications were collected and analyzed.

- **Results**: Three hundred twenty-seven patients underwent ear reconstruction. Defects most commonly involved the superior one-third of the helix and the antihelix. Approximately half of the patients' defects were reconstructed with full-thickness skin grafts, and about one-third required flap reconstruction. There were 30 complications (9 percent), ranging from partial flap loss to cancer recurrence. No difference in complication rates was observed between elderly patients and the younger cohort.

- **Conclusions**: Optimizing results when reconstructing ear defects is challenging due to multiple preoperative variables. Ear reconstruction is safe in an outpatient setting, and age should not preclude patients from undergoing reconstruction.

### Cutaneous melanoma: Methods of biopsy and definitive surgical excision [^113rNeL2]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

The proper method of biopsy and definitive surgical excision of cutaneous melanoma is vital for optimal patient outcomes. The authors' understanding of the pathophysiology of cutaneous melanoma continues to change rapidly. As their research efforts expose some of the mysteries of melanoma, they begin to better understand the intricacies of this dreaded cancer. This article highlights methods of biopsy for melanoma and management of the primary tumor. The authors review recommendations for excision margins for the primary tumor, the usefulness of lymphoscintigraphy, timing of definitive surgical excision, and issues unique to head and neck melanoma.

### A cost comparison between Mohs micrographic surgery and conventional excision for the treatment of head and neck melanomas in situ and thin melanomas [^111P5yqd]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Variation in operative setting and surgical technique exists when treating specialty site melanomas. However, limited data compare costs among surgical modalities.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the costs of head and neck melanoma surgery performed with Mohs micrographic surgery or conventional excision in the operating room or office-based settings.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients aged 18 years and older with surgically treated head and neck melanoma in two cohorts — an institutional cohort and an insurance claims cohort — covering the years 2008–2019. The primary outcome was the total cost of care for a surgical encounter, provided in the form of insurance reimbursement data. A generalized linear model was used to adjust for covariates affecting differences between treatment groups.

- **Results**: In the institutional and insurance claims cohorts, the average adjusted treatment cost was highest in the conventional excision-operating room treatment group, followed by the Mohs surgery and conventional excision-office setting (p < .001).

- **Conclusion**: These data demonstrate the important economic role the office-based setting has for head and neck melanoma surgery. This study allows cutaneous oncologic surgeons to better understand the costs of care involved in head and neck melanoma treatment. Cost awareness is important for shared decision-making discussions with patients.

### The perichondrium in auricular melanomas: Implications for surgical management [^114ghsbj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Auricular melanomas are now considered less aggressive than originally thought, but those located on the conchal bowl and posterior ear can create particular challenges for reconstruction. Given the paucity of cases, no standardized recommendations exist for tumor resection. In this study, we provide a pathologic basis in support of conservative tumor resection along the perichondrial plane.

- **Study design**: Case series with review of pathology and medical records.

- **Setting**: Academic tertiary referral center.

- **Subjects and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed all ear melanomas from the archives of Yale Dermatopathology and Surgical Pathology laboratories between 1987 and 2009. Cases of melanoma in situ or malignant melanoma of the earlobe were excluded.

- **Results**: Fifty-one cases were included in the study. Patients' age ranged from 26 to 94 years, with a mean (SD) of 58.9 (17.5) years. The male to female ratio was 5.4:1. Melanomas were distributed similarly between right and left ears, at 52% and 48%, respectively. The most common location was the helix (74.5%). The Breslow depth ranged from 0.19 to 11 mm, with a mean (SD) of 1.64 (1.6) mm. The lesion-perichondrium distance ranged from 0 to 8.12 mm, with a mean (SD) of 1.11 (1.1) mm. Notably, the perichondrium was not invaded in any of the cases.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the histopathologic characteristics of our cases, the perichondrium can be considered an effective barrier and therefore a biological plane for wide local resection in some cases of auricular melanomas, allowing surgeons to achieve negative margins.

### A retrospective study comparing the accuracy of prehistology diagnosis and surgical excision of malignant melanomas by general practitioners and hospital specialists [^113WaGVB]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was carried out to compare the overall standard of surgical excision of malignant melanomas (MMs) between general practitioners (GPs) and hospital specialists before and after the introduction of the UK melanoma guidelines between 1989 and 2006. In total, 213 melanoma excision reports were examined, and surgical excision margins were recorded. The results showed a significant difference in the rate of adequate surgical excision margins (at all levels of Breslow thickness) between GPs and hospital specialists, with hospital specialists excising melanomas with safe surgical excision margins at a significantly higher rate compared with GPs.

Since the introduction of the guidelines in 2002, GPs showed a significant improvement in the completeness of melanoma excision but remained poor at prehistology diagnosis and, in particular, at taking adequate excision margins. Implementation of the guidelines has not produced significant improvements in the adequacy of excision margins in both primary and secondary care. The results show that hospital specialists maintained a high standard of prehistological diagnosis and completeness of excision throughout the time of the study, performing at a significantly higher standard compared with GPs.

Our conclusions concur with the UK melanoma guidelines and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines, which suggest that lesions suspicious for melanoma should be urgently referred to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for surgical excision and should not be surgically excised in primary care, particularly if lesions appear suspicious.

### Immediate versus delayed reconstruction of head and neck cutaneous melanoma [^111TbJco]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the surgical management of cutaneous melanoma and the optimal timing of reconstruction. One approach to ensuring an oncologically sound outcome is a two-stage procedure, with reconstruction delayed for negative permanent section margins. Alternatively, a single-stage excision with immediate reconstruction is advantageous because it limits both resource use and patient morbidity from multiple procedures. We sought to examine available published data on the oncologic outcomes associated with immediate versus delayed reconstruction of cutaneous melanoma in the head and neck region.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review using EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and PubMed. We examined all English-language studies reporting oncologic outcomes, such as positive margins and/or local recurrence rates, of single-stage or delayed reconstruction of cutaneous melanoma in the head and neck region. Our primary outcomes of interest were rates of positive margins requiring re-excision and rates of local recurrence. A total of 1,557 studies were screened by three independent reviewers.

- **Results**: Nine studies met inclusion criteria for final analysis. Two of the nine studies directly compared immediate versus delayed reconstruction and demonstrated lower rates of positive margins in the immediate reconstruction group (odds ratio 3.7 [95% CI 0.79–17.34]).

- **Conclusion**: There is a paucity of studies directly comparing oncologic outcomes associated with immediate versus delayed reconstruction following the excision of head and neck cutaneous melanoma. Based on a limited amount of data, the immediate reconstruction group may be associated with lower rates of positive margins.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^112apnoj]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Melanoma of the ear accounts for approximately 1% of cutaneous melanomas. Management recommendations are based on small retrospective series and case reports. Resection of melanoma of the ear requires a delicate balance between disease clearance, preservation of function, and aesthetics. The role of cartilage resection in the wide excision of melanoma of the ear remains unclear. We aimed to compare outcomes in patients having wide excision of ear melanoma who had cartilage resected with those who had a cartilage-sparing approach.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) prospectively maintained database. All patients diagnosed with invasive melanoma involving the ear between 1990 and 2022 were included. Data analysis was performed to assess the association between cartilage resection and recurrence-free survival (RFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).

- **Results**: Overall, 411 patients were included in the study, of whom 330 (80%) had cartilage resected and 81 (20%) had a cartilage-sparing resection. The cartilage resection group had a higher mean Breslow thickness (1.9 vs. 1.4 mm; p = 0.0002), whereas the cartilage-sparing group had a higher proportion of stage IA disease (60.5 vs. 39.7%; p = 0.041). Five (1.2%) patients had melanoma invading into perichondrium but not deeper. Cartilage resection had no impact on RFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82 (0.52–1.29); p = 0.39] or MSS (HR 0.89 (0.30–2.62); p = 0.83).

### Wide versus narrow excision margins for high-risk, primary cutaneous melanomas: Long-term follow-up of survival in a randomised trial [^112GKKem]. The Lancet Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The risk of metastatic spread from a malignant melanoma is estimated based on histopathological features such as Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, and the presence of microscopic ulceration. Whether the surgical margins taken around the primary tumour affect metastatic spread is unclear, despite being the subject of several randomised clinical trials. Historically, wide surgical margins of 5 cm or more were used around primary melanomas to excise the primary tumour and encompass local micrometastatic disease.

In previously reported randomised trials comparing wide (3–5 cm) and narrow (1–2 cm) margins, no significant difference in overall survival between the groups has been noted. Although no trial has shown a significant differential risk for melanoma-specific survival related to different surgical margin widths, findings from two trials and the previous report of this trial suggest a possible detrimental effect of narrow margins on melanoma-specific survival. In a Swedish Melanoma Study Group trial, patients were randomly assigned to excision margins of either 2 cm or 5 cm for trunk and extremity melanomas with a Breslow thickness of 0.8–2.0 mm (median 1.2 mm). The hazard ratio (HR) for melanoma deaths for narrow compared to wide margins was 1.22 (95% CI 0.88–1.69; p = 0.24) with a median follow-up of 11 years. Additionally, the Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial of patients was randomly assigned to either a 2 cm or 4 cm excision margin for trunk and extremity melanomas.

Malignant melanoma develops through the neoplastic transformation of pigment-producing cells, usually located in the epidermis and dermis. Accumulation of mutations occurs in genes responsible for cell proliferation and apoptosis. Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells and, therefore, melanomas can develop in various places in the body. Although melanomas are usually cutaneous in nature, they can also occur in various extracutaneous sites, including ocular, mucosal, and leptomeningeal locations. Mucosal melanomas are rare and represent 1.4% of all melanomas. They arise from mucosal epithelium anywhere in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts.

Head and neck mucosal melanomas are predominantly found in the sinonasal region and oral cavity. This is usually an aggressive form of cancer without symptoms in the early stages because of these "hidden" sites, resulting in late diagnosis and poor prognosis. The main function of melanocytes is pigmentation and UV protection of the skin and the eyes. However, melanocytes are also present at sun-protected mucosal areas of the body where they are believed to play a role in the immune system because of their phagocytic, antigen-presenting, and cytokine-producing properties. Primary mucosal melanomas of the head and neck are uncommon, and because of their rarity, knowledge on their pathogenesis and prognosis is scarce.

### Surgical margins for melanoma in situ [^117CNQ8F]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

A controversy in the treatment of melanoma in situ is the required width of the surgical margin. The currently accepted 5-mm margin is based on a 1992 consensus opinion, despite data since then showing this is inadequate.

- **Objective**: We sought to develop guidelines for predetermined surgical margins for excision of melanoma in situ.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected series of 1,072 patients with 1,120 melanoma in situs was studied. All lesions were excised by Mohs micrographic surgery with frozen-section examination of the margin. The minimal surgical margin was 6 mm, and the total margin was calculated by adding an additional 3 mm for each subsequent stage required. The minimum surgical margin that would successfully remove 97% of all tumors was calculated. Local recurrence was also tabulated.

- **Results**: In all, 86% of melanoma in situs were successfully excised with a 6-mm margin, while 9 mm removed 98.9% of melanoma in situs. The superiority of 9-mm to 6-mm margins was significant (P < .001). Gender, location, and diameter did not affect results. The recurrence rate for this set of patients treated with Mohs micrographic surgery was 0.3% (n = 3).

- **Limitations**: Margins less than 6 mm were not studied. This is a referral center for melanoma in situ, and 10% of tumors were previously treated before presentation to our clinic.

- **Conclusion**: The frequently recommended 5-mm margin for melanoma is inadequate. Standard surgical excision of melanoma in situ should include 9 mm of normal-appearing skin, similar to that recommended for early invasive melanoma.

### Mohs micrographic surgery for the treatment of external ear melanoma: An outcome study [^115Up2w9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The external ear is composed of thin skin overlying cartilage, making melanoma on the external ear difficult to resect while preserving the intricate anatomy. Although surgeons have achieved robust clinical outcomes for nonmelanoma and most recently melanoma skin cancers with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), there is still not enough evidence on the MMS application for external ear melanoma treatment.

- **Objective**: The authors examined survival outcomes in patients treated with MMS, narrow margin excision (NME), and wide margin excision (WME) for melanoma on the external ear.

- **Methods**: Data from the NCI SEER program was retrospectively analyzed. Patients who received surgical treatment on the external ear and had microscopically confirmed diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma were included in the study. The effect of different surgery types — MMS, NME, and WME — on melanoma survival was evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 8,212 melanoma cases of the external ear performed during the years 2000 to 2015 were considered for analysis. There were no significant differences in survival when comparing NME and WME with MMS.

- **Conclusion**: Mohs micrographic surgery is at least equivalent to WME for the treatment of melanoma of the external ear.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^115RyGK5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 330 patients (80%) underwent cartilage resection, while 81 (20%) had a cartilage-sparing procedure. Among those who had cartilage resected, none demonstrated cartilage invasion; however, 6 (1.8%) had tumors abutting the perichondrium but not invading beyond (Fig. 2). Factors associated with an increased likelihood of cartilage resection included a Breslow thickness of 2.01–4.0 mm, which had a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.40 [CI 1.05–11.06] on multivariate analysis, and patients with AJCC 8th Edition stage IIA disease (HR 2.94 [CI 1.25–6.89]) [Table 2]. Additionally, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 143 (35%) patients, yielding a 17% positive result.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^114R5Xio]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to excisional biopsy, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend performing a narrow excisional/complete biopsy with 1–3 mm margins. This should encompass the entire breadth of the lesion and be of sufficient depth to prevent transection at the base, as this is the preferred biopsy technique. The excisional biopsy may be performed by any of the following methods:

- **Fusiform/elliptical excision**: This method insures comprehensive removal of the lesion.
- **Punch excision around the clinical lesion**: Allows for a targeted approach to remove specific areas.
- **Deep shave/saucerization removal**: This technique involves removing tissue to a depth below the anticipated plane of the lesion to ensure complete excision.

### Surgical management of melanoma-in-situ using a staged marginal and central excision technique [^116Tus7n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Melanoma-in-situ (MIS) represents 45% of all melanomas. The margins of MIS are often poorly defined, with extensive subclinical disease. Standard fusiform excision with 5-mm margins results in positive margins in up to a third of cases. To decrease the incidence of involved margins, a staged excision approach for MIS is used.

First, patients undergo excision under local anesthesia of a 2- to 3-mm "contoured" rim of tissue, optimally 5 mm beyond the visible extent of the lesion. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded en face sections from this excision are then evaluated, potentially with the aid of immunohistochemical stains. Any positive margins are further excised. When all margins are negative, the central area is excised and reconstructed.

A total of 61 patients with MIS or lentigo maligna melanoma underwent staged contoured excisions from 2004 to 2007 at Moffitt Cancer Center. Data was analyzed only from patients with MIS of the head and neck. Patients with known invasive melanoma or non-head and neck primary disease were excluded. Demographics, tumor characteristics, margin status, number of stages, and type of reconstruction and recurrences were evaluated.

Forty-nine patients with MIS of the head and neck, comprising 28 (57%) males and 21 (43%) females aged 42 to 88 years old (median 72; mean 70), underwent staged contoured margin excision before definitive central tumor excision and reconstruction. The final surgical defect size ranged from 2 to 130 cm² (median 16 cm²). Twelve patients (24%) required reexcision of at least one margin; the median number of reexcisions was one.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^114nGvsN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, particularly in the context of locoregional disease, wide-local excision is a key consideration. The AAD 2019 guidelines recommend avoiding wide excision or Mohs micrographic surgery with sub-1-cm margins in patients with primary invasive melanoma at anatomically constrained sites, such as the head and neck and acral sites.

### Motor nerves of the head and neck that are susceptible to damage during dermatological surgery [^111ADkKN]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

As the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer rises, dermatologists will increasingly be called upon to perform excisions in the head and neck region. Damage to the motor nerves of the head and neck represents an important adverse event for patients and a source of litigation for surgeons. Understanding the anatomy of this region is key to counseling patients about the possibility of motor nerve injury associated with particular skin surgical procedures.

We describe the anatomy of the motor nerves of the head and neck that are most vulnerable to injury during dermatological surgery. The consequences of injury are outlined, and the surface anatomy and anatomical landmarks that may be used to identify the relevant danger zones are described.

### Modified Valente technique for cauliflower ear: Outcomes in children at two-year follow-up: New surgical technique for cauliflower ear [^113cYjjd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Using a caliper, the volume of fibrotic tissue for removal is determined; normal concha cartilage is around 1 mm in thickness. Methylene blue markings are made to determine the extent of tissue removal. Excess tissue is sharply excised in superior to inferior and external to internal directions (Fig. 2 D–G).

After removing excess tissue from the anterior aspect of the ear (Fig. 3 A), a 4 mm diamond bar or cutting burr is used to increase the flexibility of the ear, achieve consistent thickness, and refine contour (Fig. 3 B). The cartilage is then folded to recreate the new antihelix, with any excess cartilage in the superior part of the concha removed. The fold is maintained using mattress sutures that incorporate perichondrium, employing resorbable 4–0 Monocryl suture (Fig. 3 C–E). The new antihelix is again contoured with the diamond burr, and the skin is redistributed over the cartilage framework and sutured. Gauze with Fitostimoline® (DAMOR spa, Naples, Italy) is placed over the anterior and posterior ear, followed by the placement of a compressive bandage.

- **Surgical step 2**: A Auricular cartilage after removal of the deformed portion. B Auricular cartilage smoothing by diamond burr. C–E Use of Monocryl mattress sutures to stabilize the new antihelix.

- **Statistical analyses**: We performed a two-tailed t-test to compare the difference in the GCBQ between patients who had worse (≥ 3 points) malformation scores versus lower at the baseline. A two-tailed t-test was also performed to compare the GCBQ in patients who underwent bilateral versus unilateral surgery.

### Management of complex melanomas of head and neck region [^114mZBwb]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Though many melanomas in the head and neck region are amenable to simple excision and direct closure or skin grafts, a subset of patients is deemed complex due to the large size of the tumor, depth of invasion, or proximity to aesthetically and functionally important structures. This retrospective study examined complex melanomas of the head and neck region treated in the past ten years. Nineteen cases were analyzed, including four women and fifteen men, with ages ranging from 59 to 83 years (mean: 69 years). The Breslow thickness of these tumors varied from 1 to 40 mm, with an average of 9 mm.

The resectional procedures included wide local excision (15 patients), wide excision with partial maxillectomy (1 patient), wide excision with total maxillectomy (1 patient), and orbital exenteration (2 patients). Neck dissections were performed in 12 cases, and parotidectomy was performed in 5 cases. Reconstruction was undertaken using local (2 cases), regional (5 cases), and free flaps (11 cases) in a total of 18 cases. There were four complications, including two nerve injuries during neck dissection involving the vagus and marginal mandibular nerve.

Four patients died during follow-up due to metastatic disease, with a median survival of 3.5 years (range: 2–8 years, mean: 3 years). One patient is alive with recurrent disease and distant metastases four years after the original surgery. The remaining 14 patients are alive and free of recurrence, with a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 7 years (median: 4.5 years).

### Surgical approaches to pre-auricular cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas extending to the temporal bone [^1111RXSD]. Head & Neck (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 provides an overview of the tumor levels, based on common patterns of spread observed and their recommended treatment paradigms — outlined in further detail below (Figures 1–9). For each level, incision planning and incorporation of skin and soft tissue is handled on a case-by-case basis and can vary greatly depending on the site of origin (cutaneous or nodal) and extent of involvement. Attempts should be made to preserve cosmesis where possible while also ensuring at least a 10 mm peripheral margin. For most pre-auricular-based lesions, the pinna (or part of it) can usually be spared, and vascularity is likely best preserved through a pre-auricular incision (usually incorporating the tragus) and a posteriorly based flap (Figures 6 and 8). Note that in the following examples, clearance of the medial disease extent is the main focus of the dissections, and the incisions and soft tissue resection may not necessarily correlate to the radiological example provided.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^112WGa5V]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: This study represents the largest cohort at the time of writing, comparing melanoma-specific outcomes for patients undergoing cartilage-sparing surgery of the ear with those who have cartilage resected for management of invasive melanoma. In this cohort, cartilage resection did not confer a melanoma-specific survival (MSS) advantage and did not result in lower recurrence rates. This study suggests that the decision to perform a cartilage-sparing procedure is unlikely to compromise oncological safety and could be considered if the resulting reconstruction will provide an improved functional and cosmetic outcome for the patient.

The largest cohort at the time of writing before this study was by Truong et al, which described 156 patients with external ear melanomas, of whom 18.6% had a cartilage-sparing operation. In their cohort, there was no recurrence-free survival (RFS) advantage for patients who had cartilage resection, with a 5-year RFS and overall survival (OS) of 84.5% and 79.0%, respectively, and a median follow-up of 5.5 months. However, there were several limitations of this study, including the inclusion of melanomas of the non-cartilaginous earlobe and the definition of cartilage-sparing surgery as any operation that was not described as a wedge resection in the procedure report, which is likely to overestimate the number of cartilage-sparing procedures. In our study, we defined a cartilage-sparing procedure as one where cartilage was not identified in the histological analysis, as well as the lack of description of a cartilage resection in the procedure report, which we believe to be a more accurate reflection of the true number of cartilage-sparing procedures.

### Malignant melanoma: Beyond the basics [^114rhen4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

After reading this article, the participant should be able to:

- **Discuss the initial management**: Focus on cutaneous malignant melanoma regarding diagnostic biopsy and currently accepted resection margins.
- **Be familiar with management options**: Include specific situations such as subungual melanoma, auricular melanoma, and melanoma in pregnant patients.
- **Discuss characteristics of desmoplastic melanoma**: Include its treatment options.
- **List the indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy**: Be aware of ongoing trials and literature.
- **Discuss available medical therapies**: Focus on treatments for patients with metastatic melanoma.

Management of patients with melanoma is a complex and evolving subject. Plastic surgeons should be aware of the recent changes in the field. Excisional biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis; however, there is no evidence that using other biopsy types alters survival or recurrence. Wide local excisions should be performed with margins as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines according to the lesion's Breslow depth. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be offered to all medically suitable candidates with intermediate-thickness melanomas (1.0 to 4.0 mm) and should be considered for high-risk lesions (ulceration and/or high mitotic figures) in melanomas of 0.75 to 1.0 mm.

Melanomas diagnosed during pregnancy can be treated with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and wide local excision under local anesthesia, with sentinel lymph node biopsy as appropriate.

### The role of soft tissue reconstruction after melanoma resection in the head and neck [^114W6ufo]. Head & Neck (2001). Low credibility.

Reconstruction after wide local excision of melanomas in the head and neck can be formidable. Many tumors lie close to vital structures, and excision must carefully balance preservation of form and function. For small defects, primary closure or skin grafting is satisfactory. However, it has become increasingly evident that more advanced reconstructive procedures can improve the outcome in terms of both function and aesthetics. This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of flap closure after wide local excision of melanomas in the head and neck and to develop a set of surgical recommendations based on our experience.

- **Method**: We reviewed 35 patients who underwent 39 flap closures at The University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center after the wide local excision of head and neck melanomas. Local flaps were primarily used to close defects after the resection of superficial or intermediate-thickness melanomas. Pedicle and free flaps were used to cover larger defects resulting from the excision of extensive tumors. The flap closures were compared with an analogous database of 560 melanoma resections that underwent primary closure or skin grafting.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patient population was 57 years. The most common location for tumor presentation was the cheek, followed by the ear, forehead, and lip. Pathologic findings most commonly demonstrated superficial spreading melanoma, and the average defect size was 30.7 cm². Local flaps were used most often for reconstruction. The only variable that significantly predicted local recurrence…

### Melanoma of the ear: prognostic factors and surgical strategies [^112iXdjN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The ear's specific anatomical and lymphatic characteristics impose special requirements on the treatment of melanoma of the ear. The aim of this prospective study was to define prognostic factors for melanoma of the ear and to evaluate surgical strategies for excision margins, histological evaluation, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to achieve better cosmetic and functional results.

One hundred and sixty-one patients with stage I/II melanoma of the external ear were treated in the Department of Dermatology, University of Tuebingen, from March 1976 to March 2004, with a median follow-up of 62 months. Malignant melanoma of the external ear represented 3% of the stage I/II cutaneous melanomas and 20% of the stage I/II head and neck melanomas recorded in the Melanoma Registry of the Department of Dermatology at the University of Tuebingen.

- **Histological evaluation**: Twenty of 42 lentigo maligna melanomas (LMM) underwent conventional histological evaluation, while 22 underwent complete three-dimensional histology of excision margins (3D histology) in a paraffin-technique, i.e. micrographic surgery.
- **Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)**: SLNB was performed in 28 patients with melanomas thicker than 1.0 mm.
- **Risk factors**: Clinical, histological, and surgical risk factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.

The median thickness of the tumors in the present study was 1.08 mm (mean 1.51 mm; range 0.18–8.50 mm), and the median excision margins were 11.0 mm (mean 12.61 mm; range 2.0–31.0 mm). The 3-year disease-specific survival rate was 98%, and the 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was not provided.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^116wuX1r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Materials and methods: Data were obtained from the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) prospectively maintained database. All patients diagnosed with an invasive melanoma involving the cartilaginous ear between 1990 and 2022 were included. Data analysis was performed to assess the association between cartilage resection and local recurrence (LR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).

Patient files, operation and pathology reports, and follow-up letters were reviewed when any ambiguity was present. Cartilage resection was determined either by the presence of cartilage noted in the histopathology report and/or description of a cartilage resection in the operation report. When available, slides of patients with reported invasion into cartilage or perichondrium were reviewed by an expert dermatopathologist for confirmation. Patients with in situ disease only or tumors located at the earlobe were excluded.

The follow-up period was calculated from the date of definitive treatment of the primary melanoma to the last follow-up visit or death. Data were summarized using frequencies and proportions for categorical variables, and means (with standard deviations) and medians (with ranges) for continuous variables.

Patient characteristics and clinicopathological features were summarized and stratified by cartilage resection (categorized as cartilage resection or cartilage sparing). RFS, MSS, and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by cartilage resection. Landmark survival rates at 3 and 5 years were derived.

### Wide versus narrow excision margins for high-risk, primary cutaneous melanomas: Long-term follow-up of survival in a randomised trial [^111QtgFQ]. The Lancet Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Research in context**: We searched PubMed for articles published up to August 1, 2015, on randomised trials assessing surgical excision margins in cutaneous melanoma, using the search terms "melanoma", "margins", "excision", and "surgery". No languages were excluded from the search. We identified five randomised trials that analysed the effect of surgical margins on outcomes in cutaneous melanoma. None of these trials have shown a significant effect of the choice of surgical margins on either locoregional relapse or melanoma-specific survival. However, some of these studies have shown non-significant results favouring wider margins in minimizing locoregional and distant relapse.

- **Added value of this study**: This study reports on long-term survival analysis and, to our knowledge, is the first to show that wider surgical margins result in a significant improvement in melanoma-specific survival.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: This study, alongside the other randomised trials, reiterates international guidelines stating that a 1 cm margin is inadequate for the treatment of a melanoma greater than 2 mm in Breslow thickness. It lends support to further investigation of the adequacy of a 1 cm margin for melanomas between 1 mm and 2 mm in thickness, especially those with other poor prognostic features, for which most international guidelines at present still advise a 1 cm excision.

In 2004, we reported the findings from our randomised clinical trial of patients with high-risk malignant melanoma (Breslow thickness ≥ 2 mm) randomly assigned.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^117SfCRp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

The decision to resect cartilage is not solely based on oncological negative margins but should also consider patient factors such as skin quality and potential inhibitors of wound healing, such as smoking, diabetes, and immunosuppression, which may inhibit the healing of skin grafts and local flaps. Functional aspects should also be considered, including the need to wear glasses or hearing aids. This study demonstrates that cartilage resection is not essential to achieve good oncological outcomes for patients with invasive melanomas, even if presenting with high-risk primary lesions.

Limitations of this study include the retrospective design, which resulted in some missing data points, including 36% of patients who did not have the exact location of their lesions described in the database, clinical notes, or histological report. However, we hypothesize that the proportion of patients in each anatomical site would remain relatively similar and in keeping with the distribution of tumors described in other studies, with the helix being the most common site of occurrence.

Despite this, we report a large cohort of a relatively uncommon melanoma location. To our knowledge, this was the first study to compare melanoma-specific outcomes between patients who have cartilage resection and those who have a cartilage-sparing procedure. In addition, in this large cohort of ear melanomas, we confirm the results.

### Cartilage resection in the surgical management of ear melanoma [^1147N9Vq]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Melanoma of the external ear accounts for approximately 1% of cutaneous melanoma cases and 7–14% of melanomas arising in the head and neck region. Evidence for the surgical management of this subgroup of melanoma patients is limited to small retrospective case series and case reports. Additionally, few studies have compared melanoma-specific outcomes for patients who have and have not had cartilage-sparing resections, which is an important consideration in the decision process for resection and reconstruction of this anatomically complex body region.

Some studies have suggested a worse prognosis and more aggressive growth pattern for ear melanomas, advocating for more aggressive resections, including total or partial amputation. More recently, others have suggested a more conservative surgical approach without compromising oncological outcomes. In addition, guidelines are based on studies that are poorly represented by ear melanomas and do not provide guidance on the required deep margin. There is, therefore, a need for further investigation of these patients to determine optimal margins, particularly the need to include cartilage in the resection if not clinically involved.

The external ear is a surgically complex body region, where oncological clearance must be balanced with good cosmetic outcomes and maintenance of function, including the funneling of sound into the external acoustic meatus to facilitate hearing and allowing placement of glasses and hearing aids if required. Preservation of cartilage may help to maintain these important functions.
