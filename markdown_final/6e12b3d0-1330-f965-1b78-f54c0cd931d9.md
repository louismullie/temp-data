## Question

Treatment of DKA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity. Then, I should verify precipitating causes and comorbidities. Next, I will review fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and potassium management. After that, I need to check special populations and complications. Finally, I will consider monitoring, transition to subcutaneous insulin, and prevention strategies, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria and severity, because treatment hinges on getting this right. DKA is defined by hyperglycemia or known diabetes, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis; importantly, hyperglycemia is not required in euglycemic DKA, so I should not anchor on glucose alone and must measure β-hydroxybutyrate when available rather than relying on urine ketones, which are less reliable for diagnosis and monitoring [^1c4044c1] [^5aee2556] [^0e3e6928]. I should classify severity by venous pH and bicarbonate, and I need to remember that SGLT2 inhibitor–associated DKA can present with glucose less than 200 mg/dL, so I must actively consider euglycemic DKA in those patients [^50235045] [^f4a24e0a].

> Wait, let me verify precipitating causes and comorbidities before jumping into treatment, because identifying and treating the trigger is essential. Common precipitants include infection, insulin omission or pump failure, myocardial ischemia, stroke, trauma, surgery, and medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors, glucocorticoids, and atypical antipsychotics; I should also screen for COVID-19 in the right context and assess for chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or pregnancy, as these affect fluid and insulin choices [^2d7ffc06] [^f4a24e0a] [^078098a1]. I need to ensure I obtain electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, glucose, and an ECG, and consider additional tests based on suspicion for infection or ischemia [^c63e549e] [^34c57fa9].

> Next, I should review fluid resuscitation, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. For adults with severe hypovolemia, isotonic saline or a balanced crystalloid at 1.0 L/hour for the first 2–4 hours is appropriate, with subsequent fluids tailored to volume status and sodium concentration; balanced crystalloids may hasten DKA resolution compared with saline, though I should individualize in those at risk of fluid overload [^3ca299c7] [^38f412cd]. For milder cases, replacing about half the estimated deficit over 8–12 hours with 0.9% saline or balanced crystalloid is reasonable, and I should add dextrose when glucose falls below 250 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketonemia resolves [^e80037eb] [^64da3dbb]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances: in children, avoid rapid shifts in osmolality and use 10–20 mL/kg 0.9% saline boluses for shock, followed by calculated maintenance and deficit replacement with close neurologic monitoring for cerebral edema risk [^ef45147e] [^0f802fc1].

> I will now examine insulin therapy, and I need to ensure I match route and dose to severity. For moderate-to-severe DKA, continuous IV regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/hour is standard; if there is a delay in starting the infusion, a 0.1 units/kg IV bolus can be considered, and I should reduce to 0.05 units/kg/hour when glucose drops below 150 mg/dL to mitigate hypoglycemia and hypokalemia while continuing insulin until ketonemia clears [^f8275f26] [^c54599f2]. For mild DKA, subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin every 1–2 hours at 0.1–0.2 units/kg can be effective when combined with aggressive fluids, with dose reduction as glucose approaches 150 mg/dL; I should confirm that the patient is hemodynamically stable and reliable for this route [^f8275f26] [^e17a9af3]. But wait, what if I want to prevent rebound hyperglycemia? Early basal insulin during IV infusion can shorten DKA duration and length of stay without excess hypoglycemia; if the patient was on basal insulin, I should continue it, and if not, I can start 0.25 units/kg/day glargine or degludec after initial fluids, ideally 2–4 hours before stopping the infusion to avoid relapse [^ead6658b] [^d03c1d81] [^c54599f2].

> Let me think about potassium management, because this is where dangerous shifts occur. Despite total body potassium deficits, serum potassium is often normal or high at presentation due to insulinopenia and acidosis; with insulin and fluids, potassium plummets, so I should check renal function and replace potassium proactively. If potassium is less than 3.5 mmol/L, I should replace aggressively, even delaying insulin if necessary; if 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, I should add 10–20 mmol/L to IV fluids; if greater than 5.0 mmol/L, I can start insulin and reassess potassium every 2–4 hours, anticipating the drop [^51833118] [^480053bc]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing hypokalemia risk in patients with low pH; a pH-adjusted potassium framework can help anticipate expected losses and guide replacement, but I need to balance this against the risk of hyperkalemia if I replace too early in anuric patients [^e3016871].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and complications thoughtfully. In pregnancy, DKA carries high maternal-fetal risk; I should use aggressive fluids and insulin with continuous fetal monitoring and involve obstetrics early [^078098a1]. In chronic kidney disease or heart failure, I must avoid fluid overload and consider pressors if shock persists despite cautious resuscitation; in pediatrics, I should prioritize slow, controlled fluid administration and maintain a high index of suspicion for cerebral edema with readiness to administer mannitol or hypertonic saline emergently [^3ca299c7] [^ef45147e]. For SGLT2-associated DKA, I should stop the SGLT2 inhibitor immediately, anticipate euglycemia, and be prepared to increase dextrose to allow higher insulin dosing until ketonemia resolves, as glucosuria may persist and delay recovery [^292dc073] [^9e12ec37].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and transition planning, because premature changes cause relapse. I will monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable, then space out; I should measure potassium about 2 hours after starting insulin and then every 4 hours until resolution to catch hypokalemia early [^c63e549e] [^480053bc]. I should confirm resolution with pH greater than 7.3, bicarbonate greater than 18 mmol/L, and anion gap closure, and only then transition to subcutaneous insulin; to prevent rebound, I will give basal insulin 2–4 hours before stopping the infusion and continue the infusion for 1–2 hours after the first subcutaneous dose, adjusting prandial insulin as the patient resumes eating [^c54599f2] [^c290cc3b].

> I should double-check that my prevention and education plan is concrete, as readmissions are common and preventable. Discharge should include structured education on sick-day rules, ketone monitoring with serum β-hydroxybutyrate, insulin adjustments during illness, and when to seek care; I should also review precipitating factors and ensure follow-up within 1–2 weeks, and for patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, I must reinforce peri-procedural and sick-day management and consider whether to restart the agent after a DKA episode once a clear precipitant is addressed [^190b945d] [^08d1fa6f] [^df9ea45d]. Hold on, I should verify that the patient has access to ketone meters and unexpired strips, because lack of supplies is a frequent barrier to early detection and self-management [^9d80f671].

> Finally, I need to ensure my approach remains adaptable to evolving evidence and local protocols. Balanced crystalloids may expedite DKA resolution in adults, early basal insulin can shorten length of stay, and protocolized care reduces errors; however, implementation gaps persist, so I should audit my own practice, align with a standardized DKA pathway, and adjust based on outcomes and guideline updates [^38f412cd] [^ead6658b] [^25097eca] [^01151857].

The cornerstone of DKA management is **IV fluids, insulin, and potassium** [^1c4044c1] with close monitoring and treatment of the precipitating cause [^046be813]. Start **isotonic saline** for hypovolemia [^3ca299c7], then add dextrose when glucose falls below 200 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketonemia resolves [^64da3dbb]. Use **continuous IV insulin** at 0.1 units/kg/h [^f8275f26], and reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h when glucose drops below 150 mg/dL to limit hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [^f8275f26]. Replace potassium based on serum levels and renal function [^51833118], and avoid routine bicarbonate unless severe acidosis with hemodynamic instability persists [^9f5abf56]. Transition to subcutaneous insulin 1–2 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent recurrence [^c54599f2], and address the underlying trigger to reduce readmission risk [^190b945d].

---

## Fluid resuscitation

Fluid therapy restores intravascular volume, improves perfusion, and reduces counterregulatory hormones; **isotonic saline is first-line** [^3ca299c7], with balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's) as an alternative [^38f412cd].

- **Initial fluid resuscitation**: 1.0 L isotonic saline bolus over 1 hour for severe hypovolemia; repeat if needed [^e80037eb].
- **Subsequent fluid management**: 0.9% saline at 500–1,000 mL/h for the first 2–4 hours, then tailor to clinical response and electrolytes [^3ca299c7].
- **Glucose supplementation**: Add 5–10% dextrose when plasma glucose falls below 200 mg/dL to permit continued insulin until ketonemia resolves [^64da3dbb].
- **Special considerations**: Use caution in heart failure, renal failure, or elderly patients to avoid fluid overload [^3ca299c7].

---

## Insulin therapy

Insulin suppresses ketogenesis and corrects hyperglycemia; **continuous IV insulin is standard** for moderate-to-severe DKA [^f8275f26].

- **Initial insulin infusion**: 0.1 units/kg/h IV regular insulin; if delay occurs, give a 0.1 units/kg IV bolus [^f8275f26].
- **Adjustment of insulin dose**: Reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h when glucose falls below 150 mg/dL to limit hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [^f8275f26].
- **Duration of insulin therapy**: Continue until resolution of DKA (pH ≥ 7.3, bicarbonate ≥ 18 mmol/L, anion gap ≤ 12) [^c290cc3b].
- **Transition to subcutaneous insulin**: Start basal insulin 1–2 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent recurrence [^c54599f2].

---

## Electrolyte management

Electrolyte disturbances are common; **potassium replacement is critical** to prevent arrhythmias and hypokalemia [^51833118].

| **Serum potassium** | **Potassium replacement** |
|-|-|
| < 3.5 mmol/L | - 10–20 mmol/h IV until > 3.5 mmol/L <br/> - Central access may be needed for rapid replacement [^51833118] |
| 3.5–5.0 mmol/L | - 10–20 mmol/L in IV fluids <br/> - Adjust to maintain 4–5 mmol/L [^51833118] |
| > 5.0 mmol/L | - Start insulin <br/> - Do not give potassium <br/> - Monitor every 2 hours [^51833118] |

---

Routine phosphate or magnesium replacement is not generally required unless clinically indicated [^c290cc3b].

---

## Monitoring and complications

Close monitoring guides therapy and detects complications early; **frequent reassessment is essential** [^c63e549e].

- **Vital signs and neurologic status**: Monitor hourly initially, then every 2–4 hours as stable.
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check glucose, electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, and ketones every 2–4 hours until stable [^c63e549e].
- **Common complications**: Hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, fluid overload, and cerebral edema (especially in children) [^c1a0b088].
- **Cerebral edema**: Rare but fatal; avoid rapid fluid shifts and monitor for headache, altered mental status, or bradycardia [^c1a0b088].

---

## Identification and treatment of precipitating causes

Addressing the trigger reduces recurrence; **common causes** include infection, insulin omission, myocardial infarction, and medications (e.g. SGLT2 inhibitors) [^f4a24e0a]. Obtain cultures and imaging as indicated, and start antibiotics for suspected infection.

---

## Transition and discharge planning

A structured transition prevents relapse; **education and follow-up are key** [^190b945d]. Continue insulin until DKA resolves, then transition to subcutaneous insulin with overlap [^c54599f2]. Provide education on sick-day rules, ketone monitoring, and when to seek care, and arrange close follow-up to reinforce adherence and prevent recurrence [^190b945d].

---

DKA management centers on **fluids, insulin, and potassium** with vigilant monitoring and cause-directed therapy; adherence to protocols and patient education reduce complications and recurrence [^25097eca].

### Joint British diabetes societies guideline for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^1eb0a9a9]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (these do not cover Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome) are available in full at: (i) http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Our_Views/Care_recommendations/The-Management-of-Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-in-Adults; (ii) http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/publications_and_resources/reports_and_guidance; (iii) http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS_DKA_Management.pdf. This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^85e7324d]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious condition that warrants immediate and aggressive intervention. Even with appropriate intervention, DKA is associated with significant morbidity and possible mortality in diabetic patients in the pediatric age group. With appreciation of its severity, proper understanding of the pathophysiology, and careful attention to the details of management and close monitoring, most cases will have a satisfactory outcome. Because treatment is costly and because the risk for morbidity remains even under the best of circumstances, prevention of DKA must be a major goal in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Involvement and close follow-up by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals with experience in dealing with diabetes in children and adolescents is the best way to avoid DKA.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^68da76b3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that presents commonly to the emergency department. Severe DKA has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on the emergency clinician to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.

Discussion

DKA is a condition found most commonly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent the complications that can occur.

Conclusions

DKA is a medical condition that has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^1c4044c1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy [^078098a1]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The development of diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy is a medical emergency, requiring treatment in an intensive care setting. Both the mother and the fetus are at risk for significant morbidity and mortality. Physiologic changes unique to pregnancy provide a background for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis. An understanding of these physiologic changes assists in the management of the two patients being treated. Treatment of the patient with diabetic ketoacidosis includes insulin therapy and careful fluid management; recommendations for management are presented.

Patients

Pregnant women, either with preexisting diabetes or with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Prompt recognition of the clinical manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis, followed by appropriate, timely treatment will optimize outcome for the pregnant woman and her fetus.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^3ca299c7]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^e80037eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours < br > - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL < br > - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|
|Cardiac compromise|- Hemodynamic monitoring/pressors.|

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults-an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes society for inpatient care [^38af5b2b]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de-escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end-stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^ead6658b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis… [^fd358df8]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The therapeutic goals for diabetic ketoacidosis consist of improving circulatory volume and tissue perfusion, reducing blood glucose and serum osmolality toward normal levels, clearing ketones from serum and urine at a steady rate, correcting electrolyte imbalances and identifying precipitating factors. A suggested flow sheet for monitoring therapeutic response is provided in Figure 3.
6. The initial priority in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is the restoration of extra-cellular fluid volume through the intravenous administration of a normal saline solution. This step will restore intravascular volume, decrease counterregulatory hormones and lower the blood glucose level. 9 As a result, insulin sensitivity may be augmented. In patients with mild to moderate volume depletion, infusion rates of 7 mL per kg per hour have been as efficacious as infusion rates of 14 mL per kg per hour.

10 The subsequent administration of a hypotonic saline solution, which is similar in composition to the fluid lost during osmotic diuresis, leads to gradual replacement of deficits in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. INSULIN THERAPY Modern management of diabetic ketoacidosis has emphasized the use of lower doses of insulin. This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis. 11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. POTASSIUM THERAPY Although the typical potassium deficit in diabetic ketoacidosis is 500 to 700 mEq, most patients are hyperkalemic at the time of diagnosis because of the effects of insulinopenia, hyperosmolality and acidemia.

4 During rehydration and insulin therapies for diabetic ketoacidosis, the serum potassium concentration typically declines rapidly as potassium reenters the intracellular compartment. One protocol entails using insulin and intravenous fluids until the serum potassium concentration is less than 5. 5 mEq per L. At this time, potassium chloride is added to intravenous fluids in the amount of 20 to 40 mEq per L. The exact amount of potassium that is administered depends on the serum potassium concentration. Patients with known diabetes can typically be given the dosage they were receiving before the onset of diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^25483cb0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^6a304466]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^2c9ea69c]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The object of this review is to provide the definitions, frequency, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnostic considerations, and management recommendations for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children and adolescents, and to convey current knowledge of the causes of permanent disability or mortality from complications of DKA or its management, particularly the most common complication, cerebral edema (CE). DKA frequency at the time of diagnosis of pediatric diabetes is 10%–70%, varying with the availability of healthcare and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the community. Recurrent DKA rates are also dependent on medical services and socioeconomic circumstances. Management should be in centers with experience and where vital signs, neurologic status, and biochemistry can be monitored with sufficient frequency to prevent complications or, in the case of CE, to intervene rapidly with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion. Fluid infusion should precede insulin administration (0.1 U/kg/h) by 1–2 hours; an initial bolus of 10–20 mL/kg 0.9% saline is followed by 0.45% saline calculated to supply maintenance and replace 5%–10% dehydration. Potassium (K) must be replaced early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is contraindicated. The prevention of DKA at onset of diabetes requires an informed community and high index of suspicion; prevention of recurrent DKA, which is almost always due to insulin omission, necessitates a committed team effort.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^01151857]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes‐related ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life‐threatening yet preventable complication of predominantly type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it may also occur in ketosis‐prone type 2 diabetes (T2D) and with the use of novel agents such as sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.DKA is characterised by a triad of blood glucose concentration > 11.0 mmol/L or known diagnosis of diabetes, capillary of blood ketone concentration > 3.0 mmol/L or significant ketonuria and bicarbonate concentration of < 15.0 mmol/L and/or venous pH < 7.3.DKA may occur in states of absolute or relative insulin deficiency or as a consequence of a rise in counter‐regulatory hormones including cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon and catecholamines. The alteration in hormone levels contributes to elevated blood glucose, lipolysis, ketone body production and electrolyte imbalances. Mismanagement of DKA may result in increased length of hospital admission and high readmission rates. Previous studies have demonstrated that protocol‐driven management of DKA is a safe approach — decreasing the duration of DKA and length of hospital admission with no difference in hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia.

Though the diagnostic criteria for DKA remain unambiguous in the United Kingdom, there remains a variation in DKA management guidelines between hospital sites. To reduce errors and improve the standard of care, the Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) published national guidelines for DKA management, which have been regularly revised. Initial surveys have demonstrated a high uptake of guidelines. Management within the emergency department or acute medical unit is initiated in a timely manner, presumably due to a higher nursing staff‐to‐patient ratio and familiarisation with guidelines. However, prompt monitoring and review are often overlooked when patients are transferred to general medical wards. Rates of continued guideline adherence in clinical practice and, thus, the impact of guideline revisions on outcomes remains less well explored. A national survey of DKA management demonstrated a high burden of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia episodes, with the use of insulin recognised as the primary driver for these biochemical abnormalities. Therefore, based upon expert consensus, the 2021 revision recommends reducing the fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate to 0.05 units/kg/h. when blood glucose reduces to less than 14 mmol/L to avoid complications, including hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. However, whether this guideline change has resulted in the expected improvement in DKA care is unknown.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^ef45147e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

The convergence of the NICE and BSPED guidelines is a welcome development in the emergency management of paediatric DKA. This will provide much needed clarity to the treating clinicians, reducing regional variation and decreasing the potential for error. Despite the pathophysiology of CO remaining uncertain, fluid therapy must be carefully controlled, as inadequate resuscitation is likely to increase the risk of brain injury and thus must be avoided.

There is emerging evidence for a more judicious approach in the management of DKAand the NICE and BSPED guidelines are now largely concordant in this regard. A number of minor differences in the guidelines remain, but these are unlikely to profoundly influence patient management or outcomes. As both guidelines have changed considerably since their conception, and now have only minor differences, it could be argued that there is no benefit of two guidelines. The existence of two guidelines in the UK is primarily historical, with both guideline-producing groups having good reason to be interested in this area. However, the UK would, in our opinion, be better served with a single set of guidance to avoid confusion and harmonise practice.

Despite this, it is imperative that the incidence of CO continues to be monitored following a change to the guidelines and, in addition, this may offer insights into the underlying pathophysiological basis and effective preventative measures.

In the meantime, for junior clinicians treating DKA in CYP, close supervision by experienced paediatricians, careful monitoring and adherence to a single-set of evidence-based guidelines are likely to translate into better outcomes for this challenging condition.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^98766ad9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis management and short-term insulin use — Of adolescents in whom T2DM is subsequently diagnosed, 5% to 25% present with ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis must be treated with insulin and fluid and electrolyte replacement, and patients in whom ketoacidosis is diagnosed require immediate treatment with insulin and fluid replacement in an inpatient setting under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in treating this complication. Youth and adolescents with T2DM and poor glycemic control (BG concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dl or HbA1c > 9%) but lacking evidence of ketosis or ketoacidosis may also benefit from initial treatment with insulin, at least on a short-term basis, and many patients with T2DM can be weaned gradually from insulin therapy and subsequently managed with metformin and lifestyle modification. When diabetes type is uncertain, these patients are best managed initially with insulin therapy while appropriate tests are performed to differentiate between T1DM and T2DM, and the care of such patients should be supervised by a physician experienced in treating diabetic patients with insulin.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic entity seen in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in the emergency department. Having an understanding of its pathophysiology, a consequence of absent to low insulin levels, delineates the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss. The newer management modalities are discussed that include the need for intensive laboratory workup, meticulous monitoring of the insulin, and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. The new insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for management of DKA is proposed.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in COVID-19: unique concerns and considerations [^2d7ffc06]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

While individuals with diabetes appear to be at similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without diabetes, they are more likely to suffer severe consequences, including death. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and potentially lethal acute complication of diabetes arising from a relative insulin deficiency, which occurs more often in those with type 1 diabetes and in the setting of moderate to severe illness. Early reports indicate that among patients with pre-existing diabetes, DKA may be a common complication of severe COVID-19 and a poor prognostic sign.

Case Description

This clinical perspective explores the key elements of caring for individuals with DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic through 2 cases. Topics addressed include diagnosis, triage, and the fundamental principles of treatment with a focus on the importance of characterizing DKA severity and medical complexity to determine the best approach.

Conclusions

As discussed, some tenets of DKA management may require flexibility in the setting of COVID-19 due to important public health goals, such as preventing transmission to highest risk individuals, reducing healthcare worker exposure to infected patients, and preserving personal protective equipment. Evidence for alternative treatment strategies is explored, with special attention placed on treatment options that may be more relevant during the pandemic, including use of subcutaneous insulin therapy. Finally, DKA is often a preventable condition. We include evidence-based strategies and guidance designed to empower clinicians and patients to avoid this serious complication when possible.

### International consensus on risk management of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors [^d259000c]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are new oral antidiabetes medications shown to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycemic variability, blood pressure, and body weight without intrinsic properties to cause hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. However, recent studies, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes, have demonstrated increases in the absolute risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. Strategies must be developed and disseminated to the medical community to mitigate the associated DKA risk. This Consensus Report reviews current data regarding SGLT inhibitor use and provides recommendations to enhance the safety of SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^d005ce66]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Previous research indicates that adhering to protocol‐driven DKA management improves outcomes. The Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) group formulated guidelines for standardised DKA care. However, compliance with JBDS‐IP guidelines in clinical practice and its impact on clinical and patient‐centred outcomes remains insufficiently explored.
In DKA episodes where fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate reduction was adopted, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII rate when glucose was < 14 mmol/L. We did not find any favourable effect on the rate of complications or outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced‐rate FRIII.
Understanding factors that influence adherence to guidelines is crucial in creating resources to implement guidelines effectively.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guideline: diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings-role of subcutaneous insulin [^6c40212e]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Clinical Practice Consensus Guideline 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people. Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritized or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines, is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarizes evidence for the role of subcutaneous insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f8275f26]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine insulin route and dosage according to the severity of hyperglycemic crisis:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Insulin SC. 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as SC bolus, then 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every 1 hours or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours < br > - Insulin IV. As an alternative to insulin SC, with the regimen similar to moderate-to-severe DKA < br > - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every 2 hours when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Moderate-to-severe DKA|- Insulin IV. 0.1 units/kg/h short-acting insulin IV fixed-rate infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values < br > - Consider administering 0.1 units/kg short-acting insulin as IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion < br > - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state|- Insulin IV. start 0.05 units/kg/h short-acting insulin as fixed-rate IV infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values < br > - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 200–250 mg/dL range until resolution.|

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^0f802fc1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Specifically, the NICE 2015 guidelines were more conservative with fluid administration, in order to avoid rapid changes in osmolality. The BSPED guidelines permitted a more generous fluid allowance, and this raised concerns about precipitating CO. The conflicting advice generated challenges in the emergency setting, with arbitrary site-specific preference rather than evidence-based medicine taking precedence. In addition to generating uncertainty of treatment pathways increasing the risk of clinical error, the regional variability hampered service evaluation and audit of clinical practice.

Unfortunately, there is little data to establish differences in their efficacy, especially surrounding the risk of CO in the paediatric population. However, inadequate resuscitation is likely to increase the risk of brain injury and thus must be avoided. Further research on a national scale is required to assess this.

This article aims to highlight the considerable alterations made to the two main UK guidelines. Alongside these updates, this article will provide clinical context to paediatricians and junior doctors who are likely to treat these vulnerable groups.

### Advances in the management of type 2 diabetes in adults [^545ffb92]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis

SGLT2is are associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in people with type 1 diabetes and in the perioperative population. Rates in adults with type 2 diabetes are low and range from 0.16 to 0.76 events per 1000 patient years. In type 2 diabetes, the risk is increased in people who are insulin deficient, in older people, with prolonged use of SGLT2is, or in those with a combination of these factors. Guidance on risk management of diabetic ketoacidosis is mainly from individuals with type 1 diabetes, with little guidance specific to type 2 diabetes, and recommendations are mostly extrapolated from the type 1 diabetes context. People with diabetes should be informed of the importance of adherence to insulin treatment, avoiding very low carbohydrate diets (such as ketotic diets), and excessive intake of alcohol. Education on management of sick days should also be given, and insulin doses should be monitored carefully; basal insulin should not be discontinued completely during illness or planned activity, particularly in those receiving intensive insulin treatment.

Clinicians and people with diabetes should be aware of predisposing factors and the clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis, which often occurs with lower serum glucose levels (so-called euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis), sometimes at glucose concentrations of ≤ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). The SGLT2i should be discontinued and treatment started promptly if diabetic ketoacidosis is suspected. SGLT2is should also be discontinued 3–4 days before scheduled surgery, during prolonged fasting or low carbohydrate intake, or during critical illness to lessen the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Some have suggested that absence of ketosis (< 0.6 mmol/L blood ketones, negative urine ketones) should be confirmed in people with type 1 diabetes before the start of treatment if SGLT2is are being used off label in this population, but no evidence exists in support of this practice for people with type 2 diabetes.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^34c57fa9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### ESPE / LWPES consensus statement on diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents [^c1a0b088]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM). Mortality is predominantly related to the occurrence of cerebral oedema; only a minority of deaths in DKA are attributed to other causes. Cerebral oedema occurs in about 0.3–1% of all episodes of DKA, and its aetiology, pathophysiology, and ideal method of treatment are poorly understood. There is debate as to whether physicians treating DKA can prevent or predict the occurrence of cerebral oedema, and the appropriate site(s) for children with DKA to be managed. There is agreement that prevention of DKA and reduction of its incidence should be a goal in managing children with diabetes.

### Improving management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^072f4f86]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The optimal fluid management for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is uncertain. In an effort to simplify DKA therapy, we revised the treatment protocol in our institution to use a simpler method of calculating fluid needs, use fluids with higher sodium concentration, and allow glucose concentration to be adjusted easily. We performed a retrospective study to determine the effects of these revisions.

Design

We compared patients treated with traditional and revised protocols (~220 and ~300 patients, respectively, over consecutive 2.75-year intervals). Sixty patient records were randomly selected from the first group (30 treated with each of 2 protocol versions) and 30 from the second group. Biochemical and clinical parameters were analyzed.

Results

Patients selected for detailed analysis were similar in demographics and initial laboratory measurements. Patients treated under the revised fluid protocol received less total fluid, needed fewer intravenous fluid changes, were treated at less cost, and resolved acidosis more rapidly than patients treated under the original protocols. The rate of cerebral edema (0.3%-0.5%) was unchanged.

Conclusion

A DKA protocol that necessitates less fluid delivery and fewer calculations simplifies therapy and is associated with more rapid correction of acidosis.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a critical and life‐threatening complication that occurs in people with diabetes, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with an increasing proportion of cases in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The incidence of diabetes is rising globally, contributing to a reported 55% increase in DKA admissions over the past decade. The key to effective management of this condition is prompt diagnosis and the timely administration of appropriate treatment to correct the metabolic derangements in DKA (hyperglycaemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis), which result from a combination of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and elevated levels of counterregulatory hormones (e.g. glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone).

Insulin therapy is one of the cornerstones of DKA management. Most patients are treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin until DKA resolves, at which point they are transitioned to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. Early use of basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) is increasingly common in clinical practice, as evidenced by several prospective studies. These studies have reported that coadministration of a low dose (0.15–0.3 units/kg) of glargine U‐100 during IVII reduces the time to DKA resolution, the duration of IVII, and the length of hospital stay (LOS), while also preventing rebound hyperglycaemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In accordance with the UK guideline, long‐acting basal insulin should be continued in patients already receiving it, or initiated at a dose of 0.25 units/kg once daily in newly diagnosed patients. Although insulin degludec has become increasingly utilised as a basal insulin in diabetes management, evidence supporting its effectiveness in the management of DKA remains lacking.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^50235045]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an emerging complication of diabetes associated with an increasing use of sodium-glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor drugs. This review highlights the growing incidence of EDKA and its diagnostic challenges due to the absence of hallmark hyperglycemia seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The paper presents a classification system for the severity of EDKA, categorizing it into mild, moderate, and severe based on serum pH and bicarbonate levels. Another classification system is proposed to define stages of EDKA based on anion gap and ketones at the time of diagnosis and during the treatment period. A treatment algorithm is proposed to guide clinicians in managing EDKA. This treatment algorithm includes monitoring anion gap and ketones to guide insulin and fluid management, and slower transition to subcutaneous insulin to prevent a relapse. Increased awareness of EDKA is essential for a timely diagnosis because an early diagnosis and treatment can improve clinical outcomes.

### Re-visiting pH-adjusted potassium to avoid hypokalemic crisis during management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a conceptual framework [^e3016871]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment guidelines recommend to initiate potassium-replacement when serum potassium (S K) drops within normal range, and to withhold insulin if S K is below normal. Despite strict recommendations, hypokalemia is frequently observed in DKA.

Methods

Scientific literature was thoroughly searched to find 1) DKA treatment guidelines, 2) studies reporting hypokalemia in DKA, 3) and literature elaborating mechanisms involved in hypokalemia.

Results

Acidosis affects S K and its regulators including insulin, catecholamines and aldosterone. Current conceptual framework is an argument to gauge the degree of hypokalemia before it strikes DKA patients utilizing S K level after adjusting it with pH. Suggested approach will reduce hypokalemia risk and its associated complications. The nomogram calculates pH-adjusted potassium and expected potassium loss. It also ranks hypokalemia associated risk, and proposes the potassium-replacement rate over given time period. The differences between current DKA treatment guidelines and proposed strategy are also discussed. Moreover, reasons and risk of hyperkalemia due to early initiation of potassium replacement and remedial actions are debated.

Conclusion

In light of proposed strategy, utilizing the nomogram ensures reduced incidence of hypokalemia in DKA resulting in improved clinical and patient outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic benefits can also be expected when avoiding hypokalemia ensures early discharge.

### Approach to the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^94182727]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of severe metabolic acidosis, remains a life-threatening condition due to complications of both the disease and its treatment. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case discusses DKA management, emphasizing complications of treatment. Because cerebral edema is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in children with DKA, we emphasize its pathophysiology and implications for therapy. The risk for cerebral edema may be minimized by avoiding a bolus of insulin, excessive saline resuscitation, and a decrease in effective plasma osmolality early in treatment. A goal of fluid therapy is to lower muscle venous Pco 2 to ensure effective removal of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate buffer in muscle and diminish the binding of hydrogen ions to intracellular proteins in vital organs (such as the brain). In patients with DKA and a relatively low plasma potassium level, insulin administration may cause hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. It is suggested in these cases to temporarily delay insulin administration and first administer potassium chloride intravenously to bring the plasma potassium level close to 4mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate administration in adult patients should be individualized. We suggest it be considered in a subset of patients with moderately severe acidemia (pH < 7.20 and plasma bicarbonate level < 12mmol/L) who are at risk for worsening acidemia, particularly if hemodynamically unstable. Sodium bicarbonate should not be administered to children with DKA, except if acidemia is very severe and hemodynamic instability is refractory to saline administration.

### Diabetic emergencies-ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and hypoglycaemia [^526d24e2]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and hypoglycaemia are serious complications of diabetes mellitus that require prompt recognition, diagnosis and treatment. DKA and HHS are characterized by insulinopaenia and severe hyperglycaemia; clinically, these two conditions differ only by the degree of dehydration and the severity of metabolic acidosis. The overall mortality recorded among children and adults with DKA is < 1%. Mortality among patients with HHS is ~10-fold higher than that associated with DKA. The prognosis and outcome of patients with DKA or HHS are determined by the severity of dehydration, the presence of comorbidities and age > 60 years. The estimated annual cost of hospital treatment for patients experiencing hyperglycaemic crises in the USA exceeds US$2 billion. Hypoglycaemia is a frequent and serious adverse effect of antidiabetic therapy that is associated with both immediate and delayed adverse clinical outcomes, as well as increased economic costs. Inpatients who develop hypoglycaemia are likely to experience a long duration of hospital stay and increased mortality. This Review describes the clinical presentation, precipitating causes, diagnosis and acute management of these diabetic emergencies, including a discussion of practical strategies for their prevention.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes between initially diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis [^42d685ab]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the first manifestation. Differentiating types of newly diagnosed diabetes could provide appropriate long-term management. Therefore, we conducted this study to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between initially diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients presenting with DKA.

Materials and methods

A retrospective study was conducted on adult patients who presented with DKA as the first diagnosis of diabetes in our tertiary hospital between January 2005 and December 2019. Demographic data, precipitating causes, laboratory investigations, treatment, and outcomes were obtained by chart review. The primary outcome was to compare the clinical characteristics of initially diagnosed patients with T1DM and T2DM who presented with DKA.

Results

A total of 100 initially diagnosed diabetic patients who presented with DKA were analyzed (85 T2DM patients and 15 T1DM patients). Patients with T1DM were younger than patients with T2DM (mean age 33 ± 16.2 vs. 51 ± 14.5 years, p value < 0.001). Patients with T2DM had a higher body mass index, family history of diabetes, precipitating factors, plasma glucose, and lower renal function than those with T1DM. There was no difference in resolution time or DKA management between T1DM and T2DM patients. The overall mortality rate of DKA was 4%.

Conclusion

In this population, most adult patients who presented with DKA had T2DM. Older age, obesity, a family history of diabetes, and the presence of precipitating factors were strong predictors of T2DM. We can implement the same clinical management for DKA in both T1DM and T2DM patients. However, T2DM patients had longer hospitalization than T1DM patients. After DKA resolution for 12 months, more than half of patients with T2DM could discontinue insulin. Therefore, the accurate classification of the type of diabetes leads to appropriate treatment.

### Awareness and knowledge of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with type 1 diabetes: a cross-sectional, multicenter survey [^9d80f671]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the management of DKA, increased home ketone monitoring may lead to self-management of ketoacidosis prior to hospital admission and thus improve individual outcomes. However, in our cohort, 60% of participants reported that their ketone test strips were either expired or they did not know.

A total of 67% of individuals wanted more information about the condition of DKA, particularly through general information and discussion with their doctor. Healthcare professionals play an important role in the prevention of DKA. In our study, patient-reported knowledge of DKA did not match the perceived knowledge of their healthcare professionals, who rated patients' knowledge significantly higher than the patients themselves. These findings suggest a communication gap in the physician–patient relationship. The Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care as well as other societies strongly recommend education about DKA in people living with diabetes and several programs and practical recommendations do existeven for individuals treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In particular, they recommend counseling about precipitating factors and early warning symptoms, including the rules about sick days. They also emphasize the involvement of healthcare professionals by including an assessment of the individual's understanding of DKA. Participation in a structured diabetes (self-)education program leads to a substantial risk reduction of DKA and is cost-effective, as shown by numerous studies. However, our results suggest that DKA seems to play a minor role or used means in adults are less effective in the management of T1D among physicians and diabetes nurses, or that the tools used in adults are less effective. There is a need for appropriate patient education.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^5a12e985]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Management

Children with established diabetes, who are not vomiting or severely ill, and whose caregiver has been trained in sick day management, can be managed at home or at an outpatient facility, with appropriate supervision and follow-up.–Children who are vomiting and not severely ill may be managed with intravenous (IV) fluids in an emergency department and discharged to home if able to take fluids orally following rehydration, if venous pH is above 7.25, and telephone follow-up can be assured. Children requiring IV rehydration over an extended period need to be admitted to a unit in which neurological status and vital signs can be monitored frequently and blood glucose levels measured hourly. Nursing staff trained in monitoring and management of DKA should be available and written guidelines should be provided. With severe DKA (long duration of symptoms, compromised circulation, depressed level of consciousness) or if there are other factors increasing the risk for cerebral edema (CE; age under 5 years, low partial pressure of carbon dioxide [pCO 2], high serum urea nitrogen), an intensive care unit, preferably pediatric, or an equivalent facility is appropriate.

Fluid and Insulin Replacement

Goals of Treatment with Fluid and Insulin

Restore perfusion, which will increase glucose uptake in the periphery, increase glomerular filtration, and reverse the progressive acidosis.
Arrest ketogenesis with insulin administration, which reverses proteolysis and lipolysis while stimulating glucose uptake and processing, thereby normalizing blood glucose concentration.
Replace electrolyte losses.
Intervene rapidly when complications, especially CE, occur.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis… [^c290cc3b]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

1 Use of a standard protocol provides consistent results in treating DKA. 2 An evidence-based guideline for the management of DKA from the American Diabetes Association is the basis for much of this article.
3. Treatment A priority of treatment should be to protect and maintain the airway, particularly in the obtunded patient, and to treat shock if present. Patients should be monitored closely and frequently. Blood glucose should be evaluated every one to two hours until the patient is stable, and the blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels should be monitored every two to six hours depending on the severity of DKA. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT TREATMENT Selected patients with mild DKA who are alert and taking fluids orally may be treated under observation and sent home without admission. 3 The ADA admission guidelines are a plasma glucose concentration greater than 250 mg per dL with an arterial pH level below 7.

30, a serum bicarbonate level of less than 15 mEq per L, and a moderate or greater level of ketones in the serum or urine. 27 Patients with severe DKA should be admitted to the intensive care unit. Regular insulin should be used intravenously. Lispro and aspart insulin are more expensive and do not work faster than regular insulin when given intravenously. A newly published regimen is treatment of DKA with subcutaneous aspart or lispro insulin. PHOSPHATE Although the phosphate level frequently is low in patients with DKA, good-quality studies have shown that routine phosphate replacement does not improve outcomes in DKA, and excessive replacement can lead to hypocalcemia. 3, 38–40 If the patient's serum phosphate level is below normal, consider giving one third to one half of the potassium may be given in the form of potassium phosphate, provided the level of serum calcium is monitored closely. 3, 41.

Transition to Standard Regimen and Prevention of Recurrence A blood glucose concentration of less than 200 mg per dL, a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq per L or greater, and a venous pH level of greater than
7. 3 indicate that the DKA has resolved. 3 Typical duration of therapy is about 48 hours. 3 If the patient can eat when DKA has resolved, a standard subcutaneous insulin regimen by injection or insulin pump should be started.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated diabetic ketoacidosis: clinical review and recommendations for prevention and diagnosis [^4cd5bb5a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the newest class of antihyperglycemic agents available on the market. Regulator warnings and concerns regarding the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), however, have dampened enthusiasm for the class despite the combined glycemic, blood pressure, and occasional weight benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors. With the goal of improving patient safety, a cross-Canada expert panel and writing group were convened to review the evidence to-date on reported SGLT2 inhibitor-related DKA incidents and to offer recommendations for preventing and recognizing patients with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA.

Methods

Reports covering DKA events in subjects taking SGLT2 inhibitors that were published in PubMed, presented at professional conferences, or in the public domain from January 2013 to mid-August 2016 were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for diagnosis and prevention were established by the panel.

Findings

DKA is rarely associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Patients with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA may be euglycemic (plasma glucose level < 14 mmol/L). DKA is more likely in patients with insulin-deficient diabetes, including those with type 2 diabetes, and is typically precipitated by insulin omission or dose reduction, severe acute illness, dehydration, extensive exercise, surgery, low-carbohydrate diets, or excessive alcohol intake. SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA may be prevented by withholding SGLT2 inhibitors when precipitants develop, avoiding insulin omission or inappropriate insulin dose reduction, and by following sick day protocols as recommended.

Implications

Preventive strategies should help avoid SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA. All SGLT2 inhibitor-treated patients presenting with signs or symptoms of DKA should be suspected to have DKA and be investigated for DKA, especially euglycemic patients. If DKA is diagnosed, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should be stopped, and the DKA should be treated with a traditional treatment protocol.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^cf43d14b]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

It is essential that inpatient therapy of SGLT2i‐related DKA focuses on providing adequate insulin and dextrose independent of serum glucose concentrations given ongoing glucosuria despite resolution of metabolic acidosis. Monitoring urine glucose concentration may also assist in the risk assessment for DKA relapse in this setting. A larger, prospective multicentre study comparing patients with DKA on SGLT2i to a control group of DKA and no SGLT2i that closely monitors urine glucose concentrations and other relevant clinical factors is necessary to define recommended monitoring and management strategies. Guidelines for treatment of SGLT2i‐related DKA should recognize that patient characteristics and course may differ from that of classical DKA and require vigilance to prevent relapse and extended hospitalization.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^7159fac3]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA is the result of absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in combination with exuberant secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone) resulting in blockade of glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, fat, muscle) and a cascade of derangement progressing to ketoacidosis and dehydration. Much new-onset DKA can be prevented by increased awareness of early signs and symptoms of diabetes and, in principle, almost all recurrent DKA is preventable by informed sick day management, recognition of psychosocial problems leading to insulin omission, and careful monitoring of insulin pump function.

Management of DKA should occur in centers with treatment experience and monitoring capability. Fluid replacement begins with 0.9% saline to restore circulation and subsequent 0.45% saline for maintenance and replacement of 5%–10% dehydration, according to severity indicators. Whether levels of serum K are normal or elevated, there will be a total K deficit that must be dealt with early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is neither necessary nor safe. Mannitol or hypertonic saline should be at the bedside, for rapid intervention as indicated for CE, the most common serious complication of DKA. Other complications include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoglycemia, intracerebral complications other than CE, peripheral venous thrombosis, mucormycosis, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. Among questions that need to be addressed regarding DKA in children and adolescents are whether feasible and cost-effective methods can reduce the frequency of new-onset and recurrent DKA, what characterizes optimal fluid replacement therapy, how effective proposed monitoring and intervention criteria are in the reduction of CE morbidity and mortality, and whether hypertonic saline is as or more effective than mannitol in the treatment of CE.

Key points

Treatment of DKA requires first and foremost fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, followed by replacement for 5%–10% dehydration, depending on severity, and maintenance with 0.45% saline, and early and adequate K replacement.
Insulin should not be given as a bolus, but infused after the initial fluid resuscitation in a dose of 0.1 U/kg of body weight/hour.
Bicarbonate infusion is contraindicated in pediatric DKA.
CE is the most common serious complication, requiring careful neurologic and vital sign monitoring and early intervention with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion.

### Treatment… [^abe3e469]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The therapeutic goals for diabetic ketoacidosis consist of improving circulatory volume and tissue perfusion, reducing blood glucose and serum osmolality toward normal levels, clearing ketones from serum and urine at a steady rate, correcting electrolyte imbalances and identifying precipitating factors. A suggested flow sheet for monitoring therapeutic response is provided in Figure 3.
6. The initial priority in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is the restoration of extra-cellular fluid volume through the intravenous administration of a normal saline solution. This step will restore intravascular volume, decrease counterregulatory hormones and lower the blood glucose level. 9 As a result, insulin sensitivity may be augmented. INSULIN THERAPY Modern management of diabetic ketoacidosis has emphasized the use of lower doses of insulin.

This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis. 11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. When a blood glucose concentration of 250 mg per dL has been achieved, the continuous or hourly insulin dosage can be reduced to 0. 05 unit per kg per hour. The insulin and fluid regimens are continued until ketoacidosis is controlled. This requires the achievement of at least two of these acid-base parameters: a serum bicarbonate concentration of greater than 18 mEq per L, a venous pH of 7. 3 or greater and an anion gap of less than 14 mEq per L.

POTASSIUM THERAPY Although the typical potassium deficit in diabetic ketoacidosis is 500 to 700 mEq, most patients are hyperkalemic at the time of diagnosis because of the effects of insulinopenia, hyperosmolality and acidemia. 4 During rehydration and insulin therapies for diabetic ketoacidosis, the serum potassium concentration typically declines rapidly as potassium reenters the intracellular compartment. Immediate Posthyperglycemic Care When diabetic ketoacidosis has been controlled, subcutaneous insulin therapy can be started. The half-life of regular insulin is less than 10 minutes. Therefore, to avoid relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis, the first subcutaneous dose of regular insulin should be given at least one hour before intravenous insulin is discontinued.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated ketoacidosis vs type 1 diabetes-associated ketoacidosis [^9e12ec37]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In treatment of SGLT2i DKA, a tendency toward euglycemia results in clinically relevant reduction in the amount of insulin administered over the first 24 hours of treatment. It remains unclear whether the protracted duration of SGLT2i DKA is a result of inadequate insulin dosing or the ongoing effect of SGLT2i. It would be reasonable, based on the evidence presented and the safety profile of intravenous dextrose, to increase dextrose infusion rates and concentration to allow increased insulin administration and suppression of ketosis. The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and size. Prospective randomized clinical trial evidence is lacking.

### A systematic literature review on the burden of diabetic ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^6723b2aa]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Currently, an estimated 537 million adults worldwide are living with diabetes, more than 95% of whom have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). People living with diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life‐threatening complication that is characterized by hyperglycaemia (in most cases), hyperketonaemia and acidosis, and requires timely care.DKA risk varies according to diabetes treatment, comorbidities and age. Subgroups at risk of DKA would benefit from ketone monitoring, but few people with diabetes regularly monitor their ketone levels because of a lack of awareness of the importance of ketone monitoring and how to interpret and take action on ketone levels. The current methods for ketone monitoring can be costly and burdensome and are often not reimbursed. In addition, these methods do not indicate the onset of ketosis or ketoacidosis, but rather confirm if it is already in progress.

Although people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM are both susceptible to DKA, the burden of DKA in T2DM is not well defined. To understand the health impact of DKA on patients and the healthcare system, a systematic literature review (SLR) was designed to identify and summarize existing evidence on the prevalence, incidence and burden of DKA in T2DM and to identify those with T2DM at risk of DKA.

### Improving care for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^55dfe721]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to create and implement recommendations from an evidence-based pathway for hospital management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and to sustain improvement. We hypothesized that development and utilization of standard work for inpatient care of DKA would lead to reduction in hypokalemia and improvement in outcome measures.

Methods

Development involved systematic review of published literature by a multidisciplinary team. Implementation included multidisciplinary feedback, hospital-wide education, daily team huddles, and development of computer decision support and electronic order sets.

Results

Pathway-based order sets forced clinical pathway adherence; yet, variations in care persisted, requiring ongoing iterative review and pathway tool adjustment. Quality improvement measures have identified barriers and informed subsequent adjustments to interventions. We compared 281 patients treated postimplementation with 172 treated preimplementation. Our most notable findings included the following: (1) monitoring of serum potassium concentrations identified unanticipated hypokalemia episodes, not recognized before standard work implementation, and earlier addition of potassium to fluids resulted in a notable reduction in hypokalemia; (2) improvements in insulin infusion management were associated with reduced duration of ICU stay; and (3) with overall improved DKA management and education, cerebral edema occurrence and bicarbonate use were reduced. We continue to convene quarterly meetings, review cases, and process ongoing issues with system-based elements of implementing the recommendations.

Conclusions

Our multidisciplinary development and implementation of an evidence-based pathway for DKA have led to overall improvements in care. We continue to monitor quality improvement metric measures to sustain clinical gains while continuing to identify iterative improvement opportunities.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^a6d4cb6a]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

Methods

Study design, setting and population

The study was undertaken at a large tertiary care center in West Midlands, UK, which serves an ethnically diverse population of over one million people. All people admitted with DKA from April 2014 to September 2020 were included in the study. DKA was defined as blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, pH ≤ 7.3 or bicarbonate ≤ 15 mmol/L and ketonemia ≥ 3 mmol/L. The list of people admitted with DKA was initially screened based on those who meet one of the following criteria: electronic records with pH < 7.3 and blood glucose > 11 mmol/L or referral with DKA to the specialist team or discharged with a diagnosis of DKA. This list was further manually verified for confirmed diagnosis of DKA and only those who met the criteria as per national guidelines were included in the study. Classification (type 1/2) of diabetes was based on a clinical diagnosis as per National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, although may have been confirmed through islet autoantibody or C peptide testing. Patients who had DKA were identified using an automatic monitoring system, and data regarding various aspects of DKA were collected manually. We reviewed patients' health records to confirm the type of diabetes diagnosis. Patients were excluded from analysis if the diabetes classification was unclear or if this information was unavailable.

DKA management guidelines

The guidelines for management of DKA at our center are based on the Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines and are the same for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment of DKA includes administering fluids to correct the deficit and replacement glucose infusion when serum glucose drops less than 14 mmol/L but ketosis persists. A fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion was administered based on the patient's body weight at a rate of 0.1 unit/kg/hour to switch of lipolysis. Hourly glucose and ketone measurements are done to check treatment progress. Venous blood gases are done during infusion bag change to ensure the next bag of fluid has appropriate potassium replacement. While the guidelines for DKA management have evolved to ensure simplicity and end-user satisfaction over the last 7 years in our institute, the principles have not changed (figure 1).

Introduction

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as an important class of blood glucose-lowering medications, due to cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal benefits. However, there is a small but significant risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) associated with their use.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE and Embase to July 2019 using variants on the key search terms sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, diabetic ketoacidosis, and type 2 diabetes. A broad spectrum of evidence was incorporated to facilitate a comprehensive narrative review. Further sources were identified through hand searching of reference lists.

Discussion

Although cardiovascular outcome trials demonstrated mixed evidence of SGLT2i associated DKA, increasing evidence from case reports and cohort studies has identified an increased risk. SGLT2i use is associated with a ketotic state caused by an increased glucagon:insulin ratio and stimulated by factors including stress-induced hormonal changes, insufficient insulin, decreased glucose, increased ketone resorption, and hypovolemia. Atypical presentations of DKA with lower-than-expected blood glucose levels are possible with SGLT2i use, so clinical and biochemical monitoring is vital for early identification and management. DKA risk is particularly increased with precipitating factors, therefore optimization of risk factors is vital. Recommendations for perioperative and sick day management of patients taking SGLT2i have been suggested based on available evidence.

Conclusion

SGLT2i are an excellent class of drug in the physician's toolkit for managing type 2 diabetes. However, both clinicians and patients must be aware of the potential for DKA and the need for increased monitoring, both clinically and biochemically, when potential precipitating factors are present. In acutely unwell patients, these medications should be withheld to reduce the risk of DKA.

### Clinical effects of balanced crystalloids vs saline in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis: a subgroup analysis of cluster randomized clinical trials [^38f412cd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does using a balanced crystalloid solution instead of saline for fluid therapy in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) lead to faster resolution of DKA?

Findings

In this subgroup analysis of 172 adults with DKA from 2 large cluster randomized clinical trials comparing balanced crystalloids and saline, the median time to DKA resolution was 13.0 hours with balanced crystalloids and 16.9 hours with saline, a significant difference.

Meaning

These findings suggest that balanced crystalloid therapy leads to faster resolution of DKA than saline and may be the preferred isotonic fluid solution for acute management of DKA.

### Fluid treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis in children… [^d30fcc05]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

About 20 percent of childhood deaths from diabetes mellitus are related to diabetic ketoacidosis. The appropriate management of DKA includes lowering the serum glucose level and reversing abnormalities in body fluids and electrolytes. However, one complication of DKA treatment is cerebral edema, which can occur if fluid is administered too fast. Some studies report that a rate of more than 4 L per m. 2 per 24 hours is more likely to cause cerebral edema. Recent recommendations have called for lower amounts of replacement fluid. Felner and White discuss a simplified protocol for the management of DKA in children with type 1 diabetes and review complication rates. Children from before and after the protocol change were included in the study if they had a discharge diagnosis of DKA. Children in the first group were given a bolus of 20 mL per kg of normal saline administered over 30 to 45 minutes.

They then were given intravenous human insulin administered at a rate of 0. 1 U per kg per hour. Group 2 received fluid with 0. 675 percent sodium chloride after the initial fluid bolus. Both groups received subcutaneous insulin and food by mouth after their venous pH reached at least 7.
3. Potassium was also administered, depending on serum levels of potassium, phosphate, and calcium. In both groups, dextrose was added to the intravenous fluids when the blood glucose concentration was less than 300 mg per dL or if the glucose level decreased by 350 mg per dL in less than six hours. The fluid administration rate was decreased if patients developed signs or symptoms of cerebral edema such as headache, change in level of consciousness, or bradycardia.

The "before protocol change" group included 363 children and the "after protocol change" group included 502. On average, the new protocol was associated with a per-patient fluid administration rate of
4. 1 L per m. The authors conclude that reducing the rate of fluid given to children with DKA while simultaneously increasing the amount of sodium administered can decrease the number of fluid changes needed, reduce the cost associated with treatment and, perhaps most importantly, reduce the time to resolution of acidosis.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus with nivolumab [^21c84672]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, with the increasing use of ICIs in cancer management, it is anticipated that the incidence and prevalence of ICI-DM will continue to rise. Further research is required to identify the most appropriate screening tests for early identification of ICI-DM, with an aim to prevent acute complications such as DKA, and to guide optimal long-term management of this condition. Current guidelines recommend discussion with patients around the potential for ICI-DM prior to initiation of therapy, and regular blood glucose monitoring while patients are receiving ICIs.

Learning points

Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) has increasingly been reported with prevalence up to 2%, and the majority of patients present in diabetic ketoacidosis and require lifelong insulin therapy.
Clinicians should be aware of this immune-related endocrinopathy to prompt early identification with appropriate testing (eg, blood glucose level, haemoglobin A1c, C-peptide), to reduce the risk of patients presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis and facilitate appropriate initiation of insulin treatment and subsequent monitoring.
ICI-DM may present atypically without overt signs or symptoms of hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^e17a9af3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted by following a prespecified protocol and is reported based on the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42022339577). Material deviations to the prespecified protocol are described below.

We systematically searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception until April 26th, 2024 to identify studies that compared the use of subcutaneous insulin to continuous IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. Keywords and search strategies used are available in Appendix 1.

We included RCTs and observational studies that compared subcutaneous insulin and a continuous IV insulin infusion in managing adult patients with mild-to-moderate DKA. Subcutaneous insulin included either short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included adults age ≥ 18 years old, who were identified as having diabetes with DKA, defined as having arterial pH ≤ 7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and anion gap is > 12 mmol/L with positive serum and/or urine ketones. Our definition of DKA was based on the criteria outlined in the ADA guidelines. Mild DKA is defined as pH 7.25 to 7.30 and serum bicarbonate 15 to 18 mmol/L, whereas moderate was defined as pH 7.00 to < 7.24 and serum bicarbonate 10 to < 15 mmol/L Studies were required to report at least one of the following outcomes: length of stay, time to resolution of DKA, mortality, need for intensive care stay, hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Studies that compared subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin in severe DKA, or in patients with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, comatose state, and other medical conditions that warranted ICU admission were excluded.

### Preventing diabetic ketoacidosis [^065478df]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article examines the factors associated with DKA in children with T1DM, both at first presentation and in recurrent cases. The challenge for future research is to find effective ways to improve primary care physician and general community awareness of T1DM to reduce DKA at presentation and develop practical, cost-effective programs to reduce recurrent DKA.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f2f336e8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

### Management of diabetic keto-acidosis in adult patients admitted to intensive care unit: an ESICM-endorsed international survey [^74394982]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) is the most common metabolic emergency in patients with diabetes, accounting for almost 10% of hospital admission in patients with diabetes. There is currently an increase in hospital admissions for DKA and although the mortality rate for DKA remains low, ranging from 0.20% in patients with type 1 diabetes to 1.04% in those with type 2 diabetes, it has stopped decreasing over the last decade.

DKA results from relative or absolute insulin deficiency and failure to regulate the effect of the hyperglycemic hormones glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone and catecholamines. The result is the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids, which generates ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia leading to osmotic diuresis, which causes dehydration and water loss, and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and pseudohyponatremia), and metabolic acidosis linked to the production of ketone bodies. The management of DKA requires fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and correction of metabolic disorders. The provision of continuous insulin therapy and the frequent monitoring and repletion of electrolytes requires critical care expertise and thus patients with DKA are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Guidelines for managing patients with DKA are limited. While the American and British guidelines provide recommendations on fluid resuscitation and suggest isotonic saline as the first option, the supporting evidence is limited, leading to ongoing debate regarding both fluid resuscitation, specifically regarding the use balanced solution to avoid the occurrence of hyperchloremic acidosis. Other heterogeneities in practice are related to insulin therapy, administration of sodium bicarbonate and the management of metabolic disorders.

This international survey aimed to assess current clinical management of adult patients with DKA, focusing on ICU admission criteria, fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and management of metabolic disorders.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^7aef5c50]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

How to initiate diabetes therapy and advance interventions

Except in rare circumstances, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or patients who are extremely catabolic or hyperosmolar or who are unable to hydrate themselves adequately (seebelow), hospitalization is not required for initiation or adjustment of therapy. The patient is the key player in the diabetes care team and should be trained and empowered to adjust medications with the guidance of health care professionals to achieve glycemic goals and to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. Many patients may be managed effectively with monotherapy; however, the progressive nature of the disease will require the use of combination therapy in many, if not most, patients over time, to achieve and maintain glycemia in the target range.

The measures of glycemia that are initially targeted on a day-to-day basis are fasting and preprandial glucose levels. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important element in adjusting or adding new interventions and, in particular, in titrating insulin doses. The need for and number of required SMBG measurements are not clear and are dependent on the medications used. Oral glucose-lowering regimens that do not include sulfonylureas or glinides, and are therefore not likely to cause hypoglycemia, usually do not require SMBG. However, SMBG may be used to determine whether therapeutic blood glucose targets are being achieved and for adjustment of treatment regimens without requiring the patient to have laboratory-based blood glucose testing. Insulin therapy requires more frequent monitoring.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^182e1714]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Fewer DKA episodes in our study received a reduction in FRIII as per JBDS‐IP guidelines, even over 18 months following the update in respective hospitals. In DKA episodes where FRIII rate reduction was implemented, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII when glucose levels were < 14 mmol/L. We did not find any favourable effect on the rate of complications nor outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced‐rate FRIII, possibly owing to a suboptimal implementation of the guidelines. Further work is required to understand the clinical and human factors involved in clinical guideline adherence and the lack of clinical gain from this guideline change.

Diabetes — SGLT inhibitors and ketone monitoring: Individuals with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who are ketotic prone and/or follow a ketogenic eating pattern and who are treated with SGLT inhibitors should be aware of the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and methods of risk management and provided with options/tools for accurate ketone measurement (i.e., serum β-hydroxybutyrate).

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f4a24a0a]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

SGLT inhibition and risk of ketosis — individuals with type 1 diabetes and insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT inhibitor therapy; SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes, the risk can be 5–17 times higher than in untreated type 1 diabetes, and SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, DKA is uncommon with an estimated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per 1,000 person-years; up to a third of SGLT2-associated DKA cases present with glucose < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and in one small study 71% presented with glucose ≤ 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); risk factors include low-carbohydrate diets, decreased caloric intake, alcohol intake, and other common precipitating factors, and it is important to educate individuals about the signs and symptoms of DKA and DKA mitigation and management and to provide accurate tools for ketone measurement.

### Initial fluid resuscitation for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: how dry are they? [^492dd4f2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

A prospective consecutive case series of patients aged 5 to 20 years who presented to a pediatric emergency department with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was studied to determine the actual percent loss of body weight during an episode of DKA to determine the degree of dehydration and thereby provide a guide for hydration therapy during such an episode. Patients' weights at the time of presentation, inpatient discharge, and at the first follow-up clinic visit were used to calculate the percent loss of body weight. Data from 33 episodes of DKA showed that the majority of patients with DKA had moderate (4% to 8%) dehydration. Clinical assessment was a poor predictor of severity of dehydration and overestimated the percent dehydration in 67% of patients. Based on these data it is recommend that initial fluid therapy for DKA should assume moderate dehydration with adjustment made according to clinical response.
